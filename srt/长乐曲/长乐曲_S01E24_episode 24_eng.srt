00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,990
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,028
♫  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  ♫

4
00:00:35,028 --> 00:00:38,226
♫  The past hides blood and tears  ♫

5
00:00:38,226 --> 00:00:40,595
♫  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  ♫

6
00:00:40,595 --> 00:00:44,470
♫  The truth cannot be fully revealed  ♫

7
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,605
♫  Fate is full of twists and turns  ♫

8
00:00:47,605 --> 00:00:50,770
♫  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  ♫

9
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:55,906
♫  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  ♫

10
00:00:55,906 --> 00:01:02,178
♫  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  ♫

11
00:01:02,178 --> 00:01:08,586
♫  At least you share my joy and sorrow  ♫

12
00:01:08,586 --> 00:01:14,865
♫  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  ♫

13
00:01:14,865 --> 00:01:21,178
♫  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  ♫

14
00:01:21,178 --> 00:01:28,922
♫  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  ♫

15
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:37,256
   

16
00:01:37,256 --> 00:01:40,800
   

17
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,100
The embroidery on your clothes is really exquisite.

18
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,300
I wonder which young lady embroidered

19
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,600
this peach blossom pattern at the neckline for you.

20
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,360
Please don't make fun of me, Madam.

21
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,730
I just ordered this ready-made garment

22
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,820
with this pattern because I like peach blossom.

23
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,160
I see. No wonder it looks so familiar.

24
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,800
It turns out that I've seen this pattern in a clothes shop.

25
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,160
This is indeed a trendy style this year.

26
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,860
If I remember correctly, this set of clothes comes with an overcoat.

27
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,600
Why aren't you wearing it?

28
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,460
I must have forgotten it somewhere

29
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,400
because I was too busy tonight.

30
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,660
You were indeed busy tonight.

31
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,880
It's normal to make mistakes in a rush.

32
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,920
Then, what is this powder?

33
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,070
If my sense of smell isn’t mistaken,

34
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,980
this must be the legendary mandala scent.

35
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,780
I-I have never heard of any mandala scent.

36
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,440
I don't know why it would be on me. My Lord, please look into it.

37
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,800
The abduction of Miss Du has nothing to do with me.

38
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,000
Nothing to do with you?

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,972
Imperial Guard Jing.

40
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,460
Xu Jize, we found this overcoat on the road. It's yours, isn't it?

41
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,680
Are you going to say that this overcoat isn't yours?

42
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,500
You threw away your overcoat in a panic during the escape,

43
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,520
but you didn't realize that the silver thread on the collar had caught your undershirt.

44
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,380
You also forgot about the mandala fragrant powder

45
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,980
inside the inner pocket of your overcoat.

46
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,820
And this hypnotic scent also lingered on your undershirt.

47
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,760
Xu Jize, you're a repeat offender of drugging brides.

48
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,940
You are the mastermind of the abduction and you killed your accomplice.

49
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,520
No. It's not like that.

50
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,400
I didn't kill anyone. I swear I didn't kill anyone.

51
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,620
My Lord, I did drug the bride. I lusted after her beauty.

52
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,220
But… But My Lord, I didn't kill anyone.

53
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,360
What a shameless scoundrel. You're full of lies.

54
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,090
Chief Clerk Yan, say no more.

55
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,220
Put clamps on him.

56
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,800
Understood.

57
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,080
Governor Mo, allow me—

58
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,920
No! No!

59
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,840
My Lord, I confess. I'll confess everything!

60
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,440
Confess everything you've done tonight without holding back.

61
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,660
I used to be pedantic,

62
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,100
believing that "within books, one will find beauties like jade." 
  (It implies that through studying and reading books, one may find rewards, such as wealth or beautiful companions.) 

63
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,560
But once I became a wedding conductor, I suddenly realized

64
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,580
that I could enjoy real beauty outside of the books.

65
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,280
With just some hypnotic powder,

66
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:38,400
the brides from those noble families could all become my beauties.

67
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,280
Because it is something too shameful to talk about,

68
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,090
so I succeed most of the time,

69
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:48,220
and no one ever speaks of it.

70
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,860
So why did you target Miss Du this time?

71
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,560
I don't have many hobbies.

72
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,100
I just like beautiful women.

73
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,620
I have long heard of Miss Du's beauty.

74
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,540
How could I miss the chance

75
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:07,440
to spend some time with the beauty of Yingzhou?

76
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,480
What was the name of the deceased, who was also your accomplice?

77
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,680
How did you know him?

78
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:21,300
He was just a hooligan. I only know him as Er Laipi.

79
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,220
He was an orphan and had been in jail for burglary.

80
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,680
Before the man in black arrived, you were already arguing.

81
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,740
About what?

82
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,240
I decided to stop the criminal act and send Miss Du back.

83
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,160
 No, I was mistaken. Let her go. 

84
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,550
 Are you kidding me? 

85
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,800
 What's done is done. You have to do it now. 

86
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,300
 I said I was mistaken. Let her go. 

87
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,670
 You— 

88
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,180
But we suddenly heard something.

89
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,160
 I'll take a look. 

90
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,780
I suspected that we were being followed and stopped arguing.

91
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,900
Er Laipi stayed to hide Miss Du in the cellar well.

92
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,160
I went to look around.

93
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,380
There was nothing. Maybe it was a stray cat.

94
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,120
 Er Laipi, I didn't see anything apart from a stray cat in the bushes. 

95
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,640
 Perhaps a cat made the noise. 

96
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,900
I was scared witless. I was scared the killer would come back to kill me.

97
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,020
I was scared witless. I was scared the killer would come back to kill me.

98
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,360
So I ran away.

99
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:32,520
Xu Jize, are there any other witnesses who can testify to what you've said?

100
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,500
In that case, how can you prove

101
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,580
that you didn't kill him because you had a fallout?

102
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,140
If I had fought with Er Laipi, he would certainly have won.

103
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:51,120
How can I possibly manage to kill him?

104
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,220
My Lord, please look into it.

105
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,360
I will certainly investigate the case of Er Laipi before giving the verdict.

106
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,980
But there is solid evidence in Miss Du's case.

107
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,420
Guards, take the prisoner Xu Jize into custody.

108
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,680
- Understood. 
 - Understood.

109
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,228
Let's go.

110
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,580
What? Won't you rest after such a long night?

111
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,930
Is the fearless Chief Clerk Yan

112
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,980
so scared to share a bed with her husband?

113
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,900
I do want to rest.

114
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,460
But I can't stop thinking about the case when I lie down.

115
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,440
The case was solved smoothly. But I just feel that there are hidden stories.

116
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,000
Smoothly? We chased the killer until midnight.

117
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,280
It took a long time and a little torture for him to confess.

118
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,440
I'm not just referring to the bride's case.

119
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,580
Even if this case is closed, the abductor Er Laipi is dead.

120
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,580
There's a new murder case.

121
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:23,320
Er Laipi was a burglar. I bet he had quite a few personal vendettas in Yingzhou City.

122
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,380
What kind of personal vendetta would require such deliberate mystery,

123
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,600
by gouging out his eyes after killing him?

124
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,840
Did the murderer happen to be there or was it well planned?

125
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,300
You can't figure it out just yet. Rest first.

126
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,140
I told you I couldn't sleep.

127
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:43,300
Among Er Laipi's acquaintances, the major suspect must be…

128
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,900
Since you're so energetic,

129
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,840
let's do something else.

130
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,700
What… What do you want?

131
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,380
Something a couple should do, naturally.

132
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,600
A-Are…

133
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,420
Are you crazy?

134
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:24,500
People call me the White Ghost who always keeps his promises.

135
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,120
How come my wife calls me crazy?

136
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,100
What did you give me?

137
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,920
A sleeping pill. It will help you fall asleep.

138
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,560
Sweet dreams to you, My Wife.

139
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,620
Great Chief.

140
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,340
Great Chief. A letter from Xiang'an.

141
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,540
What message is so urgent?

142
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,080
My wife was about to rest. I didn't let you in.

143
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,400
Please forgive me.

144
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,100
But you said that letters from this person are top priority.

145
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,000
Urgent letter from Xiang'an? Who sent it?

146
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,032
Madam Xu.

147
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,780
There's nothing special about it.

148
00:11:42,364 --> 00:11:45,020
Want to read it first? 
     

149
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,360
No, no. I don't want to read your love letters.

150
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,580
I'm tired. I'm going to sleep.

151
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,280
There is no romantic relationship between Madam Xu and me.

152
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,120
Besides, I'm in love with someone else.

153
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,256
Yan Xing.

154
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,080
The pill kicked in just at the right time.

155
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,860
 We are Half-faced Demons. 

156
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,840
 When will you find my head? 

157
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,640
 Give me your head. 

158
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,464
 Who's there? 

159
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,480
 Who is it? Come out. 

160
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,260
 Eyes. 

161
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,320
 My eyes. 

162
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,888
No!

163
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,940
This is... the red-feathered gray messenger pigeon?

164
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,120
 The red-feathered gray messenger pigeon arrived. 

165
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,770
 It means that there are informants 

166
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:02,240
 of Empress Dowager in Yingzhou who can't show up. 

167
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,800
 So they use this gray pigeon to remind me that it's time to report back to the Imperial City. 

168
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,480
Sister!

169
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,760
Did you bring this pigeon?

170
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,060
So you're—

171
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:23,160
No, I saw this red-feathered gray pigeon flying into your courtyard and wouldn't leave.

172
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,680
Sister, do you know the legend?

173
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,720
It brings you luck if a red-feathered gray pigeon settles in your home.

174
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,960
We must keep it.

175
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,360
So I rushed to the main street and bought a birdcage for you.

176
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,092
I see.

177
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,520
So you came to bring me the birdcage.

178
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,920
One more thing. We ran out of deer antlers.

179
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,000
But Gannandao lacks herbal medicine.

180
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,260
I went to the Guangchun Clinic, which is the biggest.

181
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,780
They said they never receive rare goods like deer antlers.

182
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,120
They only have Cistanche.

183
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,520
We might have to get it from somewhere else.

184
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,360
They have Cistanche?

185
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,100
It may be less effective, but it works as a substitute.

186
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,220
The shopkeeper said he would sell me the last bit, but I didn't buy it.

187
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,260
- Take me there now. Let's get some. 
 - Okay.

188
00:15:11,728 --> 00:15:13,560
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

189
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,648
    
 Be careful.

190
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,040
Big clinics surely have good business.

191
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,280
They even have to use huge pots to boil medicine.

192
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,040
These are not for boiling medicine.

193
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,600
I think they're used for storing herbs.

194
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,600
Right, Yeyun.

195
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,520
I asked you to keep an eye on the governor's mansion. Was there anyone suspicious?

196
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,920
I take the task you entrust to me seriously.

197
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,360
I didn't find anyone suspicious.

198
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,320
But I did hear about a suspicious place.

199
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,340
I heard there's a secluded courtyard that nobody is allowed to enter.

200
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,360
But Governor Mo visits it very often.

201
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,440
 There are such blooming peonies in the freezing weather of Yingzhou. 

202
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,600
 Pink peonies. 

203
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,960
Great Chief, this way.

204
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,384
All right.

205
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,900
 What is he doing here? 

206
00:16:45,918 --> 00:16:48,245
   

207
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,760
Yingzhou is far north with a lot of snow in winter.

208
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,500
You set up a warm room for flowers.

209
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,280
It must have cost you a great effort.

210
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,256
Senior Brother.

211
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,256
Great Chief.

212
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,060
 Do you have to be so distant, Senior Brother? 

213
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,400
Nowadays, the position of the Great Chief is quite extraordinary.

214
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,340
I have been through the turbulences in the officialdom and only want to live in peace.

215
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:33,280
I do not wish to be linked to you and make things hard for you.

216
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,620
Please forgive me.

217
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,660
You do not wish to be associated with me in public.

218
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,180
I can understand that.

219
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,560
But it's just the two of us here.

220
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,680
Do you have to treat me like a stranger, Senior Brother?

221
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:04,840
Back in the detention center, you suffered greatly.

222
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,360
After all, you were implicated by the officialdom.

223
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,320
So from then on, I wanted you to stay out of the officialdom.

224
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,000
However, you have exceptional talent.

225
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,100
In the end, the Empress Dowager thinks highly of you.

226
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,640
Now you are the Great Chief.

227
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,980
I can only be a subordinate official.

228
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,430
I see.

229
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,460
You are blaming me, Senior Brother.

230
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,100
Exceptional talent?

231
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,700
The Empress Dowager thinks highly of me?

232
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,980
All those who knew my father and the Shen family

233
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,260
knew that I sold out my father and drove my mother to death

234
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,660
in exchange for my freedom.

235
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,240
 I denounce. 

236
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,800
 I, Shen Du, the son of the criminal official Shen Bingzhu, 

237
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,260
 denounce my father. 

238
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,000
Such shameful conduct...

239
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,420
shall be despised by all,

240
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,400
especially you.

241
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,020
Senior Brother, you must have regretted...

242
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:35,320
kneeling all the way to the palace...

243
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,820
to ask for mercy for my family.

244
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,120
 Your Majesty, Minister Shen has been wronged. 

245
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,960
 Your Majesty! 

246
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,100
 What did the women and children of the Shen family do wrong? 

247
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,930
The late emperor spared me and my mother

248
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:17,320
from the death penalty because of you.

249
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,840
That's how I made it into the detention center.

250
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,660
There is no need to dwell on that.

251
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,700
Your father took me in when my family went broke.

252
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:35,440
He was a savior to our Mo family and he treated me like his own.

253
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,380
I just did what I had to do by crying out injustice.

254
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:43,660
Otherwise, I would be disloyal and ungrateful.

255
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,480
You abandoned your bright future

256
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,140
and got exiled here with no hope of promotion

257
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,540
only for a disloyal, ungrateful, and unfilial person like me

258
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:59,820
to survive and trade my father's reputation for a bright future.

259
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,584
Senior Brother,

260
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,000
if you had known about this,

261
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,960
would you have regretted it?

262
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,000
Looking back,

263
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,880
I have many things I regret.

264
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,980
But I have never...

265
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,880
regretted saving you.

266
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,160
You had no choice but to do what you did.

267
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,960
My late mentor would surely understand.

268
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,940
Your mother "drove you out" of the house

269
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,700
only as an act for those scoundrels who were watching.

270
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,380
She did that to protect her only son.

271
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:51,140
Senior Brother, you really don't blame me?

272
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,700
Do you recognize this flower?

273
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,276
Yes.

274
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,460
It's Xiuxiu's favorite "Child's Face".

275
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,120
 Where are we going? 

276
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,420
 Hurry up. 

277
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,720
 See! Brother Du is the best, after all. 

278
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,560
 He grew the "Child's Face" for me. 

279
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:38,220
 A'Du, you're going to spoil Mo Xiuxiu. 

280
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,380
 It's hard to grow one "Child's Face" out of ten peonies. 

281
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,280
 Other young ladies are happy to wear peonies on their heads. 

282
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,580
 But you have to ask for "Child's Face". 

283
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,120
 What's wrong? I just love "Child's Face". 

284
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,440
 Brother A'Du, 

285
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,220
 this one I'm wearing will wither in a few days. 

286
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:57,000
 Remember to get me the best one then. 

287
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,320
 Rest assured, I have picked one for you 

288
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,920
 and I'll cut it in a few days. 

289
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,200
After Xiuxiu left,

290
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,460
I built this small courtyard full of peonies for her.

291
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,610
Only then did I realize

292
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:15,960
how difficult it was for you to grow "Child's Face" back then.

293
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,800
A'Du, how could I blame you?

294
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,940
I was only glad.

295
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:29,260
I was glad that you assessed the situation and survived.

296
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,840
Then there is one more person like me

297
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,360
who cherishes Xiuxiu and remembers her.

298
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,700
Life is unpredictable.

299
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,000
I did not expect that

300
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,620
I would never see Xiuxiu again...

301
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,240
after we parted in the Imperial City.

302
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,880
If Xiuxiu were still alive,

303
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,880
she would be the same age as Miss Du now.

304
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,688
Senior Brother,

305
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,040
I've been scared to ask you.

306
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,680
How did Xiuxiu die?

307
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,360
I didn't take care of her.

308
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,800
She died of illness due to poor acclimatization.

309
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,180
 Xiuxiu. 

310
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,120
 I remember now. 

311
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:44,660
 The rattan piglet and the letter were gifts from Mo Xiuxiu. 

312
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,520
 That's why he kept them for so long. 

313
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,180
 Mo Xiuxiu! 

314
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,520
 What were you writing? 

315
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,680
 Master, you scared them. 

316
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,480
 It's nothing. 

317
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,880
 Keep practicing. 

318
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,240
 It seems these children 

319
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,760
 haven't gotten over the trauma of being kidnapped. 

320
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,860
A'Du, go find some rattan.

321
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,432
 All right. 

322
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,560
 Master. 

323
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,780
 My Lord. 

324
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,220
 Let's call it a day now. 

325
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,620
 Understood. 

326
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,260
 Kids! 

327
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,920
 I'm going to teach you 

328
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,020
 how to make small animals with rattan. Okay? 

329
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,124
 Okay! 

330
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,980
 Brother Shen, am I doing it right? 

331
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,680
 Brother, help me get started, will you? 

332
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,340
 You're really impressive! 

333
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,780
 I also want to make one as a birthday gift for Brother Du. 

334
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,080
 Can you swap with me? 

335
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,320
 Okay, take it. 

336
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,820
 Thank you. 

337
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,460
 What's your name? 

338
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,800
 You can just call me Sixth Miss. 

339
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,220
 It was a gift from Mo Xiuxiu. 

340
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,780
 That's why he has kept it for so long. 

341
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:03,820
 So the person he loves is Mo Xiuxiu. 

342
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,960
Why did you insist on meeting with me in private today?

343
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,800
My family was wronged.

344
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,460
You know what happened.

345
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,600
I was young back then and there are things I don't remember clearly.

346
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,520
I hope you can tell me in detail.

347
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,920
Great Chief,

348
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,040
it has been so many years.

349
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,640
You are a successful man with a bright future.

350
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,440
Do not dwell on the past.

351
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,820
What do you mean?

352
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:54,280
Ordinary people couldn't have

353
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,380
endured the torment in the detention center.

354
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,780
A'Du, you made it out alive.

355
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:03,140
So don't think about seeking revenge.

356
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,360
I'm not seeking revenge.

357
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,120
I'm merely seeking...

358
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,060
the truth for my family.

359
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,120
You have won Empress Dowager's trust.

360
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,980
You have a bright future as long as you play safe.

361
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,800
Do you truly have the courage to give up everything you have now?

362
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,420
To reopen the old case,

363
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,520
you must give up everything you have now.

364
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,900
Do you think it's worth it?

365
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,960
Throughout history,

366
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,880
those who can overturn old cases are invincible.

367
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,840
But you're married.

368
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,840
Can you truly disregard everything

369
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,960
and burn your boats just for yourself?

370
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,960
I stand by what I said.

371
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,180
Do not dwell on the past.

372
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:08,620
Great Chief, I've given you the answer you want.

373
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,800
I hope, Great Chief,

374
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,932
please think twice.

375
00:30:15,699 --> 00:30:21,299
♫  Drifting in the mist, amidst the vast misty waves, groping in the dark  ♫

376
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:26,634
♫  You passing by, igniting fireworks  ♫

377
00:30:27,443 --> 00:30:34,483
♫   To seek results, you fall into silence and become an Asura  ♫

378
00:30:34,483 --> 00:30:41,139
♫  Love is complicated, it hurts you and burns me  ♫

379
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:45,958
♫  Flowers bloom and fall along the way, heavy rain pours  ♫

380
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:49,459
♫  The lights will intersect  ♫

381
00:30:49,459 --> 00:30:55,202
♫  You are my whereabouts  ♫

382
00:30:57,381 --> 00:31:01,028
   

383
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,600
 He does have a close tie with Mo Qianzhi. 

384
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,920
 But no matter how you see it, 

385
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,260
 Mo Qianzhi is an upright and dutiful official. 

386
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,560
Oh, pigeon.

387
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,140
How should I report to Empress Dowager?

388
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,260
- Master Sister. 
 - "Master Sister"?

389
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,440
What did I teach you? Show some manners.

390
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,340
I knew it. My sister is boiling medicine so early.

391
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,880
Who deserves such a good wife in the world?

392
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,440
It's rare to find someone like Madam who fits our Great Chief.

393
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,100
A perfect match.

394
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,700
"A perfect match"?

395
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,000
Listen. Your Great Chief is indeed a mighty leader,

396
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
but he doesn't quite make a good husband. Unlike my sister.

397
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,920
She's the top female detective and a role model of feminine virtue.

398
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,580
- How come he is not a good husband? 
 - Shut up.

399
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,380
Do you want anything? Leave me alone if you want to idle around.

400
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,000
Yeah. Who says I want to idle around?

401
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,860
I want to know how well it works with Cistanche instead of the deer antler.

402
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,840
Does it work? After all, it's just a cheap substitute.

403
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,400
If it won't do, let Imperial Guard Jing get some from the neighboring county.

404
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,560
This is medicine for his Great Chief.

405
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,200
- He has to put in some effort. 
 - Stop saying "his" Great Chief.

406
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,800
You're also being supported by the Imperial Guards now, all right?

407
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,240
You're training with us. And I'm forced to accept a substandard disciple.

408
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,400
Imperial Guard Jing, I must inform you seriously.

409
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,440
I only want one master, who is Chief Clerk Yan Xing right here.

410
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,830
She's not taking me in for now,

411
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,040
so I only begrudgingly let you satisfy your craving to be a mentor.

412
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,180
Speak properly. What do you mean by "begrudgingly letting me satisfy my craving to be a mentor"?

413
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,420
- You started it. 
 - You think I want you as a disciple?

414
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,990
- Speak properly. Do you think I want to be a mentor? 
 - Get out! Get out!

415
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,530
- Get out! 
 - Sister, don't push me!

416
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:49,440
Make it clear to me!

417
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,720
 Substitute. 

418
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,300
 Meeting an old acquaintance on a foreign land, 

419
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,880
 a lonely man took a woman as a substitute. 

420
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,000
 Perhaps the romance that I've felt 

421
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,420
 was due to the fact that I was Xiuxiu's substitute. 

422
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,900
 Sixth Miss Yan, how do you have the time for this? 

423
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,700
 Sixth Miss! 

424
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,910
You mean, Governor Mo has agreed to combine

425
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:21,680
the bride kidnapping and the decapitated corpse cases.

426
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,220
Not completely. But he agreed that I could cross-check both corpses

427
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,380
after the initial checking by the coroner.

428
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,800
Combining the cases is possible.

429
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,600
Will you join me for the autopsy?

430
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,500
All right, let's go now.

431
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,940
Sister, I'll get your toolbox.

432
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,920
Here you go, Sister.

433
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,200
Let's go.

434
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,004
Be careful.

435
00:33:48,004 --> 00:33:52,030
   

436
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,500
Sister seems to have a lot to talk about with him.

437
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,040
Madam just finds you noisy.

438
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,660
- You're noisy. 
 - You're noisier.

439
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,640
You're the noisy one.

440
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,412
Kid.

441
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,600
No. I can't let them have too much to talk about.

442
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,836
Where are you going?

443
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,956
Kid.

444
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,440
Any thoughts on the characteristics of the killer?

445
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,800
Not much.

446
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,120
But the entire Yingzhou is abuzz with it.

447
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,880
Everyone speaks with certainty

448
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:38,680
that the killer is the Half-faced Demon widely known in Gannandao.

449
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,220
They say the Half-faced Demon

450
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,520
eats only one part of the human body at a time.

451
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,480
It does match the previous two cases.

452
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,600
There are many rumors about supernatural beings.

453
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,480
The common people are excused.

454
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,080
But you also believe in it as the top detective?

455
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,880
I don't believe in ghosts and deities.

456
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,000
I just have respect for the rumors.

457
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,120
No matter where these rumors originate from,

458
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,220
there must be a reason they're spread throughout the city.

459
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,360
Perhaps there is an expert behind it.

460
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,280
Or it reflects the local situation.

461
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,520
Do you still remember what the rumor says?

462
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,040
The Half-faced Demon attacks people when they're unconscious.

463
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,900
The victims wake up only to find themselves missing an arm or a leg.

464
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,600
Yeah, this is why we can't

465
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,500
get to the bottom of the cases regarding the Half-faced Demons.

466
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,480
First, there is no threat to life.

467
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,160
Second, everyone fears ghosts and deities.

468
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,680
The victims are terrified and dare not cooperate.

469
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,380
The matter ends up being dropped.

470
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,920
And these two bodies…

471
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,920
These two victims were both beheaded

472
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,600
or had their eyes gouged out alive and ended up dead.

473
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:46,720
Either the killer was not the Half-faced Demon

474
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,720
or the killer failed to imitate the demon properly.

475
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,680
Only you are brave enough to not fear

476
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,400
ghosts and deities, and dare to join me in this muddy water.

477
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,000
What’s so fearsome about a murderer?

478
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,720
Be it a human or a ghost,

479
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,200
a murderer should pay the price.

480
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:13,120
Even if it's an evil ghost, it should be up to us to judge in place of King of Hell.

481
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,520
You…

482
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,284
What's wrong?

483
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,840
There are bruises on the body.

484
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,240
These are external injuries from falling into the cellar well.

485
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,600
No internal injuries.

486
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,400
The cause of death is an instantly shattered heart.

487
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,780
The corpse has turned purple and shows signs of decay.

488
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,960
The shattered heart accelerated the decay of the body.

489
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,240
It must be a pile of sludge in his abdomen now.

490
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,560
The wounds are completely different from those on the headless body.

491
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,000
- They're more clean-cut. 
 - Did you find anything?

492
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:54,200
I can't remember what kind of sharp weapon this is.

493
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,700
But it's definitely not the curved blade from the Western Region.

494
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,400
It looks more like a customized one.

495
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,700
You mean the one that is used to gouge out eyes?

496
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,900
It's something like that.

497
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:16,160
But I'm not sure whether such a thing truly exists.

498
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,200
Brass knuckles.

499
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,000
There is such a thing?

500
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,520
This is a weapon worn on the fingers.

501
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,560
It's as sharp as swords and knives.

502
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,220
It's just that this weapon is too sinister.

503
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:32,200
Only those who practice mischievous arts would use it.

504
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,400
Someone used such a thing on a petty thug.

505
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,560
This is worth our attention.

506
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,400
In that case,

507
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,800
this is not directly related to the headless body.

508
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:49,200
But I have no idea why the murderer would kill the victim

509
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,500
and take away his eyes.

510
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,820
Take a look over here.

511
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,660
Something is not right.

512
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,880
Above the outer layer of skin,

513
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,180
there are some blue traces that are barely visible.

514
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,680
If you feel tired, go back to rest.

515
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,200
- Leave it to me. 
 - I'm fine.

516
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,600
I just didn't rest well last night and I'm a bit unfocused.

517
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,000
Last night, you…

518
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,600
What's wrong with you today?

519
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,900
 Did you get into a fight? 

520
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,660
Great Chief is really protective.

521
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,800
 She appears to be an ordinary young lady. But every time, 

522
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,420
 she puts aside all the dreadful smells and images 

523
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:24,040
 and immerse herself in the cases she's working on. 

524
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,940
 Sixth Miss Yan is truly a remarkable woman. 

525
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,280
Young Master Pan,

526
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,180
you can space out in this morgue filled with foul odors.

527
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,790
I am truly impressed.

528
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,100
Space out?

529
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:41,560
What were you thinking? Any new thoughts on the corpse?

530
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,900
Not really.

531
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,220
It's just that I've never seen a woman who is both

532
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,040
careful and brave like you.

533
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,240
Seeing what you're doing, I truly admire you.

534
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,540
Keep it to yourself if you don't want to tell me.

535
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:56,940
There's no need for something so far-fetched.

536
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,120
Right.

537
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,380
Had anyone handled the body before we came here?

538
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:06,200
As far as I know, the body hasn't been processed.

539
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,600
Only some embalming fluid has been applied to the wounds.

540
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,900
Jing Lin, please fetch some embalming fluid.

541
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,520
What?

542
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,380
- I'll go. 
 - You go then.

543
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,100
What is this?

544
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:55,700
People laugh at the moths flying to the flame, yet they don't know that mayflies

545
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,600
live at dawn and die at dusk, never entering the cycle of reincarnation,

546
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:02,440
while moths survive the fire and await reincarnation.

547
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,760
It's the Huo'e Sect again.

548
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,760
The brother is unlike a brother. The human is unlike a human.

549
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,480
Disrespect of the Huo'e. Disaster comes from the sky.

550
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,920
T-This is cursed.

551
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,880
It's not cursed.

552
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,680
Someone is playing tricks.

553
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,640
How do you know about the embalming fluid?

554
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:28,760
My master once said that people of the Western Region

555
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,640
would write with rice soup on sheepskin paper as secret letters.

556
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:35,100
Once it dries out, the writing turns invisible.

557
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:39,260
The recipient would then apply embalming fluid to the sheepskin paper.

558
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:42,600
The writing will turn blue and reappear.

559
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,240
I checked the skin around the neck and found blue traces.

560
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,400
So I tried it.

561
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:09,800
Rape, pillage, and plunder. Deserving to die.

562
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,960
Disrespect of the Huo'e. Disaster comes from the sky.

563
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,200
To preserve the body, the coroner

564
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,680
uses embalming fluid to moisten the wounds.

565
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,540
The murderer used rice soup that would react with the embalming fluid.

566
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,420
It means that

567
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:28,420
the murderer never intended to keep the writing a secret.

568
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,640
We can even say that

569
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,240
they want us to see it with our own eyes.

570
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:37,220
These people aren't scared of us

571
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:41,240
linking the Huo'e Sect to the Half-faced Demon.

572
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,460
The accusation is more like a flaunt,

573
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:47,740
showing us that the Huo'e Sect has infiltrated

574
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:50,600
Gannandao much more than we imagined.

575
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:55,580
As we investigate the case, each and every move is under their surveillance.

576
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,900
Disrespect of the Huo'e.

577
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,400
Disaster comes from the sky.

578
