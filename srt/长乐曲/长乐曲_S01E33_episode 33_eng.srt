00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,950
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,992
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:34,992 --> 00:00:38,290
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,559
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,534
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,534 --> 00:00:47,669
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,669 --> 00:00:50,734
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,734 --> 00:00:55,870
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:02,142
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,142 --> 00:01:08,550
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:14,729
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:21,142
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,142 --> 00:01:29,086
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:29,086 --> 00:01:37,220
   

16
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,255
   

17
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,820
 It's my first time hearing someone sing a nursery rhyme in the cemetery. 

18
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:53,700
 On a dark and windy night, it's quite interesting. 

19
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,260
 It's you. 

20
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,960
 You are the one who saved me? 

21
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,800
 Just think of me as the mysterious man in black, 

22
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,876
 Masked Man. 

23
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,020
 Consider me as your friend. 

24
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,680
 Registrar Lu, it's rare for you to come to the Imperial Inspectorate. 

25
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,840
 You didn't even greet me before leaving? 

26
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,300
Lai Luozhi did so many bad things.

27
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,700
That must be a disguise.

28
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,800
Perhaps he approached me with an ulterior motive.

29
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,280
Excuse me.

30
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,380
Make way.

31
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,016
Excuse me.

32
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,924
Jiang the Stickler!

33
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,452
Thank you, boss.

34
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,080
Come on, have a taste.

35
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,448
Have a taste.

36
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,200
What are you up to?

37
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,380
Why are you following me?

38
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,740
To... To protect you.

39
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,760
Protect me?

40
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,680
How long have you been following me?

41
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,500
Not...  Not very long.

42
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,820
So, recently, around Marshal Xu, it has always been Yun Que following.

43
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,860
Is it because you spent all your time following me?

44
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,800
Not really, Yun Queâ€¦

45
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,280
Idiot. That's your boss.

46
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,400
Why are you following me?

47
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,360
I'm afraid you might be in danger.

48
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,160
Then you should have just told me.

49
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,800
Why act like a thief?

50
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,520
You wouldn't agree.

51
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,700
Boss, how much is it?

52
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,800
I have already paid.

53
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,020
You are still like when you were a child.

54
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,820
Ready to use gold ingots at any moment without considering if it's worth it.

55
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,820
Nonsense, I have always been very meticulous and frugal.

56
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,660
I don't spend money recklessly.

57
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,400
How do you know that I've been like this since I was little?

58
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,220
Your face is flushed.

59
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,160
Why is your face flushed? You haven't even eaten the wontons.

60
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,776
Follow me.

61
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,360
Thisâ€¦

62
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,120
Such a big ingot of gold.

63
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,160
When did you become so wealthy?

64
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,720
 A manâ€™s whole life shouldnâ€™t be spent serving others. 

65
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,240
 He must go and do more meaningful things and protect more people. 

66
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,680
Little Miss!

67
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,120
 Little Miss, from now on, I am yours. 

68
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,004
From this moment on,

69
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,480
I am yours.

70
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,820
It was you.

71
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,180
That lad who was so poor that he sold himself.

72
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:41,120
Chuichui, I listened to you...

73
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,680
and strove to help so, so many people.

74
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,760
When you gave me this gold ingot,

75
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,476
I, Jiang Langxing,

76
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,340
was your person.

77
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,960
   

78
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,192
Princess Sister.

79
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:41,967
   

80
00:10:50,571 --> 00:10:53,592
   

81
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,760
Great Chief Shen.

82
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,160
I've heard that you never liked to attend such banquets.

83
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,640
I didn't expect that today, you would come with Madam Shen.

84
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,780
It's truly a delightful surprise to me.

85
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,720
Great Chief Shen has arrived.

86
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,310
Why is there still no sign of Vice Minister Lai,

87
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,240
who is as famous as the White Ghost?

88
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,520
 I'm late. 

89
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,240
It's about to snow.

90
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,760
I wonder if my sister would be fortunate enough...

91
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,160
to join the Princess of Valor and the ladies to appreciate the snow together.

92
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,400
Sister.

93
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,200
I didn't expect you would actually bring your elder sister along.

94
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,800
It really gives me full face.

95
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,400
I'm late. I ask for everyone's forgiveness.

96
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,200
How about everyone takes a seat?

97
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,800
I will personally pour wine to apologize.

98
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,700
All right! Please be seated.

99
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,700
Your Highness.

100
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,900
I'm sorry.

101
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,400
She seems so nimble.

102
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,000
Not at all like someone who's been injured.

103
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Could it be that you really mistook the wrong person in Gannandao?

104
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,000
It is said that Madam Shen's talents are peerless.

105
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
How about dancing to a piece of music and adding to the fun?

106
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,400
This is indeed true.

107
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,800
Madam Shen rarely attends feasts.

108
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,600
Of course, she should give face to Prince Xian.

109
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,800
She can't be arrogant because she is now favored

110
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,200
by the Grand Empress Dowager, can she?

111
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,160
Everyone, isn't that so?

112
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,640
 - Right. 
 - Right. 

113
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,400
Prime Minister Zhang,

114
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,800
I still remember when you tried to unite

115
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,000
the Shen family and Yan family before His Majesty,

116
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,300
you said that the Yan family had a daughter who was skilled in poetry and dance

117
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,400
and her reputation as a gentlewoman was unsurpassed in Xiang'an.

118
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,000
Today, we have this opportunity.

119
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,300
Indeed we should let everyone witness it for themselves.

120
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:54,000
I have also heard at the Kaiyang banquet,

121
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,400
Madam Shen performed a dance to pipa music and amazed everyone present.

122
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,200
I wonder if you can perform

123
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,500
a new dance today in my mansion.

124
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,600
The daughter taught by Academician Yan must be well-versed in the six arts.

125
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,900
You may add to the enjoyment for everyone.

126
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,800
- Today, my wifeâ€¦ 
 - Husband.

127
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,100
Since the hospitality is hard to decline,

128
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,500
I will gladly add to the fun for everyone.

129
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,800
Husband, may I borrow your sword?

130
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
 Fortunately, Shen Du practices the sword daily. 

131
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,100
 I have secretly observed it. 

132
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,000
Vice Minister Lai, isn't your sister a cloistered lady?

133
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,200
How could she possess such formidable martial skills?

134
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,500
Why do the stance and technique look somewhat familiar?

135
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,900
It seems I've seen it somewhere.

136
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,900
Vice Minister Lai, Sixth Miss's swordsmanship is not skilled.

138
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,200
She offended your sister.

139
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,600
Fortunately, your sister has profound martial arts skills.

140
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,900
She exchanged a few moves with me.

141
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,500
We did not disturb the elegance of the banquet.

142
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,700
It's all right.

143
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,200
Wonderful! Marvelous indeed!

144
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,100
Mrs. Shen and Vice Minister Lai's sister's sword dance was indeed spectacular.

145
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,000
It was truly a feast for my eyes.

146
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,970
How embarrassing.

147
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,300
Go and fix your appearance at once.

148
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,600
You were too bold just now.

149
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,400
But it was useful, wasn't it?

150
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,900
Now you can be sure about the doubts in your heart, can't you?

151
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The one you encountered in Gannandao was indeed Lai Luofu.

152
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,800
Husband, this may look easy.

153
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,900
But the sword is very heavy when dancing with it.

154
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,120
I almost smashed it to the ground several times.

155
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,100
Madam Shen is exceptional in both talent and skill

156
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,800
and shares a deep affection with Great Chief Shen.

157
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,300
Truly enviable indeed.

158
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,600
The sword dance of the Great Chief and his wife

159
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,700
really broadened everyone's horizon.

160
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,080
However, the piece played by Music Minister Jin just now...

161
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,240
seemed like one I had never heard before.

162
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,200
It was a new composition by me for the winter solstice scene.

163
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,200
"Sorrow and Joy."

164
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,400
Music Minister Jin is the musician most beloved by Mother Empress.

165
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,000
It's extremely difficult to hear his performances on regular days.

166
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,200
I did not expect that in today's banquet hosted by Prince Xian,

167
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,000
we could not only invite Music Minister Jin to perform for us

168
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,700
but also have him compose a new piece for us.

169
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,900
It is truly enviable.

170
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,800
I did not expect that during this banquet,

171
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,800
I would hear a new piece by Music Minister Jin.

172
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,500
It is indeed a pleasant surprise.

173
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,800
The sky is cold, about to snow.

174
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,000
It's such an elegant banquet.

175
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,800
Ladies and gentlemen, let us raise our glasses together

176
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,000
to thank Prince Xian for his invitation.

177
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,200
   

178
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,400
   

179
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,900
Save me.

180
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,500
It hurts so much! It hurts so much!

181
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,800
Save me, please.

182
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,600
You were injured by Shen Du in Gannandao.

183
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,200
I went to great expense to find a miraculous medicine from the Western Region...

184
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,300
only to temporarily control your wound

185
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,400
making you seem all right today

186
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,200
to attend the banquet to prove your innocence.

187
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,800
Yet you recklessly fought fiercely, exposing your skills.

188
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,300
You're still unaware of your mistake.

189
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,300
I want to kill Shen Du.

190
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,400
Now you are injured on top of injuries

191
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,600
and you have aroused suspicion among everyone.

192
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:34,100
You can't show yourself publicly anymore for the time being.

193
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,100
No! No!

194
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,300
No. Give me some time.

195
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,000
Give me a little time.

196
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,800
I'll recover soon, I'll be as good as new very quickly.

197
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,000
Recover?

198
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,200
To let others suspect that you were impersonating Chen Huo'e again?

199
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,800
Trust me.

200
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,400
I am still useful.

201
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,100
I am still of use.

202
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,600
I still need to play your sister well. Right?

203
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,000
Give me some time. Trust me. I will be fine.

204
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,600
I will be obedient.

205
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,600
Save me, please. I am still of some use.

206
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,900
Quick, save me.

207
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,260
It hurts.

208
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,280
Quick, save me, please.

209
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,040
This year's Winter Solstice didn't bring snow.

210
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,140
Are you planning to turn yourself into a snowman?

211
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,320
I plan to make dumplings for you to eat.

212
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,800
Make dumplings, see.

213
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,240
Madam,

214
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,400
the palace eunuch is here again.

215
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,200
The Grand Empress Dowager has summoned you.

216
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,420
The number of times you enter the palace now is more than mine.

217
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,440
All right, I will go and change my clothes right away.

218
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,400
I'll take care of it when I return.

219
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,000
I am off.

220
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,600
I pay my respects, Your Majesty.

221
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,760
Dispense with formalities.

222
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,440
Come closer, Minister Yan.

223
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,880
Thank you, Your Majesty.

224
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,080
Winter solstice has arrived.

225
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,760
I allowed them to take a holiday.

226
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,640
I've taken you alone to accompany me.

227
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,760
You won't blame me. Right?

228
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,480
Your Majesty must be jesting.

229
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,320
Come, please sit down.

230
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,420
I'd heard yesterday, Minister Lai

231
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:05,480
joked with you. Right?

232
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,230
Yes.

233
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,480
Both of them are my right-hand men.

234
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,880
You should persuade Minister Shen

235
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,800
to not create conflict with Lai Luozhi.

236
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,560
It's best for matters to be settled here.

237
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,800
I thank Your Majesty for your concern.

238
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,720
Although I don't know the details,

239
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,120
my husband wholeheartedly serves Your Majesty.

240
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,340
Naturally, there won't be any bias or selfishness.

241
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,800
It's about time for the snow to fall.

242
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,420
The end of the year is nearing.

243
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,200
I have aged another year.

244
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,880
Long live Your Majesty.

245
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,040
Enough of this.

246
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,360
Quick, sit down. Sit down.

247
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,280
Today, there are no outsiders in the palace.

248
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,000
No need to be so formal.

249
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,100
I am just a mortal with a fleshly body.

250
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,340
How can I live too long?

251
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,920
They respect me

252
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,460
and fear me even more...

253
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,600
because in this vast palace,

254
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,980
not a single person can stand shoulder to shoulder with me.

255
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,060
I can see that Minister Baohuan and Madam Xu

256
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,640
both hold Your Majesty in the highest respect.

257
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,200
That is due to the affection I have shown.

258
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,440
Your Majesty, there are Princess Yong'an and Prince Xian.

259
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,480
They are both Your Majesty's children.

260
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:09,040
They only care...

261
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:13,400
about the position of the future Prince Regent by Qi's side.

262
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,960
They hope that I age sooner

263
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,880
so that they can hold great power.

264
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,780
How could they remember their duty as children?

265
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,760
All right.

266
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,520
Let's not talk about them.

267
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,680
I have called you here today.

268
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:37,360
It is said that Minister Shen has been every protective of you.

269
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,920
I suddenly remembered my days with the late emperor.

270
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:49,160
The late emperor also protected me in the same way.

271
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,340
He had always been a person who didn't cause trouble for others.

272
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:59,360
But he would stand against the court's ministers for me.

273
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,560
I am truly old.

274
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,290
I'm old.

275
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,840
Lately,

276
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,380
I have loved to reminisce.

277
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,460
Yan Xing,

278
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:35,000
Minister Shen's love for you is pure and sincere.

279
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,720
It makes the marriage I arranged back then

280
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,000
somewhat inconsiderate now.

281
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,140
Your Majesty is speaking too seriously.

282
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,560
In Shen Du's heart, he holds you in high regard.

283
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:54,520
It is precisely for this reason that I must urge you even more

284
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,760
not to let dark clouds cloud your vision.

285
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,040
No matter when or where,

286
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:07,400
you must cherish the one in your heart.

287
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,920
I will carefully remember.

288
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,750
   

289
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,860
A'Si.

290
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,660
My Lord insists you return to Yan Mansion.

291
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,020
My father? Now?

292
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,320
Right, get in the carriage.

293
00:30:49,094 --> 00:30:51,567
   

294
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,240
Sixth Miss, come here.

295
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,120
Prime Minister Zhang has a few questions for you.

296
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,120
You talk first.

297
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,120
Prime Minister Zhang,

298
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,840
we just met yesterday at Prince Xian's banquet.

299
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,400
I wonder why you've come to the Yan Mansion specifically to see me.

300
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,480
I heard that these past few days, you had repeatedly entered the palace for an audience...

301
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,960
and received the deep favor of Her Majesty.

302
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,200
You place too much importance on it.

303
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,440
The Grand Empress Dowager only wanted to speak with me.

304
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,640
To chat about some household matters.

305
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,560
To be able to converse with the Grand Empress Dowager about household matters,

306
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:10,760
this is a fortune that many people cannot achieve in several lifetimes.

307
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,060
You've been by Shen Du's side and have been through life and death several times.

308
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:17,680
Now you're favored by the Grand Empress Dowager.

309
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,520
It is truly fortunate.

310
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,680
Now, you are in the spring breeze of success.

311
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:27,100
Do you still remember why you were married to Shen Du?

312
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,220
Today is the Winter Solstice. I will not tangle with you too much.

313
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,740
Just tell me what the Grand Empress Dowager said to you

314
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:51,980
and during this period of time, what happened in the Shen Mansion.

315
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,440
I don't know.

316
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,580
Are you trying to rebel?

317
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,880
You've been using my father and the Yan Mansion to manipulate me for a long time.

318
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,800
Indeed, for my third sister, I married into the Shen Mansion.

319
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,680
But I am wholeheartedly involved in reviewing cases at the Ministry of Justice

320
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,000
and sharing the worries of the Grand Empress Dowager.

321
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,880
I'm unaware of anything else.

322
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,920
I should not know anything else, either.

323
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,300
I hope you will show mercy.

324
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:29,260
Sixth Miss, you have obtained the favor of the Grand Empress Dowager and Shen Du.

325
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,840
Now that you have them to rely on,

326
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,920
you think I can do nothing to you

327
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:37,500
and the Yan Mansion now?

328
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,200
Imperial favor changes in the blink of an eye.

329
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,160
Shen Du is hard-pressed to secure his own safety.

330
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,400
Do you believe that he can protect you

331
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,040
and your Yan family?

332
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,400
I don't wish to rely on anyone.

333
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,740
I only want to rely on myself.

334
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,680
All right!

335
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,400
Your wings have grown strong, huh?

336
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,720
This time, my husband and I went together to Gannandao.

337
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,820
Along the way, we pursued the Half-faced Demon and the Huo'e Sect.

338
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,800
We gained a lot of knowledge about the borderlands.

339
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,360
Following the leads,

340
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,580
we also learned a lot of unimaginable stories.

341
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,480
Are you interested in them?

342
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,800
What do you want to say?

343
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,000
Sxith Miss Yan, don't go making baseless accusations.

344
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,719
If you don't want to listen, I will not talk about them.

345
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,200
Today, I reviewed the Ministry of Justice's archives.

346
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,400
I do have a question in mind.

347
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,000
Regarding the old case of the Shen Mansion,

348
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,280
why didn't you submit a single memorandum

349
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,920
or show any stance on such a major case?

350
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,620
For public cause, you were then the pillar of the court.

351
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,920
For personal reasons,

352
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:03,240
weren't you once classmates with Lord Shen Bingzhu?

353
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,760
What are you trying to say?

354
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,240
What exactly do you know?

355
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,480
I do not know much.

356
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,200
Nor do I know what I should know.

357
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,920
You have no evidence.

358
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,320
Yet you seek to threaten me?

359
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,360
If you have any questions, just come to the Shen Mansion and ask me.

360
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,500
Going in such a big circle to trouble my wife at the Yan Mansion.

361
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,290
Isn't it inappropriate?

362
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,960
I thought you were the clear stream of the court,

363
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,760
disdaining the vile acts of the officialdom.

364
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,440
How come you are now starting to threaten a mere woman?

365
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,020
I'll take my leave.

366
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,710
My Sixth Daughter!

367
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,320
Mother.

368
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:31,600
Third Sister, Fourth Sister, Fifth Brother, why have you all come out?

369
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,400
Come.

370
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,960
Your father is spineless.

371
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,400
He only knows how to harm his daughter.

372
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,480
You came back for the Winter Solstice. Now you are without even having a meal.

373
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,000
I know you must feel you are being wronged in your heart.

374
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,560
Yes.

375
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,600
Mother and Auntie made steamed rice cakes and dumplings

376
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,720
for you and my brother-in-law.

377
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,920
While waiting for you, it was reheated several times already.

378
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,240
Hearing you would leave directly,

379
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,240
Auntie was so anxious she was about to cry.

380
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,280
Mother, I'm sorry.

381
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,960
What are you apologizing for?

382
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,200
It's all your father's fault.

383
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,520
Haven't you loved eating this since you were little?

384
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,240
Eat it up, Sixth Sister. It's still hot.

385
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,080
Thank you, Fourth Sister! Thank you, Fifth Brother!

386
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:49,360
Sixth Sister, have you been well these days at the Shen Mansion?

387
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm fine.

388
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,200
That's good.

389
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,520
That day, I heard our father and Mojie talk to my husband Han.

390
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,020
I heard that the Grand Empress Dowager favored Lai Luozhi

391
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,600
and suppressed the Great Chief.

392
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,080
But it seems for the sake of checks and balances,

393
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,640
she calls you to accompany her in the palace every day.

394
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,080
It's not that serious.

395
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:09,100
My Daughter, I still say the same thing.

396
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,400
If you and the White Ghost can live in harmony as husband and wife,

397
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,200
that's good.

398
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,360
But if every day you're putting your neck

399
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,560
on the knife's edge, living in fear and trepidation,

400
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,560
it's better to return home.

401
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,520
After all, the Yan Mansion has a place for you.

402
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,760
Yes, Auntie Jin was quite straightforward,

403
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,480
but it's all for your own good.

404
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,800
No matter what, your happiness is the most important.

405
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,260
Do not make too many sacrifices for the Yan family.

406
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,740
Thank you to Mother, my brother, and sisters for your concern.

407
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,320
I am doing very well now.

408
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,312
Really very well.

409
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,520
Then we are relieved.

410
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,480
Right, today is the Winter Solstice, a day of rest.

411
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,380
We're rarely without matters to attend to. Why not take a stroll down the street together?

412
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,600
He won't eat people anyway.

413
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,500
Let's go then.

414
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,540
Your family members all care for you deeply.

415
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,640
The Yan family estate is peaceful.

416
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,640
Although there are occasional disputes,

417
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,360
they mainly stem from goodwill.

418
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:13,460
I don't know whether this is my father's blessing

419
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:16,340
or our siblings' fortune.

420
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,160
It's my good fortune.

421
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,720
My parents passed away early.

422
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,920
What I envy most

423
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,480
is a whole and complete family.

424
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,480
Actually, ever since my first visit to the Yan Mansion, I've been wondering...

425
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:41,520
why you are so determined to clear the grievances of the people.

426
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,840
Turns out it's because you've been happy and well since childhood.

427
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:49,160
There is pure justice in your heart, without a trace of impurity.

428
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,680
In the future, they

429
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,120
will all be your family.

430
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,450
My Wife.

431
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,968
Be careful.

432
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,640
The greatly-feared Great Chief,

433
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,440
in front of his beloved wife, is so tender-hearted.

434
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,920
Why have you come along with an inspector?

435
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,380
Sxith Miss Yan, you don't know that Lu Chuichui

436
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,040
is going to be the wife of an inspector?

437
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,160
No way.

438
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,240
You and Jiang Langxing,

439
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,520
you two are dating?

440
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,000
Just go ahead and laugh at me.

441
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,440
Why would I laugh at you?

442
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,880
I'm happy for you.

443
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,480
You've finally seen the light.

444
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,280
How did you find out that Jiang Langxing had you in his heart?

445
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,440
How did Iâ€¦?

446
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,900
Naturally, it's because you are beautiful, kind-hearted,

447
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,400
and exceptionally intelligent.

448
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,400
You're shy.

449
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,600
I was going to ask you when you plan to have your wedding banquet.

450
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,560
I want to get married on the same day as you.

451
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,880
You're also getting married?

452
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,280
Who are you marrying?

453
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,340
Yan Xing, have you been investigating too many cases and gotten your brain muddled from them?

454
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,720
Can't you see?

455
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,220
Of course, I'm marrying Marshal Xu.

456
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,240
Congratulations!

457
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,440
Thank you!

458
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,800
Shen Du, I don't like you anymore.

459
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,840
So you have to be nice to Sixth Miss in the future.

460
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,680
If you scare away Sixth Miss, I'm afraid no other woman will like you.

461
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,680
Then you won't be able to get a wife.

462
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,000
So what?

463
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,760
In this life, I am content with having Yan Xing alone.

464
