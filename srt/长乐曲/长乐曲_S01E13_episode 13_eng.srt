00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,910
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,957
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:34,957 --> 00:00:38,255
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,255 --> 00:00:40,624
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:44,499
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,499 --> 00:00:47,634
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,634 --> 00:00:50,799
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:55,835
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,835 --> 00:01:02,107
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,107 --> 00:01:08,415
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,415 --> 00:01:14,694
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,694 --> 00:01:21,107
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,107 --> 00:01:28,951
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:37,285
   

16
00:01:37,285 --> 00:01:40,490
   

17
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,760
At Chen Shoujie's mansion, only a piece of fabric from Jinxiu Workshop was found.

18
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,500
As to which year's pattern specifically, I need to confirm it.

19
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,840
Not your concern? Very good.

20
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,520
Jing Lin.

21
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,960
Yes, Great Chief!

22
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,100
I'll take this madwoman and incarcerate her in the eighteenth-level prison of the Imperial Guards.

23
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,680
Who said to bring her back to the Imperial Guards?

24
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:09,880
Take Yun Que back to Shen Mansion for care.

25
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,380
Miss Yun Que, please.

26
00:02:33,576 --> 00:02:35,940
   

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,120
Miss, a maid from Shen Mansion seeks an audience.

28
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,540
Xiaohe?

29
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,520
Madam, please hurry back to the mansion to see.

30
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,540
As soon as the Great Chief left this morning, Yun Que changed her attitude.

31
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,800
If you don't intervene, things will be out of control.

32
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,580
You, move this porcelain vase over there.

33
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,920
Wipe the lantern in front.

34
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,360
Madam, look at her.

35
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,120
She's been troubling the entire mansion for quite some time.

36
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,120
She can even mistake the Great Chief.

37
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,280
The Great Chief took pity on her and kindly took her in.

38
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,680
But look at her, she really considers herself the lady of the mansion.

39
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,560
Better yet to complement the Great Chief's mansion.

40
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,440
You should go out and look around more.

41
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,040
So when you go out to make cushions, you'll have an idea.

42
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,640
Has the grass in the backyard been cleared?

43
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,120
Have you wiped the bookshelf, which was assigned by the Great Chief?

44
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,840
Hurry up and go.

45
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,400
I ordered them to arrange the front hall. Is it not considered formal business then?

46
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,260
Miss Yun Que, how can you say that?

47
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,480
That's too harsh.

48
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,400
You instruct the servants to do things. Naturally, they should be done well.

49
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:45,180
However, we take the silver from Shen Mansion and work for the Great Chief.

50
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,580
Firstly, for the matters entrusted by the Great Chief, we must arrange them first.

51
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,900
Am I right?

52
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,760
Let's talk about the arrangements tomorrow.

53
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,220
Butler Shen, sort out the account books of the mansion and bring them to me.

54
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,300
- I'll have a look. 
 - Sorry, Miss.

55
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:08,040
Only the lady of the mansion can check the account books of the Shen Mansion.

56
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,420
Madam, good morning!

57
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,660
Butler Shen, why do youâ€¦?

58
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,959
Madam, I forgot to greet you this morning.

59
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,700
I was wrong. Please punish me, Madam.

60
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,480
Punish you?

61
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,460
According to the rules of the Shen Mansion, servants of the mansion

62
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,440
must pay respects to Madam morning and evening.

63
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,860
Female family members must offer salutations and serve tea to Madam.

64
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,900
Since my first day entering the mansion, I've kept it firmly in mind.

65
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,480
The Shen Mansion does not keep those who lack manners.

66
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,120
Today, I was rude.

67
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,880
Madam, even if you cast me out,

68
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,300
it would be completely justified.

69
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,020
All right, that's enough.

70
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,400
Isn't it just that you want me to offer a respectful cup of tea to Madam Shen?

71
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,320
I'll offer it then.

72
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,380
Madam, please drink your tea.

73
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,680
Madam, now that you've had your tea

74
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,720
and almost all formalities have been established,

75
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,840
let's discuss what is reasonable.

76
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,400
It was the Great Chief who put me in charge of household affairs.

77
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,640
I naturally have to do my utmost.

78
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,840
Could it be that you want to go against the Great Chief's wishes?

79
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,120
Miss Yun Que, you just mentioned you wanted to see the account books. Right?

80
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,360
Right.

81
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,000
Since you want to see them, why not also take charge of the next season's accounts?

82
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,960
Wellâ€¦ Madam.

83
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,160
are you saying to entrust all accounts to my management?

84
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,920
I was not very adept at this.

85
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,500
If you are willing to share the concerns, nothing could be better.

86
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,520
- Madam. 
 - Butler Shen,

87
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,260
please bring over the account books and hand them to Miss Yun Que.

88
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,080
I have official duties these days.

89
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,300
All matters, big and small, in the inner courtyard, are to be decided by Miss Yun Que.

90
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,780
Miss Yun Que, thank you for your hard work.

91
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,540
Madam, please think it over.

92
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,200
He was momentarily dazzled.

93
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,460
He must have been bewitched by that outsider vixen.

94
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,660
Using trickery and deception,

95
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,940
she sweet-talked him into bringing her home.

96
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:35,160
Rest assured, in his heart, the first wife is only you.

97
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,760
Furthermore, all of us are on your side.

98
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,520
Butler Shen, it truly has nothing to do with Yun Que.

99
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,180
Madam, please don't treat me as a fool.

100
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,320
Had it not been for being angered by that vixen,

101
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,420
why would you need to move back to your parents' home to live?

102
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,140
Who said I'm moving back to my parents' home?

103
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,200
I have many investigations to attend to these days.

104
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,760
I'm afraid I will be at the Ministry of Justice until quite late.

105
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,280
So I will not be returning home for now.

106
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,780
Don't worry about me, I'm leaving.

107
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,700
What should we do now?

108
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,760
Speak up if you have something to say.

109
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,340
Great Chief, during the days you weren't at the mansion,

110
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,260
Miss Yun Que changed the porcelain plates and the embroidered cloth and so on.

111
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,420
Uncle Zhong argues with her every day.

112
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,160
Today, he even gave me an outright order.

113
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,340
If I don't bring you and Madam Shen back,

114
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,320
I'm not allowed to return to the mansion.

115
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,880
Since when did Butler Zhong...

116
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,560
get along so well with Sixth Miss Yan?

117
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,000
Great Chief, could you please give me a clear indication?

118
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,360
At first, I thought you were fond of Miss Yun Que.

119
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,900
But ever since you brought her back to the mansion, you have never returned.

120
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,500
So who should I support?

121
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,520
It seems your duties are quite leisurely.

122
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,680
You have even started to worry about my household affairs.

123
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,592
I'm at fault.

124
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,384
Get up.

125
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,820
How are the security arrangements for the coming days?

126
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,420
Great Chief, all has been arranged.

127
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,880
The security of the Lintai Secretariat is now completely taken over by our Imperial Guards.

128
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,280
The original guards have been transferred to assist the inspectors at the Hongwen School.

129
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:51,120
   

130
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,620
- Jiang Langxing is over there. 
 - That's just perfect.

131
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,720
Let us finish quickly and head home.

132
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,920
Jiang Langxing.

133
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,120
 Candidates shall not talk to each other. 

134
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,240
Marshal Xu asked us to pass a message to you; listen carefully.

135
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,760
The latest instructions from above stress the utmost importance.

136
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,700
This recruitment exam must be guarded rigorously so that not even a fly can get out.

137
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,540
Not even a single page can be brought in, do you understand?

138
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,500
You-You spoke too fast. I didn't hear it clearly.

139
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,620
Chuichui, could you speak a bit slower?

140
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,170
Didn't Marshal Xu instruct us to take a closer look

141
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,060
to see if there are any oversights in security?

142
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,740
We need to take a closer look?

143
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,680
Why not follow me inside to check the several doors?

144
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,260
We've also set up checkpoints in the inner courtyard.

145
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,680
Chuichui,

146
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,120
why don't you two go in first?

147
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,020
I'll wait here for my fifth brother until he comes.

148
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,230
Oh right! Your fifth brother also passed the preliminary exam.

149
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:51,740
- All right. I'm going inside then. 
 - Go on.

150
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,140
Jiang the Stickler, hurry up!

151
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,600
 Being the matchmaker is not an easy job. 

152
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,380
Excuse me. Could you help me find someone?

153
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,116
Pan Chi.

154
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,560
The person you're looking for is indeed on the final examination list.

155
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,860
But up till now, he has not yet registered for the exam.

156
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,700
   

157
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,140
Pan, have you really given up?

158
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,180
Who said I have given up?

159
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,740
Pan, it's really you! You've come to take the exam.

160
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,690
That day, after I sobered up from the drink, I thought about what you said to me.

161
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,320
It's rare for the Hongwen School to recruit everyone.

162
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,200
With all the talent I possess,

163
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,480
I must amaze those decrepit old masters.

164
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,180
Let them see what a peerless good article is.

165
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,420
Congratulations! I wish you success in one fell swoop.

166
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,880
To be listed on the honor roll.

167
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,940
Since you are also called Pan Chi,

168
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,640
sharing the name with the top detective among the people, you must be equally excellent.

169
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,800
Today, you look even more radiant.

170
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,780
Of course. I just spruced up casually.

171
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,380
Sure to be handsome and dashing. Unparalleled in Xiang'an.

172
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,720
Jokes aside. Your complexion doesn't look too good.

173
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,720
Have you been drinking again these past few days?

174
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,420
These few days, I've been busy investigating cases and reading case files.

175
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,200
But I'm completely clueless.

176
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,560
The case you mentioned

177
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,300
wouldn't be that one, would it? The case of the fluttering moth.

178
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,280
- You know it? 
 - Of course, I know.

179
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,060
The whole town knows it. It's told in an almost mystical way.

180
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,460
But in my opinion, you shouldn't just look at the files.

181
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,980
You need to ask around more.

182
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,520
I've asked the people around.

183
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,380
One of the parties is dead. Another is insane.

184
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,960
So what?

185
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,620
In our line of work, we fear not the corpse.

186
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,240
On the dead body, there could be many good things.

187
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,260
Besides, what the madman says isn't necessarily all nonsense.

188
00:12:30,564 --> 00:12:33,565
   

189
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,820
 This penmanship is the writing from before my father got injured. 

190
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:28,200
 When Sir Shen was young, his brush strokes were sharp like swords, vigorous and grand. 

191
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:33,660
 Later on, his strokes became reserved, smooth, and round. 

192
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,440
 I have practiced for a long time 

193
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,940
 to make the handwriting exactly alike. 

194
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,120
 Indeed, it is forged. 

195
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,460
 If it really was a fabrication done by Academician Yan who understands my father's calligraphy, 

196
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,920
 he would certainly not use the wrong brush strokes. 

197
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,320
 The forger is someone else. 

198
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,080
Pan, thank you.

199
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,740
After your reminder, it seems I've thought of another method.

200
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,380
Me?

201
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,800
I didn't remind you.

202
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,320
Wife, you've made it difficult for me to find you.

203
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,280
You're not at the Ministry of Justice discussing matters.

204
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,680
Why have you come here to chat?

205
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,060
Great Chief, I came here on official business.

206
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,500
You take good care of your Imperial Guards and attend to your duties.

207
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,000
What I do and where I go every day, it's not your place to interfere.

208
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,420
Affairs at the Ministry of Justice are beyond my control.

209
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,880
But what if it's a matter concerning you?

210
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,600
The backyard is a mess.

211
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,220
As Madam Shen, you should go back and take charge.

212
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,104
Return to the mansion.

213
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,760
Do you delude yourself into being on an equal footing with Madam Shen

214
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,520
and share a husband with her?

215
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:04,640
Let me tell you! As long as I live, you can't join the Shen family.

216
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,040
This is not up to you.

217
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,500
I'll say it once more. Hand me the account books.

218
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,240
Great Chief. Madam.

219
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,680
My Lord, you've brought back Madam Shen.

220
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,360
The old saying goes well.

221
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,160
A couple quarrels at the head of the bed but makes up at the end of it.

222
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,700
Only then can they grow old together.

223
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,080
Butler Shen, I'm a bit hungry.

224
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,800
Could you go check out today's dishes in the kitchen?

225
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,440
All right, I'll go right away.

226
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,160
Miss Yun Que, don't argue with the old housekeeper.

227
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,520
You don't need to worry.

228
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,280
From the first day of my marriage,

229
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,660
I had an agreement with the Great Chief to divorce in the future.

230
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,160
The account books will be under your management sooner or later.

231
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,424
Divorce?

232
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,340
Such a good man as the Great Chief, yet you don't cherish him.

233
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,980
The Great Chief is a person of remarkable appearance. Graceful as a fine jade tree.

234
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,180
Anyone who fails to see that is truly blind.

235
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,680
Such a fine young lady.

236
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,880
What a pity her eyes don't work well.

237
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,180
What are you laughing at?

238
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,800
Could it be that you find the Great Chief very ugly?

239
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,240
No, no, no!

240
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,180
Miss Yun Que, you can be careless with food, but you mustn't speak recklessly.

241
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,240
I think we have nothing more to do here.

242
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,840
It's best to leave quickly.

243
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,360
Don't drag me!

244
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,388
Then you go on your own.

245
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,120
Come back to the mansion and stay.

246
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,060
After all, weâ€¦

247
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,028
I understand.

248
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,060
 I am not the one in your heart. 

249
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,240
If outsiders were to find out, it would only lead to more gossip.

250
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,920
Once the case is concluded, I will come back.

251
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,140
I won't cause you any trouble.

252
00:17:57,124 --> 00:17:58,480
   

253
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,140
 The Grand Empress Dowager has drawn today's final exam question. 

254
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,040
 We have been ordered to open it. 

255
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:10,090
 The question is: Appreciating the clear sky after the geese return, 

256
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,520
 and observing the grand view of Xiang'an 

257
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,020
 There are no restrictions on literary forms. 

258
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,620
 Poetry and essays are especially good. 

259
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,856
Take him away.

260
00:18:25,592 --> 00:18:27,688
   

261
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,500
Your Majesty, we've reviewed the papers for three days

262
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,700
and have decided on the final recruitment list for Hongwen School.

263
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,200
Please review it, Your Majesty.

264
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,920
The examination papers have been arranged according to their scored ranking.

265
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:03,180
The first one on top is the essay by Cheng Bojian, the top scorer this time.

266
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,340
Pan Chi is the last one?

267
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,560
Yes.

268
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:20,780
Wan'er, you read out this last one's to me.

269
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,320
 Tall pines planted at the mountain's foot. 

270
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,520
 Short saplings grow at the peak. 

271
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,540
 With the saplings' diameter just an inch, they overshadow the hundred-foot pine branches. 

272
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:36,880
I feel that the literary grace of this last one is also remarkable.

273
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,000
Pan Chi did not lose in literary grace.

274
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,480
But it is somewhat off-topic.

275
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:51,260
I don't quite understand these things.

276
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:56,980
Wan'er, interpret them for me.

277
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:03,120
This candidate uses the towering pine trees at the foot of Yangui Mountain

278
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,840
to symbolize the talented scholars from humble backgrounds

279
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,160
and uses the low-lying saplings on the mountaintop to symbolize the offspring of noble families.

280
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,840
Because their position at birth is already high,

281
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,920
the inch-wide saplings can overshadow the hundred-foot pines.

282
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,860
I think the scenery at Yangui Mountain...

283
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,040
is exquisitely depicted.

284
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,800
Continue reading.

285
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,200
 Laughing heartily under the open sky. 

286
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,560
 Striding high across the divine land. 

287
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,800
   
 Though the noble prize themselves, I regard them as mere dust. 

288
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,280
 Though the lowly demean themselves, who says they aren't important? 

289
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,210
 Flapping my gown, I gaze at the mountains. 

290
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,780
 Washing my feet in the long river. 

291
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,870
I not only want to take the exam

292
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,280
but also tear off your repulsive masks.

293
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:10,460
I see your mind is not on the chessboard at all.

294
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,840
Are you trying to ask me?

295
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,880
It's clearly seen

296
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,840
the selection at the Hongwen School involves unsavory practices.

297
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,940
Why was the original list still approved?

298
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,260
Indeed, I wanted to ask.

299
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,560
But I have figured it out just now.

300
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,480
Although Pan Chi is a brilliant writer,

301
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,200
his personality is too impulsive.

302
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,560
So he's not suitable for officialdom from the start.

303
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,000
This examination was just a trial.

304
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,560
The selection of talented scholars has been riddled with longstanding malpractices.

305
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:52,320
Many officials at court are involved in it.

306
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,160
It's already as solid as a rock. It's a stalemate on the board.

307
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,880
Even if I want to make a move in this chess game,

308
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,780
I have to wait for the right opportunity to make the move.

309
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,840
"Flapping my gown, I gaze at the mountains.

310
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,340
Washing my feet in the long river."

311
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,920
This piece of writing is grand and powerful.

312
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,500
Using scenery to satirize the present.

313
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,660
Implying that some use the pretext of not sticking to social hierarchy and fair selection

314
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,000
to actually oppress the humble and solidify the power of the nobility.

315
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,280
- It's so exhilarating. 
 - All right.

316
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,320
You've been praising this good friend of yours for quite a while.

317
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,760
Well, he really did write it very well.

318
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,640
Pan is not just sharing the same name as the top detective among the people.

319
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,860
He's very likely to be the detective himself.

320
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,080
Very likely.

321
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,952
Clerk Yan.

322
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,980
Marshal Xu asked me to tell you that you wanted him to help investigate

323
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,200
into Chen Shoujie's background and there are leads now.

324
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,000
Chen Shoujie indeed participated in the investigation of the Chen Huo'e case

325
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,720
and even got promoted because of it.

326
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,480
However, not long after his promotion, he went mad.

327
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:09,620
It turns out that before Madam Chen died, he had already gone mad.

328
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,820
The Huo'e case must be connected to him.

329
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,280
It's something we haven't discovered.

330
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,220
No, I have to make another trip to the Chen Mansion.

331
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,680
Shen Du.

332
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,510
Are you all right?

333
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,396
Be careful!

334
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,360
 The style of the hidden weapon is different from that day, 

335
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,820
 but the moves it executed are remarkably similar. 

336
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,060
You're injured!

337
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:33,320
It's nothing. Just a minor injury.

338
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,800
How come you're here alone?

339
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,160
I came to look for someone but didn't find them.

340
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,120
How can you be all right with all this blood loss?

341
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,220
Are you concerned about me?

342
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,600
I'm not concerned about you.

343
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,720
You got injured while saving me.

344
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,100
I should take responsibility for you.

345
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,460
This old man really is muddled.

346
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,740
The shop was clearly closed up properly.

347
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,960
Yet he insisted I go and check if anything was stolen.

348
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,720
You want to run?

349
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,820
I advise you not to make another mistake on top of another.

350
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,100
I'm a female official from the Ministry of Justice.

351
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,920
If you confess voluntarily, the crime of theft could be punished lightly.

352
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,640
But if you injure me, that would be a serious crime.

353
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,900
Nosy woman, go die!

354
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,840
Help!

355
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,400
It's you.

356
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,160
Who's there?

357
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,500
Wait a moment.

358
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,600
Just now, the patrolling ones were inspectors.

359
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,960
Why do we have to hide?

360
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:10,120
I don't want to deal with the officialdom.

361
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,800
You are averse to dealing with the officialdom

362
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,540
and skilled in martial arts.

363
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,680
I know your identity now.

364
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,424
You are...

365
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,500
a chivalrous hero who stands up for justice. Right?

366
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,460
Donning a mask at night. Becoming a righteous enforcer.

367
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:46,840
Acting valiantly and doing good deeds without leaving a name.

368
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,508
Sort of.

369
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,740
Wait a minute. You can't go. You killed someone.

370
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:59,200
Well? You want to arrest me and report to the authorities?

371
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,940
But I killed the person who tried to kill you.

372
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,240
Is this how you treat your lifesaver?

373
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,220
Regarding Great Cang's laws, if someone tries to kill people for no reason at night

374
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,560
and the victim resists the assailant and kills him,

375
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,320
he can thus be exempt from criminal responsibility.

376
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,560
But you can't just leave like this.

377
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,160
What are you doing?

378
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,320
I'm releasing water lanterns for you.

379
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,840
When I was a child, my mother

380
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,680
often brought me to release water lanterns.

381
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:47,160
My mother said water lanterns can drift along with the waves.

382
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,840
They can ward off disasters and sickness

383
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:53,360
and can also cleanse us of any ill fortunes from our being.

384
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,200
Although you did it to save me,

385
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,780
I will release a water lantern for you

386
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,480
to dispel some of the karma of killing.

387
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,620
No need. I don't believe in these things.

388
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:12,640
Belief makes it real, belief makes it work.

389
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,720
I didn't believe it as a child either.

390
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,180
So I did it very perfunctorily.

391
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:21,260
Later on, my mother's illness got worse and worse

392
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,280
and she left me.

393
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:28,000
I often think if at that time

394
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,440
I had taken it seriously to release each and every water lantern,

395
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,500
whether Heaven would then fulfill my wish

396
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:42,660
to let my mother always be with me.

397
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,080
Even if a thousand or ten thousand water lanterns were released,

398
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,600
those who are meant to go will still go.

399
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,220
In this life, this world, they had already made up their minds

400
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,880
to only accompany us for this part of our journey.

401
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,680
It can't be changed.

402
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,280
Nothing can be changed.

403
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,180
Ghost Maskâ€¦

404
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,320
Great Chief, the bandit hanged himself in the deep alley.

405
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,260
We're unable to identify him.

406
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,560
Hanged himself?

407
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,560
Since there's a need to silence someone, they wouldn't want us to find out their identity.

408
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,400
Go ahead.

409
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,120
Yes.

410
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,280
Great Chief, do we really not need to call a doctor to take a look?

411
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,040
-  No need for medicine? 
 - Talkative!

412
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,320
No need.

413
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,640
Who says there's no need?

414
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,496
Apply the medicine.

415
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,960
Is there something else later?

416
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,560
You seem to be in a hurry.

417
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,860
Surely you're not rushing to rest?

418
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,280
Of course not.

419
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,360
I was thinking,

420
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,520
if I finish applying the medicine for you and it's not too late,

421
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,020
I can go to the Ministry of Justice to sort out the case details.

422
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:18,120
The case is so pressing that there's no rest even at midnight?

423
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,220
Wasn't I just thinking about solving the case sooner?

424
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,860
Staying up all night is not a big deal.

425
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,160
But I am injured.

426
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:37,920
Can't you stay tonight to take care of me?

427
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,240
Iâ€¦

428
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,810
Forget it.

429
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,920
I don't need your care.

430
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,520
Go ahead with your business.

431
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,840
I'll do it.

432
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,080
Who says I am leaving?

433
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,360
You got hurt because you saved me.

434
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,640
If I leave now, even the heavens would think I'm heartless.

435
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,200
What if a bolt of lightning strikes suddenly?

436
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,520
Wouldn't I be wronged?

437
00:34:16,862 --> 00:34:22,206
â™«  The night is still long and the moonlight shines in the west window  â™«

438
00:34:22,206 --> 00:34:26,522
â™«  Starlight is hidden in your eyes  â™«

439
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:27,936
â™«  With one touch, my heart flutters like the shadow of a candle, swaying and trembling  â™«

440
00:34:27,936 --> 00:34:32,875
â™«  With one touch, my heart flutters like the shadow of a candle, swaying and trembling  â™«

441
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:38,207
â™«  The more one cares, the deeper it's concealed  â™«

442
00:34:38,207 --> 00:34:43,417
â™«  Leaves fall and turn yellow, with a thousand lines of yearning  â™«

443
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:47,744
â™«  Years pass like stanzas of poetry, romantic yet sad  â™«

444
00:34:47,744 --> 00:34:49,413
â™«  Two hearts collide between dawn and dusk  â™«

445
00:34:49,413 --> 00:34:53,416
â™«  Two hearts collide between dawn and dusk  â™«

446
00:34:53,416 --> 00:34:58,602
â™«  Embraces come unexpectedly  â™«

447
00:34:59,458 --> 00:35:02,240
â™«  I want to be with you, shadows become a pair  â™«

448
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,080
â™«  I want to hold you, staying by my side  â™«

449
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:10,240
â™«  Passing through the obstruction of a storm  â™«

450
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,800
â™«  I want to be your moonlight  â™«

451
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,440
I must have aggravated the wound.

452
00:35:16,802 --> 00:35:19,456
â™«  How I wish I could just forget the length of time  â™«

453
00:35:19,456 --> 00:35:23,488
â™«  How I wish I could just forget the length of time  â™«

454
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:26,353
â™«  I want to be with you, shadows become a pair  â™«

455
00:35:26,353 --> 00:35:29,640
â™«  I want to be with you, never forgetting each other  â™«

456
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,600
Don't get distracted.

457
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,660
Help me dress it properly.

458
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,600
All right.

459
00:35:36,962 --> 00:35:41,881
â™«  I want to hold you, staying by my side  â™«

460
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,160
Maybe I didn't bandage it well enough before.

461
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,360
It's fine now.

462
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,240
It's getting late. You should rest early.

463
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,240
â™«  How I wish I could just forget the length of time  â™«

464
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,924
â™«  I want to be with you, shadows become a pair  â™«

465
00:36:00,924 --> 00:36:04,901
â™«  I want to be with you, never forgetting each other  â™«

466
00:36:04,901 --> 00:36:08,983
â™«  There is always a place where the clouds and the sea meet  â™«

467
00:36:08,983 --> 00:36:11,651
â™«  I want to accompany you forever  â™«

468
00:36:11,651 --> 00:36:15,616
â™«  I will wait until my black hair turns grey  â™«

469
00:36:15,616 --> 00:36:18,144
â™«  In this life, I will only keep you in my heart  â™«

470
00:36:18,144 --> 00:36:24,919
â™«  In this life, I will only keep you in my heart  â™«

471
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,728
My Lord!

472
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,300
My Lord, spare my life. I have inquired about the matter regarding the inspectors.

473
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,120
It has been dealt with as a typical case of thieves fighting each other.

474
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,720
It has not been reported to the Ministry of Justice yet.

475
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,800
Trash, send someone more efficient to handle it.

476
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,680
If there's another mistake, you will be the next one to die.

477
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,920
I know my mistake. Thank you for not taking my life.

478
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,480
That Lu Chuichui from the Ministry of Justice,

479
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,360
no one is allowed to touch her.

480
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,050
Yes.

481
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,020
You may leave.

482
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:20,680
 These ignorant fools, 

483
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,820
 a mere fire moth trick can turn heaven and earth upside down.  

484
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:30,620
 It won't take long before Great Cangâ€¦ 

485
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,440
Get up.

486
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,640
Go to the front hall and have something to eat.

487
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,920
When one is injured, they must eat more.

488
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,760
You've seen it.

489
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,680
I am currently seriously injured.

490
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,680
It's inconvenient for me to move.

491
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,600
Going to the front hall is too troublesome.

492
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,840
I just want to lie down.

493
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,900
All right. Then you should rest well.

494
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,200
I'll bring you breakfast in a bit.

495
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,284
Well.

496
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,000
- Where is my wife? 
 - Someone from the Yan Mansion came.

497
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,560
They have invited Madam Shen to a banquet.

498
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,480
She instructed that you are severely injured.

499
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,240
- There's no need for you to accompany her to the banquet. 
 - Iâ€¦

500
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,200
We should serve you well during your meal.

501
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,760
You may leave.

502
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,630
Yes.

503
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,560
Great Chief, Iâ€¦

504
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,420
What's the matter?

505
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,720
I have found out that Han Shiyuan is no simple character.

506
00:40:29,296 --> 00:40:32,460
   

507
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,280
Sixth Miss, Young Master Han and I are set to get married next month.

508
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,320
I use tea in place of wine.

509
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,280
I toast to you and Young Master Han.

510
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,960
I wish you both a harmonious union for a hundred years.

511
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,440
I was hasty before and lacked proper courtesy.

512
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,160
Please forgive me for that.

513
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,380
You're too kind!

514
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,040
All right. Sit down and talk.

515
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,360
This year in our Yan Mansion, it's really one joyous occasion after another.

516
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,440
Mojie has been admitted to the Hongwen School.

517
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,820
Sixth Miss and Caiwei both have married decent men.

518
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,440
My sixth daughter, why have you been frequently coming back recently?

519
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,120
Is it because you're not on good terms with the Great Chief?

520
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,680
No, I'm quite well at the Shen Mansion.

521
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,760
A few days ago, that cook took a few days off to go home.

522
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,220
The food wasn't quite to my taste.

523
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,960
So I came back home to eat.

524
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,640
That's good then, as long as there's nothing wrong.

525
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,080
The rumors outside say that as soon as you return to your parental home,

526
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,600
the Great Chief would come to fetch you.

527
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,940
This situation is a bit frightening.

528
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:39,060
But the last time you came back, he did not come to fetch you.

529
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:42,520
I actually felt uneasy.

530
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,180
My Lord, Madam, the Great Chief has arrived.

531
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,390
Great Chief.

532
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,520
Great Chief, please take a seat.

533
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,320
Aren't you inconvenienced by mobility?

534
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,020
My father-in-law's banquet cannot be missed.

535
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,880
Yes, Great Chief.

536
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,080
Please come inside.

537
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:44,760
