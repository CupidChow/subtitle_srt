00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,950
 'Go Ahead Fearlessly' - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,994
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:38,292
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:40,661
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:44,536
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,536 --> 00:00:47,671
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:50,836
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,836 --> 00:00:55,872
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,872 --> 00:01:02,144
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,144 --> 00:01:08,352
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:14,731
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:21,144
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,144 --> 00:01:28,588
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:37,222
   

16
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,157
   

17
00:01:45,037 --> 00:01:47,364
   

18
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,360
The worse you people fight,

19
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,720
the more at ease I am.

20
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,920
Where are you going?

21
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,280
Jia'er is sick and wants his father by his side.

22
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,920
Let go!

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,140
You always use Jia'er to seek attention.

24
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,280
You think I can't tell?

25
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,120
I just won't let you see that woman.

26
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,939
What a shrew. A jealous shrew.

27
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:12,360
You're living off me.

28
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,520
How dare you be rude and unreasonable to me?

29
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,380
- Stop! 
 - Get lost.

30
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,080
What are you doing?

31
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,360
 Madam Shen is here. 

32
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,720
Nasty women. Just you wait!

33
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,500
Step aside!

34
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,880
Move along, move along, move along!

35
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,944
Everyone disperse!

36
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,920
Fourth Sister.

37
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,200
What are you doing here?

38
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,700
Are you here to see me ridiculed?

39
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,200
W-Why would I do that?

40
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,880
You married well and now you're making a fool of me.

41
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,100
I don't need your help. Go away!

42
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,300
 Clerk Yan Xing of the Ministry of Justice is here to pay respects. 

43
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,420
Grand Empress Dowager, Madam Shen is here.

44
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,360
May you be well, Grand Empress Dowager.

45
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,408
Spare the formalities.

46
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,920
You contributed greatly to solving the murder case.

47
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,480
I would love to reward you with something.

48
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,120
But I couldn't think of anything.

49
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,600
Let's hear it from you.

50
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,040
What reward would you like?

51
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,320
Grand Empress Dowager, I do not wish for a reward.

52
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,120
But please bestow upon me an oral decree.

53
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,080
Very well.

54
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,560
Tell me about it.

55
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,880
Grand Empress Dowager,

56
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,640
from now on, please kindly address me as Clerk Yan instead of Madam Shen.

57
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:10,480
You have such insight and ambition at such a young age.

58
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,160
I really appreciate it.

59
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,760
Our court appoints the virtuous and capable, regardless of gender.

60
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,700
Women don't have to rely on their husbands.

61
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:25,320
We can fight for a career path on our own.

62
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,660
Approved.

63
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,260
Thank you, Grand Empress Dowager!

64
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,800
Forgive me for speaking boldly.

65
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,680
All Six Ministries have female officials,

66
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,800
but they mostly take on cleaning and archiving tasks.

67
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,240
In the Ministry of Justice,

68
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,120
female officials can't work on cases like male officials.

69
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,490
You see.

70
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,080
I am a woman, as well.

71
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,040
Therefore, I know how much we have to go through

72
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,320
to stand as tall as men.

73
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,840
If I can sit on this throne,

74
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,060
then the female officials have every right to work on cases.

75
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,040
Madam Xu, draft an imperial edict on my behalf.

76
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,160
From now on, all the female officials

77
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,320
shall enjoy the same rights as male officials.

78
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,880
Your Majesty is truly wise.

79
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,040
Clerk Yan,

80
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,480
from now on, you're free to conduct investigations

81
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,000
like your male colleagues.

82
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,260
Thank you, Grand Empress Dowager!

83
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,480
Sixth Miss.

84
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,740
Marshal Xu.

85
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,480
Is the ministry head here?

86
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,720
He hasn't been feeling well and has taken a sick leave.

87
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,800
Is there something urgent?

88
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,880
It's not exactly urgent.

89
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,120
It's just somewhat shocking.

90
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,400
How so?

91
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,240
Regarding Liang Chenzhong's chronic poisoning,

92
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,960
you told me to look into the people around him.

93
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,440
I looked into it and followed the leads.

94
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,320
Guess who it led me to?

95
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,560
It led me to the owner of the Tongming Hall, Rong Zhui.

96
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,000
Don't move.

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,800
Behave.

98
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,024
Dripping Water Guanyin.

99
00:06:35,024 --> 00:06:37,800
- Take her away. 
 - Go.

100
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,120
I brought some tonic for your mother.

101
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,400
The bottom one is for you.

102
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,440
You suffered in prison for nothing

103
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,040
and lost a lot of weight.

104
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,000
Thanks for looking after me.

105
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,720
The prison guards didn't give me a hard time.

106
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,800
And it was quiet in the cell.

107
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,100
Therefore, I came up with many ideas to improve siege weapons.

108
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,080
I know turning myself in was a stupid move.

109
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,480
But no matter what, I couldn't let my mother suffer any more misfortunes.

110
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,600
Thank you for discovering the truth...

111
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,960
and clearing our names.

112
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,920
This case may have been closed,

113
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,520
but we still haven't caught the person with the poison.

114
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,240
Your family is not considered innocent yet.

115
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,760
A-Are you still going to arrest my mother?

116
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,080
 - How can you arrest me? 
 - Take him away. 

117
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,280
Great Chief.

118
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,720
Xu Xiangren and Madam arrested Liang Jiren.

119
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,260
- They looked into the Tongming Hall? 
 - That's right.

120
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:23,440
They have arrested Rong Zhui, the owner of Tongming Hall.

121
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,360
That's quick.

122
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,240
Should I take some people to stop them?

123
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,540
What for?

124
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,320
She was just granted authority.

125
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,460
Let her show off a bit.

126
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,180
Understood.

127
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,960
Third Young Master Liang,

128
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,760
I've been visiting you quite frequently.

129
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,880
Besides sharing Grand Empress Dowager's burden,

130
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,880
I also have something else in mind.

131
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,320
Now, I've discovered what I've wanted to know.

132
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,340
And someone has arrested the suspects for me.

133
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,040
The nine sons of the dragon have different characters.

134
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,560
The poisoning has nothing to do with you and your mother.

135
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,680
The second branch has nothing to do with the main branch.

136
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,760
Do your job.

137
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,560
Live up to the Grand Empress Dowager's expectations.

138
00:09:44,897 --> 00:09:47,912
   

139
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,460
You poisoned Liang Chenzhong with Dripping Water Guanyin?

140
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,800
That's right. I did it.

141
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:06,500
His eldest son was nothing but a scoundrel.

142
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,800
If he remained alive,

143
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,720
his father was bound to die at his hands one day.

144
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,500
Besides, I already carry his father's child.

145
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,960
Naturally, I have to plan for the future.

146
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,160
 Master, this way, please. 

147
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,600
 A batch of new dancers arrived. 

148
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,360
 Would you like to take a look? 

149
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,132
 Sensible. 

150
00:10:43,932 --> 00:10:45,660
 - Nice! 
 - Young Master Liang. 

151
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,140
 I have found a real beauty for you. 
   

152
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,200
 Lan'er, come here. 

153
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,800
 - What a beauty. Come here. 
 - Young Master. 

154
00:10:57,312 --> 00:11:00,320
 Young Master Liang, please have some tea. 

155
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,400
I had no choice.

156
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,900
That wayward son of mine was either

157
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,200
out there gambling or visiting brothels.

158
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,400
Once he ran out of money,

159
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,600
he came to threaten me for more.

160
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,400
He almost drained my savings dry.

161
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,300
Otherwise, I would not have done that.

162
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:28,200
Besides, I have an unborn child.

163
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,800
Shouldn't I do something for him?

164
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,900
   

165
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,200
So, Rong Zhui got pregnant.

166
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,800
So he decided to get rid of his eldest son.

167
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,400
That's right.

168
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,800
I've seen all kinds of strange cases as an inspector,

169
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:10,100
but I've never heard of a father poisoning his eldest son on purpose.

170
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,800
I didn't expect that a tiger would actually devour its own cub.

171
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,200
People are truly unpredictable.

172
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,400
Great Chief, what brings you here?

173
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,100
Minister Liang, don't you remember?

174
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,500
The Grand Empress Dowager has entrusted this murder case solely to me.

175
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,400
However, I'm really surprised by your ruthless measures.

176
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:25,200
If I had any other options, I wouldn't haveâ€¦

177
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,300
I had no choice.

178
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,800
Even a tiger does not eat its cubs.

179
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:39,900
How come you simply "had no choice" when it came to your son?

180
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,400
Great Chief, why are you mocking me?

181
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,800
I did try to murder my own child.

182
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,100
But what about you? You reported your own father.

183
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,900
We are clearly the same type of people.

184
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,400
Among all the accusations that convicted my father,

185
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,800
one said that he had leaked a weapon design to the enemy.

186
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:20,200
That weapon design was drawn by your younger brother.

187
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,100
I knew it.

188
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,500
You've been hanging out with that silly nephew of mine.

189
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,400
I thought you valued talents

190
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,900
and saw my silly nephew as an inseparable friend.

191
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:51,900
It turns out that you've been suspecting us.

192
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,000
 My goodness, why are you here? 

193
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,600
 Why did you come at this hour? 

194
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,100
 I came to see you. 

195
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,800
 No one saw you, right? 

196
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,600
 I don't know. 

197
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,600
 We'll be in trouble if someone saw you. 

198
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,200
 This is what you're saying at a time like this? 

199
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:22,000
Your son must have figured something out.

200
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
That's why you harbored the intent to silence him.

201
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,500
If you had found anything solid,

202
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,100
you wouldn't have come to question me here.

203
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:43,000
Even if you bring this to the Grand Empress Dowager,

204
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,300
I still have nothing to say.

205
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,500
In that case,

206
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:58,600
your affection for the unborn child is nothing but a disguise.

207
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,720
If you promise to

208
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,100
look after my unborn child,

209
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,200
I may try to recall the event.

210
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,800
Perhaps I might recall something.

211
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,600
You are not in a position to negotiate terms with me.

212
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:45,800
Minister Liang, have you ever heard of a punishment called inch-torture?

213
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,300
With each cut, the criminal will shed exactly 36 drops of blood.

214
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,900
In three days,

215
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:56,400
a total of 360 cuts are made while the prisoner is alive.

216
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:02,400
Shen Du, I am a high official.

217
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,300
I am guilty of attempted murder.

218
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,800
Andâ€¦ And I was just an accomplice.

219
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,700
I don't deserve to die.

220
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Y-You shall not act recklessly.

221
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,536
Act recklessly?

222
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:35,000
Do you really think people call me "White Ghost" for no reason?

223
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,700
Do you really think...

224
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,480
you can leave this place alive?

225
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,800
H-How dare youâ€”

226
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,100
This is the first cut.

227
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,800
I have nothing to do these days,

228
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,720
so I might as well keep you company.

229
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,000
I confess. I confess.

230
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,800
I got drunk back then

231
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,000
and leaked my younger brother's weapon design.

232
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
After what happened, I was too scared to confess.

233
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,200
Back then, your father was close to my brother.

234
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,200
Besides, he had been convicted of treason.

235
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,600
I just seized the opportunity and blamed it on him.

236
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,800
Chenzhong had found out about it by chance

237
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,900
and had kept extorting money from me.

238
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,900
I couldn't take it anymore. I simply couldn't.

239
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,800
Great Chief, back in the day,

240
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:01,200
your father was convicted of treason with solid evidence.

241
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,000
With one less conviction,

242
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
you still can't overturn the case.

243
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,240
So it was you, indeed.

244
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,900
 Then, I will overturn the convictions one by one. 

245
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,600
 I do not seek to be renowned. 

246
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,600
 I only wish to have a clear conscience and not let the people down. 

247
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,700
    
  How can I collude with you? 

248
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,200
 No way. 

249
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,800
 Don't say that I haven't warned you. 

250
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,500
 The nail that sticks out gets hammered down. 

251
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,200
 If you don't ally with me, 

252
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:56,000
 you will be walking into a fire with no return. 

253
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,200
 I receive my wage from His Majesty. 

254
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,200
 Naturally, I shall share his burden even at the cost of my life. 

255
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,400
 By heavenly decree, here comes the edict. 

256
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,200
 The criminal, Shen Bingzhu, secretly corresponded with the enemy, 

257
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,400
 burned down our army's granary, leaked the weapon designs, 

258
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,300
 and colluded with the enemy. 

259
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,700
    
  He shall be executed. 

260
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,600
 The male members of the Shen family are to be executed. 

261
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,000
 The women and children are to be imprisoned. 

262
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,200
 Convey the message widely. 

263
00:21:47,298 --> 00:21:49,440
   

264
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,520
Father, all these years,

265
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,700
I've never given up seeking justice for all our family members.

266
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,760
But I'm still clueless...

267
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,040
about who that woman is.

268
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,240
Is she an enemy or a friend?

269
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:23,200
Today, at least I managed to prove...

270
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,660
that you were framed for leaking the weapon design.

271
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,940
Father, rest assured.

272
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,000
I will find that woman one day.

273
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,500
And I will gather...

274
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,400
all the evidence I need.

275
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,344
Great Chief.

276
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,220
The Ministry of Justice and the inspectors are celebrating tonight.

277
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,160
- Why do I care? 
 - Great Chief.

278
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,160
You are always right.

279
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,740
- Cheers. 
 - You've worked hard.

280
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,060
 Drink up, and I'll fill it up. 

281
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:43,020
 - Let's get wasted. 
 - Can you drink? 

282
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,900
- Over there. 
 - Come on, let's go.

283
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,740
 Come on, Brother Meng, I toast to you. 

284
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,420
Dig in.

285
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,700
 You've worked hard. 

286
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,340
 Cheers. 

287
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:04,760
I almost forgot. Your letter. It came to the ministry.

288
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,320
So happy?

289
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,200
Chi is coming to Xiang'an. She has asked to meet with me.

290
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,920
That's great.

291
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,520
I've heard you mention Chi so many times.

292
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,020
The ministry received so many case-solving letters from commoners.

293
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:34,180
Only you were silly enough to read the letters one by one.

294
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,920
I laughed at you back then.

295
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,540
I didn't expect you to meet such a close pen pal.

296
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,300
I am so jealous.

297
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,420
I still remember her first letter sent from Jiangnan.

298
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,700
The letterhead featured gilded inlays. And it had a fragrance.

299
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,540
She even put flower petals in the envelope.

300
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,660
I am so jealous.

301
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:59,960
I really want to meet such a talented young lady.

302
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,540
She must be a beauty.

303
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:05,820
Sorry. She only asked to meet with me.

304
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,336
Annoying.

305
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,440
They really can drink.

306
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,660
 - Dig in.  
 - Have some grapes. Here.

307
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,960
Sixth Miss. Come on.

308
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,020
I truly admire your investigative methods.

309
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,740
I toast to you.

310
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,360
Brother Xu, I'm not very good at drinking.

311
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,360
It's okay. You'll get better at it.

312
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,200
You'll gradually discover the mystery in the wine.

313
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,280
Cheers.

314
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,460
You'd better behave.

315
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,280
Want to be arrested again?

316
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,580
 Great Chief. 

317
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:04,200
Shen Du, why are you here?

318
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,040
Great Chief, please have a seat.

319
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,400
Did I say I wouldn't come?

320
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,680
Great Chief. Great Chief.

321
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,860
Your esteemed presence is such an honor for me.

322
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,440
Let me toast to you.

323
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,000
Please enjoy.

324
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:22,840
Come on, Great Chief. I toast to you.

325
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:37,120
That was unexpected. The Great Chief can really hold his liquor.

326
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:56,940
Great Chief, I toast to you.

327
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,092
Cheers.

328
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,320
He can hold his liquor?

329
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,720
I'm not drunk.

330
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,960
I'm very sober.

331
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,480
All right. You're very sober.

332
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,204
You don't believe me?

333
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,660
Find someone to fight with me.

334
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:58,760
Now that you mention it, I really do have someone I want to beat up.

335
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,104
Let's do it!

336
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,200
 Thank you for coming, Great Chief. 

337
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,408
Mind your steps.

338
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,640
Jing Lin, bring the lantern.

339
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,960
What for?

340
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,740
Who beats someone up with a lantern in hand?

341
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,412
Let's go.

342
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,800
I can beat someone up,

343
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,080
but not without a lantern.

344
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,060
Yes, you can.

345
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:57,860
Look at me. I am your lantern. Let's go.

346
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,640
Jing Lin, let's go. Let's go.

347
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,260
Let's go. Let's go.

348
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:06,680
- Be careful. 
 - Sixth Miss, be careful.

349
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,760
- Goodbye, Great Chief. 
 - Be careful.

350
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,660
- Be careful. 
  - Chuichui, let's keep drinking. 

351
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:13,300
 Who wants to drink? I want to eat. 

352
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,096
Be careful.

353
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,900
Jing Lin, come here and hold him.

354
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,940
He's too heavy.

355
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,860
Let's go.

356
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,470
Great Chief, there's a staircase.

357
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,760
- Another one. 
 -  Be careful.

358
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,620
Up.

359
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,790
Stand still. Be careful.

360
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,060
 Who's there? Let me out. Who is it? 

361
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,020
 Who is it? 

362
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,240
I'm going to beat him up. Wait here for me.

363
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,440
I'll go.

364
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,540
Okay. Go ahead.

365
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,700
 Who's there? 

366
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,080
- Let me out. 
 - So wasted.

367
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,352
Who is it?

368
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,340
Who is it? What do you want?

369
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,280
Buddha absorbs the sin and only kills the cheaters.

370
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,580
So many unfaithful lovers are buried at Ximing Temple.

371
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:14,540
Someone still favors the lover and neglects his family.

372
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:18,280
It's just a minor punishment as a warning.

373
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:22,320
If you dare to do it again, I will gouge out your heart and bury you.

374
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,600
I dare not anymore. I dare not anymore.

375
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:32,100
So this is how the drunk White Ghost looks.

376
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:36,720
Take your sober Great Chief back to the mansion. Let's go.

377
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,844
- Watch your steps. 
 - Go.

378
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,780
Be careful.

379
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,390
Who was it? So ruthless. Who was it?

380
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:01,320
   

381
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,040
I didn't expect the mighty White Ghost to get drunk so easily.

382
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,400
Aren't you a tough guy?

383
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,400
The corpses are easier to carry than you.

384
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,560
Thank you.

385
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,760
No problem.

386
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,300
Bringing back a drunk roommate is no big deal. You're welcome.

387
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,380
Detention center.

388
00:34:04,088 --> 00:34:11,476
â™«  May you also look up to see the brilliant stars and moon  â™«

389
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,200
So you knew all along.

390
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,740
I thought you had forgotten.

391
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,360
â™«  The winter in warm memories  â™«

392
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,740
 Are you all right? 

393
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:37,520
â™«  Never mind the destined solitary fate  â™«

394
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,600
 - It's from the new preserved fruits shop. 
 - Who is there? 

395
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,560
 I have to go. I'll comb your hair tomorrow. 

396
00:34:47,224 --> 00:34:52,388
â™«  The ice and snow slowly melting  â™«

397
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,060
 This is really tasty. Try it. 

398
00:35:00,276 --> 00:35:01,760
 - Let her go.  
 - Let go. 

399
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,000
 - Let her go. Let her go. 
 -  Brother Shen Du. 

400
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,880
 - Let her go. 
 - I will find a way to get you out. 

401
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,220
 Wait for me. 

402
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,190
Madam Xu.

403
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,150
Thank you.

404
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:25,284
â™«  Love is pure and originally flawless  â™«

405
00:35:25,284 --> 00:35:28,200
â™«  Let the vast universe change  â™«

406
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,137
â™«  Let's spend our time together  â™«

407
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,420
Shen Du.

408
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:52,860
Shen Du, you're so annoying.

409
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,950
Good morning, Madam.

410
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,640
Good morning, Madam.

411
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,440
Madam, please have breakfast.

412
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,440
Youâ€¦

413
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,280
Morning.

414
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,620
 I got drunk and did something improper. 

415
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,628
It's all right.

416
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,040
Last nightâ€”

417
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,770
Nothing happened.

418
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:02,720
Sister.

419
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,660
Qi Yeyun.

420
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,360
Sister.

421
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,920
What happened to your forehead?

422
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,840
Who hurt you?

423
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,980
Was it you? Did you hit my sister?

424
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,960
No, no.

425
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,560
I drank too much last night...

426
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,720
and bumped my head.

427
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,040
Right! Why did you come here?

428
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,260
I came to deliver something for my lady.

429
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,280
Your lady?

430
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,640
Lu Chuichui.

431
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,280
This is her treasured Floral Essence.

432
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,600
Have it with water to relieve hangover headaches. She sent me to deliver it.

433
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,720
Chuichui is so considerate?

434
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,340
But when did you start working for the Lu family?

435
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:48,580
The young lad from their pawnshop was fired for being talkative.

436
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,500
They hired me to work there.

437
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,410
You wouldn't take me in as a disciple,

438
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:55,960
and I'm too young to take exams to join the Ministry of Justice.

439
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,960
So I thought I could be closer to you if I worked for your colleague.

440
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,960
You're talking so much.

441
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,640
It looks like you'll get fired at any time.

442
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,900
No way.  I'm only talkative in front of my sister.

443
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,400
Uncle Zhong.

444
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,120
Why do you let everyone into the mansion?

445
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,420
Why do you let everyone into the mansion?

446
00:39:29,247 --> 00:39:32,566
   

447
00:39:32,566 --> 00:39:35,520
 On the first day of the sixth month, the breakfast flatbread was too hard. 

448
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,580
 Du was furious. 

449
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:40,320
 On the second day, dinner was acacia-leaf noodle. 

450
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,000
 Du ate three bowls of it. 

451
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,180
 On the third day, the breakfast tofu pudding was too salty. 

452
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,680
 Du was furious. 

453
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,460
 On the fourth day, we ran out of candied fruits. 

454
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,160
 Du was furious. 

455
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,240
Sixth Miss Yan.

456
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,700
Do you take me for a three-year-old? 
    

457
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,600
My Lord.

458
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,320
Have you settled everything in Yingzhou?

459
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,840
Yes, My Lord.

460
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,780
Here are the accounts.

461
00:40:08,504 --> 00:40:10,080
   

462
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,180
The revenue is nearly 30,000 taels this year.

463
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,260
Keep it confidential.

464
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,040
Don't even reveal anything to Prince Xian.

465
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:28,640
Rest assured, My Lord. No one will learn about it.

466
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,640
I have also taken care of the families that have expressed support for His Highness.

467
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,280
They have received benefits and will naturally keep their mouths shut.

468
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,560
There will be no slip-ups.

469
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,040
Liang Jiren can't keep a secret.

470
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:51,060
Grand Empress Dowager may exile him in secret.

471
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,380
Find an opportunity to silence him forever.

472
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:59,060
He knows too much.

473
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,240
 - Cheng Cai. 
 - Here. 

474
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,180
 - Zhang Xinliang. 
 - Here. 

475
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,992
 Songâ€” 

476
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,080
Isn't this Madam Shen?

477
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,300
What's wrong?

478
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,540
Madam Shen came for roll call in person?

479
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,940
Yan Xing.

480
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,756
Here.

481
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,300
How did you get hurt so badly?

482
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,740
I tripped and fell.
