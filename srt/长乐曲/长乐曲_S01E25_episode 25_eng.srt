00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,980
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,024
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:35,024 --> 00:00:38,222
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,222 --> 00:00:40,591
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:44,466
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,466 --> 00:00:47,601
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,601 --> 00:00:50,866
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:55,802
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,802 --> 00:01:02,174
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,174 --> 00:01:08,482
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,482 --> 00:01:14,761
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:21,074
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,074 --> 00:01:29,118
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:37,252
   

16
00:01:37,252 --> 00:01:40,290
   

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,360
Disrespect of the Huo'e.

18
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,020
Disaster strikes from the sky.

19
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,200
There's likely a hidden threat in this.

20
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,980
If we continue to investigate and stop them from causing trouble,

21
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:58,660
then you and your loved ones might encounter an unforeseen disaster.

22
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,480
How can you tell Madam this?

23
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,120
Do you want her to worry?

24
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,080
With her intelligence, it's only a matter of time before she figures this out.

25
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,800
- Iâ€¦ 
 - I just gave her an early heads-up.

26
00:02:30,742 --> 00:02:37,778
â™«  May you also look up to see the brilliant stars and moon  â™«

27
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:48,720
â™«  Among countless others, I've found only you  â™«

28
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,511
â™«  Time is fleeting and fate is shallow  â™«

29
00:02:53,511 --> 00:02:59,149
â™«  The winter in warm memories  â™«

30
00:02:59,149 --> 00:03:03,300
â™«  Never mind the destined solitary fate  â™«

31
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,586
â™«  Blazing a lifetime of magnificence  â™«

32
00:03:09,262 --> 00:03:13,660
â™«  I have waited until time bloomed into flowers  â™«

33
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:19,320
â™«  The ice and snow slowly melting  â™«

34
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,672
â™«  I hear those gentle words  â™«

35
00:03:23,672 --> 00:03:29,640
â™«  He said he loves her  â™«

36
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,600
What's wrong?

37
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,400
Have you seen the physician?

38
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,410
I'm fine.

39
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:46,160
Thank you for your concern.

40
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,560
Don't push yourself too hard.

41
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,540
I will be worried.

42
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:54,764
â™«  Let the vast universe change  â™«

43
00:03:54,764 --> 00:03:59,596
â™«  Let's spend our time together  â™«

44
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,960
You have to stay well.

45
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,180
Otherwise, who would prepare the medicinal meals for me?

46
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,480
Shen Du,

47
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,480
I really don't have the energy to argue with you.

48
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,560
All right.

49
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,020
I misspoke just now.

50
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,300
What's wrong with you?

51
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,880
Shen Du,

52
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,520
I enjoy investigating cases.

53
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,600
I can lose myself in pursuit of the truth,

54
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,960
but I don't want to involve my family.

55
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:52,180
The Huo'e Sect wrote the words on the body to send me messages.

56
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,300
They had everything planned out, deliberately putting on a show for us.

57
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,060
They are demonstrating against us. This is a warning.

58
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,480
Are you afraid that further investigation might involve your family?

59
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,160
In Xiang'an,

60
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,560
if we hadn't arrived in time,

61
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,720
Third Sister and the others would have died.

62
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,404
Ifâ€¦

63
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,200
If when I was in Yingzhou,

64
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,240
they really wanted to harm my family, what would I have done then?

65
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,680
We are so far away.

66
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,500
How can I keep them safe?

67
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,480
I've thought about it for four hours,

68
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,700
and I really have no solution.

69
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,900
If you want to, I can arrange for a carriage to take you back to Xiang'an.

70
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,420
About the matter in Yingzhou,

71
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,160
you should stay out of it.

72
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,840
What about you? What will you do?

73
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,360
Me?

74
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,420
Do you want me to escort you back to your home?

75
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,220
We cannot go back.

76
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,840
You are the Great Chief of the Imperial Guards,

77
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,080
and I am a Chief Clerk of the Ministry of Justice.

78
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,320
We are here on a mission.

79
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,500
I definitely knew you would not leave.

80
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,440
A moment of emotion will not affect your passion for the case investigation.

81
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,800
Don't act like you know me well.

82
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,440
You're back to your old self.

83
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,380
This is the Yan Xing I know, sharp-tongued and unyielding.

84
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:21,380
Of course, you also don't fear authority, showing a stubbornness akin to going straight into the tiger's den.

85
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,500
Iâ€¦

86
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,540
I know you're worried about your family.

87
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,700
I assure you that what you are worried about...

88
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,620
will definitely not happen.

89
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,660
Before coming to Gannandao, I made some arrangements in advance.

90
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,480
So far, everything is under control.

91
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,740
Do you remember the letter from Xiang'an?

92
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,080
 An urgent letter from Xiang'an. 

93
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,780
 Who sent it? 

94
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,760
 Madam Xu. 

95
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,760
Of course I remember.

96
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,020
Every year during the Garment Festival, Grand Empress Dowager

97
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,520
would go to the Li Mountain hot springs villa for a retreat.

98
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,560
She would also reward the families of certain officials, allowing them to accompany her for leisure.

99
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,900
Madam Xu's letter informed me that she's already put the Yan family on the list.

100
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:23,980
Within the sight of the Empress Dowager, I don't think anyone would dare to create trouble.

101
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,100
Oh, you, Shen Du!

102
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,040
But then again, there is indeed something that is not that important

103
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:41,479
- yet anyway, related to you. 
 - What is that?

104
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,640
Ji Dafu, the brother-in-law of the headless body suspect, is here.

105
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,880
This Ji Dafu is very special,

106
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,300
because both the victim and the suspect are his wife's brother.

107
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,800
 Please spare me. 
   

108
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,300
 When will my brother-in-law's case be settled? 

109
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,360
 You can't find the head. All right. 

110
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,180
 Let's just bury the body and let the dead rest in peace. 

111
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,500
 Ji Dafu, be patient. 

112
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,400
 The case is still under investigation. 

113
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,080
 Governor Mo, were you looking for me? 

114
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,800
 I've heard that you have some ideas for this case. 

115
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,400
 There's something unusual about this case. 

116
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
 I am still investigating. 

117
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,840
 I suggest investigating this case with the bride case. 

118
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,740
 If we do so, the investigation will take more time. 

119
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,260
 - Then I fearâ€¦ 
 - Master Pan, what do you mean? 

120
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,100
 I don't think you deserve to be the top detective. 

121
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,440
 And you've set a rule of never meeting with the employer. 

122
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,280
 I see you're just afraid that things won't work out and you'll end up embarrassed. 

123
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,140
 Today, in front of Governor Mo, tell me 

124
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,140
 whether you can solve the case and catch the murderer within five days. 

125
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,060
 If you can't, refund the money to me, so I can find someone else. 

126
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,460
 If I can't solve the case, I will refund the money. 

127
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,620
 But I'm close to finding out who the murderer is. 

128
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,160
 Who is the murderer? 

129
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,710
 The murderer is the Half-faced Demon. 

130
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:08,300
In order not to refund the money, that friend of yours said something about demonology,

131
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,080
and it really worked.

132
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,840
After hearing it, Ji Dafu was terrified and then left.

133
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,380
But as for Governor Mo,

134
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,160
he wasn't so easy to bluff.

135
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:37,400
 Young Master Pan, I have already reported the bride case to the Ministry of Justice to have it closed. 

136
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,870
 Governor Mo, I have provided a new statement. 

137
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,660
 - I have read it. 
 - Then why do you close the case so hastily? 

138
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,720
 Xu Jize has a new testimony, which might get a lighter sentence. 

139
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,120
 The eyeless corpse case is clearly part of a bigger conspiracy, closely linked to the decapitated corpse case. 

140
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,000
 Young Master Pan, this is not Xiang'an! 

141
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,390
 This is not Xiang'an. 

142
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,680
 This is Yingzhou, which has been caught in a military disaster for decades. 

143
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,460
 The situation in Yingzhou is unstable. 

144
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,960
 Although a prefecture is established, still Xichen is covetously eyeing us. 

145
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,800
 In history, Yingzhou has been invaded by Xichen multiple times. 

146
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,200
 To pacify the turmoil in the Western Region and prevent the war from arising, 

147
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,120
 we have to unite the people. 

148
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,860
 However, do you know what matters to unite the people? 

149
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,800
 Please tell me. 

150
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,880
 What matters is the lasting peace and stability. 

151
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,510
 It's about eradicating crimes with strict laws, 

152
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,060
 solving every case, and catching every criminal. 

153
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:43,220
 We need to convince people that as long as the officials of Great Cang are here for one day, 

154
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:48,400
 Yingzhou is a city where people can live with peace of mind. 

155
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,790
 So, 

156
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,140
 troubled times call for harsh laws. 

157
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:59,840
 Xu Jize's head is destined to be hung on the gate tower 

158
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,280
 and becomes the one that deters others. Right? 

159
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,450
 Er Laipi is extremely vicious, deserving to die. 

160
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,480
 No further investigation needed. 

161
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,820
 Xu Jize raped a married woman, and is doubly guilty. 

162
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:19,220
 And he broke the frontier law. The death penalty is inevitable. 

163
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,840
 However, I can promise you to let him die peacefully 

164
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,490
 and I won't let his head be hung on the gate tower. 

165
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:32,800
You told me this matter in such detail.

166
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,540
You're not just telling me how embarrassed Pan Chi was, right?

167
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,240
You want to tell me to be more understanding of Governor Mo

168
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,200
intervening in the case and being eager to close the case.

169
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,940
His view is destined not to be the same as us,

170
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,780
who are solely pursuing the truth of the case.

171
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:03,600
You want to tell me to pay more attention to the situation of Governor Mo,

172
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,260
and to not doubt that he has a heart for the people.

173
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,400
I want to tell you...

174
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,620
that people are complicated.

175
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,900
Don't jump to conclusions that quickly.

176
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,430
Shen Du.

177
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,540
Shen Du.

178
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,520
How much do you trust Mo Qianzhi?

179
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,500
He was the person I trusted the most.

180
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,120
And now?

181
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,752
Nowâ€¦

182
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,052
Nowâ€¦

183
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,840
he's the one I want to trust the most.

184
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,590
 Anyone who wants to find out the truth 

185
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:07,980
 is bound to go through what you are going through now. 

186
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,180
 No matter how small the details are or how close the people are, 

187
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,690
 first of all, don't be afraid to doubt. 

188
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,240
  You have to verify them. 

189
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,840
 Trust may also be 

190
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,080
 a power for investigation. 

191
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,400
 The Huo'e Sect is deeply rooted in Yingzhou. 

192
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,080
 Shen has a close relationship with Mo. 

193
00:14:43,032 --> 00:14:44,320
   

194
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,740
 - Leave, leave, leave! 
 - Just one more look! 

195
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,940
 -Stop talking, stop talking! Leave! 
 - Just take one more look! 

196
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,840
 Hurry up, leave! 

197
00:14:58,468 --> 00:15:00,539
   

198
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,020
Owner, another pot of wine, please.

199
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,596
All right.

200
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,900
Yan Xing, what are you doing here?

201
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,856
What are you doing here?

202
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:55,780
 Take a look! Esteemed guest, take a look! 

203
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,430
 Take a look! All are the latest styles. 

204
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,620
Sixth Miss, what are you doing here?

205
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,700
Iâ€¦ am here to walk a pigeon.

206
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,720
Walk a pigeon?

207
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,740
Sixth Miss,

208
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:22,040
do you know the specialty of this shop is roast baby pigeon?

209
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,340
But then again,

210
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,180
don't you think you're being cruel to the pigeon?

211
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:42,480
Making it witness with its own eyes its own inevitable fate.

212
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,660
This bowl is a toast to this poor pigeon.

213
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:03,400
Are you drowning your sorrows in liquor here because Ji Dafu said you were incapable

214
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,960
this afternoon?

215
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,999
Indeed, good news stays within, but bad news spreads far and wide.

216
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:15,200
In my eyes, Ji Dafu is nothing.

217
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,440
His words can't even reach my ears.

218
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,319
Then because the case is closed?

219
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,820
I heard you've received new testimony on the bride case. Any discoveries?

220
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Discoveries?

221
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,160
There's nothing new to find. Just some useless testimony.

222
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,500
However, to collect the evidence,

223
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,620
I went to the cell to see Xu Jize.

224
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:45,920
After asking him, when I was about to leave, he suddenly said to meâ€¦

225
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,700
 Young Master Pan, you must be a scholar from a humble background. Right? 

226
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,780
 With your courage and eloquence, you're not serving as an official in the Ministry of Justice, 

227
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,440
 instead, you're doing this menial job, as a folk detective. 

228
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,660
 I'll take a wild guess. 

229
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:05,780
 You and I are of the same kind, burdened by a humble background. 

230
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,489
   

231
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,920
 Please don't shut the gate. My poems and essays were submitted to you for over a month. 

232
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,780
 I wonder if Elder Huang has had a chance to review them. 

233
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:26,040
 What a lowly person! With that pitiful appearance, and still hoping for our master to recommend him. 

234
00:18:34,102 --> 00:18:37,612
   

235
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,180
 We are not on the same path. 

236
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:47,300
 Even if I have many grievances, I wouldn't resort to venting my frustrations on the weak. 

237
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,120
 The weak? No. 

238
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,000
 I never bully the weak. 

239
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,920
 I bully those noble classes 

240
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,760
 who always oppress and insult people from humble backgrounds. 

241
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,020
 They are born to rise to high-ranking officials, 

242
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:06,040
 treating us from humble backgrounds as their slaves. 

243
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,160
 That's true that I laid hands on their brides. 

244
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,350
 I just wanted them to feel humiliated. 

245
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:19,860
 Over a hundred years, people from humble backgrounds 

246
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,880
 have been suffering from this humiliation every single day. 

247
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:30,500
 Now, do you still not think you are wrong? 

248
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,420
 Yes. 

249
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:42,000
 In the Miss Du case, I made an oversight. 

250
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,640
 The so-called oversight, 

251
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,620
 you mean you only found out that the Li family wasn't even a noble class 

252
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,480
 at the beginning of the crime. Right? 

253
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,640
 Indeed, you are a top detective. 

254
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,860
 After Miss Du was kidnapped, 

255
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:57,100
 Er Laipi said the Li family was wealthy. 

256
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:02,300
 Li Hongfa first made his fortune by doing small business. 

257
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,160
 But he was determined to have his son enter the officialdom. 

258
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,140
 Because he was just a merchant,  
  (Merchants were classified in the lowest rank of traditional Chinese social hierarchy: scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants.) 

259
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,580
 so Li Zimo was the same as me. 

260
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,280
 Later, Li Hongfa spent a lot of money 

261
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:20,080
 to fabricate an identity as a descendant of the gentry. 

262
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,980
 After that, Li Zimo could be eligible to take the examination. 

263
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,360
 So you decided to stop committing the crime, 

264
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,260
 and then started arguing with Er Laipi. 

265
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,100
 Yes. We had a pretty fierce argument. 

266
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,020
 Later on, we stopped because we might be followed. 

267
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:37,720
 But from beginning to end, I'd been meaning to send Miss Du back. 

268
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,960
 But a murder had happened. 

269
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,320
 I really did not kill Er Laipi. 

270
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,380
 I almost returned Du Xiaowan unscathed. 

271
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,600
 I will report exactly what you said today, as a reference for sentencing. 

272
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,800
 According to the law, it does get you a little lighter sentence. 

273
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,640
 But in my heart, you are a true coward. 

274
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,000
 When the brave are angry, they would go against the strong. 

275
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,360
 When the cowards are angry, they would go against the weak. 

276
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,320
 You dared not touch those who are powerful and truly oppress you, 

277
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,800
 yet you laid a hand on those weak women. 

278
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,660
 This is not revenge. 

279
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:18,560
 You're nothing but a coward who's afraid of the strong. 

280
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,580
 My sentence has been settled. 

281
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,320
 I will surely die. 

282
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,180
 You've just arrived in Yingzhou. You don't understand Governor Mo. 

283
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:38,200
 From the day that I got caught, I had no intention of getting out of here alive. 

284
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,160
 You're right. I deserve it. I brought this upon myself. 

285
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,880
 No. I should never have been born. 

286
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,320
 In my next life, 

287
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,520
 I'd rather be an illiterate farmer, 

288
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,980
 than be... 

289
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:10,340
 a scholar who appears to understand but really doesn't. 

290
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,360
Stop drinking.

291
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,600
Owner, don't serve him any more wine.

292
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,800
Get him a bowl of mutton soup noodles.

293
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,744
All right.

294
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,160
Here, enjoy.

295
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,320
The mutton from the Gannandao is really delicious. Trust me.

296
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,220
Instead of drowning your sorrows in liquor, it's better to soothe them with a bowl of noodle soup.

297
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,968
Give it a try.

298
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,140
- How is it? 
 - It tastes really good.

299
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,820
See? I didn't lie to you.

300
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,560
Laughing heartily under the open sky.

301
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,840
Striding high across the divine land.

302
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,280
Though the noble prize themselves,

303
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,580
I regard them as mere dust.

304
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:48,940
Though the lowly demean themselves, who says they aren't important.

305
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,740
 Flapping my gown, I gaze at the mountains. 

306
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,660
Washing my feet in the long river.

307
00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:00,240
Sixth Miss, why are you suddenly saying this?

308
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,020
I just think that this poem is grand,

309
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,000
revealing with just a few words the reality of oppression against those from humble backgrounds.

310
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,480
It's so exhilarating.

311
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,800
Once this poem was released, it spread through the teahouses and taverns of the Imperial City.

312
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,500
And even at that time,

313
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,500
when those young noble classes of Xiang'an City went out to eat,

314
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:23,360
they didn't dare to show off, fearing they'd stir up anger from the commoners.

315
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,720
You've said so much.

316
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,720
You don't just want to praise my literary talent. Right?

317
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,920
Of course not.

318
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,920
More than this.

319
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,180
I admire your courage.

320
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:39,200
As long as one always has the courage to confront rotten authority,

321
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,880
sometimes a single phrase or even a poem, can hold great power.

322
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,700
I know. You are disappointed by the situation

323
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,400
those from humble backgrounds are facing in Great Cang.

324
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,360
But as long as none of us gives up,

325
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,570
I believe there will always be one day when those talents

326
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:58,840
who are from humble background will be valued.

327
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,020
I wonder if this bowl of noodles is delicious,

328
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:15,400
or if it's your words, that havemotivated me.

329
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,720
I feel refreshed right now, and can investigate ten more cases.

330
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,280
No, no. We can't get more cases in Gannandao.

331
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,700
I have no time to rest now.

332
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,380
I can't hold on with more cases.

333
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,440
There's something I want to tell you.

334
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,920
If you are abused, don't tolerate it.

335
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,480
People say no one can escape the White Ghost.

336
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,380
In my opinion, Shen Du is just a paper tiger.

337
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:53,820
If you want to, I will definitely face any danger for you, helping you escape from your suffering.

338
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,660
Have you misunderstood something?

339
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,260
No one has abused me.

340
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,880
No one has abused you?

341
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,600
How did you get the wound on your forehead?

342
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,980
Whenever I see you, you'll have a new wound and an old one.

343
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,680
Didn't you get that wound at the Shen Mansion?

344
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:15,480
Indeed, I got this wound at the Shen Mansion.

345
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,600
How should I put it?

346
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,440
Anyway, Shen Du really hasn't abused me.

347
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,570
I married into the Shen Mansion as a substitute bride, it's somewhat absurd,

348
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,940
and not what he wanted,

349
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:46,240
but overall, Shen Du is a decent husband.

350
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,440
He takes good care of me and my family.

351
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:56,980
Moreover, I will leave him sooner or later.

352
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,200
Whether it's Shen Du or me,

353
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,600
both are well aware that this day will soon arrive.

354
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,088
Why?

355
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,500
Because he has someone in his heart, and that is not me.

356
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,880
This position was never meant to be mine.

357
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,140
Madam, Governor Mo knows you are busy with official duties,

358
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,200
and has specially invited you to cometo the most famous hot springs in Yingzhou,

359
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,560
Yixi Hot Spring, for rest and relaxation.

360
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:52,080
Madam, the Yixi Hot Spring is no less than the royal Li Mountain Hot Spring.

361
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,340
It is the water of a thousand years from Xiling Mountain, accompanied by natural geothermal heat.

362
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,260
Dozens of spices are added to the hot spring.

363
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,520
For men, it can warm the kidneys and boost yang; for women, it can enhance beauty and nourish the complexion.

364
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,580
The efficacy is well known.

365
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,940
Around the Gannandao, couples wishing for children

366
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,020
will come to this hot spring to soak.

367
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,940
Thank you for the introduction.

368
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:17,240
You have worked hard guiding me all the way. Please go rest.

369
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,720
No, no. I haven't assisted you with the gauze clothes.

370
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,228
Who is it?

371
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,584
It's me.

372
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,380
Why are you here?

373
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,592
Well,

374
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,260
to take a soak.

375
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,380
This is for women.

376
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,480
You should soak somewhere else.

377
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,320
There's only one Yixi Hot Spring. It's for both men and women.

378
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,060
Besides, Yingzhou Prefecture arranged for us to soak together.

379
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:14,240
If we were to separate, it would be strange.

380
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,260
- What would those outside think? 
 - Those outside?

381
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:20,260
Outside, there are a few maids and servants.

382
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:25,240
Even if it's just for show, I still have to soak with you.

383
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,220
I'm coming down.

384
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,600
Wait! Wait! Don't come down yet.

385
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,680
Turn your back, and close your eyes.

386
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,240
Are you too shy to soak with me?

387
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,540
No way.

388
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:20,160
I was afraid you'd be coy and make me feel awkward.

389
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,260
All right, you can open your eyes now.

390
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,208
Come down now.

391
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,880
Now I can't see anything.

392
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,980
Where should I come down from?

393
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,040
 Oh no. He can't see things in the dark. 

394
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,120
 I should have left one light for him until he came down. 

395
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,720
Just wait. Let me help you.

396
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,800
You said there was always someone in my heart.

397
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,500
Who is that person?

398
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,800
 Mo Xiuxiu. 

399
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,900
 No way. 

400
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,700
 That would expose me to eavesdropping on him and Mo Qianzhi. 

401
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,900
Shen Du, why would you eavesdrop on me?

402
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,400
Can't you ask openly?

403
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,200
I am asking now.

404
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,500
Do you dare to answer?

405
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,800
Of course I dare.

406
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,800
I've heard you don't get close to women.

407
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,200
I deeply agree with this.

408
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,600
In the Shen Mansion, not to mention the concubines,

409
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,900
even maids are few.

410
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:08,000
And you always look down on me.

411
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,600
Doesn't that explain it?

412
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,100
I don't get close to women

413
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,800
because I already have a girl I like in my heart.

414
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,560
Then I've misunderstood.

415
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,030
I met her...

416
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,200
when we were little.

417
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,900
I have kept her wicker piglet till now.

418
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,700
Because of her,

419
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,000
I could survive in the detention center.

420
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,400
 It's her. 

421
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,500
 Thanks to Mo Xiuxiu's brother pleading for him, 

422
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,000
 so he was spared the death penalty 

423
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,200
 and sent to the detention center. 

424
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,960
Every night,

425
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,240
she would sneak into the back garden...

426
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,600
and bring me comfort and food.

427
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,090
In those dark days,

428
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,900
that's the light I waited for every night.

429
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,000
I don't even know her name,

430
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,280
nor have I ever clearly seen her face.

431
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,400
And the only gift I gave her...

432
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,400
was a brass whistle.

433
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:11,320
 This whistle was given to me by my father. 

434
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,500
I remember she told me,

435
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:41,200
one day, she'll take me out with honor and integrity.

436
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,300
 One day, I will overturn the case for the Shen family 

437
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,300
 and take you out with honor and integrity. 

438
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,120
I didn't see her again...

439
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,600
for years.

440
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,400
It's like she just disappeared.

441
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,100
Until one day,

442
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,200
just as if it were fated,

443
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,200
she became my wife.

444
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:29,500
â™«  The night is still long and the moonlight shines in the west window  â™«

445
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,700
But the funny thing...

446
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,400
is I that had no idea she was the girl in my heart.

447
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,840
Later on, I found it out.

448
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,680
I hope it's not too late.

449
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,600
I want to tell her.

450
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,900
In my heart, from beginning to end,

451
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,700
it's always been her.

452
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:23,800
â™«  Every memory is unforgettable  â™«

453
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,100
â™«  Written from desolation into poetry  â™«

454
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:34,500
â™«  Watching the past, through the misty rain, until the clear skies  â™«

455
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:40,000
â™«  Love ripples in each other's eyes  â™«

456
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,100
â™«  You'd melted the frost in my heart long ago  â™«

457
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:49,500
â™«  Words can't express how much I love you  â™«

458
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:55,200
â™«  Day by day, we probe and test  â™«

459
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:01,100
â™«  If we are not careful, we will end up at the end of the world  â™«

460
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,900
â™«  I want to be with you, shadows become a pair  â™«

461
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,800
â™«  I want to hold you, staying by my side  â™«

462
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,800
â™«  Passing through the obstruction of a storm  â™«

463
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,600
â™«  I want to be your moonlight  â™«

464
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,400
â™«  To accompany you to every dawn  â™«

465
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:25,100
â™«  How I wish I could just forget the length of time  â™«

466
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,800
â™«  I want to be with you, shadows become a pair  â™«

467
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,800
â™«  I want to be with you, never forgetting each other  â™«

468
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,900
â™«  There is always a place where the clouds and the sea meet  â™«

469
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,600
â™«  I want to accompany you forever  â™«

470
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,500
â™«  I will wait until my black hair turns grey  â™«

471
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:51,200
â™«  In this life, I will only keep you in my heart  â™«

00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,400
- Iâ€¦ 
 - Youâ€¦

473
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,600
- Youâ€¦ 
 - Iâ€¦

474
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,400
You go first.

475
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:31,900
How did you know that I made that wicker piglet?

476
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,900
You've hesitated for so long on the way,

477
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,000
just to ask this?

478
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,300
I've known from the start that it wasn't made by Xiuxiu.

479
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,800
 You're amazing. 

480
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,300
 I want to make one for Brother Du as a birthday gift, too. 

481
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,600
 But no matter how, I made it so ugly.  

482
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,900
 Can you switch with me? 

483
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,100
 Okay, take it. 

484
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,100
 Thank you, you are so kind. 

485
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:38,000
    
 On the day of my birthday, I got the wicker piglet.

486
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I wanted to thank you,

487
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,700
but then I learned you had been taken away by your family.

488
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:52,800
I was so happy that my father didn't abandon me.

489
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,000
He arrived a little late from a business trip.

490
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I didn't notice anything else.

491
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,000
Unexpectedly,

492
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,640
you'd kept the wicker piglet all along.

493
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,140
Later on,

494
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,300
the Shen family got confiscated.

495
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:18,500
This wicker piglet became one of the few things that I could keep.

496
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,040
So I've kept it all along.

497
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,200
It also reminds me of those good old days

498
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,700
when my father taught me how to weave rattan.

499
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,000
Until recently, I only learned that

500
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,600
this Sixth Miss is Sixth Miss Yan.

501
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Detention center.

502
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,560
You said you would come for me.

503
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,560
Why didn't you come later?

504
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,200
Becauseâ€¦

505
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,300
I crawled in through the dog hole in the back garden.

506
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:20,200
Later, they discovered this hole and blocked it.

507
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,600
And laterâ€¦

508
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,820
You didn't need me to come for you.

509
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,400
Thank you.

510
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,300
You still came to take me home.

511
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:10,000
