00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,980
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,026
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:35,026 --> 00:00:38,224
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,224 --> 00:00:40,693
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,693 --> 00:00:44,568
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,568 --> 00:00:47,603
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,603 --> 00:00:50,868
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,868 --> 00:00:55,904
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,904 --> 00:01:02,176
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,176 --> 00:01:08,484
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,484 --> 00:01:14,763
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,763 --> 00:01:21,076
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,076 --> 00:01:29,120
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:37,154
   

16
00:01:37,154 --> 00:01:40,210
   

17
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,000
   
 Princess of Valor is here. 

18
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,936
Mother Empress.

19
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,600
Mother Empress.

20
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,600
I'm here to sue Prime Minister Zhang Xingwei

21
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,020
for courting scholars from humble backgrounds while supervising the exam

22
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,360
and attempting to murder those who refuse to comply.

23
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,080
Many scholars from humble backgrounds went missing today.

24
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,200
Grand Empress Dowager, I have been wronged.

25
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,880
I was simply concerned about those scholars who were exhausted from the journey,

26
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,600
and fearing they may not be properly cared for before the exam.

27
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,360
Therefore, I instructed the young nobles to treat them well.

28
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,400
How could the princess frame me like that?

29
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,720
Then tell me.

30
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:23,120
Where are those scholars from humble backgrounds who left the banquet early?

31
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,000
Grand Empress Dowager,

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,320
Prime Minister Zhang, as the head of the civil officials, has always cherished talent.

33
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,040
He may have tried to court them,

34
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,800
but I'm afraid he couldn't have

35
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,200
"silenced" anyone without any assistance.

36
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,020
Vice Minister Lai, what are you implying?

37
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,000
Do not talk nonsense.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,580
Yong'an, it's a serious matter.

39
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,240
You can't speak recklessly.

40
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,840
Do you have evidence?

41
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,440
- Iâ€” 
 - I do.

42
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,040
Several scholars were attacked last night

43
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,480
and were saved by the Imperial Guards.

44
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,200
The confiscated weapons resemble thoseâ€¦

45
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,560
of Prince Xian's guards.

46
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,440
Mother Empress, I have absolutely nothing to do with this. I beg you to look into it.

47
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,440
The assassins confessed before they died

48
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,140
that they were instigated by Prince Xian.

49
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,620
Great Chief Shen, you can't just slander someone.

50
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,600
When did you join hands with the Princess of Valor?

51
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,400
Prime Minister Zhang, stop trying to argue deceitfully!

52
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,200
With solid evidence here,

53
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,640
how can you and Prince Xian continue to oversee the Hongwen School examination?

54
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,040
- You'd better confess now. 
 - The culprits shall be arrested,

55
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,700
but not Prime Minister Zhang or Prince Xian.

56
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,320
Minister Shen,

57
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,760
you saved the scholars and you brought evidence.

58
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,240
So why are you now saying that there is someone else behind this?

59
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,399
There are three groups of assailants in total.

60
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,760
The first group only intended to kidnap

61
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,840
and intimidate the scholars to establish authority.

62
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,840
These people work for Prime Minister Zhang.

63
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,560
Iâ€¦

64
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,720
The second group was ruthless yet they used the weapons of Prince Xian's guards.

65
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,080
And they kept mentioning Prince Xian to make sure the victims knew.

66
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,460
 - And who are you? 
 - Prince Xian is wise. 

67
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,300
 You insignificant scholars can't be courted. 

68
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,400
 You shall perish! 

69
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,000
The third group lying in ambush was determined to kill the scholars.

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,840
They used the hidden weapons of Prince Xian's guards on purpose.

71
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,400
How's that possible?

72
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,920
If Prince Xian were behind all this,

73
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,720
why would he make it so obvious?

74
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,640
Grand Empress Dowager, isn't it self-contradictory?

75
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,080
It seems that many groups of people

76
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,600
are eager to put me away, Mother Empress.

77
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,120
Please look into it, Mother Empress.

78
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,960
Since the evidence is questionable,

79
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,920
I'll entrust the Imperial Guards to carry on with the investigation.

80
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,800
I accept the imperial decree.

81
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,320
Fortunately, these scholars

82
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,560
from humble backgrounds received protection from Minister Shen.

83
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,280
I want no more problems from now on.

84
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,580
Prince Xian. Prime Minister Zhang.

85
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,980
You'll be in charge of those scholar's safety.

86
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,160
If anything happens from now on, you'll be held accountable.

87
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,520
Your son will obey.

88
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,440
Grand Empress Dowager, please rest assured.

89
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,400
I swear I will keep those scholars safe

90
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,360
even at the cost of my life.

91
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,496
Great Chief.

92
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,120
Great Chief.

93
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,240
Thank you for your help today.

94
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,080
I was merely doing my job without any bias.

95
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,340
You don't have to thank me.

96
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,156
Prime Minister Zhang.

97
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,080
Why bother thanking him?

98
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,380
He was simply trying to impress the Grand Empress Dowager.

99
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,520
You're much better at keeping a low profile.

100
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,400
But those who keep lurking in the dark...

101
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,240
may get themselves into trouble.

102
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,640
- Cheers! 
  - Cheers!

103
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,160
Sixth Miss must pay for this meal.

104
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,520
You know, you didn't see it.

105
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,360
Earlier today, when Director Wu

106
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,520
heard that Sixth Miss obtained the right to investigate the case of Chen Huo'e,

107
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,660
his face turned redder than a pig's liver.

108
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,200
And you know what?

109
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,840
He told us to sever our ties with Sixth Miss.

110
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,120
He may be my superior, but can he dictate who I drink with?

111
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,580
Sixth Miss, if you need any inspectors on this case, come to me anytime.

112
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,840
Come on. I toast to you.

113
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,520
- And me. 
 - And me.

114
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,240
Come on, cheers!

115
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,768
Cheers!

116
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,200
Right, Sixth Miss, I want to ask you something.

117
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,840
Do you know how to remove birthmarks?

118
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,680
Birthmarks?

119
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,260
Since when do you have a birthmark?

120
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,660
I-I have a friend

121
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,699
who asked me about how to remove a birthmark.

122
00:08:33,699 --> 00:08:36,280
I read many medical books but found nothing.

123
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,919
That's why I'm asking you.

124
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,520
Birthmarks are innate.

125
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,960
If not a medical condition,

126
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,160
they are difficult to remove with just herbal medicine.

127
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,760
I did hear from some friends about a method to remove birthmarks.

128
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,880
What is it, Marshal Xu?

129
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,400
It sounds a bit bizarre.

130
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:01,800
Rub the birthmark repeatedly with a ring made of pure gold.

131
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,600
Well, that's simple.

132
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,800
I have plenty of gold.

133
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,480
- Thank you, Marshal Xu. 
 - No problem.

134
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,600
Waiter. Waiter!

135
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,200
No one's around. I'll go.

136
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,800
Waiter, a pot of wine, please.

137
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,200
Has Chuichui made any friends with birthmarks these days?

138
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,560
Sixth Miss!

139
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,800
Sixth Miss, listen.

140
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,040
There are some drunkards over there.

141
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,120
One of them is quite good-looking.

142
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,520
Some time ago, he visited the Ministry of Justice to see you.

143
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,450
Looked for me?

144
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,560
That's him.

145
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,230
That one.

146
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,120
The one in the middle.

147
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,830
Pan?

148
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,220
Pan.

149
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,100
Young Master Pan, with the selection for the Hongwen School approaching,

150
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,680
didnâ€™t you say you wanted to bring honor to the students from humble backgrounds?

151
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,040
Why aren't you preparing for the exam and are instead drowning yourself in sorrow here?

152
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,560
Family backgrounds don't matter?

153
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,980
Clearly, human effort cannot overcome the will of heaven.

154
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,340
 Weapons of Prince Xian's guards. 

155
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:20,500
 Prince Xian sent three groups of people to deal with us humble scholars. 

156
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,680
 This is just the beginning. 

157
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,360
 This examination isn't as simple as you think. 

158
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,060
 A word of advice to you all. 

159
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,540
 Don't cling on to someone for easy success. 

160
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,280
 Xiang'an is a dangerous pond of muddy water that you can't handle. 

161
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,200
 Xiang'an ended up like a muddy pond 

162
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,000
 because of you people who seek power by sinister means. 

163
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,700
 What's wrong with seeking power? 

164
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,960
 There's nothing wrong with power, 

165
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,520
 but the way it's used. 

166
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,480
 With power, 

167
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,100
 people can protect those they wish to protect 

168
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,820
 and do what they believe is right. 

169
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,800
 Those who are nothing but self-righteous, 

170
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:17,120
 can't achieve anything apart from winning a few quarrels. 

171
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:24,120
 Save your energy for something meaningful. 

172
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,680
Better to drink. Better to drink.

173
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:58,200
   

174
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,540
Take them to the Ghost Market. Thank you.

175
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,180
Clerk Yan, enjoy life to the fullest.

176
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,720
Keep drinking! Keep drinking!

177
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,528
Be careful!

178
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:21,420
The exam is coming up soon. Why is he drowning himself in sorrow?

179
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:26,060
Don't you know? Three gangs of villains attempted to kill those scholars.

180
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,300
- For real? 
 - Yes.

181
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,680
What happened in the end?

182
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,470
Didn't Great Chief Shen tell you?

183
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,980
He turned the tide alone and saved them all.

184
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,660
Otherwise, it'd have been a disaster.

185
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,900
Shen Du saved them?

186
00:12:52,444 --> 00:12:55,220
   

187
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,820
 Send this letter to the Ministry of Justice. Thanks! 

188
00:13:05,398 --> 00:13:07,440
   

189
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:14,200
 Madam Official, I am looking for Clerk Yan of the Ministry of Justice. 

190
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,340
 She's not in. She must be working on a case with the White Ghost. 

191
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,480
 White Ghost? 

192
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,380
 Great Chief Shen Du of the Imperial Guards? 

193
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,200
 He is Sixth Miss' husband. 

194
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,840
 - Husband?  
 - I heard that Madam Shen got beaten again today. 

195
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,860
 She came out limping. 

196
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,060
 Yes, her forehead was so swollen. 

197
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,320
 Married to White Ghost. What do you expect? 

198
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,340
   
 Sixth Miss, we have been pen pals for ages. 

199
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,180
 You got married, so I shouldn't disrupt you. 

200
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:50,420
 But how can I sit back and do nothing while you're married to that notorious White Ghost? 

201
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:14,500
- Madam. 
 - Butler Shen.

202
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,420
- Madam. 
 - What happened?

203
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,810
Great Chief has been practicing fists since he came home

204
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,820
and hasn't had dinner.

205
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,040
Madam, you're finally home. Please go to the backyard.

206
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,360
The Great Chief has been waiting to have snacks with you every day.

207
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,240
But you were either working or drinking with a bunch of random people.

208
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,400
He has waited for you for hours again today, soâ€¦

209
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,880
He's waiting for me?

210
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,980
I thought he'd be busy with work.

211
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,484
Serve the dishes.

212
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,232
Impressive!

213
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,760
Someone's finally home.

214
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,560
Me?

215
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,740
I went to work with the Imperial Guards, inspected Chen Shoujie's mansion,

216
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:37,100
drank with Chuichui and Brother Xu, and ran into the merchant Pan.

217
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,780
That's why I'm home late.

218
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,480
Do you need something from me?

219
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:53,400
- I'm hungry. 
 - Why didn't you eat?

220
00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:00,400
Right! I've come back to tell you that I promised my mother to visit her tonight.

221
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,420
Enjoy your dinner. See you around.

222
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,580
Youâ€¦

223
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,580
Dinner is ready.

224
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,320
Why bother with meals? This family will fall apart without me.

225
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,160
Uncle Zhong, do your things. I'll take the Great Chief there.

226
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,280
Great Chief, Madam is not some illiterate peasant.

227
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,620
She works for the Ministry of Justice as a clerk. She solves cases all day long.

228
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:31,180
She can have a drink with her colleagues. You're somewhat making a fuss about it.

229
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,120
I'm just trying to say that...

230
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,780
you should take this opportunityâ€¦

231
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:12,740
Mother, I really can't drink anymore.

232
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,959
This is the best tonic I picked for you and just for you.

233
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:20,100
What a pity that my son-in-law didn't come.

234
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:24,019
Otherwise, he can have some, too. Then you'll have children soon.

235
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:26,839
Mother, what are you talking about?

236
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,780
It doesn't have something weird. Right?

237
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,200
No, no. I wish there was something.

238
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,980
Too bad I don't have the magic Chen Huo'e possesses.

239
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:40,060
Otherwise, I would get you some magic pills that bring people back to life.

240
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:44,260
Mother, what did you say? How do you know about Chen Huo'e?

241
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:49,760
Are you kidding? Throughout Xiang'an, can you find someone who doesn't know her?

242
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,340
Five years ago, she killed herself in the street.

243
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,620
But now, she has come back to life.

244
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:01,680
She fought her way back, passing all the monsters and demons, from the underworld.

245
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,020
She has extraordinary power.

246
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,480
Mother, where did you hear all that nonsense?

247
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,100
I heard it from First Madame.

248
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,440
Even if you don't believe me, don't you believe First Madame?

249
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,170
All the nobles of Xiang'an are saying

250
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:23,160
that this woman has the power to brave the gates of the underworld.

251
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,180
Even the soul collectors can't do anything to her.

252
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,960
Mother, you smell so good. What rouge did you use today?

253
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,700
Want to know?

254
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,300
Want some?

255
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,400
Drink some more.

256
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:03,980
Sixth Miss, thanks to you, Caiwei managed to return safely.

257
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,280
You rarely come home. Master asked the kitchen to prepare snacks for you.

258
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,860
Do have more. Eat more.

259
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:17,680
Sixth Miss, there are rumors about you and the Great Chief.

260
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,680
If you ever feel mistreated, you must tell us.

261
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,980
That's right.

262
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,460
 The Great Chief has arrived. 

263
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,320
Who is he arresting again?

264
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,940
 This way, please. 

265
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,760
Hurry! Hide in the back room!

266
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,140
Hurry!

267
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,880
Stop acting like he's a demon. The Great Chief doesn't bite.

268
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:43,040
Mojie, after you were arrested by the White Ghost, you came home totally changed.

269
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,080
- And you're even defending him? 
 - Of course. I amâ€¦

270
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,110
I amâ€¦

271
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,560
It's a secret.

272
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,936
Great Chief.

273
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,640
I've come at the right moment,

274
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,780
just in time to enjoy some late-night snacks with my wife and in-laws.

275
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,480
That's right.

276
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,000
Why did you come today?

277
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,600
Great Chief, please take a seat.

278
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:56,180
While you're away, food tastes bland to me.

279
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,260
- Here. 
 - Thank you, Great Chief! Thank you, Great Chief!

280
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,168
Wife.

281
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,624
Here.

282
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,240
Thank you!

283
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,440
That's enough!

284
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,656
Here.

285
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,680
Enjoy your meal!

286
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,540
These are not as good as your cooking.

287
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,280
But at least, you grew up to this taste.

288
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,100
What are you waiting for? Sit down and eat.

289
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,052
All right.

290
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,460
I want to chat with my sister a bit more.

291
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,060
How about you go home first?

292
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,120
All right then.

293
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:27,280
Take your time. I will wait for you. No rush.

294
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,100
 Shen Du, what do you want? 

295
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:47,100
Great Chief, I've been providing you with tips in time. Right?

296
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,680
The moment I noticed how impudent those scholars were,

297
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:54,160
I knew Prime Minister Zhang would go after them.

298
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,820
No wonder you're Sixth Miss' brother.

299
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,220
You're truly clever.

300
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:03,500
T-Thank you for your recognition!

301
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:10,580
Once I pass this examination, I'll count on you to promote meâ€”

302
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,160
Great Chief, my son is talking nonsense.

303
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:19,400
Please don't take offense. Please don't!

304
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,470
 So he did save those scholars. 

305
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,180
Great Chief, please come in. Since you're free,

306
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:45,200
I'd like to show you my paintings over the years.

307
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,080
You're known as an expert in calligraphy and paintings.

308
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,000
What an honor to admire your work.

309
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,440
I didn't expect that you'd collect so many artworks.

310
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:12,960
Isn't the original copy of this calligraphy work in the palace?

311
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:18,160
What discerning eyes you have, Great Chief.

312
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,280
The original of this work is in the palace, of course.

313
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,840
It's merely my imitation work.

314
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,140
To be honest, all the works of masters in this room

315
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,780
are but imitations completed by me.

316
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,940
They look so authentic.

317
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:45,820
I didn't expect that you could capture the essence of all the calligraphy styles.

318
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,920
Great Chief, you flatter me.

319
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,740
I have no other talent.

320
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:56,700
And I barely come out on top in terms of artwork imitation.

321
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,460
Madam said that you're showing our son-inâ€¦

322
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,840
our Great Chief the artworks of yours.

323
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:10,180
It reminded me that you have once imitated Elder Shen's manuscript.

324
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:13,376
So I found them for you.

325
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:16,832
   

326
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,816
My father?

327
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,340
Please forgive me!

328
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,900
I bearâ€¦ I bear no other intentions.

329
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,260
It's justâ€¦

330
00:26:51,781 --> 00:26:55,092
   

331
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,716
It's fine.

332
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,240
My father was a convict.

333
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,140
No one would wish to associate with him.

334
00:27:14,501 --> 00:27:19,190
   

335
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:26,036
   

336
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:36,100
Actually, I had studied your father's calligraphy wholeheartedly back then.

337
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:41,440
When Elder Shen was young, his handwriting was as sharp as a sword.

338
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,880
But later on, his strokes became reserved, smooth, and round.

339
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:53,700
It took me a lot of practice to achieve identical handwriting.

340
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:59,403
   

341
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,760
   

342
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,668
 Could it beâ€¦ 

343
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,500
I haven't seen something so similar to my father's handwriting.

344
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,240
I was lost in thought. My apologies.

345
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,660
Not at all.

346
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:38,160
I have work to attend to. I will take my leave now.

347
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,980
All right.

348
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,580
You are really busy.

349
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,580
Please stay.

350
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,860
Great Chief, take care.

351
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,120
Look at you!

352
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:02,240
Prime Minister Zhang said that Shen Du freed himself by confessing on behalf of his father.

353
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,420
Why did you have to bring it up?

354
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:08,940
How would I know?

355
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,580
 Father, you write so well. May I have this? 

356
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:32,720
 Ever since my arm got injured some years ago, 

357
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,040
 my strokes have lost strength. 

358
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:39,100
 I'll give you a fan I've written on before the injury. 

359
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,940
   

360
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,240
 Smooth and rounded. Sharp like a sword. 

361
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,380
 Indeed, the fonts are different. 

362
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:11,180
 Could it be Sixth Miss' father who forged the letter to frame my father? 

363
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,680
Why hasn't he come yet?

364
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,600
   

365
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,800
Masked Man! Masked Man!

366
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,000
Masked Man, you're finally here!

367
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,600
You're visiting your mother again?

368
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,400
I'm waiting for you.

369
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,000
For me?

370
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,800
It's for you.

371
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,400
This isâ€¦

372
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:25,100
I learned about a folk remedy that can remove birthmarks.

373
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:29,800
It is said that you can remove birthmarks by rubbing them with this.

374
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,700
Give it a try.

375
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,200
You came just to give me this?

376
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,000
What if I didn't come today?

377
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,400
Then I'd come again tomorrow.

378
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,200
Anyway, my mother would be thrilled to have me here.

379
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
Let me show you.

380
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,600
Give me your hand.

381
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,680
Like this.

382
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:16,000
Rub it back and forth on the birthmark.

383
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,600
Not too lightly or too harshly.

384
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,500
Got it?

385
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,840
Here you go. Take it.

386
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,300
Anyway, you must keep doing it. Or it won't work.

387
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,300
We barely know each other.

388
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:31,000
Why are you giving me something so valuable?

389
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,400
It's not valuable.

390
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,100
I, Lu Chuichui, can have all the gold I want.

391
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,200
As long as you can remove your birthmark

392
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,400
and then take off the mask to face the world

393
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,200
with your true look,

394
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,200
it's more valuable than gold.

395
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,100
Thank you!

396
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,800
I've been wronged, My Lord!

397
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,400
I've been wronged! Please do me justice.

398
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,000
Someone's asking me to do her justice.

399
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,600
That's the first time.

400
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,700
How were you wronged?

401
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,400
    
 Many people at the Jinxiu Workshop died bearing injustice.

402
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,700
I beg you to look into it.

403
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,200
Boring. Get lost!

404
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,900
Great Chief, people call you the White Ghost,

405
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,600
because you catch culprits

406
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,700
and never leave someone wrongly accused.

407
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:16,800
If you don't agree to exonerate the innocent, I shall take my life here.

408
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,600
Madwoman. Probably an assassin!

409
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,000
My Lord, please vindicate the wrongly accused.

410
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,600
 Stop! 

411
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,500
Vice Minister Lai.

412
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,400
What did she do to get herself executed on the street?

413
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,200
This is the Zhuque Street in Xiang'an, the capital city.

414
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,800
The people are watching.

415
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,700
Surely you don't want to kill an innocent.

416
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,500
I'm merely executing an assassin.

417
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,200
Do you have to intervene, Great Chief Shen?

418
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,800
Great Chief?

419
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,000
So you are Great Chief Shen, the White Ghost.

420
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I am not an assassin. I was wronged.

421
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,200
Please do me justice and retry the case of the Jinxiu Workshop.

422
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:04,200
Vice Minister Lai, since this woman has been asking to see me, I'll take her with me.

423
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,200
Since you've asked for her,

424
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,700
feel free to take her away.

425
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,300
Great Chief, I've heard so much about how righteous and incorruptible you are.

426
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,700
My family in Jiangnan provides silk materials for the Jinxiu Workshop.

427
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,900
Here is the order they've placed.

428
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,000
The Eldest Princess's husband ordered purple chrysanthemums

429
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,600
which was against the regulation.

430
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,100
But the paper used for the order was thinner than usual.

431
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,400
If we can prove that this order was tampered with,

432
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,300
we can overturn the ruling, can't we?

433
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,900
I'll keep this. Go home first.

434
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,600
The Imperial Guards will contact your parents if needed.

435
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,700
But the owners of the workshop were good people. They must have been wronged.

436
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:53,600
Jing Lin, escort her out of the city.

437
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,000
 Help! 

438
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,400
Hurry, go after the villain. Don't let him get away.

439
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,000
He's gone.

440
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,200
Miss, are you all right?

441
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,700
Don't worry about me. Catch that villain.

442
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,500
I bet he's related to the Jinxiu Workshop case.

443
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,000
Or he wouldn't come to kill to silence me.

444
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,600
Brother Xu.

445
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,500
Sixth Miss.

446
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,000
Great Chief.

447
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,400
Miss Yun Que was attacked at the inn last night.

448
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,500
Thankfully, I happened to pass by on patrol and saved her.

449
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,700
Is this how you watch over your witnesses?

450
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,400
I sent her out of the city yesterday.

451
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,900
Why did she sneak back by herself?

452
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,000
Great Chief, I thought I wouldn't be able to see you again.

453
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,600
The assassin must have been trying to silence me, Great Chief.

454
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,100
You took my evidence, so you must take responsibility.

455
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,600
That order is the key evidence that could overturn the ruling.

456
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,420
I am a key witness. You can't neglect me.

457
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,700
I told you yesterday

458
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:54,200
that we can't overturn the case with an order from six years ago.

459
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,200
You caused a commotion on the streets,

460
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,400
telling the whole world that you are involved in this case.

461
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,600
Do you find it exciting and fun?

462
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:06,500
Do you not know that this case is complicated?

463
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,200
An assassin came last night.

464
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,000
Tomorrow, he could go after your entire family.

465
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,500
You're putting your family in danger just because you're passionate

466
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,000
about re-opening the case.

467
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,200
I didn't think that much. I apologize.

468
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,300
Anyway, we will reinforce the defense to keep you safe.

469
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,800
And I will send someone to look after your parents.

470
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,800
We will work on the case.

471
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,500
Before the truth comes out, do not act rashly again.

472
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,200
Thank you, Great Chief! I knew you wouldn't neglect me.

473
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,800
You have the order placed by the workshop.

474
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,100
What do you have to do with the workshop?

475
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,800
Didn't you hear what I just said?

476
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,000
I am just curious.

477
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,900
Who are you?

478
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,460
The evidence is for the Great Chief. Why should I tell you?

479
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,400
Show respect to the Great Chief's wife.

480
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,680
Great Chief, youâ€¦ you got married?

481
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:32,500
Isn't it said that all those who wish to marry you would die a sudden death?

482
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,000
How did it happen?

483
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I always thought that fate was leading you to wait for me.

00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,300
So all these years, I have been studying how to manage household affairs,

485
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,200
how to be a proper madam,

486
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,600
how to cook, keep accounts, and make the bed.

487
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,960
I even have dreams about marrying you.

488
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,200
Youâ€¦ You must be crazy.

489
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,000
Madam, it has nothing to do with us.

490
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,500
T-This woman cried injustice on the street.

491
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,200
So the Great Chief had her arrested.

492
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,200
What is there for me to misunderstand?

493
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,300
Most of the women in Xiang'an, if not all, admire the Great Chief.

494
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:24,300
It's normal. Besides, we areâ€¦

495
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:33,600
If you take a liking to someone, it might be good.

496
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,400
So you've made up your mind.

497
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,900
So what...

498
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,380
are your plans?

499
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I only found a piece of fabric from the Jinxiu Workshop at Chen Shoujie's mansion.

500
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,800
I need to confirm which year it was from.

501
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,700
Not your concern? Very good.

502
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:12,500
