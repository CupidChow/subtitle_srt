00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,910
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,956
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:34,956 --> 00:00:38,254
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,254 --> 00:00:40,623
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:44,398
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,398 --> 00:00:47,633
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:50,798
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,798 --> 00:00:55,834
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,834 --> 00:01:02,106
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,106 --> 00:01:08,414
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,414 --> 00:01:14,693
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,693 --> 00:01:21,106
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,106 --> 00:01:29,050
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:37,184
   

16
00:01:37,184 --> 00:01:40,210
   

17
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,724
   

18
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,800
Assistant Minister Zhang has arrived.

19
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,900
- Stand still. Don't move. 
 - Wait!

20
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,500
Stop! Let him go.

21
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,200
Trying to snatch someone in broad daylight?

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,840
How is this considered snatching?

23
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,920
I have sent someone to invite him over as a guest.

24
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,460
Princess of Valor. Since he is a guest, he should be free to come and go.

25
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,160
But it's obvious that he doesn't want to be a guest.

26
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,120
Just a personal matter.

27
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,480
I didn't expect it to get you to come.

28
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,680
I wonder what relationship you have with Young Master Han.

29
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,740
Your Highness overstates it. I am here under imperial orders to offer my regards to the Great Chief and his wife.

30
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,580
And I happened to hear Madam Shen mention it.

31
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,720
The Grand Empress Dowager has always valued you.

32
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,420
My actions are also for Your Highness's benefit.

33
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,040
I hope Your Highness will reconsider.

34
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,000
Since you have said so,

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,360
it would be inappropriate for me to insist on holding him here as a guest.

36
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,220
I shall take my leave.

37
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,300
Madam Shen, I have made it clear last time

38
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,540
that you might protect Young Master Han temporarily, but can you protect him for a lifetime?

39
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,810
   

40
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,840
Great Chief, someone has reported

41
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,920
that a number of moth-shaped jades suddenly appeared in the ruins of Jinxiu Workshop.

42
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,020
And familiar faces appeared. Very strange!

43
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,840
Let's go to Jinxiu Workshop.

44
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,200
   

45
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,680
 It's Manager Kong from Jinxiu Workshop! 

46
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,160
 But hasn't Mr. Kong already died? 

47
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,340
 Is it a person or a ghost? 

48
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,080
 Could it be that the dead really can come back to life? 

49
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,240
You saw it just now.

50
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,860
Is it really the work of ghosts?

51
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,000
I never believed that there were ghosts or deities in this world.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,180
If there were, it would be someone secretly causing trouble.

53
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,680
Let's investigate carefully, and we will certainly find some clues.

54
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,800
 I've found it! 

55
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,520
 A divine miracle revealed a precious jade. 

56
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,760
This moth-shaped jade must be a divine jade.

57
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,560
 - There must be more. Keep searching. 
 - Definitely more. Search. 

58
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,360
I found one!

59
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,688
 Miraculous! 

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,140
 I found another one! 

61
00:04:29,114 --> 00:04:32,156
   

62
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,440
I always feel that there are two pairs of big hands behind this case.

63
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,180
One pair of big hands wants to quietly erase the Jinxiu Workshop case,

64
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,000
while the other pair wants to stir up trouble by taking advantage of this.

65
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,040
Moth-shaped jade,

66
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,220
the shop owner reveals divine power, the dead come back to life.

67
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:57,000
It's as if all these strange events were planned to occur together this month.

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,820
Whoever stirs up such a commotion in the Imperial City

69
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,860
is definitely not a serial murderer or an ordinary warlock.

70
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,580
Certainly, a powerful figure must be behind this.

71
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:13,340
I just can't figure out the purpose of this powerful figure.

72
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,120
Creating a deity!

73
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,900
Creating a deity?

74
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,100
The case now is already beyond your control.

75
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,360
There's a case within the case,

76
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,780
and it's intricately connected to the court's strife.

77
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,300
What's the purpose of creating a deity, then?

78
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,300
Any thoughts?

79
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,200
My only thought right now

80
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,720
is the only advice I can give you.

81
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,200
Stop investigating!

82
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,960
Don't get involved in the trouble.

83
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,200
Boring!

84
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,580
I thought you had some profound insights.

85
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,820
I must continue to investigate the case.

86
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,520
Utterly childish!

87
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,500
Don't recklessly put yourself in danger!

88
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,820
Are you concerned about me?

89
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,624
What do you think?

90
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,880
Regardless, you currently bear the title of Madam Shen.

91
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,680
Behave yourself!

92
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,800
Try not to get yourself involved.

93
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,540
I still feel like you care about me.

94
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,300
You won't let me go. I must get to the bottom of it.

95
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,084
Madam.

96
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,020
Lu Chuichui and I have an appointment to visit the silk store in the south of the city.

97
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,680
I've heard they've received a batch of new cloths.

98
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,360
In red, yellow, black, and sophora yellow.

99
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,800
The tie-dyeing looks really good.

100
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,760
If I go too late, I won't get any.

101
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,500
Maybe you should go back. Don't disturb Great Chief.

102
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,680
He didn't rest well last night, just let him sleep a little longer.

103
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,720
All right, hurry up and go.

104
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,680
Madam, where are you going so early in the morning?

105
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,680
Lu Chuichui and I have an appointment to visit the silk store in the south of the city.

106
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,240
I've heard they've received a batch of new cloths.

107
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,340
In red, yellow, black, and sophora yellow.

108
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,560
The tie-dyeing looks really good. If I go too late, I won't get any.

109
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,140
I'm going to the silk store in the south of the city.

110
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,280
I've heard they've received a batch of new cloths.

111
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,520
- Uncle Zhong, what happened? She had another quarrel with Great Chief? 
 - Yellow,  black, and sophora yellow.

112
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,340
- If I go too late, I won't get any. 
 - What are you talking about?

113
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,240
Want some sugar cakes? I just made them.

114
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,760
I am about to deliver them to the Great Chief.

115
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,540
No, it's a made-up lie.

116
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,512
What?

117
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,280
Madam Shen left the house this early in the morning, she must have something urgent to do.

118
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,820
Recently, Great Chief hasn't had much appetite for breakfast,

119
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,080
so I made some sugar cakes.

120
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,040
Why donâ€™t you all give them a try?

121
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,896
Jing Lin.

122
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,200
Great Chief.

123
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,679
Go keep an eye on Yan Xing.

124
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,040
With her temper, she definitely won't listen to me.

125
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,620
Yes.

126
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,920
 There's one person missing from this case. 

127
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,200
 The witness who found Madam Chen's body. 

128
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,760
 Besides Chen Shoujie, there was another person. 

129
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,460
 She personally made basin mutton, smoked chicken, baked flatbread, and cake. 

130
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,680
 She even gave me a bowl of wine. 

131
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,680
 Madam treated us so well. 

132
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,490
 She personally made basin mutton, smoked chicken, 

133
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,640
 baked flatbread, and cake. 

134
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,440
 The testimony of Chen Shoujie's servant 

135
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,300
 is exactly the same as that recorded by the officials when they questioned him. 

136
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,640
 The testimonies are identical, not a single word differs. 

137
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,720
 He probably memorized what to say beforehand. 

138
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,560
Chen Shoujie.

139
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,520
Where is your servant?

140
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,520
Fire moth!

141
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,392
Fire moth!

142
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,660
Fire moth!

143
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,960
Fire moth!

144
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,360
- Fire moth! 
 - What fire moth?

145
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,640
Fire moth!

146
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,550
Fire moth!

147
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,600
Fire moth!

148
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,224
Fire moth!

149
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,168
It's you!

150
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,400
The day Madam Chen was killed, what exactly did you see?

151
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,940
Why would you forge the testimony?

152
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,220
   

153
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,560
He seems to be waiting for me?

154
00:11:30,363 --> 00:11:32,981
   

155
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,640
Mingsheng Temple.

156
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,840
Sounds familiar.

157
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:16,000
May I ask, did you just see anyone come in?

158
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,100
May I ask...

159
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,930
Help!

160
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,780
The dead come back to life.

161
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,420
The dead come back to life.

162
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,340
The deadâ€¦

163
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,616
You cannot die.

164
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,760
You still haven't told me who the murderer is.

165
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,180
- You cannot die. 
 - Who are you?

166
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,720
And who are you?

167
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,440
Why did you kill him?

168
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,200
I didn't kill him.

169
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,900
I saw it with my own eyes. Don't try to deny it.

170
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,200
I really did not kill him.

171
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,980
Guards.

172
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,120
I didn't kill him, I justâ€¦

173
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,932
Stop!

174
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,780
Greetings, Princess Runing!

175
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,340
Princess Runing?

176
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,880
    
 Mingsheng Temple.

177
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,680
No wonder it sounds so familiar.

178
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,040
The Princess of Runing, implicated in the Jinxiu Workshop case, is reflecting at the Mingsheng Temple.

179
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,900
Brother Xu.

180
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,240
What? Do you not want your head anymore,

181
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,760
or is it your hands you don't need?

182
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,500
Why would I be that foolish to be set up?

183
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,900
I am really so foolish.

184
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,060
What's wrong?

185
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,040
I think...

186
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,620
I got this powder in the Mingsheng Temple.

187
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:10,000
It looks like the suspicious powder around Jinxiu Workshop.

188
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,800
I need to calm down and think things through.

189
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,680
There must be some connection here.

190
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,560
There must be something I've missed.

191
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,720
Don't be anxious.

192
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,960
There is someone out there who is more anxious than you.

193
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,840
I'd been following her all the way.  But when I reached the outside of Chen Shoujie's mansion,

194
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,160
my horse seemed to have gotten frightened.

195
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,920
After I got to Mingsheng Temple, Princess Runing had alreadyâ€¦

196
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,480
Are you sure that after coming out from the Chen Mansion, Yan Xing didn't look right?

197
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,820
Yes, I called her several times and she didn't respond at all, as if she were bewitched.

198
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,220
And she ran after something.

199
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,620
I don't care who it is.

200
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,820
Whoever dares to harm my people, I won't show any mercy.

201
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,720
But Madam was taken by Princess Runing.

202
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,040
I'm afraid this matter won't be that simple.

203
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,440
There are rules, you can't go in.

204
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,760
How could Yan Xing possibly have killed someone?

205
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,020
You really can't go in.

206
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,040
How is Yan Xing doing?

207
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,200
She's fine and just ate two steamed buns.

208
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:16,300
Right, she said not to tell her family about this matter yet.

209
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,720
Who set Yan Xing up?

210
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,840
You must investigate this thoroughly.

211
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,440
We also believe Yan Xing wouldn't kill anyone.

212
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,120
But the one who arrested her is Princess Runing.

213
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,720
This matter might not be that easy to investigate.

214
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,560
What's not that easy?

215
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:51,640
With solid evidence here, it is natural to punish a murderer.

216
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,760
You!

217
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:58,380
Minister Lai, I wonder what brings you here to the prison of the Ministry of Justice at this late hour.

218
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,840
The matter of Mingsheng Temple involves the Royal Princess.

219
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:06,500
The Empress Dowager wants to interrogate the murderer, Yan Xing.

220
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,960
- What are you waiting for? Take her. 
  - Yes. 

221
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,792
Wait!

222
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,120
What do you want to do, Great Chief?

223
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,800
Do you intend to shield your wife,

224
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,520
obstruct the interrogation, and go against the law?

225
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,680
The Imperial Inspectorate breaks into the prison of the Ministry of Justice.

226
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,820
Is this by imperial decree?

227
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,420
Or are you relying on favor and indulgence, treating the law as if it were nothing?

228
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,380
The Imperial Inspectorate has always served the Grand Empress Dowager sincerely.

229
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,560
Great Chief, you are slandering me!

230
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,580
Regarding today's matter, I must take action personally,

231
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:13,060
in order not to let down the Grand Empress Dowager.

232
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,920
I will personally investigate this matter thoroughly.

233
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,200
Vice Minister Lai, please leave.

234
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,000
Guard this place well.

235
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,440
Anyone who dares to approach will be considered as attempting a prison break...

236
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,700
and will be executed without mercy.

237
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,496
 - Understood! 
 - Understood! 

238
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,920
Unexpectedly,

239
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,240
you truly trust that Madam Shen is not the murderer.

240
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,500
But I wonder how the Grand Empress Dowager will react when she knows about this tomorrow.

241
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,240
Whether she will be moved by the deep affection between you two,

242
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,320
or will command me to administer justice and enforce the law.

243
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,500
One night.

244
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:14,600
Great Chief, please cherish this night!

245
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,440
Go! Come again tomorrow.

246
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,520
-  In the dead of night, what are you doing? 
 - Old Wu.

247
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,760
- Shut up and come with me. 
 - Can't you wait until tomorrow?

248
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,068
Great Chief.

249
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,520
Jing Lin.

250
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,160
You saw with your own eyes

251
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,040
that after Yan Xing came out of the Chen Mansion, as if chasing someone,

252
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,260
she rode a horse all the way to the forest west of the city.

253
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,920
Yes.

254
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,300
Yan Xing said that she discovered the Chen family servant forging testimony,

255
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,120
so she went to the Chen Mansion with growing suspicions.

256
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,520
But she found he was trying to flee, so she chased him to Mingsheng Temple.

257
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,500
That's right, that's what Yan Xing said.

258
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,340
Then something's wrong.

259
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,100
What's wrong?

260
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,740
Jing Lin, lift your foot.

261
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,460
I see.

262
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,640
The west woods are muddy.

263
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,960
If it were a fast horse galloping, the hem of the pants wouldn't be this clean.

264
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,100
I must have soiled my soles on the way to Mingsheng Temple chasing Madam.

265
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,880
But the soles of the Chen family servant are spotless.

266
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,340
Then, how did the body appear at the Mingsheng Temple?

267
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,160
Could this scent beâ€¦

268
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,180
The Mingsheng Temple case has many suspicious points.

269
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,200
No one will interrogate the suspect until tomorrow.

270
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,580
- But ifâ€¦ 
 - If Yan Xing suffers in the prison,

271
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,960
- But ifâ€¦ 
 - If Yan Xing suffers in the prison,

272
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,180
I will hold you responsible.

273
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,460
Great Chief, what should we investigate next?

274
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,260
The source of the mistake.

275
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,100
 Not entering the cycle of reincarnation, undying. 

276
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,600
   

277
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:24,500
   

278
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,400
This powder is similar to the one that appeared in the Jinxiu Workshop.

279
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,100
Did Madam fall into a trap right here?

280
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,300
 Fire moth! Fire moth! Fire moth! 

281
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,320
What was originally placed here?

282
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,900
Great Chief, there doesn't seem to be any signs of rummaging or fighting.

283
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,600
So much blood.

284
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,000
Looks like this is where the murderer killed.

285
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,900
How did the victim end up at the Mingsheng Temple, then?

286
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,500
 It's a box. 

287
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,560
Great Chief, this is the whereabouts of Prince Xian last night.

288
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,200
   

289
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,000
As expected.

290
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,100
You sent someone to spy on Prince Xian.

291
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,400
- If they find out, I'm afraidâ€¦ 
 - Saving the person is priority!

292
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,200
I need to meet this Princess Runing myself.

293
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,600
I'm Shen Du, the Great Chief of the Imperial Guards.

294
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,100
Greetings, Princess Runing.

295
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,700
Great Chief Shen, you are the renowned White Ghost.

296
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,000
Today, who do you want to take away here?

297
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,600
Your Highness, you misunderstand.

298
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,000
Today, I have a favor to ask.

299
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,200
Don't be kidding.

300
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,300
I am no longer a princess, but a commoner.

301
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,600
Great Chief, I can't help you with anything. Please leave.

302
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,400
Your Highness, please hear me out.

303
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,100
If it is an affair of the court, it has nothing to do with me.

304
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,300
You donâ€™t need to say anything more.

305
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,880
It is my personal affair.

306
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,000
A personal affair?

307
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,800
Yesterday, my wife was set up by someone.

308
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,400
She mistakenly entered Mingsheng Temple and was imprisoned.

309
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,900
I hope Your Highness can show some leniency.

310
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,400
I can't believe you would come to beg me for your wife.

311
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,600
You are very different from what I heard about you.

312
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,400
Do you want me to release your wife?

313
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,400
I would like Your Highness to tell me the truth.

314
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,200
What do you mean?

315
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,600
Are you suggesting that I have slandered your wife?

316
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,100
Naturally, Your Highness did not intend to do so.

317
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,700
But if you want to protect someone,

318
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,300
you might hide some piece of information.

319
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,800
Nonsense!

320
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,000
I am tired. You may leave.

321
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,400
At the time of the incident,

322
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,300
was there really only Your Highness in Mingsheng Temple, without anyone else?

323
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,700
Grand Empress Dowager has confined Your Highness here.

324
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,100
If Her Majesty learns that you met Prince Xian secretly,

325
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,520
I wonder what Her Majesty would think.

326
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,600
Are you threatening me?

327
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,200
I only seek the truth.

328
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:09,000
He just came to visit his lonely aunt,

329
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
brought some items, and had a cup of tea.

330
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,800
We never criticized state affairs or harbored any ulterior motives.

331
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,600
It's just a courtesy thing between relatives. Can't we do so?

332
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,200
Prince Xian values family ties.

333
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,400
But people on the outside may not necessarily think it that way.

334
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:30,300
Sometimes, one word can cause an innocent person to die unjustly.

335
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,900
Your Highness, please tell me the truth

336
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,700
and clear my wife's name.

337
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,400
Open it.

338
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,000
I didn't actually see your wife kill anyone.

339
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,300
When I rushed over upon hearing the commotion,

340
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:00,300
only she and the body were left in the hall.

341
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,800
I didn't want others to find out that Prince Xian was here,

342
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,100
so I told him to leave through the back door.

343
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,800
Later, upon inspecting the back door,

344
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,100
signs of forced entry were indeed discovered.

345
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,800
Among the pile of items brought by Prince Xian,

346
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,800
I found this box.

347
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,800
But I don't know where it came from.

348
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,400
Thank you for telling the truth.

349
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,800
Today, I  have caused many offenses.

350
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,400
Great Chief, be careful!

351
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,400
If anything happens to Prince Xian,

352
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,300
I will definitely inform Empress Dowager of your surveillance of the royal family.

353
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,800
Do you think that I would be that bold

354
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,100
to do so without permission?

355
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,680
May there be peaceful days ahead.

356
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,100
Doesn't Your Highness want to know

357
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,800
the truth behind the Jinxiu Workshop case from years ago?

358
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,500
What difference does it make knowing the truth?

359
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,000
The dead can never come back.

360
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,400
The dead are gone and have found peace.

361
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,800
Just a word to comfort the living.

362
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,800
No one dared to investigate the truth of that case back then.

363
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,800
What about today?

364
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:25,200
I promise you that I will get to the bottom of the case...

365
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,760
and give Your Highness the truth.

366
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,920
Good, then I'll wait for the truth.

367
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,800
Prince Xian, Mingsheng Temple is a place of dispute.

368
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,200
If Grand Empress Dowager knew that you had been there,

369
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,000
she would certainly accuse you of harboring treasonous intentions.

370
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,400
When there is a desire to accuse someone, there will always be an excuse.

371
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,300
Back then, it was just because of a piece of clothing,

372
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,400
that my aunt caused bloodshed at Jinxiu Workshop.

373
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,600
Prince Xian, please be cautious with your words!

374
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,200
Prince Xian, please be cautious with your words!

375
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,100
You have just performed a charitable act to aid in disaster relief which pleased the Grand Empress Dowager.

376
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:25,400
Do not do anything to displease the Grand Empress Dowager.

377
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,700
Do not neglect minor conduct, lest you suffer a great loss.

378
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,800
Shen Du knew about this yet did not report it.

379
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,500
He is quite calculating!

380
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,300
It's already dawn,

381
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,700
why hasn't Great Chief Shen returned yet?

382
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,000
It's about time. Take her.

383
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,200
How stubborn you are!

384
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:17,000
I remember back then you were caught by Shen Du.

385
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,200
But now you listen to him.

386
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,600
Grand Empress Dowager's decree

387
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,900
requires you to interrogate by the hour of Yi. 
  (Between 9:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m.) 

388
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,200
No interrogation until the time has come!

389
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,200
Inspector!

390
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,100
How dare you to stop the Imperial Inspectorate from handling a case!

391
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:51,600
I'll see just how stubborn you are!

392
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,400
Vice Minister Lai certainly has a lot of bravado!

393
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,000
Though it seems like you're a bit impatient.

394
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:26,600
I should do my best for Grand Empress Dowager.

395
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,120
Grand Empress Dowager has decreed.

396
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,300
The Mingsheng Temple case is fraught with numerous suspicious points.

397
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,300
Now it's transferred to the Imperial Guards to take full responsibility...

398
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,840
to investigate thoroughly!

399
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,500
Great Chief Shen, you really act fast!

400
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,500
Retreat!

401
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,480
Why hasn't she come out yet?

402
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,520
Bless her, bless her! Please come out quickly.

403
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,660
Sixth Miss, you finally came out!

404
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,400
I was so worried!

405
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,760
Come, come, come. Sweep, sweep, sweep! 
  (Clearing away bad luck.) 

406
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,520
I'm glad that you could come out safe and sound.

407
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,920
You!

408
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,340
You always get yourself in trouble while investigating cases.

409
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,980
But I'm glad that you could come out safe and sound.

410
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,320
Do you have any idea how worried I was

411
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,460
when I heard you'd been arrested for murder?

412
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,680
Come on. Get rid of the bad luck. Turn around, turn around.

413
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,320
Get rid of the bad luck. Go around.

414
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,240
I am blessed and lucky to be alive.

415
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,700
The case has been cleared up and then I got released.

416
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:53,580
If it werenâ€™t for Great Chief Shen finding the Princess of Runing to clarify the situation,

417
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,200
and for uncovering the box used to transport the body

418
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,060
in the woods behind the Mingsheng Temple,

419
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,120
do you think you would have gotten out so easily?

420
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,560
He went to find Princess Runing?

421
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,880
What did you just say?

422
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,260
The box used for transporting the body was thrown into the woods?

423
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,679
Something's wrong.

424
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,480
What's wrong?

425
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,600
You must have been scared out of your wits.

426
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,440
It's all right now.

427
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,780
Oh, right! Brother Xu and Jiang Langxing have gone to pursue new clues.

428
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,159
I heard that the deceased servant of the Chen family

429
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:27,199
had been stealing the Chen family assets while Chen Shoujie was out of his mind.

430
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,520
had been stealing the Chen family assets while Chen Shoujie was out of his mind.

431
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,560
Later, he got caught by Madam Chen,

432
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:36,779
so he betrayed his master and colluded with someone to kill her.

433
00:34:36,779 --> 00:34:38,819
Unfortunately, thereâ€™s no way to prove it now.

434
00:34:38,819 --> 00:34:40,620
Yan Xing.

435
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:52,819
- Great Chief, are you here to take Sixth Miss back home? 
 - Back home?

436
00:34:52,819 --> 00:34:57,039
I'm all fired up to investigate the case and clear my name now.

437
00:34:59,488 --> 00:35:00,760
What are you doing?

438
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,080
From now on, you're not allowed to investigate this case.

439
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,400
We've reached this point.

440
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,640
Even if I were to quit now, can I stay out of it?

441
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,300
Also, the body of that servant of the Chen family should be at the Ministry of Justice.

442
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,440
I must find clues from his body.

443
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,680
When I say no, I mean no.

444
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,640
The murderer used that servant of the Chen family to lure me to Mingsheng Temple,

445
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,560
obviously leading me to suspect Princess Runing.

446
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,960
Princess Runing has not left Mingsheng Temple for many years.

447
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,000
Who wants to drag her down into this?

448
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,760
Enough.

449
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,360
Are you asking me to quit because it's related to the royals?

450
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,480
Leave this matter to me. I will handle it well.

451
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,040
I just want to know the truth.

452
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,840
Since you are hesitant and fearful of the powerful,

453
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,160
fine, I'll investigate this case myself.

454
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,540
Great Chief, you can just pursue your career.

455
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,760
So that's what you think of me.

456
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,280
Aren't you always afraid of being implicated by others?

457
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,600
Then let's divorce right now.

458
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,920
So you don't have to write a confession later.

459
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,892
Sixth Miss!

460
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,800
What should we do?

461
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:29,180
- Where are you going? 
 - To do the autopsy.

462
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,400
Shen Du examined the body before.

463
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,520
The soles of his shoes did not have any forest mud on them.

464
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,920
He was sent to Mingsheng Temple after he died.

465
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,600
What? Did you find anything?

466
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,080
Come and smell this.

467
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:12,800
This is the scent of something used to slow down the decay of a body.

468
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,480
Long before I arrived at Chen Shoujie's mansion,

469
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,000
he had already died.

470
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,840
What happened after then,

471
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,000
although I witnessed them myself,

472
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,380
I'm not sure if it's true.

473
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:29,060
Are you suggesting everything you saw might have been an illusion?

474
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,400
What is that?

475
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,420
Or what kind of drug could manipulate the mind like this?

476
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,520
The world is vast,

477
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,400
all sorts of wonders

478
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,120
are beyond our grasp.

479
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,160
Also, what concerns me more is

480
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,840
the method used on this servant's body to delay the death time

481
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,400
is the same as what Madam Tang used.

482
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,800
Do you believe that there are techniques for bringing the dead back to life in this world?

483
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:05,100
Are you worried that Chen Huo'e might bring the dead back to life asl the others said?

484
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,980
Yes.

485
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,280
I don't think so.

486
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,120
So I have to find out the truth.

487
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:17,060
So you quarreled with your husband and ran away from home?

488
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,580
I am just afraid that without White Ghost's protection,

489
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,160
what if you get bullied?

490
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,640
What am I afraid of? I still have you guys.

491
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,080
If you go home and your mother finds out, she will definitely scold you.

492
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
Don't worry!

493
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,272
I already know where to go.

494
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,980
 This is where the Ministry of Justice keeps all case files. 
   

495
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:43,580
 I can't believe that no clues can be found. 

496
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,280
- Clerk Yan. 
 - Master Ji.

497
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,520
Why do you come to the Historical Archive so late?

498
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,640
Master Ji, I want to check on every record before and after

499
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,800
the Jinxiu Workshop case. 
    

500
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,700
You've been in charge of the Historical Archive for years. Do you know where it is?

501
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,080
Jinxiu Workshop.

502
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,200
It's been some years.

503
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,100
Perhaps over there, you can take a look.

504
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,928
Thank you.

505
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,280
 I've smelled... 

506
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,440
 this scent somewhere before. 

507
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,250
Clerk Yan.

508
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,960
Mind the fire.

509
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,620
Thank you. I will be careful.

510
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,400
 Aren't you always afraid of being implicated by others? 

511
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,840
 Then let's divorce right now. 

512
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,020
 So you don't have to write a confession later. 

513
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,688
 Mother. 

514
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,560
 Oranges. 

515
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,280
 The branches of the orange tree outside the wall 

516
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,640
 just happened to fall into the garden. 

517
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,000
 I know you like oranges, 

518
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,040
 so I picked them for you. 

519
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,000
 Have you written the things 

520
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,040
 I told you to? 

521
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,240
 I don't know how, nor can I write it. 

522
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,240
 My father has been upright all his life. 

523
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:57,520
 He has never done the slightest thing against the Shen family's precepts. 

524
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,400
 My father was framed by others. 

525
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,260
 How can I admit to those unfounded crimes on behalf of my father? 

526
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,880
 Shut up! 

527
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,160
 You have a criminal record. 

528
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,880
 If you do not draw a clear line with the Shen family, 

529
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,160
 then you will have no hope. Youâ€¦ 

530
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,120
 But how can I live ignobly, 

531
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,400
 allowing my father to be reviled? 

532
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,400
 Rather so, I would rather, like my father, die to prove my integrity. 

533
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:30,280
 But if even you die, then this unjust case will truly end. 

534
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,200
 Shen Du! 

535
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,000
 Do you really want them 

536
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,220
 to never rest in peace in the underworld? 

537
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,280
 If you don't write that confession, 

538
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,680
 then from now on, 

539
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,120
 don't call me your mother again. 

540
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,760
 To clear the name of your father 

541
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,400
 and the Shen family, 

542
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,120
 no matter how difficult, 

543
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,960
 and dangerous it is, 

544
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,640
 you must go on. 

545
