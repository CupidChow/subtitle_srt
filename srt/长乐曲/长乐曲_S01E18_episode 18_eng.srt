00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,990
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,036
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:35,036 --> 00:00:38,334
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,334 --> 00:00:40,603
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,603 --> 00:00:44,478
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:47,613
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:50,878
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,914
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,914 --> 00:01:02,286
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,286 --> 00:01:08,594
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,594 --> 00:01:14,873
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,873 --> 00:01:21,186
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,186 --> 00:01:29,030
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:37,164
   

16
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:40,600
   

17
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,620
 The Great Chief successfully vindicated the Jinxiu Workshop. 

18
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,880
 Finding the real culprit is truly satisfying to the people's hearts. 

19
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,980
 Good to see the wrongful grievances have been cleared. 

20
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,100
 I will be the Lady of the Shen Mansion from now on. 

21
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,170
 What are you still doing here? 

22
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,440
 This is bad. The Great Chief insisted on a re-investigation of the old cases, which provoked the Empress Dowager. 

23
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,760
 The entire Shen Mansion is to be executed today! 

24
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,620
 But Shen Du did not defy the Empress Dowager. 

25
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:01,660
 Sixth Miss, aren't you desperately trying to find out the truth? 

26
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,420
 Why are you feeling compassion for Shen Du? 

27
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,620
 I'm not. This is unfair! 

28
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,440
 Nothing's fair! 

29
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,730
 I tried so hard to learn, 

30
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,920
 but I was unable to get an official title due to my humble background. 

31
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,480
 Do you want the truth or Shen Du's safety? 

32
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,480
 - You can only choose one. 
 - I won't choose! I can't choose! 

33
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,020
 Hurry up and move out! 

34
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,060
 Madam, please save the Great Chief! Think of a way! 

35
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,420
 - Sixth Miss! 
 - Hurry and choose one! 

36
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,060
 From now on, this place is all mine! 

37
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,220
 Madam, we are all to be executed today! Madam! 

38
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,660
 Don't you want to know the truth? What are you waiting for? 

39
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,880
 - I won't need to compete with you anymore in the future. 
 - Madam! 

40
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,980
 Shen Du! 

41
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,180
 Knock downâ€¦ 

42
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,600
 What on earth are you talking about? 

43
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,040
 A bull. 

44
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,240
 What do you mean by that? 

45
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,500
Madam, you've finally woken up.

46
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,140
The Great Chief has something to discuss with you.

47
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,280
He has been waiting in the study for a long time.

48
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,100
Xiaohe, what time is it now?

49
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,880
Madam, you have slept until the hour of You. The sun is about to set.

50
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,920
Could it be that something is really going to happen?

51
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,720
I'm here.

52
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,880
I heard you were looking for me.

53
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,380
   

54
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,090
Yes.

55
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,280
Did something happen?

56
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,780
These are the case files of the Jinxiu Workshop case.

57
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,700
I have organized them so it will be more convenient to go through them later.

58
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,600
What do you mean?

59
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,720
The Empress Dowager has agreed to re-investigate this case.

60
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,370
Really?

61
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,240
Do I look like I'm joking?

62
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,280
You had me worried for nothing...

63
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,840
for so long.

64
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,660
I thought there would beâ€¦

65
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,140
Were you worried that I would act only in my own interest and hastily close the case?

66
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,260
Or were you worried that my reporting this matter would make the Empress Dowager unhappy?

67
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,180
Is there a difference between the two?

68
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,730
Yes.

69
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,270
Which one is it?

70
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:07,480
I just woke up. Why do I still have to choose?

71
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,372
I won't choose.

72
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,470
So?

73
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,200
What did you think?

74
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,660
What can I think?

75
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,400
I think you are a man of integrity.

76
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,140
This is what one ought to do in a key position.

77
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,620
Besides that, is there nothing else you want to say?

78
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,652
What should I say?

79
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,800
Did I say something wrong again?

80
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,452
No.

81
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,100
Weird!

82
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,900
I heard that the Great Chief argued with so many in the court without any fear.

83
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,540
He delivered a passionate and fiery speech

84
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,210
that made the Empress Dowager

85
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,410
agree to re-investigate the Jinxiu Workshop case.

86
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,780
I suppose you certainly had a hand behind the scenes

87
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,160
and made no small contribution.

88
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,340
What contribution could I possibly have made?

89
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,260
Instead, I fell for Pan Chi's drug and knocked myself out.

90
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,360
When I woke up, I heard this news.

91
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,580
Did you become foolish from working on the cases?

92
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,510
It's such a shame that I only heard about it

93
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,800
instead of witnessing the Great Chief's impressive demeanor.

94
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,580
He has no shortage of swaggering about all day long!

95
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,880
You don't know how fortunate you are.

96
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,480
The Great Chief holds an important position and has a prestigious reputation.

97
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,180
Most importantly, he's also good-looking!

98
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,300
He always has a cold expression.

99
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,020
It's terribly unsightly!

100
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,140
Jing Lin.

101
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,860
Great Chief.

102
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,820
Am I...

103
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,004
ugly?

104
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,620
Miss Yun Que, I have something to tell you.

105
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:44,780
I advise you it's best not to provoke the Great Chief.

106
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,140
Mind your own business.

107
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,950
Have you ever wondered why the Great Chief is called...

108
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,400
White Ghost?

109
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,380
I'm not the same as outsiders.

110
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,580
The Great Chief had a bad look.

111
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,300
If you remain persistent, what if, in a fit of anger, he twists your head off?

112
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,440
It's not impossible.

113
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,400
Who are you trying to scare?

114
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,600
If you don't believe me, go ahead and try.

115
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,380
I'm just curious about the Jinxiu Workshop case.

116
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,780
Brother Jing Lin, you often work on cases with the Great Chief.

117
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,800
Ji Fangming has been interrogated.

118
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,300
But who is the initial instigator of the matter of the Jinxiu Workshop?

119
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,040
You must have some insider information. Right?

120
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,716
Iâ€¦

121
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,240
don't know.

122
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,010
You definitely know. Tell me about it.

123
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,880
Then let me ask you.

124
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,580
How does your family know Kong Xianrong of the Jinxiu Workshop?

125
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,340
What makes you so devoted to reversing the case for him?

126
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,900
Even if I told you, you wouldn't understand.

127
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,620
How can others understand if you don't explain it clearly?

128
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,880
What do you mean?

129
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,100
Your family had many dealings with the Jinxiu Workshop in the past

130
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,740
yet were never affected.

131
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,400
Why is that?

132
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,060
Are you interrogating me now?

133
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,020
Are you suspecting my family members?

134
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,504
Iâ€¦

135
00:10:12,516 --> 00:10:14,572
   

136
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,600
 Have you heard? Hundreds of moths just swarmed into the Princess of Valor's mansion. 

137
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,400
 It was so frightening! I heard they flew over from the Jinxiu Workshop. 

138
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,700
They say it's the grievous wails of wronged souls seeking retribution.

139
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,840
Could it be that the Princess of Valor is the mastermind behind the Jinxiu Workshop massacre?

140
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,840
Back then, she had a hostile relationship with Princess Runing.

141
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,040
Aunt, as for the case of the Jinxiu Workshop,

142
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,080
Mother Empress has agreed to re-investigate it.

143
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,740
The injustice you've endured for many years can finally be redressed.

144
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,380
The old case can be overturned.

145
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,380
But the ones who died in vain can never be brought back.

146
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,980
Do you still harbor hatred in your heart?

147
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,260
I opened the door and saw you today,

148
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,320
which means I have let go of the past.

149
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,440
The departed have passed on.

150
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,470
And the living must carry on.

151
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,310
Now, outside, it's being said

152
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,900
that the wrongful Jinxiu Workshop case back then was a setup by me.

153
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,640
That I was the one who caused the death of your husband.

154
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,840
Don't you have anything you want to ask me?

155
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,460
So?

156
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,840
It wasn't me!

157
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,120
If that's the case, why is your heart in turmoil again?

158
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,740
That invisible force has appeared again.

159
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:01,100
It's targeting the royal family, intending to throw us into utter chaos.

160
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,860
I'm not the first one...

161
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,820
and you won't be the last.

162
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,240
Knowing there is no way to change it,

163
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,620
you might as well accept it as fate.

164
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,860
I refuse to resign to fate.

165
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,300
Be it the wrongful case of Jinxiu Workshop or the unsolved case of Chen Huo'e,

166
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,680
the Imperial Guards, the Imperial Inspectorate, the Judicial Government Office, and the Ministry of Justice

167
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,680
are all trying to solve the case.

168
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,840
We must make the truth come to light once more.

169
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,840
The mortal world is full of turmoil.

170
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,960
Seek clarity and peace within one's heart.

171
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:50,240
Aunt, do you wish to stay at this Mingsheng Temple for the rest of your life?

172
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,400
Affairs of this world are all trivial matters.

173
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,260
At least, one can find peace here.

174
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:09,020
Fine. It seems I've made a fool of myself.

175
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,180
It's still the same as before.

176
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:16,040
I can't stand this pretentiousness, and you despise my frivolity.

177
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:21,260
I heard that when Prince Xian came, you once told his fortune.

178
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,400
Today, can you divine a fortune for me too?

179
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,640
I have only been cultivating myself here for a few years.

180
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,300
My practice is not enough.

181
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,900
I'm not very proficient in fortune-telling.

182
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,840
If there's nothing else, you should go back.

183
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,000
You're asking me to leave, huh?

184
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,916
I know when I'm not wanted.

185
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,680
An encounter is already a good omen.

186
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,680
Why worry and foster unnecessary thoughts?

187
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,080
Your Highness.

188
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,880
Shen Du.

189
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,640
You've paid a night visit to Mingsheng Temple.

190
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,820
Are you worried about the matter of Jinxiu Workshop or Chen Huo'e?

191
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,460
What? Are you suspecting me as well?

192
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,040
Do you want to question me?

193
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,040
Your Highness, you misunderstood me.

194
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,320
I have a plan that can free you from undeserved blame.

195
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,840
Come on! Bring it in, bring it in!

196
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,730
All right, put it here!

197
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,060
   

198
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,304
Mister! Mister!

199
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,180
- Father. Mother. What are you doing here? 
 - Que!

200
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,560
It is thisâ€¦

201
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,020
young hero who kidnappedâ€¦

202
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,820
escorted us all the way here.

203
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,584
Escorted?

204
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,120
How did you do it?

205
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,140
Anyway, I have brought them to you.

206
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:18,100
He also said that Que is to be wed to Shen Du, the Great Chief.

207
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,860
Great Chief, if you had this intention, you should have told me first.

208
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,860
Why go for this surprise?

209
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,630
Yan Xing,

210
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,520
handle this matter!

211
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,320
You have traveled through dust and wind to arrive at Xiang'an.

212
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,820
You must have not had a good rest on the road.

213
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,600
Let's take a rest first and talk about this matter later.

214
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,340
Please, rest in the hall.

215
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,700
Is this how you invite people?

216
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,590
You didn't mention how to bring them here.

217
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,700
Moreover, they did not cooperate.

218
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,580
Besides, this is the safest way!

219
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,500
That's right.

220
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,380
I also found out something that you would be interested in.

221
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,480
Great Chief, please.

222
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,160
Since Yun Que is not here, let's get straight to the point.

223
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,930
Master and Madam Yun, we invited you two to Xiang'an,

224
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:55,000
not for Yun Que's marriage.

225
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,470
Great Chief is letting Yun Que stay here,

226
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:00,860
but he never had the intention of marrying her.

227
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,340
As to the matter of the Jinxiu Workshop,

228
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:08,580
we hope that this time, you two can tell the truth.

229
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,940
What do you mean, Madam Shen? We do not understand.

230
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,360
Your journey to Xiang'an was not peaceful.

231
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,470
I need not mention those assassins.

232
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,000
You should have heard about them.

233
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,140
At this point, if you continue to conceal things,

234
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,520
I'm afraid that even the Great Chief of the Shen Family can't protect you all the time.

235
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,080
This is true.

236
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,920
Indeed, I don't need to shelter those who are unimportant.

237
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,240
Husband, since they do not wish to say more,

238
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,700
we need not waste any more time.

239
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,100
I've heard that near the Jinxiu Workshop, there have been wronged spirits lurking recently.

240
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,320
I am timid and do not wish to stir up more trouble.

241
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,070
Perhaps we should pack their luggage

242
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,280
and send them out of the Shen residence tonight.

243
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,980
Whether they live or die...

244
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,380
is up to them.

245
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,780
That would be for the best.

246
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,824
- Wait! 
 - Master!

247
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,500
Que is innocent.

248
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,180
Uncle Yun, we also do not wish to see you in danger,

249
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,580
but now someone is stirring up trouble with the old Jinxiu Workshop case.

250
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,850
Even if you conceal what you know,

251
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:38,800
would the instigator truly protect you?

252
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,640
We have wronged the Jinxiu Workshop! We have wronged Boss Kong!

253
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,540
 However, we had no other choice. 

254
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,700
If we were to meddle further,

255
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,960
our Yun family would not be able to survive.

256
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,680
 Back then when inspecting the evidence, 

257
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,600
we did find something abnormal and wanted to contact Boss Kong.

258
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,560
But that very night, we were threatened to keep our mouths shut.

259
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,940
Otherwise, Yun Que would lose her life.

260
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,530
So we had no choice but to abide by the agreement

261
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,380
and not speak up for the Jinxiu Workshop.

262
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,120
And after so many years,

263
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,060
the person threatening us has never ceased surveillance.

264
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:20,540
If that's the case, why did the evidence end up in Yun Que's hands in the end?

265
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,920
Moreover, she came alone safely to Xiang'an to seek justice.

266
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,040
That person asked us to do that.

267
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,140
We didn't understand why there was such a sudden request,

268
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,600
but we had to comply.

269
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,280
We could only put on an act letting Que find out bits and pieces.

270
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,720
Given her character, she would definitely take those documents

271
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,780
to file a lawsuit.

272
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:49,100
Who exactly is the person threatening you?

273
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,000
- It'sâ€¦ 
 - It'sâ€¦

274
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,840
It is Chen Huo'e.

275
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,960
- Que'er. 
 - Que'er.

276
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,060
So you've known all along that Uncle Kong's family was wronged.

277
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,260
But in order to protect yourselves, you knew there were hidden circumstances

278
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,640
and disregarded the wrongs done to so many people of Jinxiu Workshop.

279
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,340
Que'er, we had no choice.

280
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,420
Your mother and I can't and dare not gamble with your life

281
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,440
or the fate of the entire Yun family.

282
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,700
Father. Mother.

283
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,880
Then how are we, the Yun family, different from the accomplices?

284
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,280
Your father and I were cowards.

285
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,820
If there's any retribution to be had, let it fall on us.

286
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,990
Que'er, the Great Chief and Madam Shen

287
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,520
know that you are not involved in this affair.

288
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:49,360
Only by staying in the Shen Mansion, will you be out of danger.

289
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,160
We implore you for mercy, Great Chief.

290
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,270
Father. Mother.

291
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,560
No matter what happens in the future,

292
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,840
I will face it with you.

293
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,932
Que'er.

294
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,300
 So, is the truth more important 

295
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,760
 or is the safety of those close to you more important? 

296
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,840
I didn't expect it to be Chen Huo'e again.

297
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,080
So she didn't just come back to life recently.

298
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,580
She has always been alive.

299
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:57,020
For over five years, whatever Chen Huo'e has been planning,

300
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,380
she must have felt the time was ripe.

301
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,760
That's why she appeared using all the evidence that could prove her resurrection.

302
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,760
What exactly is her purpose?

303
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,800
A miraculous resurrection,

304
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:15,240
even the re-investigation of the Jinxiu Workshop case.

305
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:20,640
In the Jinxiu Workshop case, Princess Runing's family was involved.

306
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,080
In this re-investigation, she used moths to guide the people

307
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,640
into thinking the Princess of Valor was the instigator back then.

308
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,920
So she wants...

309
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:39,030
to make the most favored Princess of Valor subject to suspicion or even incrimination.

310
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,300
If we want to clearly investigate the old case of the Jinxiu Workshop,

311
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,140
it will inevitably involve Princess Runing,

312
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,360
Princess of Valor, Prince Xian,

313
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,520
even Prime Minister Zhang, Lai Luozhi, and the interactions between these high-ranking officials.

314
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,020
From the perspective of the beneficiary,

315
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:02,060
it is indeed difficult not to suspect that the person behind the scenes is related to the Princess of Valor.

316
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:05,980
Chen Huo'e's act of deifying is leading the innocent people

317
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:10,680
to believe that the Princess of Valor is the one who needs to be punished.

318
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,500
What's wrong?

319
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,200
I've just fully understood how much risk and pressure

320
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,900
proposing a re-investigation of an old case brings.

321
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,800
If Princess of Valor gets implicated,

322
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,900
it will again draw out many forces in the court.

323
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,500
By the way, Pan Chi mentioned something upon his return.

324
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,500
- He saidâ€¦ 
 - Great Chief.

325
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,500
Princess of Valor is hosting a family banquet in her mansion

326
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,600
and invited you to attend.

327
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,800
Unexpectedly, even at such a time,

328
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,400
Princess of Valor is still in the mood to hold a family banquet.

329
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,800
I didn't expect it to come so quickly.

330
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,920
Since you are curious, accompany me to go there.

331
00:24:02,228 --> 00:24:06,010
   

332
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,900
I don't see other wives accompanying their husbands.

333
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,400
We can take this opportunity

334
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,700
to dispel the rumors of our marital discord.

335
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,300
I agree.

336
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,800
Let's go all the way and let them all see clearly.

337
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,100
 - Great Chief. 
 - Great Chief. 

338
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,100
Why would Princess of Valor take your advice

339
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,700
and hold this family banquet?

340
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,000
Given her character, she wouldn't ignore the rumors.

341
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
She would make a preemptive move trying to catch turtles in a jar.

342
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,400
Are you so certain that Chen Huo'e will take action?

343
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,800
If Chen Huo'e wants to attract more followers,

344
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,200
she must keep creating miracles.

345
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,100
And to punish those who were truly responsible for the Jinxiu Workshop case,

346
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,800
is her chance to prove herself

347
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,600
and the best opportunity to capture people's hearts.

348
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,520
You have always stayed away from factional disputes.

349
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,800
Attending the banquet today,

350
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,900
aren't you afraid that others will think that you are siding with Princess of Valor?

351
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,600
Do you think the "White Ghost" that people speak of cares about these matters?

352
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,200
Wife, you are intelligent and resourceful.

353
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,700
If Chen Huo'e shows up later, what's your plan?

354
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,200
I'll play it by ear.

355
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,580
 Princess Jia'an has arrived. 

356
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,200
 - Greetings to Princess Jia'an. 
 - Greetings to Princess Jia'an. 

357
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,500
 - Good health to Princess Jia'an. 
 - Good health to Princess Jia'an. 

358
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,800
Greetings, Mother. I hope you are well.

359
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,600
Come here.

360
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,200
Today is a family banquet. There's no need for excessive formalities.

361
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,400
Just make yourselves comfortable. Please take a seat quickly.

362
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,500
Princess Jia'an is so outstanding with an extraordinary presence.

363
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,800
Just as the legends describe, she has impeccable manners.

364
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,900
Princess Jia'an truly is fitting to be the daughter of the Princess of Valor.

365
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,500
It is an honor to see her today.

366
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,200
Jia'an has been frail since childhood,

367
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,800
so she grew up in the gardens on the outskirts of the capital.

368
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,600
As her mother, we have had few meetings and many partings.

369
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,800
Not long ago, she just reached the age of maturity

370
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,200
and was summoned back to the capital by Mother Empress.

371
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,000
Today's banquet is to welcome her

372
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,100
and help her get settled.

373
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,600
I've heard that the Empress Dowager

374
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,600
is personally arranging a marriage for Princess Jia'an.

375
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,000
Surely, Your Highness will have an excellent son-in-law.

376
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,800
On the other hand, I hope that she

377
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,900
can stay by my side for a longer time.

378
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,200
Did you notice anything?

379
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,800
Her smile outshines the stars.

380
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,500
She's truly young and beautiful.

381
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,000
Take a look.

382
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,500
With the singing and dancing, it really is a delightful sight.

383
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,300
Be careful lest extreme joy begets sorrow.

384
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,600
I hope no trouble occurs.

385
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,000
- There are moths. 
 - I see them.

386
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,600
Look.

387
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,600
Your Highness!

388
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,200
Guards, capture her alive!

389
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,800
Yes!

390
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,600
You've prepared this show with great effort.

391
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,800
Why leave without taking a look?

392
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,500
You actually noticed.

393
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,500
A petty trick can't deceive anyone.

394
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,800
Since you can control the moths,

395
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,600
they will naturally lead me to find you, their master.

396
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,100
You're clever.

397
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:49,000
But you alone can't block my path.

398
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,400
I'm enough.

399
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,600
An ignorant fool.

400
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:58,400
Today, you will have a one-way journey.

401
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,400
 If you do not ally with me, 

402
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:05,500
 you will be walking into a fire, a one-way journey. 

403
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,600
Is the wrongful case of the Shen Mansion back then related to you?

404
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,900
Your father was but an ant.

405
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,300
No one cares about his death.

406
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,400
You can choose to believe in me

407
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,600
and beg me to resurrect him.

408
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,000
Sweet words, but utter nonsense!

409
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,700
The person who framed your father is right by your side.

410
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,500
Yet you regard the murderer as your father and assist in oppression!

411
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,900
Shen Du. Oh, Shen Du!

412
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,300
Your father died with eyes unclosed!

413
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,300
You are seeking death!

414
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,200
Does the person who was resurrected from death also bleed?

415
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,200
I never believed that there were people

416
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,960
who can come back to life after death.

417
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,100
Kill me.

418
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,800
And there will be one less person who knows

419
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,400
about the wrongful case of the Shen Mansion years ago.

420
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,680
Sixth Miss, be careful!

421
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,500
Sixth Miss!

422
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,200
Shen Du, are you all right?

423
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,600
I have figured out the key to Chen Huo'e's resurrection.

424
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,600
Let's go!

425
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,000
   

426
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,300
Your Highness, the princess was a bit frightened.

427
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,400
She has taken a Tranquilizer Pill and is resting now.

428
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,000
Good.

429
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,600
Your Highness, the assailant has been captured.

430
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,800
Your Great Chief...

431
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,600
truly is a man of his word.

432
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,800
Who sent you here?

433
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,200
No one.

434
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,800
Drag her out and beat her until she talks.

435
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,200
Yes.

436
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,200
As you all have seen today.

437
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,900
The Huo'e Sect and these so-called limitless miracles,

438
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:31,700
are nothing but a group of charlatans deluding the public.

439
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,000
From now on,

440
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,300
if anyone else uses the name of Chen Huo'e to spread rumors,

441
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,600
this will be their fate.

442
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,200
 - Yes. 
 - Yes. 

443
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,920
How can you be so careless?

444
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,500
It'sâ€¦ It's Shen Du. And Yan Xing.

445
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,400
They ruined my plans.

446
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,500
After today,

447
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,000
it will be hard to get another opportunity...

448
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,199
to get close to the Princess of Valor's mansion.

449
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,600
I will not hesitate to eradicate the opposition for you, Master.

450
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,190
Forget it.

451
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,200
Overthrowing the Princess of Valor

452
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,100
is not something that can be achieved overnight.

453
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:41,400
You fell for Shen Du's trick.

454
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,400
What he wanted was for you to take action.

455
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,960
As long as you are unable to punish the Princess of Valor as prophesied,

456
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,839
it will be used by them to make you lose the trust of your disciples and the public.

457
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,440
No.

458
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,560
I won't let Shen Du succeed.

459
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:57,400
Those who offend Huo'e must all die.

460
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,600
Very good.

461
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,040
Go on and demonstrate again the miracle of your rebirth!

462
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,744
Don't move.

463
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,600
Next time we encounter Chen Huo'e,

464
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,240
I will definitely not let her escape again.

465
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,720
You want there to be a next time?

466
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,100
She no longer has any secrets to immortality.

467
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:55,820
With your skills, capturing her should be very easy.

468
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,440
So,

469
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,140
it's news from Pan Chi.

470
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,600
He says among those whom the Huo'e Sect once killed,

471
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,100
there was an old famous physician who mentioned he had treated someone

472
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,240
with displacement of the internal organs.

473
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,600
Based solely on this statement, you deduced

474
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,840
that Chen Huo'e's heart is different from that of an ordinary person.

475
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,680
It's not on the left side.

476
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,500
I wasn't quite sure before.

477
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,640
Until during the entanglement, I confirmed.

478
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,240
Her heartbeat is on the right side.

479
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,800
 - Great Chief.  
 - Come in.

480
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,540
The guard watching the Huo'e Sect disciples reports

481
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,480
- that there's an anomaly. 
 - What's up?

482
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,680
This morning, Chen Huo'e appeared separately in the eastern, western, southern,

483
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,680
and northern parts of the city,

484
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,300
proclaiming the wide-reaching divine powers of the Huo'e Sect.

485
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,460
Not only can they bring people back to life, but they can also create many clones.

486
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:25,240
And suddenly, citizens of Xiang'an City are enshrining all kinds of fire moths.

487
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,740
It seems the ambition of the Huo'e Sect

488
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,000
does not stop within the sect.

489
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,260
Notify everyone to conduct a citywide manhunt for Chen Huo'e.

490
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,904
Yes.

491
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,780
Keep a close watch on my wife.

492
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,820
Don't let her wander around anymore.

493
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,320
Yes.

494
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,140
Let go of me! Let go of me!

495
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:24,320
- Lock them all up in the dungeon. 
  - Yes! 

496
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,880
Great Chief, it's not good!

497
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,380
Great Chief, Madam is missing!

498
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,280
Missing?

499
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,980
Outside Shen Mansion, these thugs from the Huo'e Sect

500
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,820
were hurting people and causing trouble.

501
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,440
 It's important to save people. Open the gate. 

502
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,480
 Great Chief gave orders before he left 

503
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,320
 that before he returned, the doors of Shen Mansion must remain shut. 

504
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,800
 If today, there are commoners 

505
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,080
 encounter an unexpected incident outside the Great Chief's mansion gate, 

506
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,220
 it would be framing the Great Chief as being unkind and unjust. 

507
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:57,070
 Later on, this mansion's gate might truly never open again. 

508
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:00,360
 Open the gate, and save people! 

509
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,520
Madam and I went to save the people but we fell into their ambush.

510
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,140
In the blink of an eye, she vanished.

511
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,200
Go search for her!

512
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,772
Let's go!

513
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,440
 The moths flying to the flame. 

514
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,660
 Live at dawn, die at dusk. 

515
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,740
 The moths flying to the flame. 

516
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,060
 Live at dawn, die at dusk. 

517
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,980
 The moths flying to the flame. 

518
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,420
 Live at dawn, die at dusk. 

519
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,560
 The moths flying to the flame. 

520
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,520
 Live at dawn, die at dusk. 

521
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,580
 - The moths have revived. 
 - The moths have divine powers. 

522
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,520
 The moths have divine powers. 

523
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,820
 The moths have divine powers. 

524
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,200
 The moths have divine powers. 

525
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,840
The moths flying to the flame.

526
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,000
Live at dawn, die at dusk.

527
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,960
 Not entering the cycle of reincarnation. 

528
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,720
Undying.

529
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,760
 Undying. 

530
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,760
 Not entering the cycle of reincarnation. 

531
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,940
 Undying. 

532
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,920
 Not entering the cycle of reincarnation. 

533
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,680
 Undying. 

534
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,200
 The moths flying to the flame. 

535
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,160
 Live at dawn, die at dusk. 

536
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,960
 The moths flying to the flame. 

537
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,240
 Live at dawn, die at dusk. 

538
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,940
 The moths flying to the flame. 

539
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,020

540
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,800
 The moths flying to the flame. 

541
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,780
 Live at dawn, die at dusk. 

542
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,580
 The moths flying to the flame. 

543
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,740

00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,880

 The moths flying to the flame. 

547
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,520
 Live at dawn, die at dusk. 

548
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,500
Shen Du, you can't kill me! Give up!

549
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,960
You're merely a mirror-image person, yet you dare to claim immortality. 
  (Person with reversed organ placement.) 

550
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,300
Truly a Joke!

551
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,944
Shen Du!

552
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,740
Today, let's fight to the death!

553
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,780
Sixth Miss!

554
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,820
Shen Du, we cannot let Chen Huo'e escape!

555
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,920
Shen Du!

556
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,964
Shen Du!

557
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,050
Shen Du!

558
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,328
Shen Du!

559
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,250
Shen Du!

560
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,740
Shen Du, wake up!

561
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:43,668
Shen Du!

562
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,008
Jing Lin!

563
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,912
Shen Du!

564
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,520
Shen Du!

565
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,400
Help!

566
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,840
Someone, help!

567
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,004
Shen Du!

568
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,256
Jing Lin!

569
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,240
Great Chief! Madam!

570
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,400
Shen Du!

571
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,120
Hurry and take him back to the mansion!

572
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,200
Shen Du!

573
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,976
Hurry up!
