00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,880
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,025
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:35,025 --> 00:00:38,223
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,223 --> 00:00:40,592
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,592 --> 00:00:44,467
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,467 --> 00:00:47,602
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,602 --> 00:00:50,767
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,767 --> 00:00:55,803
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,803 --> 00:01:02,075
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,075 --> 00:01:08,483
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,483 --> 00:01:14,662
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,662 --> 00:01:21,175
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,175 --> 00:01:29,019
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:37,153
   

16
00:01:37,153 --> 00:01:40,210
   

17
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,960
I'll take your feelings into account,

18
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,580
and won't make things too difficult for them.

19
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,320
I will give you three days...

20
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,600
to think it over carefully.

21
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,200
Take care, Vice Minister Lai.

22
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,188
Stickler.

23
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,428
Stickler!

24
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,400
Don't cry, Chuichui.

25
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,256
I'm fine.

26
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,736
I'm fine.

27
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,460
Sixth Daughter, you can't just not eat all the time.

28
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,760
Open the door. I will bring you a bowl of soup.

29
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,600
If you have any grievances, once you've eaten,

30
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,000
I'll go with you to storm the Shen Mansion.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,080
I have had a close brush with death.

32
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,660
No matter if it's the White Ghost or the White King of Hell,

33
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,440
I'll make him cry for his parents.

34
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,980
My daughter, I know how much you're suffering.

35
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:21,100
But a woman must have love and appreciation to flourish.

36
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,200
A person who doesn't appreciate you, what use is he to you?

37
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,800
We can't just get knocked down by every little thing.

38
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,800
I promise you to find you a handsome young man

39
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,980
who will cherish you greatly and heed your advice.

40
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,676
How about that?

41
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,840
Handsome young man.

42
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,020
I've come to see Yan Xing.

43
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:56,240
Sixth Miss, it's me, Pan Chi.

44
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,224
 Sixth Miss! 

45
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,530
Sixth Miss has been shutting herself in lately and does not open the door for anyone.

46
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,152
Come in.

47
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,480
She's taken my words to heart?

48
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,400
Madame.

49
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,780
Lady Jin, was there a man who just entered Sixth Miss's room?

50
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,580
Madame, what nonsense are you talking?

51
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,440
What do you mean, a man?

52
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,080
Our Sixth Daughter is a female official of the Ministry of Justice,

53
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,400
not a lady sequestered deep in the household.

54
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,680
Of course, she should meet with guests and deal with official business.

55
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,440
Sixth Miss is naturally virtuous.

56
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,080
Even though Sixth Miss is not my biological daughter, I've watched her grow up.

57
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,120
Everyone knows it.

58
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,200
Previously she married Shen Du.

59
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,080
I was frightened.

60
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,680
I hoped that she would find a good marriage.

61
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,600
But now that she has divorced and returned to the Yan Mansion,

62
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,780
she should at least consider the reputation of the Yan Mansion.

63
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,320
What do you mean?

64
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,780
Don't you know?

65
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,160
Now the entire Yan Mansion is under the watch of the Imperial Inspectorate.

66
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,200
Outside, it's rumored that the daughter of the Yan family

67
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,500
has become an abandoned wife.

68
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,440
If now there are men coming and going,

69
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,580
I'm afraid others would think that our Yan family lacks discipline.

70
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,580
Madame, clearly, it was our Sixth Daughter

71
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,920
who did not want that heartless Shen Du anymore.

72
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,880
How dare you call our Sixth Daughter an abandoned wife?

73
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,100
Let me tell you, Madame. I've tolerated you for a long time.

74
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,400
- I'm at my wit's end with you. 
 - I'm well-intentioned.

75
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,800
What do you mean by well-intentioned?

76
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,560
Stop fighting! Stop fighting!

77
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,240
Stop fighting!

78
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,560
Stop it.

79
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,760
Isn't this family misfortune?

80
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,280
You two, stop it now.

81
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,560
Sixth Daughter!

82
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,040
- I'm with all good intentions. Youâ€¦ 
 - You guys also shush.

83
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,660
Madame. Mother. Stop arguing.

84
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,100
Father, we need to go out for a bit.

85
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,240
Lady Ru.

86
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,840
- You're talking nonsense. 
 - Look.

87
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,900
- Isn't that a man from outside?
- Stop fighting.

88
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,760
- You're still making excuses. 
 - Stop fighting.

89
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,180
- My Lord. 
 - Why are you hitting me?

90
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,820
Look at her. Are you going to do something about her?

91
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,800
Be gentler, you hit my face.

92
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,320
You areâ€¦

93
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,160
You are from Tongming Hall.

94
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,152
You are Yan Xing?

95
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,480
There's a small alley up ahead where you turn.

96
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,780
Leave from there. No one will know.

97
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,600
Why help us?

98
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,960
For the sake of sisterly affection.

99
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,460
For the virtue of women.

100
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,460
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

101
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,140
Please hurry.

102
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,020
They're here.

103
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,560
- Sister! 
 - Quick!

104
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,960
Sixth Miss.

105
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,480
Chuichui.

106
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,032
Quick.

107
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,480
You finally arrived.

108
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,040
I was worried you wouldn't make it out.

109
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,160
Fortunately, it was a close call with no harm done.

110
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,320
 The White Ghost has really joined forces with Lai Luozhi? 

111
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,700
 From now on, I will have nothing to do with Shen Du. 

112
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,080
How did you manage to evade the Imperial Inspectorate's surveillance?

113
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,799
You haven't left your home in days.

114
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,039
That has made Lai Luozhi lower his guard somewhat.

115
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:43,540
It seems Chuichui understood my letter.

116
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,240
 "Salt has ears and eyes."  
  ("Salt" and "Yan" are homophones in Chinese.) 

117
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,840
 "Three days at the pond."  
  ("At" sounds like "pawnshop," whereas "Chi" literally means "pond" in Chinese.) 

118
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,510
 It means around the Yan Mansion, 

119
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,860
 Lai Luozhi's watchers are surveilling. 

120
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,660
 In three days, meet me at the pawnshop. 

121
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,080
 Lu Chuichui is waiting for us at the pawnshop. 

122
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,440
 We will find a way to bypass the secret lookouts. 

123
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,240
   

124
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,660
"Gift to Zhanxin."

125
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,560
It turns out she is Kuang Zhanxin's friend from Tongming Hall.

126
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,400
So her helping me today is because she thinks

127
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,360
I avenged Kuang Zhanxin?

128
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,650
Solving the case and clearing the injustice

129
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,440
was never about seeking a reward.

130
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,300
Today's gains are all for the good intentions of the heart.

131
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,320
A kind of mutual help.

132
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,960
Chuichui, now, Lai Luozhi has unchecked power.

133
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,120
I have thought of a solution.

134
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,840
Why don't you go with Jiang Langxing and temporarily leave Xiang'an?

135
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,020
Get out and lay low for a while.

136
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,760
I feigned compliance with him yesterday.

137
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,480
He should start lowering his guard.

138
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,540
We can take this opportunity to escape.

139
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,740
Sixth Miss, why don't you leave with us?

140
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,640
I need to stay here.

141
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,450
Why?

142
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,320
You can't still be clinging on to the White Ghost, can you?

143
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,328
Take good care of yourself.

144
00:10:32,975 --> 00:10:35,320
Chuichui. Chuichui.

145
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,804
Father.

146
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,200
This is your first long journey.

147
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,240
Remember, nothing is as good as gold.

148
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,180
I have prepared for you much gold.

149
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,120
It's convenient for use on the road.

150
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,200
Come on, put it on your back.

151
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,440
Be careful on the road.

152
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,400
- Be obedient. 
 - Father.

153
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,500
All right, be obedient.

154
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:16,680
   

155
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,880
Stickler!

156
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,400
Chuichui! It's all right now, it's all right now!

157
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,580
Stickler, for my sake, you are leaving Xiang'an

158
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,200
and also giving up the identity of an inspector.

159
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,980
Will you feel regret? Will you feel it's unfortunate?

160
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,120
As long as you are with me,

161
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,860
anywhere is a place for me to make my mark.

162
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,040
Right. From now on,

163
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,560
we shall be a pair of chivalrous heroes who punish the wicked and eliminate the evil.

164
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,216
All right.

165
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,704
- Thank you very much. 
 - Thank you very much.

166
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,240
Take care.

167
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,340
Farewell.

168
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,160
Give it to me.

169
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,168
What do you mean by "disappeared"?

170
00:12:54,168 --> 00:12:57,680
It's my incompetence. Miss Lu and Jiang Langxing have indeed disappeared without a trace.

171
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,320
I'm afraid they have already left Xiang'an.

172
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,600
Then leave the city and search everywhere.

173
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,240
Even if you have to dig three feet into the ground, you must find her for me.

174
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,796
Yes.

175
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,810
She was deceiving you all along.

176
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:15,460
Why pay so much attention to such a woman?

177
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,800
Get out. Get out.

178
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,400
    
 Dongzhou garrison pay respects to Vice Minister Lai.

179
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,560
The Governor of Yangyue City requests to see Vice Minister Lai.

180
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,240
Commandant of Yuanmeng City is here to pay respects.

181
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,800
Vice Minister, the carriages of the noble classes who have come to submit

182
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,940
are crowding the streets near the mansion. They just won't leave.

183
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,380
Now, seven out of ten officials have pledged allegiance under your leadership.

184
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:58,160
We will have difficulty accomplishing things with only the literati.

185
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,400
Are there any movements from the commanders in various places?

186
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,820
All the commandants from the various prefectures have sent letters of allegiance,

187
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,000
all expressing the desire to use the opportunity of the grand assembly

188
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,340
to come to Xiang'an to give thanks to you.

189
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,380
Good.

190
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:13,600
In the six garrison towns, four commandants have pledged allegiance.

191
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,140
The remaining two are not worth of fearing.

192
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,760
The second day of the second month.

193
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,840
It seems that

194
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:30,200
the second day of the second month is a good day.

195
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,080
 The moths flying to the flame. 

196
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,900
 Live at dawn, die at dusk. 

197
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,360
 Not entering the cycle of reincarnation, undying. 

198
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,840
The Ziwei star has appeared. The blessing of Great Cang. 
  (Ziwei is a star in Chinese astrology that is associated with royalty, power, and good fortune.) 

199
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,220
The emperor's blessing is forthcoming. The world for Luozhi.

200
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:52,780
 The emperor's blessing is forthcoming. The world for Luozhi. 

201
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,728
Sixth Miss.

202
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,910
A'Pan.

203
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,460
The Imperial Inspectorate has not yet rescinded its surveillance on the Yan Mansion.

204
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,500
You just come out like that. Aren't you afraid of being implicated?

205
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,960
Lai Luozhi has been trying to implicate me for many times.

206
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,700
I'll accompany you to go out and clear your mind. Why can't I?

207
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:18,180
I've heard that now the Imperial Guards and the Imperial Inspectorate are in cahoots.

208
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,560
From now on, I'm afraid Xiang'an will see no clear skies.

209
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,480
After hearing too many rumors, it's easy to harm one's health.

210
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,320
Better to find some fun.

211
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,920
Madam. Director Yan.

212
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,660
Director Yan, you always claim yourself to be devoted to official duties.

213
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,080
How come you are not to be seen at the Ministry of Justice now?

214
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,780
Instead, you are here flirting with someone who is of no importance.

215
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:01,480
Minister Shen, Sixth Miss has finished her shift. She is affiliated with the Ministry of Justice.

216
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,770
Whom she chats with and whom she makes friends with

217
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,060
are none of the Imperial Guards' business.

218
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,220
Throughout the court of Great Cang, aside from the Imperial Inspectorate,

219
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,480
who would dare not to listen to the word of my Imperial Guards?

220
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,260
Shen Du, just look at what you've become now.

221
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,000
The common people are all saying

222
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,180
The Black and White Kings of Hell walk side by side.

223
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,920
From now on, the human world is a purgatory.

224
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,470
Do you think being shunned by everyone like a venomous snake

225
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,920
is a matter of honor?

226
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,060
Do you still remember the words you once said and the vows you made?

227
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:40,720
People are all subject to change.

228
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:49,120
Sixth Miss, don't waste your words on this kind of person.

229
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,980
Let's go.

230
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:13,800
Sixth Miss, sit here and rest for a while. I'll be right out.

231
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,760
Sixth Miss, do you still remember this is the place where we first met?

232
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,320
When the shadow arrives, at noon there is an endpoint.

233
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,540
With the shadow's length, the explanation is in the endpoint.

234
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,840
This is what you taught me.

235
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,460
Since the moment we first met,

236
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,360
I've imagined what your future would look like.

237
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,900
You will become a female official pleading for the people.

238
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,100
Your reputation will last for centuries.

239
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,260
Now, it is only you...

240
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,480
who still believes in the ambitions in my heart.

241
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,720
In my eyes, you have never been someone's daughter,

242
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,220
nor someone's wife.

243
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,780
You are Yan Xing, the female official of the Ministry of Justice.

244
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:28,180
You are the most formidable case-solving expert in Great Cang.

245
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,540
And even more so, my confidant.

246
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,300
I only hope that you can live freely and happily in the Ministry of Justice

247
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,460
to fulfill your own ambitions.

248
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,580
I will definitely stand behind you silently.

249
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,800
But regretfully, everything has now changed.

250
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,780
The court is full of undercurrents with no fairness or justice to speak of.

251
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,500
You are caught up in it and it has become your burden.

252
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,900
The world is vast and there isn't just one path to officialdom.

253
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,060
Perhaps you are right.

254
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,460
With our power, even if we travel all around the world,

255
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:55,360
we could also settle matters that are unsettled and redress cases of injustice.

256
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,720
Yan Xing, are you willing to join me

257
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,000
to escape this place of disputes and travel the world?

258
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,520
As long as you are willing,

259
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:43,980
I can take the lives of this pair of scoundrels immediately.

260
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,980
If you let them go now,

261
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,700
I'm afraid they won't come back.

262
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,440
That's just right.

263
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,720
To avoid any eyesore.

264
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,420
Rest assured.

265
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,980
I will ensure that the Ministry of Justice vindicates the Shen family.

266
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,900
Itâ€™s just a matter of submitting a report.

267
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,140
Is there anything else you need to explain?

268
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,380
I have already told my family that I will go out and play for a few days.

269
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,420
They are very supportive.

270
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,240
The world is vast and wide.

271
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,040
One can have an open and magnanimous heart

272
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,540
and be untroubled by mundane matters.

273
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,420
Once outside the city,

274
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:33,200
all disturbances are no longer related to you and me.

275
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,260
With the sky as the roof and the earth as the home,

276
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,840
stride the winds with high aspirations.

277
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,500
Your Majesty.

278
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,740
It's all right. I'm fine.

279
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,652
I'm fine.

280
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,172
Your Majesty.

281
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,324
Guardsâ€¦

282
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,220
Your Majesty, take your medicine.

283
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,980
News from the palace.

284
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,880
The Grand Empress Dowager's illness has worsened.

285
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,280
It seems she won't have much time.

286
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,900
In that case,

287
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,680
I shall visit her in person.

288
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,280
Who's there?

289
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,620
Hearing that Your Majesty's condition has worsened,

290
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,900
I'm deeply concerned.

291
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,400
I've come to pay respects to Your Majesty.

292
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,120
I'm fine.

293
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,500
A few days of rest should suffice.

294
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,800
Vice Minister Lai, there's no need to worry.

295
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:42,100
You just focus on doing what you should do in the court.

296
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,460
Be more cautious and compliant,

297
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,520
lest others say you don't understand the rules.

298
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,240
Thanks for your instructions, Your Majesty.

299
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,560
It seems

300
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:03,640
the news that Your Majesty's illness is fatal is not false.

301
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,276
How dare you!

302
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,360
In front of me,

303
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,260
how can you be so disrespectful and impudent?

304
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,580
Don't be angry.

305
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,940
Human life is fragile.

306
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,580
Someone come!

307
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,900
You've come to harm me.

308
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,220
Your Majesty, how could I harbor such intentions?

309
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:42,860
I have always been utterly loyal.

310
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,300
Lai Luozhi,

311
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,120
you were of lowly birth.

312
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,380
Had I not supported you,

313
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:03,100
how would you possess your current status and wealth?

314
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:07,080
Yet you harbor a disloyal heart.

315
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,740
You are worse than a beast.

316
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:17,320
If you were not suspicious or prone to jealousy

317
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,740
and could not tolerate others,

318
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,980
how would you have ended up with today's retribution?

319
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:25,120
I think I have been just to Heaven and Earth

320
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,380
and I have a clear conscience.

321
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,240
I didn't fail Great Cang.

322
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,040
How can I allow you to judge me?

323
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,220
What a phrase, "a clear conscience".

324
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,160
Do you still remember

325
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:43,260
Consort Shu who was framed and driven to death by you?

326
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,144
Consort Shu?

327
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,420
Who on earth are you?

328
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,680
What is your relation to her?

329
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,708
Indeed.

330
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,840
In the vast imperial palace,

331
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,780
who would remember a woman presented by a neighboring country,

332
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,160
a concubine driven to her death?

333
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,730
Of course,

334
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,160
even more so, no one would remember...

335
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,300
her child.

336
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,090
 A'Zhi, 

337
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,440
 you must remember, 

338
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,980
 it was Zhou Xu who killed your mother. 

339
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,320
 Once your father is dead, 

340
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,740
 there is no longer a way for us to survive in the entire palace. 

341
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,520
 The empress and the Zhou clan behind her 

342
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,140
 now have unchecked power. 

343
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,120
 They will not let you live. 

344
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,900
 But do not be afraid. 

345
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,520
 I will protect you. 

346
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,660
 Even in death, 

347
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,280
 I will ensure your survival. 

348
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,480
 Using a mother's death 

349
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,420
 to trade for a son's chance at life. 

350
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,840
 A'Zhi, you must survive! 

351
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,840
 You have to live on 

352
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,120
 and take back everything that belongs to you. 

353
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,950
 Do you understand? 

354
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,800
 Do you understand? 

355
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,600
 A'Zhi. 

356
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,280
The wet nurse used her own son in exchange for my life.

357
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,880
From then on, I became Lai Luozhi.

358
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,180
The wet nurse's pair of twin daughters and I

359
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,520
depended on each other for life.

360
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,120
 Mother! 

361
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,060
 People laugh at the moths flying to the flame. 

362
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,300
 Little do they know they are but mayflies themselves. 

363
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,620
 Mother! 

364
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,500
After my mother's death,

365
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,880
you who have a high status

366
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,400
thought this was but a palace scandal.

367
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,140
You ordered that this matter not be discussed in the palace again.

368
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,780
It is for this very reason

369
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:41,520
the maid who came to Great Cang with my mother, my wet nurse,

370
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,400
fooled everyone...

371
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,360
and took me out of the palace.

372
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,920
That year,

373
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,620
inside the ruins,

374
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:59,160
the charred corpse of that boyâ€¦

375
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,340
My wet nurse's son.

376
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,000
Of similar age to me.

377
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,220
He willingly entered the fire in my place.

378
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,836
It's insane!

379
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,360
It's really insane!

380
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,320
All of this...

381
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,240
was all thanks to you.

382
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,300
It was because of you.

383
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:46,520
So it should be me who repays you this consequence.

384
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,860
What do you want?

385
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,940
You won't live long.

386
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,500
The young emperor has yet to come of age.

387
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,220
I think this world

388
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,500
should be handed over to me,

389
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,260
his uncle.

390
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,640
This throne was rightfully mine.

391
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,240
Only my ascension can better continue the Xiao family's lineage.

392
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,060
The spirit of my late father

393
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:28,120
would also feel deeply consoled on behalf of the ancestors.

394
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,040
Your Majesty,

395
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,440
please write the abdication edict now.

396
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,400
Abdication edict?

397
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,040
Delusional fantasies.

398
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,400
Just think,

399
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:54,540
my sister, Yong'an, is still in custody.

400
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,220
As for Prince Xian,

401
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:00,820
it's time to arrange a good place for him.

402
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,420
How dare you!

403
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,920
I am now the regent.

404
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,560
It was Your Majesty who promoted me to the position.

405
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,300
Yong'an funded troops for a rebellion. There is irrefutable evidence.

406
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,880
From Prime Minister Zhang, I can easily dig out a charge

407
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,060
to imprison Prince Xian.

408
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,620
What's the next step?

409
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:36,560
Your Majesty, can you really not guess it?

410
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:50,520
I entered the palace at the age of 14.

411
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:56,160
I spent my whole life in struggle.

412
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:03,240
But ultimately, I still neglected to guard against others.

413
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,180
You could well wait until after my death.

414
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:11,280
Won't any kind of imperial edict be up to you to fabricate?

415
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:17,120
But you are just a man fishing for fame.

416
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:21,660
You just want to ascend to the throne rightfully.

417
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:25,660
The day of the grand assembly

418
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,180
is also the anniversary of my mother's death.

419
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,759
It's also the final deadline I'm giving you.

420
00:34:30,759 --> 00:34:35,000
When the time comes, my mother will see her son returning in a righteous and dignified manner.

421
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,439
Her death anniversary will be the day her child ascends the throne.

422
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:18,880
 Shen Du, I know what you're up to. 

423
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:45,020
 Counting the days, they should have arrived by now. 

424
00:36:01,354 --> 00:36:03,220
   

425
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,620
This is the boundary marker of Nanlang.

426
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,580
We have finally arrived.

427
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,840
- Master. 
 - Master Chen.

428
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,560
Hey, apprentice, I received your message via the pigeon.

429
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,580
I figured you should have arrived by now.

430
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:27,280
But you have arrived even sooner than expected.

431
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,040
Master, Xiang'an City is now filled with Lai Luozhi's minions.

432
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,420
For safety, we dared not rest on the way.

433
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:43,560
The things you want to know are indeed not simple.

434
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,960
So it turns out you had Master Chen

435
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,880
secretly go to Nanlang to investigate the background of Lai Luozhi.

436
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,940
    
 I heard from Chuichui before

437
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,630
that on the tombstone of Lai Luozhi's mother, there was only the name Bi Luo,

438
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,340
but no family surname.

439
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,380
So I had Yeyun go and investigate.

440
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,000
On the partially burned paper used for worship, there's a drawing of a conch shell.

441
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,790
While on the sacrificial money used by Great Cang for ancestor worship,

442
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,460
such patterns are rare.

443
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,900
I heard that there are people in Nanlang who worship conch shells.

444
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,780
Yeyun found traces of spilled ox blood on the ground.

445
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:16,860
Using ox blood as an offering is exactly a custom of Nanlang.

446
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,740
Master,

447
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:25,030
Bi Luo turns out to be Consort Shu presented to the former Emperor of Great Cang by Nanlang.

448
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:30,560
That's right. However, Bi Luo had an unknown past.

449
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,380
I'm afraid even her own son does not know it.

450
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,120
After the grand assembly tomorrow,

451
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,820
everything will be settled.

452
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,040
After waiting for so many years,

453
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:29,140
if she willingly surrenders the throne tomorrowâ€¦

454
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,360
It is still somewhat lacking something.

455
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,480
   

456
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,940
 Long live Your Majesty! 

457
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:18,540
The tribute envoy from Xichen presents treasures for an audience.

458
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:23,000
The tribute envoy from Nanlang presents treasures for an audience.

459
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,180
Today, all nations come to celebrate.

460
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,240
Together they contribute to the grand occasion.

461
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:46,640
Wishing for cordial diplomatic relations and peace over the four seas.

462
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,860
Stability at the foundation ensures national peace.

463
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:52,420
It is necessary to start anew together with the people.

464
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,430
Only when all under Heaven are of one heart

465
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,460
can glory endure for a thousand years,

466
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,260
ensuring longevity and stability.

467
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:02,440
Selection of talent solely based on virtue will naturally stabilize the world.

468
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:09,280
 Harmonizing the world and ensuring longevity and stability 

469
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,480
 are the responsibilities of a great nation. 

470
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:16,800
 Greetings, Your Majesty! 

471
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,360
 May you live long! 

472
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:30,080
The grand assembly at the court is a universal celebration.

473
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,480
The Grand Empress Dowager is delighted and has recovered from illness.

474
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,960
Her Majesty grants a banquet for the ministers.

475
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,900
 Thanks to the Grand Empress Dowager's great favor. 

476
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,980
The Grand Empress Dowager has just recovered. Her Majesty should not overwork.

477
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:46,120
If the old illness relapses, that would be bad.

478
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,260
Does the Grand Empress Dowager have a decree

479
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:51,620
to be announced during the grand assembly to all officials?

480
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:55,760
Vice Minister Lai, you're more and more ignorant of the rules.

481
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,500
Thanks to Vice Minister Lai's reminder.

482
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,420
I indeed have something to announce.

483
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,140
Recently, I suddenly fell seriously ill

484
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,560
and had no time for court affairs.

485
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,130
The various matters

486
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:14,440
were temporarily entrusted to the Imperial Inspectorate for supervision.

487
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:18,020
Vice Minister Lai has worked quite hard.

488
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:21,260
Now, my health has fully recovered.

489
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,380
The emperor has been

490
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,020
diligently studying the laws of governance with the Senior Tutor.

491
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:31,620
Starting today, Vice Minister Lai is relieved of his duty as regent.

492
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:34,320
He will be relieved of the Imperial Inspectorate's tedious tasks.

493
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,100
Go and rest at ease.
