00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,980
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,026
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:35,026 --> 00:00:38,224
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,224 --> 00:00:40,593
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,593 --> 00:00:44,468
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,468 --> 00:00:47,603
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,603 --> 00:00:50,868
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,868 --> 00:00:55,904
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,904 --> 00:01:02,176
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,176 --> 00:01:08,484
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,484 --> 00:01:14,763
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,763 --> 00:01:21,176
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,176 --> 00:01:29,120
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:37,254
   

16
00:01:37,254 --> 00:01:40,920
   

17
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,960
Unlimited expenses don't mean that corrupt officials can line their own pockets.

18
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,060
How much could that involve?

19
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,440
It could probably shake the entire imperial court.

20
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,480
They have thoroughly angered the Grand Empress Dowager.

21
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,160
This matter has far-reaching implications.

22
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,420
At this moment, there is still no sign of activity.

23
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,460
I'm afraid the Grand Empress Dowager plans to investigate secretly...

24
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,640
and uproot the problem.

25
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,900
So what should we do now?

26
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,240
They might find me disrespectful for rejecting the marriage.

27
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,920
I'm afraid I will be sidelined.

28
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,300
You won't despise me for this. Right?

29
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,600
Your shrewdness is probably too much for this courtyard to hold.

30
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,280
However, my feelings for you, My Lady, are evident for all to see.

31
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,080
The Grand Empress Dowager's decree

32
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,260
instructs the Imperial Guards to investigate Princess Runing and Prince Xian.

33
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,780
Additionally, to monitor the Imperial Inspectorate.

34
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,280
Is the Empress Dowager suspecting Prince Xian?

35
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,800
It's probably not just that.

36
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,900
The Grand Empress Dowager's edict:

37
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,030
"The Imperial Inspectorate shall secretly investigate the actions of the Zhou family

38
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,540
and the Princess of Valor.

39
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,540
Report truthfully without concealment.

40
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,700
Additionally, monitor the Imperial Guards in secret.

41
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,000
If there are any anomalies, report immediately."

42
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,420
I accept Her Majesty's edict.

43
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,800
Madam Xu, I've prepared some fine tea from Junshan Island

44
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,660
brewed with snow water from the Tianshan Mountains.

45
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,140
Won't you stay for some tea?

46
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,660
Tea is too cold in nature.

47
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,420
What a pity I can't taste it.

48
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,020
Vice Minister Lai, no need to see me off.

49
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,540
I hope you carry out the Grand Empress Dowager's order

50
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,980
cautiously and prudently without any mistakes.

51
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:50,360
Thank you for your kind reminder, Madam Xu.

52
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,248
Excellent tea!

53
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,520
Shen Du had the nerve to turn down the marriage bestowed by Mother Empress.

54
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,200
I have underestimated Yan Xing.

55
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,660
How interesting!

56
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:44,580
I didn't expect the cold and merciless Shen Du to actually fall in love.

57
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,020
Anyway, it's good news for us.

58
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,100
If the Imperial Guards side with the Princess of Valor,

59
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:56,700
it will be even harder for you to obtain the position of Prince Regent.

60
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,720
Don't you find it weird that Mother Empress hasn't punished Shen Du severely?

61
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,060
After Mo Qianzhi died, the position of Yingzhou Governor has remained vacant.

62
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,900
I heard that Shen Du had been attacked before he returned to Xiang'an.

63
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,880
He entered the palace to see Mother Empress overnight.

64
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,100
After that, he was bestowed with a marriage.

65
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,740
Too much of a coincidence.

66
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:23,900
I wonder what secrets Shen Du has discovered in Yingzhou.

67
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:32,920
I believe that the Grand Empress Dowager grew distant from Shen Du due to his refusal.

68
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,900
She barely summons him these days.

69
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,420
Some palace maids have reached the age of being sent back to their hometowns.

70
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:42,540
The Grand Empress Dowager summoned Lai Luozhi and bestowed several maids upon him.

71
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:48,400
Anyone with a discerning eye can see that Lai Luozhi is now favored by the Empress Dowager.

72
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,520
The Imperial Inspectorate will eventually overpower the Imperial Guards.

73
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,960
It is too early to say that.

74
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,500
Zhang Baohuan suddenly fell ill.

75
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,380
It's quite suspicious.

76
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:06,780
Sir, I feel that something huge is brewing in the court.

77
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,880
People are unfathomable.

78
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,120
I'll keep a closer watch on the Princess of Valor.

79
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,900
Uncle Lan, he is a friend.

80
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,780
Men of Great Cang are not to be trusted.

81
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,580
He is also after that person.

82
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,540
That person didn't just deceive Saintess Daisi.

83
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,380
- You believe in him? 
 - Yes, I do.

84
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,380
Here.

85
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,248
Thank you.

86
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,472
Thank you.

87
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,280
Uncle Lan, you served Saintess Daisi for many years.

88
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,900
We want to know what happened back then in detail.

89
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,820
It's been over ten years.

90
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,960
Back then, Daisi was still the saintess of the Jinwu Tribe.

91
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,740
After the Jinwu Tribe sent envoys to pay homage to Great Cang,

92
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:14,020
Great Cang also sent envoys to Jinwu in return.

93
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,620
The Jinwu Tribe and Great Cang have been in touch ever since.

94
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,120
The common folks were free to travel back and forth.

95
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,880
Once the saintess was doing charity work on the streetâ€¦

96
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,400
 Easy. There's enough for everyone. 

97
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,800
That's when she met that person.

98
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,120
It was just a random encounter.

99
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,390
 The saintess didn't pay much attention to him 

100
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:41,120
 and soon forgot about this man after she returned. 

101
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,440
Because she was a saintess who was bound for life not to marry

102
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,160
or fall in love with anyone.

103
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,620
She lived solely for the people of Jinwu.

104
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,340
But somehow, they met again very soon.

105
00:09:54,340 --> 00:10:00,200
But this time, they met at the court banquet of the Jinwu Tribe.

106
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,680
 How could it be such a coincidence? 

107
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,680
 - Saintess.  
 - The saintess had rarely met any men.

108
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,560
She was innocent and pure.

109
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,360
But once she fell in love,

110
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,800
she was like a wild horse breaking free of its reins. There was no hiding of her feelings anymore.

111
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,800
After the welcome banquet,

112
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,380
during the days that the envoys stayed,

113
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:25,720
    
 Daisi had frequent contact with the envoys of Great Cang as the saintess.

114
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,720
And she did that to get close to that man from Great Cang.

115
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,180
 What is this? 

116
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,320
 Daisi. Your name. 

117
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:41,460
Unexpectedly, this man proposed to learn the Jinwu language from the saintess.

118
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,400
This man from Great Cang was gifted in language learning.

119
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,920
In just seven to eight days, he learned quite a bit.

120
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,720
And then, the saintess learned that man's name.

121
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,260
Those three characters should be etched in her memory.

122
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,820
But it remained a blur no matter how hard she tried to recall it.

123
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,540
Their feelings for each other grew day by day.

124
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,180
Very soon, they became deeply affectionate.

125
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,260
But the saintess had her duties.

126
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:19,340
In the presence of others, she had to restrain herself.

127
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:24,420
But at that point, all she could see and think about

128
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,400
was that man from Great Cang.

129
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,520
She forgot all about her duties.

130
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,220
But the good times didn't last.

131
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,240
Trouble arose...

132
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,260
very soon.

133
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,120
 Will you come to Great Cang with me? 

134
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,300
 I know you have a special status. 

135
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,740
 I've used all my luck just to meet you. 

136
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,100
 How could I ask for more? 

137
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,100
 No. I will go with you. 

138
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,100
 Of course, I will. 

139
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:05,030
From then on, the saintess could no longer be found.

140
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:10,500
Some said they saw her dressed in the attire of a Great Cang woman,

141
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,220
riding a horse towards Great Cang, following that man.

142
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,220
Jinwu did not want it to be a scandal and proclaimed that

143
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,580
the saintess passed away due to illness and erased her identity.

144
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,400
After that, the Jinwu Tribe severed its tie with Great Cang.

145
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,310
I thought that this man from Great Cang and the saintess

146
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,020
would be together for life.

147
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,840
But to my surprise, not long after,

148
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:46,340
I saw the dying saintess right in this dilapidated house.

149
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,300
 Saintess! Saintess! 

150
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,420
 Saintess, what happened? 

151
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,860
 I am no longer the saintess. 

152
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,260
 Saintess, come back with me. Everything will be fine. 

153
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,680
 It's too late. 

154
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,360
 Where is he? Where is that man? 

155
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,740
 He deceived me. 

156
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,360
 He tricked me into revealing the secret I should keep 

157
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,080
 and teaching him how to control moths with medicinal powder. 

158
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,680
 I was such a fool. Why did I fall for the trick? 

159
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,980
 When I discovered that he bore evil intentions, 

160
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,680
 practiced evil crafts, 

161
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:31,700
 and even tried to manipulate others with those crafts to do his bidding, 

162
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,740
 he harbored the intent to kill me. 

163
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,680
 Saintess! Saintess! 

164
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,960
 Saintess. 

165
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,360
 It's too late. 

166
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,000
 Everything is too late now. 

167
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,720
 I've sinned gravely. 

168
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,220
 - Death will do me justice. 
 - No! No! 

169
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,168
 Saintess! 

170
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:05,020
This man truly deserves to be cut into a thousand pieces; death is too lenient a punishment.

171
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,080
Calm down first.

172
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:16,860
Sooner or later we will catch him and expose him to the world.

173
00:14:22,656 --> 00:14:26,720
Uncle Lan, check these and see if he looks like anyone in there.

174
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,720
This man. It's him. 
    

175
00:14:47,447 --> 00:14:49,680
   

176
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,320
It's the man from Great Cang.

177
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,620
It's him.

178
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,960
You found him? Where is he?

179
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,500
- I'm going to kill him. 
 - Uncle Lan.

180
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,540
Leave it to us.

181
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,780
Rest assured.

182
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,570
I will make this person pay the price

183
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,460
and give Saint Daisi justice.

184
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,300
Are you watching, Saintess?

185
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,140
That man did so many evil deeds.

186
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,400
Surely, karma will get him.

187
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,540
He shall die a miserable death.

188
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,600
Saintess Daisi once saw that treacherous man

189
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,160
teaching someone to burn down a granary with evil crafts.

190
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,160
The saintess denounced him for harming the people of Great Cang.

191
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,400
Yet that treacherous man scoffed and said that

192
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,440
the one who harmed the people of Great Cang wasn't him, butâ€¦

193
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:57,160
but the Grand Empress Dowager of Great Cang.

194
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,020
And the one who made him burn the granary was the Empress Dowager's close relative

195
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:04,040
was the Empress Dowager's close relative from the Zhou family.

196
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,000
When Saintess Daisi fled,

197
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
she took the token of communication between the man and the arsonist.

198
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,420
It is this jade pendant.

199
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,000
Yan Xing,

200
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,540
I hope it's not too late.

201
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,860
   

202
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,940
Empress Dowager, I have something to report.

203
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,780
Minister Lai, what matter do you bring before me?

204
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,060
I wish to impeach Sun Tan,

205
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:47,180
the Marshal of Inspectors in Gannandao, for dereliction of duty.

206
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:52,100
Sun Tan led the inspectors in Gannandao to investigate the case of the Half-faced Demon

207
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,900
as I have personally witnessed.

208
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,680
How did someone with merit end up guilty in your story?

209
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,080
Grand Empress Dowager.

210
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:04,900
I gathered evidence of Sun Tan abusing his power and profiteering from bribery.

211
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,200
I'm presenting them to you.

212
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,000
Your Majesty, please have a look.

213
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:21,700
The Great Cang law states: Taking what is not one's own is theft.

214
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,919
Those in charge who embezzle are guilty.

215
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,740
And those who accept bribes will be sentenced to execution by hanging.

216
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,680
Sun Tan abused his power to amass wealth and collude with bandits.

217
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,440
The evidence is conclusive.

218
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,520
Grand Empress Dowager, please allow me to punish him according to the law.

219
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,010
Grand Empress Dowager,

220
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:43,460
the Imperial Inspectorate may have convicted the suspect through torture.

221
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,180
Has Sun Tan really committed such a heinous crime?

222
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,460
Please consider carefully, Your Majesty.

223
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,920
Great Chief Shen, your courthouse is also known as the Devil's Court.

224
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,740
You have cruel tortures just like we do.

225
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,080
But now, you pretend to be merciful to protect the criminal, Sun Tan.

226
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,120
Why is that?

227
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,570
Enough.

228
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,860
I'm a bit tired now.

229
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,820
Leave the evidence behind.

230
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,240
We will discuss it another day.

231
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,640
- I take my leave. 
 - I take my leave.

232
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,620
Leave us alone.

233
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,720
Prince Xia--

234
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,100
One must be concentrated when pruning branches and leaves.

235
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,840
What do you think?

236
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,040
Doesn't it look much better than before?

237
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,720
Your Highnessâ€¦

238
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,540
Your Highness,

239
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,720
Lai Luozhi has been dominating the court

240
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,460
and detaining officials with random accusations.

241
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,400
Now he's even reached out to Gannandao.

242
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,320
Judging by his conduct, he will be a great threat to you

243
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,860
even if you become the Prince Regent.

244
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,600
Should I find someone to impeach him at the court meeting tomorrow?

245
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,460
Prime Minister Zhang,

246
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,660
withered leaves will eventually fall.

247
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:42,440
Even if we stop the autumn breeze, can we stop the winter snow?

248
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,920
What do you mean, Prince Xian?

249
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,340
Nothing.

250
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,520
These people from Xichen and Nanlang showed up recently. Right?

251
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,360
Yes. Recently, countless nations have come to pay tribute to Great Cang, gathering talented individuals and remarkable figures from across the land.

252
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,160
These people from Xichen and Nanlang came to Xiang'an for a living some time ago.

253
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,800
Pay extra attention during the patrol.

254
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,400
Understood.

255
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,920
Your Highness, it's Shen Du.

256
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,400
I really can't stand it.

257
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,470
How dare the White Ghost openly turn down the marriage

258
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,860
and embarrass Princess Jia'an?

259
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,040
Your Highness, you shouldn't let him off easily.

260
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,200
Shen Du is just like his father.

261
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,300
They don't know what's good for them.

262
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,200
Mother Empress was kind to him.

263
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,500
Yet he doesn't know the importance of seeking support from a patron.

264
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,160
You've watched Jia'an grow up,

265
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,680
spending more time with her than I have as her mother.

266
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,160
Naturally, you would feel for her.

267
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:15,240
The dignity of the royal family matters the most.

268
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,520
Mother Empress has been humiliated.

269
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:23,960
Things won't be easy for Shen Du even if we don't make a move.

270
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,340
Sixth Miss, you are the best!

271
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,500
You've become a Chief Director, yet you still help me sort out the files.

272
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,570
Have you ever looked down on me

273
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:46,160
when I was just a humble clerk?

274
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,500
Right.

275
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,140
Try this.

276
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,320
You brought it from Gannandao?

277
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,480
As expected, it's sweeter than the ones in Xiang'an City.

278
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,400
Here.

279
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,140
The honey from Gannandao is exceptionally sweet.

280
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:09,220
It's not only used for fruits but also human flesh.

281
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,640
Sixth Miss Yan, I hate you!

282
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,660
Lu Chuichui! Lu Chuichui! Lu Chuichui!

283
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,900
How dare you let Director Yan sort out the files for you?

284
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,688
What are you thinking?

285
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:28,700
Didn't you use to boss Director Yan around?

286
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,140
Iâ€¦ that was in the past.

287
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,340
Right, Director Yan?

288
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,840
Director Yan.

289
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,860
Times have changed.

290
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,200
Now we are colleagues of the same rank.

291
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,420
And you are married to the Great Chief.

292
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:56,260
Therefore, I will count on you to look after me from now on.

293
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,420
Please don't say that, Director Wu.

294
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:03,860
Her Majesty was kind enough to make me the Chief Director by honor,

295
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,460
but I'm still staff of the Ministry of Justice.

296
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,880
I will still follow your instructions to work on cases.

297
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,000
I'll count on you to take good care of me.

298
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Fair enough! Fair enough! Fair enough!

299
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,940
Your endless cliche is making me sick.

300
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,128
Feng Gui.

301
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,260
Take a seat.

302
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,300
Since you still see me as the director,

303
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:50,960
I think I should give you some advice.

304
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,260
Now that you are married to Great Chief and have been promoted,

305
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,380
you've become the leading female official.

306
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:09,360
But as the old saying goes, "It doesn't last long to burn oil with fierce fire."

307
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,660
Do you know that the Grand Empress Dowager favors the Black Fiend

308
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,180
over the White Ghost now?

309
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,940
Look at you.

310
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,820
The wives of other high officials

311
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,700
are adept at dealing with people

312
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,900
to learn secrets that may be useful for their husbands.

313
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,180
Who is silly enough to bury her head

314
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:43,680
in files and stay in the morgue all day long?

315
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,360
   

316
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,060
I'm just saying.

317
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:02,400
Vice Minister Lai is in power.

318
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,920
The Grand Empress Dowager indulges and spoils Vice Minister Lai

319
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,140
more than she does with Zhang Baohuan.

320
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:13,120
The Grand Empress Dowager never refuses his request for arrest.

321
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,280
The court officials all feel threatened.

322
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,500
How can Lai Luozhi be so autocratic?

323
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:33,480
So Sixth Miss, think about it.

324
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,780
How can the Black Fiend allow the White Ghost

325
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:40,620
to be on an equal footing with him?

326
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:45,080
To be honest, even if it were me, I would surely hope

327
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:50,240
that there were only one merciless law enforcer.

328
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,360
Thank you for the reminder, Director Wu.

329
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,040
The more I know my husband,

330
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:06,040
the more I realize that he's treading on thin ice in that high position.

331
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:11,180
I don't know court politics. Nor do I know how to help.

332
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:15,200
I can only do my job well and not cause him any trouble.

333
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,140
You don't...

334
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,460
cause him trouble?

335
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,060
 Lai Luozhi is killing innocent people. Can't anyone do something? 

336
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,300
What's going on? What's going on?

337
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,980
 Marshal Xu, if you refuse to deal with it, 

338
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,220
 I'll ask the Grand Empress Dowager in the imperial palace 

339
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,780
 whether Great Cang is still ruled by law. 

340
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,260
Shut up.

341
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,900
Get back to work. I don't care if you're suicidal.

342
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,590
But our staff and I don't want to

343
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:50,380
have our ears cut off by the Black Fiend in the middle of the night.

344
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,960
Brother Xu, what happened?

345
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,280
Lai Luozhi arrested Sun Tan.

346
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,660
Sun Tan? The Marshal of Inspectors of Gannandao?

347
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,460
Wasn't his file delivered to the Judicial Government Office just after the court meeting?

348
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:08,000
The Grand Empress Dowager hasn't given a verdict. How could they arrest him already?

349
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,100
The Imperial Inspectorate took him into custody without a verdict from the Grand Empress Dowager.

350
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,900
But one day in the Imperial Inspectorate's prison means ten fewer years to live.

351
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:20,860
If it goes on like this, Sun Tan might be dead before the Grand Empress Dowager gives a verdict.

352
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:24,980
Vice Minister Lai has been dominant for a very long time.

353
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,900
In the end, it's up to the Judicial Government Office.

354
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,680
Aren't you crying to the wrong people here?

355
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,460
Don't you know the staff at the Judicial Government Office?

356
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,900
They're timid and afraid of trouble.

357
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:39,320
This case was initiated by the Imperial Inspectorate and it involves the inspectors.

358
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,060
They have already handed it over to you.

359
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,660
The Judicial Government Office... My...

360
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,700
My headache! Feng Guiâ€¦

361
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,040
I'm here! I'm here! What's wrong?

362
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,220
Director Wu, rest and recover.

363
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,410
If the Ministry of Justice can't do my buddy justice,

364
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:59,680
I don't mind barging into the palace again.

365
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,640
- Slowly. 
 - Let's go.

366
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:06,000
Director Wu isn't any more courageous than those at the Judicial Government Office.

367
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,280
You're trying your luck with the wrong person.

368
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,960
Yun Que, why are you with Marshal Xu?

369
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,500
I am also an inspector. Why can't I be with Marshal Xu?

370
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,180
Go back to work.

371
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,780
Understood.

372
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,100
I take my leave.

373
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,950
Brother Xu.

374
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:33,100
You have always been outspoken.

375
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,980
Why are you so cautious today?

376
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,380
Don't you remember that I'm also a Sixth-Tier

377
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,180
Chief Director of the Ministry of Justice?

378
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:45,700
Speaking of ranks, I'm on a par with Director Wu.

379
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,680
I also have the authority to try cases.

380
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,620
I can apply to be the presiding judge.

381
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,560
I knew it. Ask Sixth Miss for help.

382
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,320
Sixth Miss, aren't you going to offend Lai Luozhi?

383
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:01,100
Didn't you say you wouldn't cause trouble for Shen Du?

384
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,700
That's right!

385
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,140
I just said I wouldn't cause him trouble.

386
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:13,540
Sixth Miss, I know the court nowadays is filled with intrigue, and Her Majesty's intentions are hard to discern.

387
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,620
Shen Du must be having a hard time.

388
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,840
You'd better stay out of it.

389
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,940
But it concerns you.

390
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,780
And Sun Tan had helped us a lot in Gannandao.

391
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:27,240
He would help us if we were in trouble.

392
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,320
Sixth Miss, thank you!

393
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,560
Since I've agreed to help, we must plan it carefully.

394
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,540
Follow me. Let's go.

395
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,200
Vice Minister, that Sun Tan is tough.

396
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,440
We've tried everything that doesn't kill him, yet he still refuses to talk.

397
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:10,600
Since when did we become so soft and lenient?

398
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,220
It doesn't matter whether he confesses.

399
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,660
As long as he is not in Gannandao,

400
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:21,300
the inspectors there won't be able to do anything.

401
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,700
Whoever tries to block my path

402
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,100
will have a taste of my fierce measures.

403
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:34,500
Brother Xu, do you know what solid evidence Lai Luozhi has against Sun Tan?

404
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,960
Do you know how we became inspectors?

405
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,280
The court recruits chivalrous men to serve as detectives and arresting officers.

406
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,680
Exactly, we managed to spread our network everywhere

407
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,840
and secured more access to information than the court officials

408
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,300
because we were recruited as people from all walks of life

409
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,220
in the first place.

410
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:58,080
Before we were recruited, many were bandits who robbed people

411
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,020
or skilled thieves with nimble fingers like me.

412
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:04,280
We couldn't just sever our ties with our old friends.

413
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,700
Lai Luozhi could easily pin any charges on anyone.

414
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:12,700
I'm worried that Sun Tan isn't the only target in this case.

415
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,040
Lai Luozhi may have been arrogant and domineering,

416
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,780
but he has never dared to provoke us.

417
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,660
Now that the Half-Faced Demon case has just been solved,

418
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:24,680
the Gannandao is in dire need of rebuilding, yet he has arrested Sun Tan.

419
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,880
Was he targeting the inspectors or Gannandao?

420
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,810
Sixth Miss, you just came back

421
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:32,840
and may not know what had happened in Xiang'an.

422
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,500
The secluded Mingsheng Temple, where Elder Princess Runing resides,

423
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,740
is often visited by the carriages of the Princess of Valor.

424
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:42,080
Elder Princess Runing and Princess Yong'an?

425
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,880
His Majesty is young and slow in speech.

426
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,340
How much longer can the Grand Empress Dowager reign over Great Cang?

427
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,440
Nowadays, many people believe that the Princess of Valor is more likely

428
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,880
to gain power than Prince Xian.

429
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:56,120
Has Elder Princess Runing decided to support the Princess of Valor?

430
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,340
Elder Princess Runing holds the highest status in the Xiao family.

431
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:03,040
If she takes a stance, it'll surely change the dynamics in the court.

432
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,100
Moreover, the reconstruction of Ming Hall was close to an end,

433
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,100
yet they slowed it down.

434
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,600
You can even say that they've stopped their work.

435
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,180
It happened shortly after we returned from Gannandao?

436
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:17,700
Also, Xiang'an has seen a lot more foreigners from Nanlang and Xichen recently.

437
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,040
Each thing may seem quite random on its own.

438
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,040
But if you connect themâ€¦

439
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,840
Could there be some connections there?

440
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,160
Sixth Miss, I stand by what I said.

441
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,460
So many people in the court are watching you and your husband.

442
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,260
I bet you know that.

443
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,720
I won't blame you if you decide not to help me.

444
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:43,460
Brother Xu, we survived multiple attacks on the way back from Yingzhou,

445
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,420
thanks to the help of the inspectors.

446
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,700
If not for this token, I wouldn't be able to see you today.

447
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:54,020
It's time to return it to its rightful owner.

448
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,780
Sixth Miss,

449
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:04,940
Sun Tan may not come out of the Imperial Inspectorate unscathed.

450
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,000
But if he has been wronged or has something to say,

451
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,980
As his older brother, I will definitely help him.

452
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,440
Can you think of a way to let me see Sun Tan?

453
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:22,560
I will draft an application to be the presiding judge right now.

454
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,980
Sun Tan may be locked up in the Imperial Inspectorate,

455
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:29,140
but the presiding judge should at least be able to question him.

456
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:37,700
Sixth Miss, I will go with you.

457
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,630
   

458
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,000
He'sâ€¦ He's bleeding so much. Will he die?

459
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,630
Do you think anyone would care about his life and death here?

460
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,400
Go back and wait for me if you're scared.

461
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,600
I am Yan Xing, the sixth-rank Chief Director of the Ministry of Justice,

462
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,200
presiding over the case of Sun Tan.

463
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,400
I'm here to summon Sun Tan for interrogation.

464
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,500
Sun Tan is a serious criminal of the Imperial Inspectorate.

465
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,100
I'm afraid you have no right to summon him.

466
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,400
Can I at least interrogate him in his cell?

467
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,200
Only two people are allowed in.

468
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,750
Wait for me at the Ministry of Justice.

469
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,800
Then I'll wait for you outside.

470
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,800
   

471
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,900
Marshal Sun.

472
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,500
Marshal Sun.

473
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,300
Marshal Sun.

474
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,900
It's me, Yan Xing.

475
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,200
Have you joined that villain?

476
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,000
I was made the presiding judge.

477
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,200
I'm here to do you justice.

478
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,200
The Imperial Inspectorate accuses you of accepting bribes

479
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,700
and colluding with bandits.

480
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,800
Tell me if you were wronged. I'll report it.

481
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,400
It's pointless.

482
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,920
It's pointless.

483
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,700
If there is injustice,

484
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:20,100
Marshal Xu and the other inspectors will risk their lives to rescue you.

485
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,200
I will also give it my all to seek justice for you.

486
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,400
The more you help, the more people will die.

487
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,000
Just leave.

488
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,000
Sun Tan.

489
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,900
I'm not dead yet.

490
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,600
Marshal Xu.

491
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,000
    
 This token is still waiting for you.

492
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,100
Hang in there.

493
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,300
   

494
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:27,700
Director Yan, I have something to say.

495
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,700
All right, I'll take notes.

496
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,000
Most of the inspectors came from all walks of life.

497
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,400
We were all captivated by Marshal Xu's aura

498
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,400
and joined the group as inspectors.

499
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,800
In Gannandao,

500
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:58,800
I naturally hoped to build wide connections with the talented as Marshal Xu did.

501
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,200
So-called "collusion with bandits".

502
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,200
What about accepting the bribes?

503
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,800
This I can't deny.

504
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,100
I did take money.

505
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,800
Gannandao has many merchants coming and going.

506
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,700
We inspectors protect them from bandits.

507
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,500
They pay us to show their gratitude.

508
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,900
I used that money to treat my buddies.

509
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,000
You can defend yourself and find the merchants

510
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,400
to testify for you to get a lighter sentence.

511
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,800
Sixth Miss, how come you just don't get it?

512
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,400
Lai Luozhi wants to take out the leader of the inspectors in Gannandao.

513
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,200
Marshal Sun, do you know the reason?

514
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,100
After Mo Qianzhi died,

515
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:49,900
Lai Luozhi put his people in Yingzhou as officials.

516
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,800
Gannandao is a key location at the border leading directly to Xichen.

517
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,800
People can even take a detour via Gannandao all the way from Nanlang.

518
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,600
Without the inspectors there, the borders...

519
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:08,200
Xiang'an has seen a lot more foreigners from Nanlang and Xichen.

520
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,200
It seems Lai Luozhi intends to dominate Gannandao.

521
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,100
But what he's aiming for is far beyond that area.

522
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:19,600
He's probably plotting with foreign powers to commit treason.

523
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,800
Marshal Xu.

524
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:31,400
You'll need evidence even if you want to frame me.

525
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,200
Madam Shen,

526
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,800
you came to visit my workplace,

527
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,600
yet you keep slandering me.

528
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,000
It really put me in a difficult position.

529
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,100
As the presiding judge of this case,

530
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,000
I tried the main suspect Sun Tan

531
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,300
and recorded his testimony based on procedures.

532
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,500
The inspector accompanied me for assistance.

533
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,200
There was nothing inappropriate.

534
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,600
Is that so?

535
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,400
Madam Shen seems to have become more sharp-tongued.

536
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,800
That was the preliminary trial.

537
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,400
Once I organize the case files and hand in the report,

538
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,600
I will be back for the second trial.

539
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:16,000
Vice Minister Lai, you are obliged to ensure the safety of the suspect.

540
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,900
It depends on his fate.

541
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:28,700
No one can be guaranteed to stay alive in our jail here.

542
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,848
How dare you!

543
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:39,100
Marshal Xu. Director Yan. Go back.

544
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,900
I don't intend to keep you and Madam Shen here today.

545
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,400
Don't be so nervous.

546
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,600
However, I do have a word of advice.

547
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:23,500
The criminals arrested by the Imperial Inspectorate won't be freed so easily.

548
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,800
You'd better think twice about what to note down,

549
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:34,800
what to report, and what to keep to yourselves.

550
