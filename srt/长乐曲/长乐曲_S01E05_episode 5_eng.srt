00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,950
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,993
♫  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  ♫

4
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:38,291
♫  The past hides blood and tears  ♫

5
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:40,660
♫  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  ♫

6
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,535
♫  The truth cannot be fully revealed  ♫

7
00:00:44,535 --> 00:00:47,670
♫  Fate is full of twists and turns  ♫

8
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,835
♫  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  ♫

9
00:00:50,835 --> 00:00:55,871
♫  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  ♫

10
00:00:55,871 --> 00:01:02,143
♫  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  ♫

11
00:01:02,143 --> 00:01:08,351
♫  At least you share my joy and sorrow  ♫

12
00:01:08,351 --> 00:01:14,730
♫  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  ♫

13
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:21,143
♫  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  ♫

14
00:01:21,143 --> 00:01:29,087
♫  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  ♫

15
00:01:29,087 --> 00:01:37,221
   

16
00:01:37,221 --> 00:01:40,256
   

17
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,440
Thank you for what you've done today.

18
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:53,240
I think you should thank someone else.

19
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,840
Indeed, it bears a striking resemblance to my writing.

20
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,040
But still, you weren't deceived.

21
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,740
And it's not just me, is it?

22
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,200
The Grand Empress Dowager?

23
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,300
The statement has unyielding righteousness.

24
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,600
But between the lines, a feminine style occasionally emerges.

25
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,760
Yan Xing was strongly recommended by Prime Minister Zhang back in the day.

26
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,380
But now she seems intent on helping you.

27
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:28,500
I think this matter is quite ingenious.

28
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,880
Why would the Grand Empress Dowager…

29
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,920
You have married a virtuous wife.

30
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,560
The Grand Empress Dowager must have taken to heart that nursery rhyme.

31
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,800
The task she's given you is tough.

32
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,120
Be sure to be careful and cautious.

33
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,988
I will.

34
00:03:11,071 --> 00:03:15,110
   

35
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,120
It seems I have wronged Madam.

36
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,380
In difficult times, she's compassionate and loyal.

37
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,980
If she didn't write it, wouldn't I be able to speak for myself?

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,520
Rescuing me is a pretense.

39
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,760
She wishes to use this opportunity to overturn the case of Chen Baiyi, who committed suicide.

40
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,280
How dare she use you?

41
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,200
She dares to use me. Despicable.

42
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,300
Never mind. She just wants to seek justice for Chen Baiyi.

43
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,800
How did she know my handwriting?

44
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,320
She entered your study.

45
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,120
No wonder the imitation was so convincing.

46
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,979
I didn't expect her to have the skill to imitate handwriting.

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,300
Great Chief, she has tampered with your memorial.

48
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,440
Should we…

49
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,480
Keep her.

50
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,280
Let's see what other tricks she might pull.

51
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,640
However, there is something that must be handled immediately.

52
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,520
Prince Xian. Prince Xian.

53
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,880
Something's happened. Outside.

54
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,080
Prince Xian Xiao Zhong receive the decree.

55
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,280
I, Xiao Zhong, will receive the imperial order.

56
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,900
Complying with Heaven and the times, here comes the edict.

57
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,200
I order Prince Xian Xiao Zhong to the Fengxiang Prefecture to inspect and issue decrees.

58
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,820
Prince Xian Xiao Zhong upholds the virtues of civil and martial grace,

59
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,800
embraces the capacity for governance and economy,

60
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,920
and cultivates benevolence and righteousness in his character.

61
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,180
He has the loyalty and courage to accomplish tasks,

62
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,780
and the virtue and talent to bring prosperity to a region.

63
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,480
Nowadays, Fengxiang Prefecture is suffering from a severe drought,

64
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,440
which requires planning, commanding,

65
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,160
and governance under absolute authority.

66
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,660
So I order Prince Xian to make an inspection tour to oversee the whole process,

67
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,420
enhance our nation's prestige, and soothe the hearts of the people.

68
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,160
Let the one in charge enforce it.

69
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,580
I, Xiao Zhong, receive the imperial order and express gratitude.

70
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,560
When shall I depart?

71
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,120
Replying to Prince Xian. The Grand Empress Dowager has decreed.

72
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,080
This matter is of great importance and cannot be delayed for a moment.

73
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,640
Prince Xian, on this journey, you will be escorted by the Imperial Guards.

74
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,020
The Great Chief has already made arrangements.

75
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,040
Prince Xian, please relocate with peace of mind.

76
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,670
All right.

77
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,760
While I'm away, you must take good care of these flowers.

78
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,520
Now the temperature difference between morning and evening is significant.

79
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,400
It is best to water at the hour of Si, 
  (In the morning, specifically from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a..) 

80
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,160
especially my Imperial Yellow Peony.

81
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,960
Yes.

82
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,120
Let's go.

83
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,720
Prince Xian, please.

84
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,800
 I wonder if the memorial had any effect. 

85
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,840
Madam! Madam!

86
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,080
Madam.

87
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,480
News has come from the palace.

88
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,800
The Great Chief has left the palace.

89
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,400
You should be relieved now.

90
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,480
Please retire early.

91
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,520
All right, I will wait a bit longer.

92
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,340
All right.

93
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,520
Madam, this is osmanthus and lotus seed soup.

94
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,600
Please drink it while it's hot.

95
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,920
 This maid looks very unfamiliar. 

96
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:28,832
   

97
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,880
Prime Minister.

98
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,520
Sixth Miss Yan, indeed, you are exceptionally intelligent.

99
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,160
Shen Du was taken to the palace earlier and has not yet returned.

100
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,120
If you are here about the progress of the case,

101
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,720
I'm afraid you will return empty-handed.

102
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,880
I know the whereabouts of Shen Du.

103
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,760
I met with you today to understand the Yan family's position.

104
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,780
I do not understand. Please be explicit, Prime Minister.

105
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,080
Grand Empress Dowager was furious after hearing the street rhymes.

106
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,740
She immediately issued an order asking Prince Xian

107
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,920
to supervise the disaster relief efforts in Fengxiang Prefecture.

108
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,720
When he left, he wasn't even allowed to bring his attendants.

109
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,700
Even the route of his tour was kept secret.

110
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,600
Prime Minister,

111
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,940
do you think the Empress Dowager suspects Prince Xian is behind the rhyme incident,

112
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,940
and thus wants to take action against him?

113
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,360
But even a tiger will not eat its cubs.

114
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,300
The mountains are high and the roads are long. If there really is an issue,

115
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,600
it will be too late.

116
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,799
I ask you.

117
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:45,300
The Grand Empress Dowager controls the government, disregarding the legitimacy of the Great Cang dynasty.

118
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,720
What was the previous emperor's surname?

119
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,560
Does the Yan family still remember that?

120
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,240
I am wholeheartedly investigating cases to redress grievances.

121
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,680
A woman like me truly does not understand the affairs of the court,

122
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,900
let alone take on a significant responsibility in it.

123
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,440
Naive.

124
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,600
You want to enter the royal court while being involved in a case,

125
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,480
and you hope to remain uninvolved?

126
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,360
Not to mention you, Sixth Miss Yan,

127
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,120
even the Yan family cannot escape involvement.

128
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,240
The Grand Empress Dowager prioritizes the state above all.

129
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,840
Perhaps you are overthinking it.

130
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,040
Can a series of linked cases and a single rhyme

131
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,120
really stir up such a big commotion?

132
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,560
Buddha absorbs sin.

133
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,720
This nursery rhyme is quite malicious,

134
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,280
directly suggesting that the Grand Empress Dowager's position is illegitimate.

135
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,940
If it spreads, not just Prince Xian will be in danger.

136
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,760
Prime Minister, what do you want me to do?

137
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,600
My men found out

138
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,240
that the Shen family uses carrier pigeons to issue orders and convey messages.

139
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,260
During Prince Xian's journey, they will surely use carrier pigeons to report back as well.

140
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,860
You should hurry and find the route of Prince Xian.

141
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,820
When the time comes, whether Shen Du intends to assassinate Prince Xian

142
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,740
or to genuinely protect him,

143
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,080
we can all prepare in advance.

144
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,060
Carrier pigeons?

145
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,000
Wife, you are in your home.

146
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,560
Why sneak around behaving like a thief?

147
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,660
Great Chief, I have been eagerly waiting for you.

148
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,080
When did you come back?

149
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,200
The Grand Empress Dowager didn't make things difficult for you, did she?

150
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,160
You had me worried all night.

151
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,220
Sixth Miss Yan, why put on an act?

152
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,480
Do you think this will ingratiate you with me?

153
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,240
You don't buy it.

154
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,400
Forget it then.

155
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,220
Are you happy now?

156
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,720
As a clerk in the Ministry of Justice,

157
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,080
you should know what crime it is to forge a memorial.

158
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,840
Moreover, your mere words caused so many issues in the court.

159
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,160
I was just anxious to save my husband.

160
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,040
I've never written a memorial before.

161
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,780
How would I know what should be written and what should not?

162
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,940
Save me?

163
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,840
I'm afraid you're using me as a pawn.

164
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,880
The night is deep and the dew is heavy.

165
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,800
Great Chief, let's hurry inside to rest.

166
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,460
The gifted scholar from a humble family, Chen Baiyi, lit himself on fire at the Great Cang Ming Hall.

167
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,440
The articles written with painstaking effort over many years were all stolen.

168
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,680
If there are no fair officials in Great Cang,

169
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,140
when will the decayed investigations cease?

170
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,780
Guys, we toil in reading poetry and books,

171
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,120
yet we can only serve as study companions to the noble classes' sons. Why?

172
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,940
We can only be their shadows. Why?

173
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,620
- We will not put up with this. 
  - No more, no more. 

174
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,320
Look at you, a bunch of destitute losers.

175
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,860
Without the noble classes,

176
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,100
you wouldn't even be worthy to enter the doors of the Hongwen School.

177
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,000
Yet you dream of making a name for yourselves.

178
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,040
Let me tell you, you were born lowly.

179
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,560
What did you say?

180
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,200
You are fools who can only steal articles.

181
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,940
Stop fighting.

182
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,320
Stop. Stop fighting.

183
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,380
Stop it.

184
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,440
What a disgrace.

185
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,040
What a disgrace indeed.

186
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,140
These are all the same empty words.

187
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,480
For the Ming Hall self-immolation case,

188
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,580
have the Imperial Guards made any progress?

189
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,000
Reporting to the Grand Empress Dowager.

190
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,580
The Imperial Guards have further verified and clarified the facts.

191
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,120
It is indeed as previously stated,

192
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,160
the student Chen Baiyi had his articles stolen by the eldest son of the Jin family.

193
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,260
He was driven out by the Jin family when he contested the matter

194
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,980
and was publicly shamed and beaten.

195
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,020
He harbored resentment in his heart but he had no recourse to official justice.

196
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:51,160
Ultimately, he self-immolated to make his conviction known.

197
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,560
The students of the Hongwen School caused a disturbance that has yet to abate.

198
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,400
News has come again from Jiangnan.

199
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,560
Look! Take a look!

200
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,400
Exam papers cannot travel the great path of humanity.

201
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,260
It is difficult to pass exams to the righteous eyes of the world.

202
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,040
Is this how the scholars in our nation

203
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,520
view our talent recruitment process?

204
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,560
 - Grand Empress Dowager, please calm down. 
 - Grand Empress Dowager, please calm down. 

205
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,740
Mother Empress, selecting talent is an important affair of the state.

206
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,440
The noble classes shouldn't have tried to maintain their ranks with it

207
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,160
and caused such disputes.

208
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,480
In my humble opinion,

209
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,900
be it a humble background or a noble class,

210
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,580
let them compete together.

211
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:36,440
By overcoming difficulties, we can select the wise and capable.

212
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,040
I disagree.

213
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,400
Acquiring office through family prestige is an ancestral system.

214
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,640
How can it be changed so easily?

215
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,840
I'm afraid Princess of Valor

216
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,640
has spent too much time composing poems and matching verses

217
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,240
with those students from humble backgrounds

218
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,000
and has lost her judgment for a moment.

219
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,360
The offspring of the humble homes are also citizens of Great Cang.

220
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,120
I only spoke a little in their favor,

221
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,560
and why would Prime Minister Zhang react so strongly?

222
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,960
Could it be that you were already aware of that Jin kid deceiving superiors

223
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,920
and deluding subordinates?

224
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,520
Grand Empress Dowager, I beg for your discernment.

225
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,800
I have only the welfare of Great Cang in mind.

226
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,800
Selecting officials can't be based only on literary talent.

227
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,560
Family heritage should also be considered.

228
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,480
Prime Minister Zhang, your words are amiss.

229
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,360
Stubbornly adhering to the special privileges of noble classes

230
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,260
has already led to so much fraud and corruption.

231
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,880
It is only right to place the virtuous in their positions.

232
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,160
Grand Empress Dowager,

233
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,420
the deceased in the Ximing Temple serial case were all descendants of noble classes.

234
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,940
Perhaps some member of a humble family was enticed

235
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,080
and committed the act.

236
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,200
Enticed?

237
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,040
It is appropriate to dredge, not to block.

238
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,640
Suppression will never be the solution.

239
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,220
It's such a simple truth.

240
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,640
Prime Minister Zhang, how could you not know?

241
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,640
Are you trying to make the Grand Empress Dowager bear a bad name

242
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,780
for being unjust to all the humble homes?

243
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,880
My loyalty to the Grand Empress Dowager is as clear as the sun and the moon.

244
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,640
If we open up a gap in the path to officialdom,

245
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,140
it is absolutely impermissible. Grand Empress Dowager!

246
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,480
All right, Prime Minister Zhang.

247
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,120
Please get up.

248
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,760
This argument of yours is for the sake of Great Cang.

249
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,200
Minister Shen.

250
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,460
Haven't you found out the truth about the Ming Hall Self-immolation Case?

251
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,460
What do you think?

252
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,600
Among the offspring of humble families, there are indeed talented individuals.

253
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,320
They indeed need an opportunity.

254
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,160
I believe we can choose a fair assessment method to seek the worthy

255
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,120
for the Grand Empress Dowager to review.

256
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,920
I think we should take the Hongwen School as a pilot.

257
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,400
We can select the worthy from humble families to study there.

258
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,180
 - The Grand Empress Dowager is wise. 
 - The Grand Empress Dowager is wise. 

259
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,900
You're here.

260
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,240
Miss, please sit over here.

261
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,200
Come, sit.

262
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,280
All thanks to you,

263
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:27,240
my unfilial grandson has passed away in peace.

264
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,420
Great Chief, do you still want these corpses?

265
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,280
The essay written by Scholar Chen was highly praised by the students.

266
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,600
I've fetched a copy for you.

267
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,640
What a pity.

268
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,480
I can't read.

269
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,640
I'll read it to you.

270
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,400
"Xizhou Melody"

271
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,960
I remembered the plum as I descended Xizhou,

272
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,560
and I picked plums to send to the north of the river.

273
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,320
 The garment is in apricot red… 

274
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,680
Madam keeps taking on tasks for herself.

275
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,280
But the fairness and justice she desires...

276
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,480
are not so easy to come by.

277
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,540
I didn't expect you to have such foresight.

278
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,140
What's wrong?

279
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,580
Grand Empress Dowager has decreed to take the Hongwen School as a pilot

280
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,260
to select the worthy from humble families to study there.

281
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,080
Really?

282
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:26,300
I mean I would never dare take credit for this matter.

283
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,700
This is all thanks to your mediation, Great Chief.

284
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,360
You are sure to gain a reputation for acute observation

285
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,300
among the students from humble backgrounds.

286
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,960
How wonderful. I'm so happy for you.

287
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,520
Do I care about these?

288
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,940
Before taking any further action, let me know in advance.

289
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,960
Otherwise, I will not let it go easily.

290
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,840
Indeed.

291
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,280
You are called White Ghost. What reputation do you still want?

292
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,720
What are you doing again in the middle of the night?

293
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,160
I'm going to get some exercise, go for a run.

294
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,240
How can I sleep beside White Ghost if I don't wear myself out running?

295
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,680
Madam.

296
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,360
Does she go for a run every night?

297
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,400
Madam says it helps with her sleep.

298
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,280
It is indeed bright.

299
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,980
But the light is still the same as before.

300
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,400
Do you also think it's bright?

301
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,760
Everyone in the house is used to it.

302
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,500
I recall that in Xichen, there is a type of fabric that can block out light.

303
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,200
- Go make a canopy. 
 - Yes.

304
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,260
Also, don't light the lamps over there anymore.

305
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,080
Save where you can.

306
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,910
Yes.

307
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,010
Great Chief.

308
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,520
You have already barged in.

309
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,390
Come in.

310
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,760
Come down now.

311
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,920
The identities of the twelve bodies at Ximing Temple have been verified.

312
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,660
Most of these paired corpses knew each other well in life.

313
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,000
They were often seen together.

314
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,940
However, there are two pairs, for whom no entanglements have been found prior to their deaths.

315
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,440
I thought the Imperial Guard handled matters efficiently.

316
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,280
What's taking so long?

317
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,440
The male corpses are all from noble classes.

318
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,620
Based on their appearance and clothing, they can be quickly identified.

319
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,880
But those female corpses had their looks destroyed and lacked household registration records.

320
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,340
It indeed will take some time.

321
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,320
And their disappearance time

322
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,920
does not match with the time of death.

323
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,760
No match?

324
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,040
- Even for the male victims? 
 - Yes.

325
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,800
At least a difference of two to three months,

326
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,920
and at most one or two years.

327
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,920
The perpetrator held the victims captive for such a long time!

328
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,160
Indeed, this would increase the risk.

329
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,600
Do the female victims match the missing courtesans' list that the inspector investigated?

330
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,040
Yes, they are the courtesans who went missing from various places.

331
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,120
You're saying they were all courtesans?

332
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,420
Yes.

333
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,040
- That's not right. 
 - What's not right?

334
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,320
The jewelry found on these female corpses is not right.

335
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,240
Come, take a look at this.

336
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,160
 It's really exquisite. 

337
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,280
 The quality is evidently good. 

338
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,400
 It is quite beautiful. 

339
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,420
I found it strange that day.

340
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:05,400
These pieces of jewelry, compared to other ornaments, seemed too exquisite.

341
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,860
They don't seem to be from a regular goldsmith.

342
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,940
These things should not be easily obtainable by normal courtesans.

343
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,480
I am not very familiar with these.

344
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,290
But Chuichui has mentioned that well-known craftsmen

345
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:21,900
tend to leave a signature mark on their work.

346
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:30,360
The goldsmiths of Bijiang Gold Workshop once created jewelry for nobles in the royal treasury.

347
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,440
After opening for just over ten years, the workshop has surpassed many centuries-old workshops,

348
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,580
- becoming the best in the city. 
 - Please take care.

349
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:42,900
Esteemed guests have arrived, may I know what you wish to select?

350
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,740
Hairpins. Bring us the best ones you have here.

351
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,356
Yes.

352
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,840
Madam, do you find anything satisfactory?

353
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,500
This one…

354
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,840
- Madam has a good eye indeed. This is… 
 - How much is it?

355
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,752
Fifty taels.

356
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,540
I told you average courtesans couldn't afford it. Right?

357
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:44,380
Husband, I want the good-looking ones.

358
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:48,520
When the shopkeeper comes, can we have him present the store's treasures?

359
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:57,300
Zisun Tea is the current imperial tribute,

360
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,700
and the Zisun tea from Yangxian is considered the finest.

361
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,160
Previously, I was fortunate enough to be rewarded with some.

362
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,720
I kept it at home, never willing to drink it. But you are so generous.

363
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,760
This is our master's private collection, offered only when esteemed guests arrive.

364
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,960
Has the manager not arrived yet?

365
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,480
The Great Chief and his wife are here.

366
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,040
I wonder to what do I owe the pleasure?

367
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:28,920
If I'm not mistaken, you are Manager Yang working for the Princess of Valor.

368
00:25:29,715 --> 00:25:31,500
   

369
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,210
The Great Chief has good eyesight.

370
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:38,180
You even remember me, a lowly servant.  I am flattered and surprised.

371
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:44,140
These gold ornaments, do you recognize them?

372
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,080
Some of them did come from Bijiang Gold Workshop.

373
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,600
Good. I want the list of people who bought these gold ornaments.

374
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:13,000
Great Chief, this would really stump your servant.

375
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,780
We open the doors to welcome guests.

376
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,640
With so many customers coming and going,

377
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,510
the jewelry sold over the years is countless.

378
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,780
How could one remember them all?

379
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,240
A hairpin that costs fifty taels each.

380
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:30,380
Even if an ordinary person spends their entire fortune on it, they couldn't buy it many times. Right?

381
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,660
If you can't provide the account book,

382
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:38,360
you might as well tell me who can.

383
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,688
But…

384
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,080
The Imperial Guards is working on a case.

385
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,810
If you hide anything, can you bear the consequences?

386
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,780
Please wait a moment, Great Chief.

387
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,760
I will go and fetch it right away.

388
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,924
This one is good.

389
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:34,720
Let's go with this one. It's simple. It suits you.

390
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,840
Are you giving it to me?

391
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,960
Don't tell me that I have to pay for it myself.

392
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:21,940
The gold jewelry worn by the female victims truly werequite expensive.

393
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,960
The courtesans were not on the list of those who bought these designs.

394
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,740
But there are a few familiar names.

395
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,960
The male victims?

396
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:45,160
That's right. They spared no expense for a smile from a beauty.

397
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,020
This seems like a muddled accountbook.

398
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,940
Many shipments were only recorded as banquets

399
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,140
without quantities nor specific destinations.

400
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:05,700
The gold workshops often hold banquets inviting the noblewomen of the town.

401
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,480
They must have been given away.

402
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,740
Such a lavish gesture.

403
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,680
That Manager Yang is really formidable.

404
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,600
The formidable one is someone else.

405
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:22,420
Manager Yang is close to the Princess of Valor,

406
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:25,220
whose rank and status are beyond that of an ordinary palace person.

407
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,000
But just now, in front of you,

408
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,140
she repeatedly claimed to be your servant and obediently handed over this register.

409
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,600
She seems to be afraid of offending you.

410
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,080
She was playing dumb but actually a tiger.

411
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,520
So she didn't want you to continue investigating the gold workshop.

412
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:46,900
Behind her, it is very likely to be the Princess of Valor.

413
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:52,160
Could it be that they wish to use the banquets to win over the ladies of various officials' households

414
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,420
and then through their intimates, to understand the thoughts and movements of each mansion?

415
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,080
 No wonder Prime Minister Zhang is so wary of her. 

416
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,620
Are you familiar with the Princess of Valor?

417
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:14,340
The Princess of Valor is deeply favored.

418
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:19,380
On the surface, she appears to enjoy herself all day, but in reality, she's very astute and cunning.

419
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:23,000
But you needn't worry. I estimate she will come looking for you soon.

420
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,200
What does that mean?

421
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,680
- Great Chief. 
 - Come in.

422
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,920
Princess of Valor sent an invitation…

423
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:42,260
Princess of Valor sent an invitation to invite Madam to attend the Floral Banquet.

424
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,180
    
 Isn't this the Grand Chief's wife?

425
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,620
Doesn't she have someone to comb her hair?

426
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,980
I just saw Madam Wu, and she did not look well.

427
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:55,140
I heard that her husband had a courtesan outside.

428
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,120
Who made her so thoughtless back then

429
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,240
insisting on marrying that minor official in the Ministry of Justice.

430
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,110
Men. Whether they have power or not, whether they are rich or not,

431
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:06,040
- they are all the same. 
 - Exactly.

432
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,560
I also heard that Madam Tang

433
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,940
once fancied a poor young man, and they were so in love.

434
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:17,420
- But in the end, that man eloped with a courtesan. 
 - How come I haven't heard about this?

435
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:21,100
Do you know why Madam Tang is so close with Princess of Valor?

436
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,780
Why?

437
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:26,290
Because they both like poor young men, you see.

438
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,620
I know. Right?

439
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,880
Exactly.

440
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,596
Here they come.

441
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,240
Madam, spare my life.

442
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,720
- It's all right. It was my own carelessness. 
 - Thank you, Madam.

443
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,320
Look. The wife of the Great Chief is so magnanimous.

444
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,640
Isn't this the illegitimate daughter of the Yan family?

445
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,700
She transforms and now looks like a lady of a noble house.

446
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,600
It's Madam Shen's first time attending such a banquet. She may not be quite used to it.

447
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,116
Actually, it's not like this on normal days.

448
00:32:02,116 --> 00:32:04,500
   

449
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:10,660
It's just that, Madam Liu had her husband taken by the Imperial Guards for questioning.

450
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,800
It's all right.

451
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:20,510
This is just what they say about the husband offending people and the wife apologizing.

452
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,940
Madam Shen, you need not take it to heart. They are merely indulging in gossip.

453
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,020
I see your dress is also wet.

454
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,880
You might as well come with me and change your clothes.

455
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,232
Let's go.

456
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:53,280
This place is called the Medicinal Spring Pool. Soaking here can maintain health and heal injuries.

457
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,700
You were exposed to coldness. Why not go up and enjoy it?

458
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,660
This is too precious. I shouldn't…

459
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,660
I am testing a new formula for the medicinal spring.

460
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:07,680
You can help me try it out and see how effective this new formula is.

461
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:14,320
Madam Tang, you are also skilled in medicine?

462
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,000
I only have a superficial understanding.

463
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,740
 This is the scent of White Champaca. 

464
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:36,380
 That day outside the Ximing Temple, she was the one spying. 

465
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:47,700
This is a fire moth. I've heard a legend that someone saw a fire moth

466
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,660
and followed it up a mountain.

467
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,600
Afterward, they obtained eternal life.

468
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:59,900
Madam Tang, with such a temperament, do you also long for immortality?

469
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,540
Life is but a few decades short.

470
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:12,520
If there are things you want to do, do not hesitate.

471
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,420
Once youth has passed, even if you try to pursue your dreams,

472
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:20,659
I'm afraid by then, you won't have the power.

473
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,568
That's exactly right.

474
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,164
Come.

475
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:37,860
You're intelligent and share a deep affection with the Great Chief.

476
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:43,100
It's reassuring that the serial killer case is within your hands.

477
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:50,660
Speaking of which, the Liang family has really had its share of ups and downs.

478
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:53,459
I often see the first madam of the Liang family.

479
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:57,980
It's a pity that such a beauty can't even get a glance from her husband.

480
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:01,800
And now she has lost her son.

481
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,920
So the couple of the Liang family's first branch is not harmonious?

482
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,700
Look at me, running my mouth.

483
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:11,080
The private affairs of officials should not be divulged.

484
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,280
Madam Shen, please do not take it to heart.

485
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,780
Please tell Madam Liang that the murderer will soon be caught.

486
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,480
No matter how deeply they hide.

487
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:31,600
Madam Shen, the Princess of Valor invites you to discuss matters after your bath.

488
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,470
I know.

489
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,680
 I have been waiting for two hours now. 

490
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,840
 How has she not arrived yet? 

491
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:01,270
   

492
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,080
Princess of Valor.

493
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,120
The flowers outside were blooming just right.

494
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,960
I actually forgot about Madam Shen.

495
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,160
Madam Shen, you don't need to be nervous.

496
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:43,160
I called you here just for a casual chat.

497
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,680
However, investigating the case is one thing.

498
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,000
For other matters,

499
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,960
you'd better leave them alone.

500
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,880
Madam Shen is so astute.

501
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,700
You should understand what I mean.

502
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,400
A good bird chooses a proper tree to perch on.

503
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,360
Hasn't your husband taught you that?

504
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,140
Your Highness, Great Chief has come to escort Madam Shen back to the mansion.

505
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,800
It's only been half a day,

506
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,960
but Great Chief is so concerned about Madam Shen.

507
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,260
It seems that the rumors in the alley are not unfounded after all.

508
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:53,440
The affection between the two of you truly makes others envious.

509
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,320
Let him in.

510
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,910
Yes.

511
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:01,000
   

512
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,600
The Floral Banquet has ended,

513
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,480
but my wife has not returned for quite some time.

514
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,360
Presumably, the palace is too big, and she lost her way.

515
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,280
I got anxious, so I came to pick her up.

516
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,900
After all, at home, there are many trivial matters for her to handle.

517
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,440
Since the Great Chief has come,

518
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,280
if I continue to bother Madam Shen,

519
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,200
it would be insensitive.

520
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,040
However, I do have one thing

521
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,860
to tell the Great Chief.

522
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,480
Investigating the murder case is the most important.

523
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,480
Thank you for the reminder, Your Highness.

524
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,560
Are you injured?

525
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,160
I'm actually bleeding.

526
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,280
Did Princess of Valor pressure you into taking anything?

527
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,160
Is there a possibility of poisoning?

528
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,080
You have worked hard, Great Chief.

529
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,480
Others can't see you within this carriage.

530
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,640
Did you anticipate long ago

531
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,980
that my trip to the palace this time would be dangerous?

532
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,680
A person who has just learned to walk

533
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,840
won't know how painful it is without a tumble.

534
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,200
Moreover, you have revealed one of Princess of Valor's cards.

535
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,880
A reprimand is not uncalled for, is it?

536
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,280
It was clearly both of us who exposed her bottom line.

537
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,680
Yet only I am being reprimanded.

538
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,580
However, since you came...

539
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,440
No need for thanks.

540
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,720
You previously wrote a memorial to save me.

541
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,340
I am merely returning the favor.

542
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,860
When the Imperial Guards conducted the investigation,

543
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:51,720
did you find out that the Liang family's first branch couple was at odds?

544
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,320
Why investigate the affairs of the inner quarters?

545
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,460
The first branch indeed has been persistently troubling the second branch's uncles,

546
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,520
crying and wailing all day long.

547
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,960
Fortunately, Liang Jiren does have a sense of the bigger picture

548
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,200
and has never made things difficult for the second branch.

549
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,160
Liang Chenzhong is an only child.

550
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:13,440
The first branch's bloodline has been cut off by the murderer.

551
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,880
There are many who hate him.

552
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,180
Even if his heart was not dug out, he wouldn't have lived much longer.

553
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,920
The person who used Dripping Water Guanyin also harbors a murderous intent.

554
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,520
It's just that they were not as quick as that serial killer.

555
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:39,100
