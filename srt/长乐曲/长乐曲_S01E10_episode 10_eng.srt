00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,956
 'Go Ahead Fearlessly' - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,956 --> 00:00:34,994
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:38,292
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:40,661
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:44,536
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,536 --> 00:00:47,671
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:50,836
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,836 --> 00:00:55,872
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,872 --> 00:01:02,244
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,244 --> 00:01:08,552
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,552 --> 00:01:14,831
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,831 --> 00:01:21,144
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,144 --> 00:01:28,888
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:37,222
   

16
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,257
   

17
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,580
Stop.

18
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,660
Great Chief, Madam has told us to extinguish all the lanterns when we arrive.

19
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,330
Wellâ€¦

20
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,960
- Extinguish them. 
 - Extinguish them.

21
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,920
Great Chief, mind the steps.

22
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,260
Great Chief.

23
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:22,080
Clerk Yan brought a strange man to my bedroom and told us to wait here.

24
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,400
Young Master Han, where have you been hiding all this time?

25
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,020
- Why are you leaving so soon? 
 - Han Shiyuan?

26
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,560
Shiyuan has run away.

27
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,320
Are you sure this man is Han Shiyuan?

28
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,680
It's him. That's how he ran away that day. He was wearing exactly the same clothes.

29
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,660
Yes. Exactly the same.

30
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,340
That day, you were startled by the bright light from Ming Hall,

31
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,740
and it was bright in the east and dark in the west. He ran west.

32
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,620
That day, you didn't actually see his face clearly.

33
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,070
It's not him.

34
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,440
But it was clearly him just now. It was him that day too.

35
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,520
That wasn't him in the room.

36
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,120
And it wasn't him that day either, but his shadow.

37
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,400
On that day, Lan Guizhou used a shadow to create an illusion that Han Shiyuan was still in the house.

38
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,200
Then he disguised himself as Han Shiyuan and went west.

39
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,680
It just so happened that Ming Hall on the east side caught fire,

40
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,940
creating a huge blaze of light, which diverted your attention.

41
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:30,560
So that made the eyewitness scholar mistakenly think he was Han Shiyuan.

42
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,800
You're just making assumptions.

43
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,600
On the seventh day of the fifth month, Shiyuan was clearly in the house and went west.

44
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,200
The problem is that both you and the student who witnessed the incident outside the house

45
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,000
said that only Han Shiyuan had left alone.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,760
You're inside the house, and there's a light in it.

47
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,180
In a situation where it's bright inside and dark outside, how did you see Han Shiyuan heading west?

48
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,620
Clerk Yan is right. The light is on in the house. Indeed, we can't see the outside.

49
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,320
As for why an illusion was created that Han Shiyuan was still in the Hongwen School on the night of the seventh night of the fifth month,

50
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,020
we have to ask his good roommate about it.

51
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,328
Take him away.

52
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,000
Everyone, you're dismissed.

53
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,900
A'Pan, thank you so much for today.

54
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,710
It's no big deal, not worth mentioning.

55
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,380
Who exactly is this Pan?

56
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,720
Madam is all smiles with him. They seem to be old acquaintances.

57
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,160
Clerk Yan, I have things to do today so I have to go now.

58
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,000
You're leaving? I haven't even had the chance to properly thank you.

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,780
Fate will bring us together.

60
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,800
If you need my help, come find me at the Ghost Market anytime.

61
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,744
Deal.

62
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,480
- Really? 
 - Yes.

63
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,840
Madam has never been so cheerful in the mansion.

64
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,280
Today, thanks to A'Pan, the case was solved smoothly.

65
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,640
Aren't you taking me to the Imperial Guards? What about the interrogation?

66
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,680
Figure it out yourself.

67
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,580
What's wrong with him?

68
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,050
Great Chief, I found that this Pan is named Pan Chi,

69
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,680
who has solved several doubtful cases in Jiangnan.

70
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,000
Great Chief, shall we start the interrogation now?

71
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,180
Interrogate me if you want to ask.

72
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,940
Shut up.

73
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,488
Madam.

74
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,920
- How's the interrogation going? 
 - Madam, you're finally here. We've been waiting for you.

75
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,720
You should have been here long ago. Let's start the interrogation.

76
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,700
You thought that Han Shiyuan would not appear again after eloping,

77
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:49,020
so you created an illusion of his presence and framed him for murder.

78
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,040
Yes.

79
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,884
Indeed.

80
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,920
Shiyuan told me he eloped with his lover on the night of the sixth day.

81
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,940
I didn't want to frame Shiyuan. I knew he was going to leave, so I just wanted to borrow his name.

82
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,910
But I don't think that's your motive for murder.

83
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,240
You kept mentioning Han Shiyuan,

84
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,980
yet you don't mention a single word about the scholar you killed.

85
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:27,360
You still haven't told me why you killed him.

86
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,940
Heâ€¦ What is there to mention of him?

87
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,140
He ruined my poetry collection. Didn't he deserve to die?

88
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:38,040
He's ruined your poetry collection, so you killed your classmate?

89
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,780
That poetry collection mattered much to me.

90
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,700
Shiyuan was my only friend.

91
00:07:56,698 --> 00:07:59,440
   

92
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,840
 Ever since Shiyuan dated Third Miss Yan, 

93
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,780
 I've stayed up many nights to copy that poetry collection. 

94
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,810
 It was a gift I gave to Shiyuan. 

95
00:08:11,684 --> 00:08:13,920
 - My poetry collection! 
 - It's just a copied poetry collection. 

96
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,100
 Do you think you are Pan Yanzhi?  
  (Pan Yanzhi was an official during China's Northern and Southern Dynasties, known for his literary talents. His name frequently appears in poetry and historical texts.) 

97
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:20,780
 Do you think anyone would love this poetry collection? 

98
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,460
 Just some waste paper. 

99
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,720
 My poetry collection! 

100
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:53,240
How dare he destroy it and mock me!

101
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,080
You killed him and intentionally framed Han Shiyuan.

102
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,880
Actually, you were hoping for him to return upon hearing the news.

103
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,320
After Han Shiyuan returned to Xiang'an, he disappeared.

104
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,560
Have you seen him?

105
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,980
Where have you hidden Han Shiyuan?

106
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:33,800
An abandoned liquor store in the West Market.

107
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,380
I didn't expect this Lan Guizhou to kill animals in here.

108
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,070
He's so twisted inside.

109
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:57,480
No wonder he would kill someone because of a poetry collection.

110
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,720
Han Shiyuan got taken away first again.

111
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,660
It's the signal from the Imperial Guards, in the direction of the Furong Garden.

112
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,480
Shen Du, can't you just let me sit properly on the horse?

113
00:10:20,331 --> 00:10:24,220
   

114
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,084
Your hand.

115
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:53,520
Jing Lin, my legs are feeling a bit numb. Help me up!

116
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,600
You are stubborn. Don't try to be brave.

117
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,060
Jing Lin.

118
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,280
Go and save them.

119
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,700
Myâ€¦ My sister is up there. Tell the Imperial Guards to put out the fire and save them.

120
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,740
It's weird. Don't act rashly.

121
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,800
You can disregard human lives, but I can't.

122
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,620
If you don't save them, I will.

123
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,520
Don't go over there.

124
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,652
Be careful.

125
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,996
It's cold flame.

126
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,156
It's coming.

127
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:09,260
    
 Like a moth to a flame. Live at dawn, die at dusk.

128
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,480
Not entering the cycle of reincarnation, undying.

129
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,040
Fools in the world. I, Chen Huo'e, am back.

130
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,740
Chen Huo'e. The serial killer from five years ago.

131
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,240
Didn't she commit suicide in public five years ago?

132
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,080
The dead cannot be brought back to life.

133
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:32,240
I'm sure this is just some deceitful trick.

134
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,080
I didn't expect you to remain so calm

135
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,380
and composed facing my nirvana setup.

136
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,660
White Ghost, you are really amazing.

137
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:46,240
What a pity. Even if you are the soul-reaper,

138
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,440
you cannot stop my nirvana rebirth.

139
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,960
Then I shall capture you and send you back to hell.

140
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,412
Third Miss!

141
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,756
Third Sister!

142
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,780
Young Master Han!

143
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,520
- Third Sister! 
 - Sixth Sister!

144
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,940
Great Chief.

145
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,820
Manager Yang, you are here.

146
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:35,440
Then it seems tonight, it's Princess Yong'an who's intervening.

147
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:44,640
But the Imperial Personal Guards who work for the Grand Empress Dowager are here, too.

148
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,900
It makes me somewhat confused.

149
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:53,320
Well, Princess of Valor only asked me to save Young Master Han.

150
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,440
I don't know anything else.

151
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,130
Great Chief. Manager Yang.

152
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,980
I was in a hurry to save people. I hope I didn't bother you.

153
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,340
I wondered who could mobilize the Imperial Personal Guards,

154
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:17,120
so turned out to be a favorite by the Grand Empress Dowager. Minister Zhang.

155
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,890
Shiyuan, youâ€¦

156
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,860
What happened? Are you injured? Are you all right?

157
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,040
All right, as long as you're not injured.

158
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,620
Remember. Be careful in the future.

159
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,480
Do not let yourself fall into such a situation.

160
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:00,280
Great Chief Shen, weird things happened today. I'm glad you are here.

161
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,320
Please let people of the Imperial Guards take greater care of this matter

162
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,559
and catch the person behind the scenes, to prevent future troubles.

163
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:15,680
I am indeed in charge of this.

164
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:21,360
If it were not for you two, the murderer would have already been caught.

165
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,119
I apologize for any offense.

166
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,080
I hope you can forgive me.

167
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,260
The reappearance of Chen Huo'e is riddled with oddities.

168
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,360
The matter of apprehending the murderer still has to rely on the Great Chief to take care of it.

169
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,430
I must return to the palace to serve Her Majesty.

170
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,540
I take my leave.

171
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,460
Han Shiyuan, Her Highness asked me to pass on a message to you.

172
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,660
As long as you want it, Her Highness's mind has not changed.

173
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,680
Han Shiyuan.

174
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,940
Do you have anything to say?

175
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,400
I know nothing.

176
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,780
About the homicide case of the Hongwen School, Sixth Miss has already cleared your name.

177
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,040
Tonight, you and Yan Caiwei are the victims.

178
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,540
If you have nothing to say,

179
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:39,380
then take her back to the Yan Mansion to rest.

180
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:53,180
   

181
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:59,460
Your third brother-in-law has a deep connection with Princess Yong'an and Zhang Baohuan.

182
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,040
It's really surprising.

183
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:06,800
Indeed. Han Shiyuan obviously knows Zhang Baohuan from long ago

184
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,040
and also has quite a story with Princess Yong'an.

185
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:15,640
They saved him, yet he is not the slightest bit grateful and wanted to pretend not to know them.

186
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,260
There must be a reason for this.

187
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:24,280
But Caiwei seems to know nothing.

188
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,000
I know.

189
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,280
From beginning to end, I have never thought to embarrass your third sister.

190
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:51,820
I'm sorry for what I did rashly just now.

191
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,440
I'm going to the Ministry of Justice to check the case files later.

192
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,030
Would you...

193
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,380
like to go with me?

194
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,540
Yes! Yes.

195
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,400
Come on, buddies.

196
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,060
Place two here. Then place another two here.

197
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,220
At the entrance, place two by the door.

198
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,160
Make sure the lanterns are all aligned to light the room up.

199
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,744
Retreat.

200
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,160
You're exaggerating it.

201
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,860
So many lanterns. The candles cost money.

202
00:21:37,653 --> 00:21:39,040
   

203
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,908
Found it.

204
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,720
Five years ago,

205
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,080
the villainous woman Chen Huo'e committed crimes in many places,

206
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,120
and consecutively killed more than fifty women. 
    

207
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,240
And on the back of the dead women

208
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,360
was found a giant moth brand burned by fire.

209
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,360
For a moment, the whole country was in a panic.

210
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,980
Women shut themselves in their houses.

211
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,020
Finally, the villainous woman Chen Huo'e was captured by the Imperial Inspectorate.

212
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,160
She was an ugly-faced woman,

213
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,440
even claiming that she knew how to come back to life

214
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,940
and would be back someday.

215
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,540
At the scene of capture,

216
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,460
Chen Huo'e stabbed a sword into her heart to kill herself.

217
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,840
Before she died, she saidâ€¦

218
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,560
Like a moth to a flame.

219
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,260
Live at dawn, die at dusk.

220
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:00,100
 Not entering the cycle of reincarnation, undying. 

221
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,960
 Like a moth to a flame. 

222
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,120
 Live at dawn, die at dusk. 

223
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,720
Not entering the cycle of reincarnation, undying.

224
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,880
Madam Tang!

225
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,420
From the motive and method of operating, these two cases have nothing in common.

226
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,160
But merely from the cases themselves,

227
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,800
these two cases could not have been done by one person alone.

228
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,760
It was a gang committing the crimes.

229
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,300
Whether it's Madam Tang burying bodies after killing

230
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,080
or Chen Huo'e's serial homicides five years ago,

231
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,040
or tonight's nirvana setup,

232
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,240
none of these could be done by one person alone.

233
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,000
This is not a simple gang crime.

234
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,400
Just consider what happened tonight,

235
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,000
the things behind it are intricate and complex.

236
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,560
I'm afraid this Chen Huo'e is just a scapegoat.

237
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,720
Then is tonight's Chen Huo'e

238
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,100
the same person who was captured five years ago?

239
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,640
No matter what,

240
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,120
the Chen Huo'e of five years ago has disappeared after committing the crimes.

241
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,900
That indicates the person behind this no longer needed her.

242
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,680
Five years later, Chen Huo'e appeared again.

243
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,640
That indicates the person behind this

244
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,220
needs her again.

245
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,910
Indeed.

246
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,120
What exactly does he want?

247
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,040
It's so complicated.

248
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,620
A small mistake could lead to a disaster.

249
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,400
Mother,

250
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,820
the night-blooming jasmine in the backyard has bloomed,

251
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,520
so I picked a bunch for you.

252
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,580
Now you are there alone. 
    

253
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:54,440
Do you feel lonely?

254
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:59,940
How about I sing a song for you?

255
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,560
Do you remember when I was young,

256
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,640
you would sing a nursery rhyme to me?

257
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,800
 â™ª Mind your words â™ª 

258
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,600
 â™ª Grandma displeased â™ª 

259
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:19,880
 â™ª Mother keeps picking flowers â™ª 

260
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:26,620
 â™ª Grandfather is often joyful upon hearing the melody â™ª 

261
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:30,920
 â™ª Mother keeps picking flowers â™ª 

262
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,608
Who's there?

263
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:42,300
It's the first time to hear someone singing a nursery rhyme in the graveyard.

264
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:47,480
On a dark and windy night, it's quite interesting.

265
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,340
It's you.

266
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,540
Masked Man, I've seen you before!

267
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,640
When I came to visit my mother before, I often saw you around here.

268
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,000
Do you also have relatives and friends buried nearby?

269
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,040
Yes.

270
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,940
My mother is buried nearby.

271
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,480
I don't know what other family burials are around here.

272
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,160
The treasure land near Xiang'an City

273
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,040
is naturally bought by noble families and wealthy households

274
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,660
to be used as their ancestral tombs.

275
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:36,480
Lowly ones can only curl up in the corners of the graveyard,

276
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,320
seeking a place to dwell in.

277
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,720
This grave cost my father a lot of money.

278
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,760
It is indeed large and imposing.

279
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,160
But I know my mother did not want to be alone here.

280
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,680
And she surely hoped to make more friends.

281
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,120
So I think my mother and your mother

282
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,240
must have already become good neighbors and friends.

283
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,612
Good friends?

284
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,072
Youâ€¦

285
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,040
are quite different.

286
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,600
Why do you wear a mask?

287
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,120
Is it because your face is injured?

288
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,760
Ever since I was born,

289
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,720
I've had an ugly birthmark on my face, with a horrifying shape.

290
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:58,280
People who have seen my face would be too scared to sleep.

291
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,880
Do you want to see it?

292
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,300
Wait a moment. I need to prepare myself.

293
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,960
Wait for me to count to five, all right?

294
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,660
Five.

295
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,940
Four.

296
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,440
Three.

297
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,940
Two.

298
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,640
One.

299
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,544
Masked Man?

300
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,480
Left already?

301
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,320
You haven't applied medicine to your hand yet.

302
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,700
I had Butler Shen bring over all kinds of wound medicine from the mansion

303
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,080
to see which one is best for treating...

304
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,128
a bite.

305
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,540
Why is it so serious?

306
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,360
It's a puppy bite.

307
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,900
No bother.

308
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,800
Butler Shen said there is a kind of red medicine,

309
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,160
which was used for treating Yaya before.

310
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,900
The bite from Yaya is about the same as the bite...

311
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,200
from me.

312
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,400
Yes.

313
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:19,000
Previously, Yaya was bitten by a mad dog.

314
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,100
Indeed, it's about the same.

315
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,640
This is your way of apologizing?

316
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,380
What am I apologizing for?

317
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,720
You didn't say it clearly and caused me to misunderstand.

318
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,320
Besides, you were injured all night and didn't even bother asking Jinglin to bandage it?

319
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,300
- Do you have to wait for me to do it? 
 - Iâ€¦

320
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,880
 - Let go of me! 
 - Go. 

321
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,280
 Let go of me! 

322
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,960
 - Let go of me! 
 - Go. 

323
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,360
 Let go of me! 

324
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,000
 A'Du. 

325
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,020
 Although it's to save someone, you have to be careful too. 

326
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,800
 If that arrow just now had been an inch off target, 

327
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,420
 this person would surely be dead. 

328
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,440
 Father, I won't miss the target. 

329
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,660
 I need to leave him alive for interrogation. 

330
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,260
 I am Shen Du, are you okay? 

331
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:13,740
 Are you the same boy who saved me back then? 

332
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,460
Who's there?

333
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,560
 Yan Xing! 

334
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,940
Why would this happen?

335
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,560
You did this on purpose, right?

336
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,860
Of course not.

337
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,300
Sorry, I grabbed the wrong one.

338
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,621
      
  (Jincang Ointment is for wound healing, and Chunfeng Powder is for improving blood circulation.) 

339
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,040
- You! 
 - I'll wash it off for you right away.

340
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,400
- You! 
 - I'll wash it off for you right away.

â™«  I want to be your moonlight  â™«

â™«  There is always a place where the clouds and the sea meet  â™«

365
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,010
My Lord.

366
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,800
Come here, Sixth Miss!

367
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,900
Take a seat, have some tea, and chat for a while.

368
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,360
Any new rumors about me?

369
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,960
No, no.

370
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,080
No rumors. Right?

371
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:43,520
Butâ€¦ all of us agree there's a tigress in the Ministry of Justice.

372
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:48,280
And this tigress is really powerful.

373
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,120
She dared to shout at White Ghost.

374
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:57,000
But later, she was still put on a horse

375
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,960
and paraded through the streets.

376
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,160
As a woman,

377
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,600
she needs to be gentle, kind, respectful,

378
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,500
and yielding.

379
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,700
Lu Chuichui!

380
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,980
You're late again!

381
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,580
And you have that dejected look.

382
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,300
What did you do yesterday?

383
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,344
Nothing.

384
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,880
What?

385
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,800
Feng Gui.

386
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,400
My Lord.

387
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:44,060
Last night, Chen Huo'e came back to life.

388
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,920
Great Chief of the Imperial Guards sent someone early in the morning to deliver the case files.

389
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,660
- Then this caseâ€¦ 
 - When entering,

390
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,440
Ji Fangming who's in charge of reviewing the case files gave this to me.

391
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,620
- Give it to me. 
 - Saying it's a case submitted from Wannian County.

392
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:09,220
Wannian County's Xuanping Alley had a murder.

393
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,900
The victim was the wife of

394
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,720
Chen Shoujie, an official

395
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,740
who had resigned and returned to his hometown.

396
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:17,680
Why the fuss over a dead woman?

397
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,620
Director Wu, do you think it's only a man's life that matters?

398
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:25,460
Doesn't a woman's life matter?

399
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,300
What did I say?

400
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,520
After you married into Shen Mansion, you've grown a temper.

401
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,976
Fine.

402
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,340
Forget what I said.

403
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:45,380
Feng Gui, arrange an inspector to investigate the case.

404
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,280
My L-L-Lord!

405
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,120
The coroner's report states that the victim died last night,

406
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:55,780
and that a giant moth brand had appeared on her shoulder.

407
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:01,180
It's identical to the brands of the victims of the Chen Huo'e murder case five years ago.

408
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,520
 It's Chen Huo'e again. 

409
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,360
Director Wu.

410
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,640
Please allow me to investigate this case.

411
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,240
Since this matter is related to the case of Chen Huo'e's resurrection,

412
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,060
it should be handled by the Imperial Guards as well.

413
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:15,780
Exactly. It's not proper for the Ministry of Justice to intervene.

414
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,480
Yes. It's inappropriate.

415
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,020
Even though the Great Chief is your husband,

416
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:29,520
in the Shen Mansion, you're just a nobody.

417
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,900
White Ghost won't take you along when solving the case.

418
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,000
He won't.

419
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,720
 Vice Minister is here. 

420
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,120
Greetings, Vice Minister Lai.

421
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,848
Vice Minister Lai.

422
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,720
If White Ghost won't take her along,

423
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,640
Black Fiend would indeed like to invite Clerk Yan

424
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,200
to assist in the case investigation together.

425
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,470
Director Wu.

426
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:09,840
Five years ago, it was me who was responsible for investigating the Chen Huo'e case.

427
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,800
I know how Sixth Miss Yan investigates cases.

428
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,640
Since you are interested in the Chen Huo'e case,

429
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,720
why not join my Imperial Inspectorate

430
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,740
to help me capture the murderer?

431
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,000
Thank you very much.

432
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,040
I am a minor clerk in the Ministry of Justice,

433
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,280
hoping only to participate in the selection of female officials

434
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,000
and to attain the position of an official clerk.

435
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,880
I have no intention to transfer my job.

436
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,360
Since you refuse,

437
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,370
then...

438
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,800
let's meet again another day.

439
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,020
Vice Minister Lai, take care!

440
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,132
Stop the carriage.

441
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,000
Greetings, Princess of Valor!

442
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,960
Young Master Han.

443
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,480
You and I haven't seen each other in a while.

444
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:35,740
We meet today, yet do you still want to avoid me?

445
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,490
I dare not.

446
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,080
Young Master Han, what are you doing?

447
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,960
Stand up and reply.

448
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,440
Princess of Valor.

449
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:58,500
I am but a mere commoner, afraid of bothering you.

450
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,040
Young Master Han, what are you talking about?

451
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,160
About the affection, it's not something we can control.

452
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,400
Now that you have someone in your heart,

453
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,040
I will certainly congratulate you.

454
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,340
Thank you for your kindness.

455
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,740
Let's go.

456
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,260
Your Highness.
