00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,920
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,960
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,258
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,258 --> 00:00:40,627
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,627 --> 00:00:44,502
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:47,637
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:50,802
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:55,838
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,838 --> 00:01:02,210
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:08,518
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,518 --> 00:01:14,797
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,797 --> 00:01:21,210
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

14
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:29,054
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:29,054 --> 00:01:37,188
   

16
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,200
   

17
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:47,040
Madam Yan, is there truly no way to bring someone back from the dead?

18
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,740
There is too much injustice in this world, especially towards women.

19
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,370
At home, we must listen to our father. When married, we must listen to our husband.

20
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,820
All that talk about the Three Obediences and Four Virtues. 
  (The Three Obediences: to father, to husband, to son.The Four Virtues: conduct, speech, comportment, works.) 

21
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,200
If we make the slightest mistake, we will be scorned by everyone.

22
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,350
That scorn could practically drown a person.

23
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,260
Think about it.

24
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,700
How ironic it is!

25
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,920
But if one only clings to these,

26
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,280
how can one ever seek true fairness?

27
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,090
Xiuxiu,

28
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,360
dow did you get to know Governor Mo?

29
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,460
And why do you call him so intimately?

30
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,500
He once saved me.

31
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,660
However, he might have chosen me as his sacrifice offering by then.

32
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,220
You really do resemble...

33
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,660
Mo Xiuxiu.

34
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,540
But I am not Mo Xiuxiu, after all.

35
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,860
Stop, don't move!

36
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,200
Jing Lin.

37
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,800
- What do you want? 
 - Release Governor Mo!

38
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,090
Mo Qianzhi is colluding with the Huo'e Sect,

39
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,440
perverting the law for personal gain and wantonly killing the innocent.

40
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,440
The Imperial Guards have been ordered to arrest him.

41
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,570
Nonsense! Governor Mo protected the civilians

42
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,680
and fought to the death with the Half-faced Demon.

43
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,020
When we executed the criminal Ji Dafu, you repeatedly obstructed us.

44
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,620
I think you have ulterior motives.

45
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,180
Governor Mo then ordered us to be alert.

46
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,560
As expected, we found out that you people

47
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,260
    
 made a secret deal with the Half-faced Demon.

48
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,940
And now you want to take Governor Mo hostage.

49
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,400
- Do you think you can turn the tables on us? 
 - You are framing us!

50
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,340
After Great Chief came to Yingzhou,

51
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,670
the Half-faced Demons had continuously popped up.

52
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:21,839
Is this a coincidence?

53
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,940
Foolish! You all are fooled by Mo Qianzhi's disguise.

54
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,140
Who exactly has captured you?

55
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,540
Xiuxiu, tell them the truth.

56
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,340
It's Mo Qianzhi who is in collusion with the Half-faced Demons

57
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,060
and wants to use all of you as the sacrifice offerings.

58
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,130
Shen Du, after all these years,

59
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,760
I never expected you'd turn out like this.

60
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,320
Just give up and surrender.

61
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,600
You corrupt official! Release Governor Mo immediately!

62
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,760
It is Mo Qianzhi who has been indulging the Half-faced Demons killing in the city.

63
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,620
He has exploited the trust of you all.

64
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,780
White Ghost, release Governor Mo!

65
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,010
Governor Mo is a good official who empathizes with the people.

66
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,900
He has our people in mind.

67
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,700
Do not frame and set him up.

68
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,540
- Release Governor Mo! 
 - Release Governor!

69
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,300
- What are you going to do? 
 - Step back! Step back!

70
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,560
Do not accidentally harm the civilians.

71
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,110
I can't beat them, nor can I reason with them.

72
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,040
These people of Yingzhou have gone crazy.

73
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:24,760
Shen Du, they've seen through who the bad guy is. What about you?

74
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,420
So this is your true scheme.

75
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,676
Wait!

76
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,160
Stop!

77
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,500
Sun Tan, are you inspectors trying to rebel?

78
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,260
My apologies, Governor Mo!

79
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,540
You all know how troublesome we inspectors are.

80
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,380
Step back! Step back!

81
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,928
Let them go.

82
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,040
Hurry up, go.

83
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,020
Marshal Sun, thank you for coming to the rescue today.

84
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,760
Great Chief, not at all. Marshal Xu had already sent a letter,

85
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,490
ordering me to work with Chief Clerk Yan to investigate the case.

86
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,240
It is my duty to do so.

87
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,310
If the inspectors hadn't come to rescue us today,

88
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:47,220
the civilians of the city, with just one spit from each, could have drowned us by now.

89
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,480
For the people of Yingzhou, Governor Mo is indeed a rare good official.

90
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,720
He set up tents in disaster years, providing porridge to the people for free.

91
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,900
He also led the constables to help people repair their houses, without taking a single coin in return.

92
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,300
How would the civilians think of such an official as a bad guy?

93
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,900
On one hand, he is a nice man who's beloved by the people and respected by his colleagues.

94
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,500
On the other hand, he is a madman who pays no regard for human life and believes in the cult.

95
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,560
These two faces...

96
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,340
are truly hard to distinguish.

97
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,260
Now, we can only temporarily hide outside the city, waiting to see how things go.

98
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:26,500
Sorry to make you all end up in this plight with us.

99
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,680
Marshal Xu trusts you guys.

100
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,800
As the leader of the inspectors in Gannandao, I also trust you.

101
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,940
Great Chief, it's a secret letter I just received from Xiang'an.

102
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,300
The Grand Empress Dowager has ordered the surrounding counties to assemble their forces,

103
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,880
wanting me and General Zhenyuan to capture Mo Qianzhi alive.

104
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,860
Yet Mo Qianzhi just drove us out of the city.

105
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,340
This secret letter came too soon.

106
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,510
Before coming here, the Grand Empress Dowager had summoned me,

107
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,940
telling me to keep a close watch on Mo Qianzhi.

108
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,920
Upon arriving in Yingzhou City, a spy had made contact with me.

109
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,580
It must have been Bi Qiu who got killed not long ago.

110
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,050
I think he noticed something amiss,

111
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,180
and sent the message to Xiang'an early on.

112
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,840
In that case, everything in and out of Great Cang

113
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,060
is all under the surveillance of the Grand Empress Dowager.

114
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:32,700
This also shows that sending me to Gannandao to deal with the Half-faced Demon

115
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,640
is also part of the Grand Empress Dowager's plan.

116
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,100
The Grand Empress Dowager asked you to take down Yingzhou City.

117
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,739
If there is a war, what will happen to the civilians in the city?

118
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,440
Let's hope things get better before General Zhenyuan gets here.

119
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,440
Who is it?

120
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,080
Who is it? Come out here.

121
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,640
Qi Yeyun?

122
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,280
What are you doing sneaking around there?

123
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,420
My sister taught me this. I must observe everything carefully first.

124
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,160
Better safe than sorry.

125
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,320
I am Shen Du. I have a word for Mo Qianzhi.

126
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,720
If you want to talk, come up.

127
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,420
You dare to come alone.

128
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,540
Aren't you afraid I'll kill you?

129
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,060
I am here to give you an ultimatum.

130
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,540
Xiang'an is aware of your betrayal.

131
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,240
The Grand Empress Dowager has dispatched the Zhenyuan Army to Yingzhou.

132
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,560
It's not too late to stop now.

133
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,500
It's not that easy for them to take down the city.

134
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,720
Do you think that the tens of thousands of people in the city who follow you,

135
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,740
plus those Half-faced Demons, can fight against the royal court?

136
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,860
The will of the people can withstand tens of thousands of soldiers.

137
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,260
Do you still remember the vow you made when you joined my fatherâ€™s household all those years ago?

138
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,400
Be loyal to the country,

139
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,320
and not let the people down.

140
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,260
Shen Du,

141
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:31,020
I never thought you'd say that to me one day.

142
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,440
Don't you see the current Great Cang is already full of rot and corruption?

143
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,620
It's only a matter of time before it collapses.

144
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,200
Then get rid of the rot and corruption,

145
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,000
instead of tearing it down.

146
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,270
The people of the Huo'e Sect have no regard for human life,

147
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,500
and can betray you at any time.

148
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:03,000
Are you going to gamble with the lives of these innocent people?

149
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,140
If you want to negotiate, I have only one condition.

150
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,104
What is it?

151
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:24,390
Bring me the head of Madam Shen!

152
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,020
Then there is no chance for negotiation.

153
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,480
A'Du,

154
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,260
she is on the Grand Empress Dowager's side,

155
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,080
a tool used by the Grand Empress Dowager to coerce you.

156
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,600
Without her, you will notice how rotten the current Great Cang is.

157
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,190
Without her, you will notice how rotten the current Great Cang is.

158
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:55,360
You're the one blinded by hatred.

159
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,920
You really did it wrong this time.

160
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,836
I was wrong?

161
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,720
You regard the murderer as your father.

162
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,100
No, as your mother.

163
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:31,350
She eats the exquisite delicacies from land and sea stained with the blood of your kin.

164
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:36,900
What she enjoys is the wealth and glory built upon the bones of your people.

165
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,320
If I was wrong,

166
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,440
then that makes you even more wrong.

167
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,940
You want to know the truth. Right?

168
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:56,412
   

169
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,940
This is a bag for carrying grain and fodder.

170
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,780
Why would the grain marked with the seal of the granary from back then

171
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:07,060
appear in Gannandao thousands of miles away?

172
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,920
Shouldn't these have been destroyed along with the fire?

173
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,840
Did it ever occur to you that my teacher,

174
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:21,840
your father, was holding onto an empty treasury?

175
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,000
I'll find out the truth myself.

176
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,920
But you are staking the lives of the people of the city.

177
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,820
Laying your foundation at the risk of massacring all the civilians in the city.

178
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,040
I will never agree.

179
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,052
Stop it.

180
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,520
I don't have much family left in this world.

181
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,640
I don't need you to agree.

182
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,500
There's no turning back.

183
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,120
I've been planning this for so long.

184
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,700
I won't let go at the last moment.

185
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,420
I remember...

186
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,980
you're the one who wanted revenge.

187
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,740
Of course, I want revenge.

188
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,948
But I...

189
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,400
and my father,

190
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,720
would never take the lives of the people of the city for revenge.

191
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,332
Great Chief.

192
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,760
Shen Du.

193
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,748
How is it?

194
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,890
No room for negotiation.

195
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,640
Jing Lin, where is General Zhenyuan now?

196
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,520
I've received a letter from Mengzhou, saying the reinforcements will likely arrive in three days.

197
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,960
I wonder how many soldiers Mo Qianzhi has trained.

198
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,260
If all the men of the city defend the city, there will surely be a fierce battle.

199
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,116
Not necessarily.

200
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,360
Young Master Pan, you indeed get things done quickly.

201
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,580
Great Chief Shen, I've brought everything you wanted.

202
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,200
These areâ€¦

203
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,960
What do you need these bamboo sticks for?

204
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,120
Troops take risky moves, and success or failure hinges on this one action.

205
00:17:16,822 --> 00:17:19,136
   

206
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,270
   

207
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:33,080
Are you planning to take down Yingzhou before General Zhenyuan arrives?

208
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,916
Elder Brother Mo.

209
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:16,560
People often say to let bygones be bygones.

210
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,160
Some pain doesn't just exist in the memory,

211
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,860
but already deep in the flesh.

212
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,380
It vibrates with every breath taken.

213
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,540
And it constantly destroys...

214
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,300
and curses,

215
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,920
"Why don't I go and die?"

216
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,500
And those who have not truly experienced it could never possibly know it,

217
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,660
or could never teach others how to live.

218
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,240
Xiuxiu, do you think...

219
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,820
I was wrong?

220
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,620
You are a good official, a good brother,

221
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,560
and the best person I've ever met.

222
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,120
You saved me from death.

223
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,880
Not only did you save me,

224
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,900
but also helped Yingzhou a lot.

225
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,900
You haven't wronged anyone.

226
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,780
It is the world that owes you too much.

227
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,580
You, just like her,

228
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,900
always trusts me unconditionally.

229
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,920
Yet I have let you down.

230
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,420
If one day she truly comes back to life,

231
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,000
I don't think

232
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,020
she'd recognize the current me.

233
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,360
If possible,

234
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:34,140
I would really want to know what the original you were like.

235
00:20:48,976 --> 00:20:53,080
   

236
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,280
   

237
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,760
Listen up, those above!

238
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,040
General Zhenyuan and a hundred thousand soldiers have already arrived in the city suburbs

239
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,040
to guard the civilians and eliminate the rebels.

240
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,400
This is the last chance for Yingzhou.

241
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,440
We can spare you if you surrender.

242
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:31,600
If not, we'll eliminate the rebels and protect our people.

243
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,550
Governor Mo!

244
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,640
Governor Mo.

245
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,960
If the battle can be avoided,

246
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,220
I hope the people in this city can be spared.

247
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,980
Things are going far beyond our expectations.

248
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:46,060
I heard General Zhenyuan is cruel and warlike.

249
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,920
Moreover, with these hundred thousand soldiers,

250
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:53,380
they will surely destroy Yingzhou and have the civilians killed.

251
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,680
You are so indecisive,

252
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,480
impossible to achieve greatness.

253
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,740
Governor Mo,

254
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,440
Master has a message for you.

255
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,180
This is precisely the critical moment for changing flags and banners.

256
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:22,140
Do not show mercy like a woman.

257
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,180
 The people of the Huo'e Sect have no regard for human life, 

258
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,440
 and can betray you at any time. 

259
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,740
 Are you going to gamble 

260
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,960
 with the lives of these innocent people? 

261
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,120
Governor Mo has devoted his heart and soul to Yingzhou and its people.

262
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,560
Yet he got framed by treacherous people.

263
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,320
We must protect Governor Mo! Protect Yingzhou City!

264
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,160
 Protect Governor Mo! Protect Yingzhou City! 

265
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,140
 Protect Governor Mo! Protect Yingzhou City! 

266
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,160
 Protect Governor Mo! Protect Yingzhou City! 

267
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,400
 Protect Governor Mo! Protect Yingzhou City! 

268
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,860
 Protect Governor Mo! 

269
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,760
 You are a good official, a good brother, 

270
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,000
 and the best person I've ever met. 

271
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,280
In the end, I have let Yingzhou down.

272
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,680
 Protect Governor Mo! Protect Yingzhou City! 

273
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,780
 Protect Governor Mo! Protect Yingzhou City! 

274
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:16,520
 Protect Governor Mo! Protect Yingzhou City! 

275
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,960
Shen Du!

276
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,860
I, Mo Qianzhi, want to fight you alone!

277
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,540
 You and I have finally come to this point. 

278
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,520
I taught you how to fight when you were a kid.

279
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,520
You could never beat me in the past.

280
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,480
 You're picking up pretty fast what I just taught you. 

281
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,920
 Study earnestly, so one can make rapid progress. 

282
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,880
 I'm going to beat you one day. 

283
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,600
 Then you have to hurry. 

284
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,000
 I aim to be the top warrior in Great Cang, 

285
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,820
 galloping across the battlefield and loyally serving my country. 

286
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:37,520
This time, it's my turn to win.

287
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,768
What should we do?

288
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,440
Senior Brother.

289
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,920
Indeed, I've grown old!

290
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,130
I can't react as fast as you anymore.

291
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,500
   

292
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:03,720
 Protect Governor Mo! Protect Governor Mo! Protect Governor Mo! 

293
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,130
 Oh! What's going on?! 

294
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,980
You came to fight me

295
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:18,300
because you couldn't abandon the people of Yingzhou.

296
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,140
Open the gate.

297
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:46,240
 - No need to fight anymore. That's great! 
 - No need to fight anymore. That's great! 

298
00:27:30,422 --> 00:27:33,944
   

299
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,220
What a bluff!

300
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,800
A'Du,

301
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,540
over these years, you've really improved.

302
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:25,370
   

303
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,880
You won.

304
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,340
If you look on with indifference,

305
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,880
you might still catch on to this kind of scheme.

306
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:41,080
I was betting you wouldn't risk the lives of the people of Yingzhou.

307
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:46,120
So you didn't lose.

308
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,240
When will the reinforcements arrive?

309
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,560
Tomorrow.

310
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,360
And how will you explain it then?

311
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,440
Mo Qianzhi was manipulated by the cult, overestimating his abilities.

312
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,040
Yingzhou is short of military force, cannot withstand a single blow.

313
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,720
There are still many people in the city

314
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,120
convinced that you were manipulated by the Huo'e Sect

315
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,760
and pleading for you.

316
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,280
Tell me how you and the leader of the Huo'e Sect made a connection.

317
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,120
People laugh at the moths flying into the flame

318
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,140
while moths survive the fire and await reincarnation.

319
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,600
Coming back to life is a fallacy.

320
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,160
Heaven has a benevolent virtue.

321
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,100
Even the mayflies, which live only from dawn to dusk, have their place in the cycle of reincarnation.

322
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,080
How could they not enter the cycle?

323
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,120
Moths that perish in the flames are reduced to ashes,

324
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,920
unable to enter the path of reincarnation.

325
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,100
How could they be reborn?

326
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,640
Is the person you've seen...

327
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,680
Chen Huo'e?

328
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,820
I told you not to get involved,

329
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,920
yet you insisted.

330
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,840
Actually, I've never reported the matter of the Half-faced Demon causing trouble.

331
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,520
Someone has been using my name.

332
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,680
From the very beginning,

333
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,560
you'd fallen into someone's trap.

334
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,480
Why would one do so?

335
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,440
Before we arrive in Xiang'an and meet the Grand Empress Dowager,

336
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,920
I won't say a word.

337
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,180
No matter what,

338
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,560
you are still my senior brother.

339
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,070
Madam Yan! Madam Yan!

340
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,120
Madam Yan!

341
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,600
- Xiuxiu. 
 - Madam Yan!

342
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,240
Why are you here?

343
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,000
Does Mo Qianzhi have to die?

344
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,520
When we reach Xiang'an, Grand Empress Dowager will decide.

345
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,440
The journey is long.

346
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,220
May I give him some food?

347
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,320
Rest assured, we will take care of him.

348
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:04,440
No matter what, my name was given to me by Elder Brother Mo.

349
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:09,360
You are here not just for this. Right?

350
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,816
Please.

351
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,620
Please help me.

352
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,170
Jing Lin.

353
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,580
I want to see Mo Qianzhi.

354
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,520
I'm not like other girls.

355
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,680
I knew what Elder Brother Mo wanted to do.

356
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,200
I did it willingly.

357
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,940
Xiuxiu,

358
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,728
stop.

359
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,780
You shouldn't be here.

360
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,744
Go back.

361
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,280
Sixth Miss!

362
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,204
Don't come closer.

363
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,920
I just wanted to see you

364
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,160
and talk to you.

365
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,900
Speaking of it, the days when you were around

366
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:14,199
were the happiest and most joyful days of my life.

367
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:18,660
Without you, I'd be dead already.

368
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,520
Thank you for giving me a name.

369
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,480
Xiuxiu.

370
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,980
What a beautiful name!

371
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,624
Xiuxiu.

372
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:07,180
But I know whenever you call her name,

373
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,680
it's very different.

374
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:18,940
I know there's always only one thing you want.

375
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,620
That is to bring Xiuxiu back to life.

376
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,590
Elder Brother Mo,

377
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:41,740
I'll take my leave!

378
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,160
Xiuxiu.

379
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,820
Xiuxiu.

380
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,400
Xiuxiu. Xiuxiu!

381
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:01,280
Elder Brother Mo, Xiuxiu is here.

382
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,216
Xiuxiu.

383
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,280
Why did you do this?

384
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,950
A'Du!

385
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,320
Ask everyone to step back.

386
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,720
You come here, I have something to tell you.

387
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,820
A'Du,

388
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,520
I knew that you had come out of the detention center.

389
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,000
And I heard you'd become the Great Chief of the Imperial Guards.

390
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,880
And I heard you'd become cold-blooded, cruel, and ruthless.

391
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,720
But I'm still glad...

392
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,560
that you are the only one who survived in the Shen family.

393
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,400
If you were still so mild and soft,

394
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,800
how would you avenge my teacher and all the others in the Shen family?

395
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,360
After establishing the Imperial Guards,

396
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,280
I've been investigating all the way.

397
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,760
On the surface, the evidence in the Shen family case is solid and flawless.

398
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,460
But I still found something suspicious.

399
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,120
What happened back then...

400
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:44,080
wasn't something one person could have done alone.

401
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,200
Teacher Shen Bingzhu was unambitious by nature

402
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,560
and never wished to get involved in the court's political strife.

403
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,440
He cared only for the people.

404
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,200
Regardless of who was in power, he simply did what he believed was his duty,

405
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,880
as long as the people were at peace.

406
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,520
But that alone offended others' interests.

407
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:09,020
What the Grand Empress Dowager you are loyal to wanted was his submission.

408
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:12,980
The ones who killed the people of the Shen family are the people of the Zhou family.

409
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,820
I will definitely find out what happened back then,

410
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:22,880
no matter how many years it takes, no matter who did it.

411
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,060
I will get justice from them...

412
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:31,500
to console those souls of the Shen family.

413
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,880
A'Du,

414
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:41,620
I never thought you and I would go against each other because of the same hatred.

415
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:45,840
If you do make it one day, remember to offer me incense,

416
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,920
so I can rest in peace in the underworld.

417
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,260
Senior Brother! Senior Brother!

418
00:38:56,395 --> 00:38:59,400
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

419
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,880
Behind Xiuxiu's painting,

420
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:06,780
there is something I want to give you.

421
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,260
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

422
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,130
Senior.

423
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,311
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

424
00:39:20,311 --> 00:39:26,583
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

425
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:32,991
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

426
00:39:32,991 --> 00:39:39,170
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

427
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:46,545
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

428
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,880
Ghosts!

429
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,720
Retribution has come!

430
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,000
Ever since Governor Mo passed away, such strange events have occurred.

431
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,320
This is divine retribution!

432
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,720
They were poisoned.

433
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,524
Move aside!

434
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,020
Great Chief, there are already many places in the city where such weird things happened.

435
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,560
It's absolutely terrifying.

436
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,480
The number of victims has reached more than 30.

437
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,960
If this continues, I'm afraid it will lead to chaos.

438
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,680
It's by the Huo'e Sect.

439
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,160
If we can't find a solution,

440
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:20,760
then the Huo'e Sect will be able to defeat Yingzhou City without bloodshed by using this poison.

441
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,460
Although the poison is potent, its onset is very slow.

442
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:29,010
There is no immediate threat to their lives.

443
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,520
I'll find a way to get the antidote.

444
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,960
Yes.

445
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,560
You take care of things here.

446
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,204
Yes.

447
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,900
 Behind Xiuxiu's painting, there is something I want to give you.
