00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:32,050
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,989
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:38,287
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,287 --> 00:00:40,656
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,656 --> 00:00:44,531
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,531 --> 00:00:47,666
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:50,831
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,831 --> 00:00:55,867
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,867 --> 00:01:02,239
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:08,547
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,547 --> 00:01:14,826
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,826 --> 00:01:21,139
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,139 --> 00:01:28,483
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:28,483 --> 00:01:37,217
   

16
00:01:37,217 --> 00:01:40,880
   

17
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,680
For the incident at Ming Hall,

18
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,620
    
 you have deducted your own salary,

19
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:49,120
all the guards have been heavily penalized,

20
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,480
and the person who self-immolated has died,

21
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,880
with only a lone elderly left at home.

22
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,480
Let this matter rest.

23
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,440
You just got married yesterday.

24
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,320
You can stop the morning reports for the upcoming days.

25
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,460
Stay at home and keep your bride company.

26
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,560
Yes, I heard that the Great Chief investigated the Ming Hall fire case throughout the night

27
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,480
and had not returned for the entire night.

28
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,920
The Great Chief has served Grand Empress Dowager with utmost loyalty and duty.

29
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,240
It's just pitiable for the bride.

30
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,240
Grand Empress Dowager should grant the Great Chief a good few days off.

31
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,880
I'm afraid his loyalty might be a sham,

32
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,080
as he's intentionally avoiding the bride.

33
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,120
The marriage of the Great Chief was introduced by me.

34
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,360
This morning, when I went to visit,

35
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,080
I found out that the bride was actually driven away in anger.

36
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,200
In the entirety of Shen Mansion, no one knows where the bride has gone.

37
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,400
Could it be that this lady from the Yan family vanished into thin air right after marrying

38
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,140
into the Great Chief's mansion?

39
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:57,120
Vice Minister Lai, in front of the Grand Empress Dowager, please censor your jokes.

40
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,480
Grand Empress Dowager, Vice Minister Lai is just worried about the Great Chief.

41
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,240
I have heard that Grand Empress Dowager intends to give the Imperial Guards some additional powers.

42
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,200
This is indeed a good thing.

43
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,760
But if the Great Chief cannot even manage his own household well,

44
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,760
how can he assist Grand Empress Dowager

45
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,260
in more significant positions?

46
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,860
Minister Shen,

47
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,740
what do you think?

48
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,000
Prime Minister Zhang's words are very true.

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,040
If one cannot sweep one's own house, how can he sweep the world?

50
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,600
I shall return home at once to console my wife and take care of the inner household affairs properly.

51
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,380
I will surely not let Grand Empress Dowager down.

52
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,800
You didn't go out to investigate cases all night.

53
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,840
How come you've gone to sleep without washing up again?

54
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,680
Did the Great Chief really not enter your chamber?

55
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:08,900
This Sixth Miss Yan, she is your niece. Right?

56
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,460
Replying to Grand Empress Dowager.

57
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,520
    
 This Sixth Miss Yan

58
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,200
is the daughter of Lady Jin from the Yan Mansion.

59
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,600
And this Lady Jin is my older sister.

60
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,380
Rest assured.

61
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:33,980
Shen Du might appear unruly, but in fact, he is methodical.

62
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:38,800
He won't do anything truly outrageous.

63
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,400
Yes.

64
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,380
I will make a trip to the Liang Mansion. 
    

65
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,500
Hey, you, what are you doing here?

66
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,660
   

67
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,720
Director Wu, I heard there was a case here.

68
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,900
There is a case indeed, but what does it have to do with you?

69
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:06,800
I heard that you got married into the Great Chief's mansion,

70
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,900
so why are you out and about in your wedding dress today?

71
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,660
- Could it be that you were driven out? 
 - Youâ€¦

72
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,520
When this woman goes on an errand, she always stirs up trouble.

73
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,720
Sixth Miss is quick-witted,

74
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,880
and she was once mentored by Chen Wen, the supervisor of the imperial prison.

75
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,600
She has inherited a lot of his investigative skills

76
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,200
and has always been a great help to us inspectors.

77
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,004
Exactly.

78
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,300
Director Wu. Marshal Xu. I was momentarily impatient.

79
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,640
Excuse my rudeness.

80
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,420
I just wanted to come to the crime scene and see if there were any clues left.

81
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,120
There are specialist personnel for investigating cases.

82
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,560
And you, a clerk, should just manage the records well. What case are you investigating anyway?

83
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,780
Go-Go back to the Ministry of Justice Office first and change your clothes.

84
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,920
Director Wu,

85
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,460
you've just returned from the western suburbs, haven't you?

86
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,072
 My Lord. 

87
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,760
Look. Look at the sleeve of Director Wu.

88
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,500
This blue flower on it is so beautiful.

89
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,920
Look, look. It seems his lady has learned a new embroidery pattern.

90
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,900
It's good for young people to be eager to learn new things.

91
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,120
If you want to investigate,

92
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,800
you can go in and have a close look.

93
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,420
But don't interfere with the inspector handling the case.

94
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,680
And mind your own business.

95
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,480
- What was that? 
 - Madam Wu doesn't know how to embroider.

96
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,680
His lackey, Feng Gui, has been frequently going to the western suburbs lately.

97
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,480
There are mud spots all over his legs. He even got a deed to a house.

98
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,460
Nine times out of ten, he's keeping a mistress in the western suburbs.

99
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,720
A mistress?

100
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
Let's go.

101
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,440
I am a clerk of the Ministry of Justice. Can I go and have a look?

102
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,400
Go ahead if you're not afraid.

103
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,380
 Master, did you notice anything before? Was there anything unusual? 

104
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,960
 Not yet. 

105
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,620
I heard that when the two of them were just unearthed, they were still tightly embracing each other.

106
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,000
Both of them had their hearts excised and bled to death.

107
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The woman's face was slashed,

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,480
but her expression was serene.

109
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,560
The man's body was intact with his skin turned black.

110
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,480
Judging by the slash marks and the bloodstains, they were inflicted postmortem.

111
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,180
In this weather,

112
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,300
the bodies somehow don't emit any foul odor of decay

113
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,960
and even give off a scent of mixed medicinal herbs.

114
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,700
Sixth Miss, you haven't lost your mind, have you?

115
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,700
Since when do corpses smell fragrant?

116
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,400
Sixth Miss.

117
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,200
Sixth Miss' words are spot on.

118
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,320
This morning, a young novice monk found the bodies when he was digging bamboo shoots

119
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,920
in the forest outside the temple.

120
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,250
The man has been identified as Liang Chenzhong, the legitimate eldest son

121
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,440
of Minister Liang from the Ministry of Works.

122
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,400
The woman is Kuang Zhanxin, a musician from Pingkang Alley.

123
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,500
Is this a case of lovers' suicide?

124
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,400
I don't think so.

125
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,360
The man's skin has turned black.

126
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,400
Did you find out what poison he was exposed to?

127
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,200
- The poison he was afflicted withâ€¦ 
 - Zhong'er.

128
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,000
Zhong'er.

129
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:33,400
- Zhong'er. Oh, my son.
 - Mrs. Liang, I'm sorry for your loss. I'm so sorry.

130
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,720
Zhong'er. 
    

131
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,700
You mentioned poisoning.

132
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,828
The poison that afflicted your son was "Dripping Water Guanyin".

133
00:08:44,828 --> 00:08:46,653
   

134
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,040
The Ministry of Justice and the inspector will definitely 
    

135
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,400
find out your son's cause of death.

136
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,300
Find out what?

137
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,080
- Older Liang. 
 - I apologize.

138
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,800
Sorry, sorry.

139
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,300
Take care, Minister Liang!

140
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,200
Are you still investigating?

141
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,420
Ximing Temple is an imperial temple built by the imperial order.

142
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,500
All the reputable officials and nobles of Xiang'an would come here to offer incense.

143
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,600
With this kind of incident,

144
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,720
- naturally, there must be an explanation. 
 - Yes, you're right.

145
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,960
Madame Liang made such a scene and it messed with my head.

146
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,400
Quickly investigate the case. Quickly close the case.

147
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,160
- Lu Chuichui. 
 - Yes.

148
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,780
Go, go, go. Take the already identified information and send it back to the Ministry of Justice for filing.

149
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,340
I've heard that the abbot of Ximing Temple had stored quite a good selection of tea.

150
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,920
Let's go and have some free tea.

151
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,800
Drinking tea? He still has the nerve to drink tea.

152
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,960
Wu Taiming brings no peace.

153
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,820
All he does is act high and mighty. I can't believe him.

154
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,280
Sixth Miss, you have been looking at the bodies for a long time.

155
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,560
Wait until you're done, come with me.

156
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,680
If Wu Taiming is enjoying tea, we should also treat ourselves better.

157
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,680
I will take you to Furong Garden for the new opera and some good tea.

158
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,300
Chuichui, you go back first. I want to take a closer look at the corpse pit again.

159
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,100
- Go then. 
 - All right.

160
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,800
I'm leaving.

161
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,320
 Dripping Water Guanyin? 

162
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,460
It seems you still haven't clearly remembered my words.

163
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,540
- I wouldn't dare. 
 - What are you doing here instead of at the Shen Mansion?

164
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,600
Although I have married into the Shen family, I'm still a clerk of the Ministry of Justice.

165
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,560
How can I not come when a murder has occurred here?

166
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,560
You are just a clerk of the Ministry of Justice without rank.

167
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,580
How come you have taken on the duty of a coroner?

168
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,800
I have also never heard that the Great Chief of the Imperial Guards needed to put out a fire personally

169
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,320
and toil all night for it, at the expense of missing his wedding night.

170
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,920
Great Chief, I just asked the inspector for the investigation results.

171
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,300
There is very little blood in the pit. Mostly, it is corpse fluid.

172
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,740
Liang and Kuang were probably moved here after most of their blood had dried.

173
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,360
But there are no wheel tracks nearby.

174
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,760
There are, however, many footprints.

175
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,340
This place has countless pilgrims, and even the Princess of Valor is a regular visitor.

176
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,680
What can be discerned from footprints?

177
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,440
What about the shovel marks in the pit?

178
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,880
Can they show how long ago it was?

179
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,880
It must have been some time ago. But the coroner says it's difficult to judge the time.

180
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,340
The 15th day of the fourth month.

181
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,420
- How do you know? 
 - The edge of the pit is thinner at the bottom and thicker at the top.

182
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,000
The impact point is sharp, and the edge is round.

183
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,540
The murderer or an accomplice used a commonly seen round-headed shovel.

184
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,080
The soil at the side of the pit is loose, with a heavy center.

185
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,460
The soil at the bottom of the pit is compact. This is a manifestation of post-rain soil.

186
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,080
Today is the eighth day of the fifth month.

187
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,180
The last time it rained was on the fifteenth of the fourth month.

188
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,030
Here.

189
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,080
When I came out this morning, I took some from the house.

190
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,660
When I return, I'll have to ask the old butler, which store he bought these sweet preserved fruits from.

191
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,352
Here you go.

192
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,560
The soil changes a lot.

193
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,040
Your findings may not be reliable.

194
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,690
Look here.

195
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,920
About three feet and eight inches above the ground, there is a streak of dirt,

196
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,040
caused by splashing mud and water.

197
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,080
The bamboo in Ximing Temple is the yellow-grooved bamboo,

198
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,760
which can grow one to two inches one day after the rain.

199
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,780
The splash marks are directly opposite the grave pit.

200
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,360
The marks are thick at the bottom and thin at the top.

201
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,580
They were undoubtedly made on the day.

202
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,340
Did Chen Wen also teach you these?

203
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,240
I am very concerned about you, my wife.

204
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,360
I've done a thorough research.

205
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,860
My master once said, that capturing criminals,

206
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,820
putting them in custody, and interrogating them are the duties of the Ministry of Justice.

207
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,520
Therefore, exhausting every means to crack the case

208
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,240
is the responsibility of any member of the Ministry of Justice.

209
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,660
You are just a lowly clerk without rank.

210
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,000
The duty of the Ministry of Justice won't fall on you no matter what.

211
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,520
- Iâ€¦ 
 - We only got married yesterday.

212
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:03,280
Return with me to the Shen Mansion today and learn the responsibilities of a new bride.

213
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,720
The Great Chief hastily welcomed the bride.

214
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,200
Now, all of Xiang'an knows that the Great Chief does not favor Sixth Miss.

215
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,900
And coincidentally, I don't care much for you, the Great Chief.

216
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,480
So from now on, we shall each do our own thing, without interfering with each other.

217
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,080
And you don't need to worry about what responsibilities I take on.

218
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,320
It seems that today, I have to worry about it.

219
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,590
Shen Du.

220
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,680
Let go.

221
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,524
Shen Du.

222
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,280
Put me down. Shen Du! Shen Du!

223
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,620
What are you doing?

224
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,430
What do you want?

225
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,500
Truly deserving of Ximing Temple.

226
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,640
How can one get such good tea in the office?

227
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,400
Unfortunately for your husband, I married a lady who is wholeheartedly devoted to official duties.

228
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,460
So I can only bring her home for some comfort.

229
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,600
Put me down now.

230
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,900
Nice scenery.

231
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,680
Shen Du, what are you doing?

232
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,350
Put me down now.

233
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,040
I advise that you be more obedient;

234
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,140
otherwise, I'll show affection to you in public.

235
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,560
What?

236
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,120
That girl, Yan Xing, and the other one on the horse is...

237
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,340
Great Chief Shen?

238
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,010
Didn't they say that White Ghost threatened Lady Shen

239
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,460
with a knife to her neck on the day of their marriage?

240
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,440
It appears these are all rumors then.

241
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,440
Now, you are now Lady Shen in everyone's eyes.

242
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,780
Having already entered the game, there's no longer a choice to leave unscathed.

243
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,920
A monkey dressed in silk is still a monkey.

244
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,800
You put on this show.

245
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,200
Are you trying to win a reputation as a good husband and son-in-law?

246
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,820
We are newlyweds. Being intimate is natural.

247
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:05,700
Today, I will definitely make you and the people behind you satisfied.

248
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,360
The Imperial Guards manage myriad affairs daily.

249
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,720
I'm sure you have many things to attend to on behalf of the Grand Empress Dowager.

250
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,200
Taking me along might be inconvenient, right?

251
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,200
- Are you dead or crippled? 
 - Great Chief.

252
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,320
If you are neither dead nor crippled, what inconvenience could there be?

253
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,864
A letter from the palace.

254
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,560
   
 Quickly resolve the Ximing Temple murder case. 

255
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,560
 Ensure the safety of the second branch of the Liang family, Liang Chenyu. 

256
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,960
- I need to go somewhere. 
 - Where to?

257
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,500
Liang Mansion at Fengyue Alley.

258
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,434
   

259
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,360
 What's going on? 

260
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,680
 If he doesn't investigate the case, I still have to. 

261
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,340
 Following him like this is not a solution. 

262
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,839
Great Chief.

263
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,739
Our third young master is waiting for you in the study.

264
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,916
Great Chief.

265
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,800
Call me Husband.

266
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,340
Or you can say goodbye to your tongue after we leave Liang Mansion.

267
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,360
Husband.

268
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,168
Speak.

269
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,040
My official position is, after all, different from yours.

270
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,240
You have business with the master of the second branch.

271
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,160
It's not very convenient for me to accompany you.

272
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,420
I might as well wait for you outside.

273
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,200
I just want to go out for a walk.

274
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,260
Fine. Jing Lin.

275
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,820
- Follow her. 
 - Yes.

276
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,440
Great Chief, this way, please.

277
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,800
I stayed up all night.

278
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,980
I'm going to take a nap here now.

279
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,360
Go over there and stand guard for me.

280
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,840
All right then.

281
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,460
Since you guards can even watch the Great Chief's wife sleep.

282
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,580
There's no need for me to be coy.

283
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,608
Guard away.

284
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,380
Lady Shen. What are you doing here?

285
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,860
Here, for you. It's very sweet.

286
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,240
I heard that after the Liang family split, they built a wall.

287
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,460
The trees in this area seem to have been moved here afterward.

288
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:34,680
Logically speaking, these pear, mulberry, and locust trees are not considered auspicious choices.

289
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,800
The second madam ordered them when she was mad.

290
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,400
Separation?

291
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,460
Pointing at one to curse the other. Guilty conscience.

292
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,600
These two brothers hold deep grudges.

293
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,600
Could it be as rumored in the alleyways,

294
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,480
that the son of the second madam, Liang Chenman was poisoned by the Dripping Water Guanyin,

295
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,160
and it was done by the first branch of the family?

296
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,020
Be careful with what you say.

297
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,860
However, the second madam did go mad after the death of the second young master.

298
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,100
Since then, the connecting door in the wall between the first branch and the second branch

299
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,740
- has never been opened again. 
 - Madam!

300
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,480
What are you doing, Madam?

301
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,376
Avoiding Whiteâ€¦

302
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,520
I'm hiding from my husband.

303
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,680
Well, since I married him yesterday, my husband can't leave me for a moment.

304
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,080
He has to send someone to follow me with every step I take.

305
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,000
I really need some air.

306
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,560
White?

307
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,420
Is the Great Chief so clingy?

308
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,160
Yes, he is.

309
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,480
I was wondering about it.

310
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,300
Although the Great Chief often comes, it's the first time he brought a female family member into the mansion.

311
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,520
So my husband is actually very close to the Liang family.

312
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,140
The Great Chief and our third young master are very close.

313
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,800
He usually brings some flowers, plants, and medicinal herbs to the second madam.

314
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,100
 Something happened in the second madam's yard again. Hurry! 

315
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,440
It's the second madam's yard.

316
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,320
The Grand Empress Dowager has decreed.

317
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,360
The crossbow improvement blueprints must be completed on schedule.

318
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,860
But how can I have the mind to draw them?

319
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:24,220
Your brother Liang Chenzhong's murder case is being investigated by my imperial guards.

320
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,080
You can rest assured.

321
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,520
Butâ€¦

322
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,560
Your family has been serving the Ministry of Works for generations, skilled in archery and machinery.

323
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,520
Most of our dynasty's crossbow equipment was designed by your grandfather

324
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,600
which has earned prestige on the battlefield.

325
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,040
Passing down to your generation, only you can be entrusted with this important task.

326
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,920
Grand Empress Dowager has always valued talent.

327
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,500
Just focus on completing the task entrusted to you.

328
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,880
Just like before,

329
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,960
as soon as my father picked up the brush to draw, your father would immediately turn and leave.

330
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,680
Before my father died,

331
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,560
he could never forget the incident that year.

332
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:27,980
    
  The criminal Shen Bingzhu deserves death for his crimes. 

333
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,000
There's no need to mention it again.

334
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,660
Rest assured, I won't repeat that person's mistakes.

335
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,140
 Man'er. 

336
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,940
 Man'er. 

337
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,760
 Man'er. 

338
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,920
 Dripping Water Guanyin? 

339
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,080
Don't touch my Man'er.

340
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,340
    
 Man'er. Man'er.

341
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,680
Don't touch my Man'er.

342
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,432
Help!

343
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,072
Help!

344
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,700
- Help! 
 - Great Chief, over there.

345
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,616
Help!

346
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,212
Helpâ€”

347
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,008
Help me!

348
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,456
Helpâ€”

349
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,520
 Shen Du, what a cruel heart you have. 

350
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,960
 If you can't drive me away, you're thinking of taking the chance to drown me here. 

351
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,840
Help!

352
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,460
- Help me. 
 - Here.

353
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,160
Clean it up.

354
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,260
Take the Great Chief's wife to bathe and change.

355
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,960
I'm so sorry about today.

356
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,240
I hope you will forgive me.

357
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,400
It's all right.

358
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,780
Tell your third son to focus on his work with ease.

359
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,500
Yes.

360
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,000
I'll take my leave.

361
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,480
Had I not seen it with my own eyes,

362
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,680
who would have thought that just the mere mention of White Ghost that makes the world tremble

363
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,400
would turn out to be a considerate husband?

364
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,260
A ruthless man to the outside world, but a man of deep feelings in reality.

365
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,040
What have you told those maidservants?

366
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,940
I was playing along with your act of being a good husband.

367
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:29,780
Maidservants from a grand household like this spread rumors in the most effective way.

368
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,040
Why did you save me?

369
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,600
If I were to die from drowning, it would be an accidental death.

370
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,400
You wouldn't have to find a way to drive me away.

371
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,700
Why not kill two birds with one stone?

372
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,800
I still need you for something.

373
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:05,192
   

374
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,760
I have settled your belongings, Madam.

375
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,240
You shall rest for the night here.

376
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,360
Didn't the master say that the main room should not be used as a bridal chamber

377
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,480
as it could easily lead to bloody disasters?

378
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,680
The master has already resolved it.

379
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,200
So rest assured and reside here.

380
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,560
I think the west chamber has better feng shui.

381
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,040
It's beneficial to me. I should go back and stay there.

382
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,830
Stop right there.

383
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,720
You don't have a choice.

384
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,160
If you wish to die,

385
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,680
you can leave Shen Mansion.

386
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,950
Fine, I'll live here.

387
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,880
Who's afraid of whom?

388
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,060
Bloody disasters?

389
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,840
It's not yet certain who will bleed.

390
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,180
Madam, the master has not yet started eating.

391
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,320
So what? I'm hungry.

392
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,040
The one who caused me to fall into the water today was the second madam of the Liang family.

393
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,640
Her son died from the Dripping Water Guanyin poison,

394
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,340
but she treated that pot of poison as if it were her own child and even called it "Man'er".

395
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,240
Now, this son of the first branch, Liang Chenzhong,

396
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,000
has also been poisoned by Dripping Water Guanyin.

397
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,140
How could it be such a coincidence?

398
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,100
Do not speak while eating.

399
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,200
I have finished eating.

400
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,140
Do you also think that Liang Chenzhong's death is Liang's second branch's revenge?

401
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,290
Great Chief.

402
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,230
Send it away.

403
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,060
Yes.

404
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,120
Leaving in such a hurry?

405
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,540
Skipping a meal?

406
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,380
So talkative.

407
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,900
You manage people's eating and drinking,

408
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,000
but are you also going to manage their speaking and blinking?

409
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,280
Remember, in the Shen Mansion,

410
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,180
you'd best choose to be blind...

411
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,120
and deaf as well.

412
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,120
The case of Liang Chenzhong has been handed over to the Imperial Guards.

413
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,880
The case belongs to the Ministry of Justice.

414
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,720
I thought you were smart.

415
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,400
Grand Empress Dowager has handed the case over to the Imperial Guards from the Ministry of Justice.

416
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,520
Don't you see...

417
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,800
her underlying purpose?

418
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,560
Grand Empress Dowager wants to calm the issue.

419
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,400
Because the Liang family is an important official in the Ministry of Works.

420
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,580
The design of the current dynasty's crossbows all came from the hands of the Liang family.

421
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,720
Liang Chenman of the second branch died suddenly and unexpectedly.

422
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,560
Liang Chenzhong suddenly died as well.

423
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,160
If the third young master was involved again due to a family vendetta,

424
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,500
it would inevitably affect the succession of the Liang family's skills.

425
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,840
Not completely foolish after all.

426
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,160
The second branch of the Liang family cannot be imprisoned.

427
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,090
Unless...

428
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,400
you want to confront the Grand Empress Dowager.

429
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,892
Or are you saying...

430
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,720
this is what Zhang Hangwei meant?

431
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,600
I am not a follower of Prime Minister Zhang.

432
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,960
You left the scroll in the room on purpose, to test me?

433
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,200
You should thank your cleverness.

434
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,480
Otherwise, you would have been beheaded by now.

435
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,080
In fact, there's no need to open it.

436
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:51,000
I can guess that it is the crossbow diagram inside.

437
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,200
What are you laughing at?

438
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,220
I am laughing at you. The Great Chief of the Imperial Guards

439
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:02,980
has determined that the murderer is from the second branch of the Liang family without verification.

440
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,040
But it might not be true.

441
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,640
The second branch of the Liang family bears a grudge against Liang Chenzhong.

442
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,819
Yet the murderer only slashed the courtesan's face to the bone.

443
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,400
I said, you don't need to investigate this matter.

444
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,820
What if I insist?

445
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,060
Either stay alive and be silent,

446
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,299
or become a dead person who cannot speak.

447
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:18,260
Great Chief, how about we make a bet?

448
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,940
You're truly not afraid I'd kill you.

449
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,800
Of course, I am afraid.

450
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:31,560
But you have also said that you still needed me for something.

451
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:38,200
What? Are you afraid of losing the bet to me?

452
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,200
How do we bet?

453
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,880
Let me investigate.

454
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,380
If the murderer really is the third young master of the Liang family, Liang Chenyu, you win.

455
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,590
I will personally ask for a divorce then.

456
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:54,380
My life will also be at your disposal.

457
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,600
You really seem to think your life is too long.

458
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:06,780
But if I do find the murderer, after three months, you and I will part ways.

459
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,320
You didn't want to marry me,

460
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,240
and neither did I.

461
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,560
Thereâ€™s no enmity or grievance between us.

462
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:24,360
We don't seek a century of harmony, only a pleasant parting.

463
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,148
Okay.

464
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:05,100
 No matter what, I must endure three months. 

465
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,420
 By then, the examination for the female officials will be over. 

466
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:11,420
 The matter of being dispatched abroad should also be settled by then. 

467
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,560
It's not appropriate for me to live in this main bedroom. Right?

468
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,640
If I say you live here, you live here.

469
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,480
Our marriage was bestowed by the Grand Empress Dowager.

470
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:39,200
In anyone's eyes, we should be overflowing with affection.

471
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,900
If you cannot do thatâ€¦

472
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,500
I'll lose my head again.

473
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,000
All right, I know.

474
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:03,080
You don't say. I think this main bedroom suits me.

475
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,880
In that case, you should treat me as the lady of the house in all ways, you know?

476
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,240
I have to play the full role. Right?

477
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:17,020
If I sleep here, where will you sleep?

478
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:22,920
Didn't you just say "in all ways"?

479
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,800
Newlyweds enjoying their bliss, close as lacquer and glue,

480
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,940
we can only share the same bed now.

481
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,120
You climbed onto my bed with your outerwear on.

482
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,480
This is what I always do at home.

483
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,220
If you're not used to it, you just have to give it a try.

484
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,480
You're right. I should try to get used to it.

485
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,000
You're pressing on my hair.

486
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,360
You don't say.

487
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:03,160
The preserved fruits in the Shen Mansion are really delicious. I can never get enough.

488
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,428
So good.

489
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,800
Would you like one?

490
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,600
Youâ€¦

491
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,860
Uncle Zhong! Change it.

492
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:34,280
Change everything!

493
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:03,560
The light is so bright. Can it be turned off?

494
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,480
No, it can't.

495
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,520
How can I sleep with it this bright?

496
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,620
You could just not sleep.

497
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,040
 Chichi, how have you been recently in Jiangnan? 

498
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:09,040
 Recently, I solved a wife-murder case. 

499
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:17,380
 The deceased did not commit suicide. Let me reconstruct the scene for you. 

500
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:20,000
 - Yuanniang. 
 - After you strangled Wang Yuanniang, 

501
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,160
 you put a rope around the corpse's neck, dragged her to the beam, 

502
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:27,320
 hung the other end of the hemp rope on the beam, and pulled hard to hang her up. 

503
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:31,180
 All these left marks on the beam. 

504
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:35,120
 Therefore, two different strangulation marks appeared on her neck. 

505
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,040
 The black ones went backward, and the brown ones went upward. 

506
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,720
 There are still rope burn marks on your hands. 

507
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,220
 - She was strangled to death by you. 
 - Clerk Yan, 

508
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:49,080
 Madam She has confessed that she assisted Cheng Xian in the matter of killing his wife. 

509
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,540
 This small shirt was embroidered by Yuanniang, wasn't it? 

510
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:55,620
 Upon examination by the coroner, Wang Yuanniang was found to be two months pregnant. 

511
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:58,060
 You're trying to deceive me. 

512
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:03,300
 Even if she was pregnant, so what? 

513
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,980
 You resented marrying into the family, and in anger plotted to murder Wang Yuanniang. 

514
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:08,880
 But what you didn't know was that she was wholeheartedly devoted to you. 

515
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,500
 She had long planned that after the child was born, they would take your surname. 

516
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:17,120
 The embroidery on this little shirt is the surname Cheng. 

517
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,700
   

518
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,220
 You blame Wang Yuanniang's maternal family for oppressing you. 

519
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:25,480
 But you know the truth better than anyone. 

520
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:30,260
 Yuanniang. I owe you an apology, Yuanniang. 

521
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,760
 Yuanniang. 

522
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:37,300
 However, on the deceased's body, there was also a pinprick wound, which is quite strange. 

523
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:40,120
 The coroner has temporarily been unable to determine its origin. 

524
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:45,040
 Lately, there have been many changes with me. 

525
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,480
Before dawn.

526
00:43:51,540 --> 00:44:01,550
