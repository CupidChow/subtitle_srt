00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,950
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,993
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:38,291
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:40,660
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,535
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,535 --> 00:00:47,670
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,735
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,735 --> 00:00:55,871
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,871 --> 00:01:02,143
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,143 --> 00:01:08,551
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:14,830
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:21,143
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,143 --> 00:01:28,987
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:28,987 --> 00:01:37,221
   

16
00:01:37,221 --> 00:01:40,310
   

17
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,204
Guards!

18
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,160
Pass down the order.

19
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,860
I am deeply grieved by the death of Commandant Bi Qiu.

20
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,200
You must thoroughly investigate this matter.

21
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,500
Starting from today, seal the city gates.

22
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,180
Do not let anyone escape.

23
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,260
I will personally interrogate any suspicious person.

24
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,900
Yes!

25
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,800
Thank you, Great Chief, for helping Bi Qiu just now.

26
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,480
He could be free from suffering earlier.

27
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:21,140
Today, I need to go to South Mountain to console his family.

28
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,700
His father raises pigeons on the South Mountain all day long.

29
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,920
However, his son died before him.

30
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,900
When I return, I will discuss with you

31
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,840
about capturing and killing the Half-faced Demon.

32
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,900
Governor Mo, please restrain your grief.

33
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,160
Raise pigeons?

34
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,760
 I'm afraid that Governor Mo Qianzhi of Yingzhou is plotting treason. 

35
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,320
 I command you to secretly investigate it. 

36
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,780
 When a red-feathered gray messenger pigeon arrives, a message can be sent. 

37
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:04,760
 Could it be Bi Qiu was the secret agent that the Grand Empress Dowager planted in Yingzhou? 

38
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,380
 Bi Qiu should act as the relay station for my messages. 

39
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,430
It's okay.

40
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,256
What's wrong?

41
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,864
I think...

42
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,400
I know why Bi Qiu died,

43
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,160
but I cannot say it.

44
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,968
It's okay.

45
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,220
If you don't want to say it, just don't.

46
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,210
Shen Du,

47
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,520
do you trust me?

48
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,900
If one day,

49
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,080
your close kin and I stand on opposing sides,

50
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,880
can you still trust me?

51
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,780
Aren't you...

52
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,460
my close kin?

53
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,180
   

54
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,120
I'm sorry. It seems this tip-off is incorrect.

55
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,900
The tip-off claims there are traces of the Half-faced Demon outside the city.

56
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,320
But we don't see the Half-faced Demon.

57
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,400
There isn't anyone around.

58
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,400
Brother, excuse me.

59
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,160
What happened today?

60
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,110
Why is there not even a single vendor hawking in this city or outside?

61
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,380
Why is there not even a single vendor hawking in this city or outside?

62
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,940
Young man, you must be new to this place.

63
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,240
This is too coincidental.

64
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,030
Yesterday morning, the Half-faced Demon

65
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,920
killed the Commandant Bi Qiu in the government office.

66
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,100
I heard it was a gruesome scene.

67
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,520
Even the skin was peeled off.

68
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,320
Who would dare to go out now?

69
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,620
I'm in a hurry to deliver medicine to my mother outside the city.

70
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,216
That's why I came out. I must go now.

71
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,210
At around the second watch of the Yin hour  (approximately 3:30 AM) , the Half-faced Demon committed murder in the government office.

72
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,120
Only us and the people in the office know it.

73
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,840
How did the citizens of the city learn about this?

74
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,680
Indeed, this matter is quite peculiar.

75
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,680
Unless someone deliberately made it known,

76
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,640
how could everyone in Yingzhou know about it?

77
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,340
It turned into a ghost town in a single day.

78
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,600
Chief Clerk Yan, Marshal Sun has sent a message.

79
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,200
At the city gate, the Half-faced Demon is holding citizens hostage.

80
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,520
Please hurry over.

81
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,620
 Like a moth to a flame, live at dawn, die at dusk. 

82
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,880
 Not entering the cycle of reincarnation,  

83
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,920
 undying. 

84
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,400
What are they doing?

85
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,780
They are performing a ritual.

86
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,888
Great Chief.

87
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,200
    
 Good! Everyone who should be here has arrived.

88
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,840
Next, I'll show you how to eat a person.

89
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,520
This knife is the Western Region curved blade.

90
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,060
The murder weapon used to behead Li Kaixiang.

91
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,540
Half-faced Demon, what on earth are you planning to do?

92
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,400
To appease the gods. Let them bestow blessings.

93
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,540
Half-faced Demon, if you don't want to die without a whole corpse, let them go.

94
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,680
Stop! What exactly do you want to do?

95
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,380
Mo Qianzhi? You've come at just the right time.

96
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,280
The day of the Three Yang is fast approaching. 
  (Three Yang often refers to an auspicious day, sometimes associated with the arrival of spring or positive energy.)  

97
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,800
Release the five ladies.

98
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,900
Everything is open to negotiation.

99
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,280
Well, we'll see how sincere you are.

100
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,640
If you agree to my terms

101
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,240
and stop investigating the case of the Half-faced Demon from this day onward, I will release them.

102
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,880
and stop investigating the case of the Half-faced Demon from this day onward, I will release them.

103
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,400
If you do not agree,

104
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,100
the whole of Yingzhou will become a city of death.

105
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,620
Shut up!

106
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,400
How dare you speak so shamelessly!

107
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,160
Commandant Bi Qiu devoted himself wholeheartedly to the people.

108
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,800
The people of Yingzhou all know this.

109
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,600
Yet you cruelly murdered,

110
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,760
flayed, and dismembered him, tormenting him harshly.

111
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,720
You are simply devoid of any humanity.

112
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,400
So you won't agree?

113
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,420
Do you want the people of this entire city to die or do you want them?

114
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,092
Take action!

115
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,800
Go to hell! Kill them!

116
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:18,620
Close the city gate, release the arrows.

117
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,310
Pan Chi!

118
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,920
Senior Brother, stop! You mustn't do this!

119
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,840
The Half-faced Demon has harmed the innocent.

120
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,160
He must be killed.

121
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,910
- How is he?  
 - I won't die.

122
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,780
The dart is poisoned, we need to stop the bleeding quickly.

123
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,900
Stay here. Don't come out.

124
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,020
Bear with it.

125
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,540
Pan Chi, bear with it.

126
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,340
Pan Chi, don't fall asleep.

127
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,960
Don't fall asleep.

128
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,200
Pan Chi.

129
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,480
Pan Chi, don't fall asleep.

130
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,380
Pan Chi! Pan Chi!

131
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:38,380
I never thought that one day you would hold a knife against my neck.

132
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,580
Stop shooting the arrows.

133
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,560
I'm afraid I cannot obey.

134
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,760
It's not easy to have this opportunity to get rid of the Half-faced Demon.

135
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,200
We can't let him off the hook.

136
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,000
For the sake of the people of Yingzhou, it's better to wrongfully kill than to let him go.

137
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,100
If there is accidental harm, at worst, I can compensate with my life.

138
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,320
To execute an imperial official is a capital offense.

139
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,480
Great Chief Shen, do not threaten me with execution.

140
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,960
I am wholeheartedly serving the people.

141
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,140
I just want to eliminate the Half-faced Demon and restore peace to the common folk.

142
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,080
Even in the presence of the Grand Empress Dowager, I would say the same words.

143
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,600
Open your eyes and see.

144
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,780
Is this the result you wanted?

145
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:16,320
If Xiuxiu were here, would she want to see you become like this?

146
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,220
Xiuxiu.

147
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,380
Stop shooting arrows.

148
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,040
Sixth Miss!

149
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,280
Guangchun Clinic?

150
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,080
This place turned out to be the headquarters of the Huo'e Sect.

151
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,800
Good!

152
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,800
It really is you, Ji Dafu.

153
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,040
You first murdered Li Kaixiang.

154
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,960
Then you framed Li Kairui.

155
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,260
Then you dragged Liu Zongyuan into this as a scapegoat.

156
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,960
What exactly are you plotting?

157
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,240
I did not frame Li Kairui.

158
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,760
I even paid to clear his name.

159
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,370
As for Li Kaixiang, so what if I killed him?

160
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,400
He deserved to die.

161
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,920
Liu Zongyuan deserved to die, too.

162
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,760
Those foolish commoners, their deaths are not a pity.

163
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,960
I'm afraid you are the most foolish one.

164
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,200
The commoners you killed were so innocent.

165
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,840
You too were once a son and a husband. You also had parents, a wife, and offspring.

166
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,220
Do you know the pain when loved ones are tragically killed?

167
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,000
Shut up!

168
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,640
Tragic death of loved ones.

169
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,480
How could I not know that pain?

170
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,480
But when I saw Xiulian,

171
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,320
she was no longer human-like,

172
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,060
disfigured!

173
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,420
But they promised me they would bring Xiulian back to life!

174
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,000
She will come back!

175
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,240
Who are they? Did they promise you that they could resurrect Xiulian?

176
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,240
Pity you are not like her.

177
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,620
So you can only offer up your viscera.

178
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,330
Shen Du!

179
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,320
Yan Xing, are you all right?

180
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,520
I'm fine.

181
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,960
How did you follow me?

182
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,100
The Half-faced Demon was in a fight and a piece of his robe was torn off.

183
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,600
It had a strong scent of complex medicines on it.

184
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,680
It reminded me of the place in Yingzhou where medicinal materials are most concentrated

185
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,560
and which is the least likely to be suspected.

186
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,800
Guangchun Clinic.

187
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,668
Let's get out first.

188
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,560
What's that noise?

189
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,556
There are snakes!

190
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,960
Shen Du, be careful!

191
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,880
Never hurt yourself for my sake, no matter when.

192
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,240
Shen Du, thank you for saving me.

193
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,240
After we get out this time, I will be your wife properly for once.

194
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,500
Did you bring the silver I asked for?

195
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,660
If I can leave Yingzhou safely at an early date,

196
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,280
you can be at ease sooner.

197
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,000
I have prepared all the silver.

198
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,100
It's placed right inâ€¦

199
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:44,720
How dare you! The lord will not let you go.

200
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,300
I'm afraid you won't live to see that.

201
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,560
The murderer, Ji Dafu, you can't escape. Guards!

202
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,780
Take the murderer to the execution cell.

203
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,512
Yes.

204
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,800
Jing Lin, hurry up.

205
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,720
The water's all boiled away and your meat isn't ready.

206
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,900
What's the rush?

207
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,840
Don't underestimate my knife skills.

208
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,120
Here, kid.

209
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,220
You're the kid.

210
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,120
Young Master Pan, this is for you.

211
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,620
Longevity Dragon and Phoenix Pot. Mutton Nourishing Soup.

212
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,520
Chinese Yam and Pork Tripe Porridge.

213
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,720
Please enjoy your meal.

214
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,780
Were these arranged by Chief Clerk Yan for you to make for me?

215
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,280
Madam Shen instructed me to make them for you.

216
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,340
Longevity Dragon and Phoenix Pot. Mutton Nourishing Soup.

217
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,200
And what he has made for you.

218
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,240
Chinese Yam and Pork Tripe Porridge.

219
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,320
Please enjoy your meal.

220
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,280
What dishes will the Great Chief have?

221
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,260
The Great Chief will have only one dish.

222
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,980
It was made by Madam Shen herself for four hours:

223
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,300
Ten Complete Nourishing Soup.

224
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,400
Young Master Pan, please enjoy your meal!

225
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,520
Kid, go.

226
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,840
Your hand isn't injured.

227
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,300
Why can't you drink by yourself?

228
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,080
My shoulder blade was cut.

229
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,120
I can't lift my hand.

230
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,500
Shen Du, it's been three days already.

231
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,120
You've long been healed. Stop lying.

232
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,720
Who said she wanted to be a good wife to me for once?

233
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,280
Got tired of it in just three days?

234
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,880
Is it possible that one time equals three days?

235
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,140
Stop being dishonest.

236
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,680
Shen Du, I haven't asked you yet.

237
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,760
Why pretend to not see and deceive me?

238
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,040
When did your night blindness get better?

239
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,400
That day, your knife skills were so precise in killing the venomous snake.

240
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,020
That kind of accuracy is not about sound location.

241
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,960
It's been better for a while now.

242
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,800
It's been a while now?

243
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,396
Wellâ€¦

244
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:53,100
 That time in the hot spring, he was pretending to be blind. 

245
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,280
Drink it yourself.

246
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,232
Great Chief.

247
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,236
Speak.

248
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,540
Ji Dafu has been arrested and brought to justice.

249
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,720
   

250
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,900
Mo Qianzhi, stop!

251
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,600
How dare you? Who dares to interrupt the Great Chief's interrogation?

252
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,696
Great Chief.

253
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,370
After our investigation,

254
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:19,800
Ji Dafu is the mastermind behind the Half-faced Demon case.

255
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,400
After he committed the crime, he gouged out Er Laipi's eyes,

256
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,420
beheaded Li Kaixiang, and took Liu Zongyuan's liver.

257
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,680
This person is extremely evil and guilty.

258
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,220
Not killing him is insufficient to appease the public's anger.

259
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,700
 - He should be killed! 
 - Kill him! 

260
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,840
He has harmed so many people.

261
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,360
Dying like this would be too lenient for him.

262
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,440
Exactly, this person is extremely evil and guilty.

263
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,900
Even a thousand cuts wouldn't suffice to appease the public's anger.

264
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,040
 He should suffer a thousand cuts. 

265
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,120
 Kill him! 

266
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,880
 - Kill him! 
 - He should be killed! 

267
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,200
Ji Dafu established a gambling house without authorization.

268
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,800
He killed your family members.

269
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,080
His crimes are unforgivable. Execute him immediately.

270
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,828
Wait a moment!

271
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,760
Chief Clerk Yan, what do you mean?

272
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,880
Could it be that you want to plead for Ji Dafu?

273
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,280
There are still some doubts in this case that have not been clarified.

274
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,000
Ji Dafu confessed to his crimes without hiding anything.

275
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,080
The evidence is conclusive.

276
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,960
The time has come.

277
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,104
Execute him immediately.

278
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,440
Great Chief,

279
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,200
haven't you always been saying

280
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,720
that you want to eliminate harm for the people?

281
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,520
Why would you want to save such an utterly evil person?

282
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:48,660
 Kill him! 

283
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:53,640
 Kill him! 

284
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,360
I cannot die!

285
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,680
I don't want to die!

286
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:06,040
 - Well killed! 
 - Well done! 

287
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:10,400
 Well killed! 

288
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,920
 He deserved to die. 

289
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,360
 A great satisfaction to the people. 

290
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,840
 Well killed. 

291
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,960
 Well done! Well done! 

292
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,128
 Well killed. 

293
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,140
Great Chief, my actions...

294
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,300
follow the will of the people.

295
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,120
 Governor Mo, you are wise! 

296
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,840
I smelled the scent of the place where I was confined.

297
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,240
- Jing Lin. 
 - Yes.

298
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,000
Investigate...

299
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,880
Yes.

300
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,520
He is the Great Chief.

301
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,960
The infamous White Ghost of Xiang'an City.

302
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,360
Why did he stop it just now?

303
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,780
Who knows, maybe it's retribution for the evil.

304
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,520
Stop talking, let's hurry up and go.

305
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,700
Let's go.

306
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,520
My Lord, a secret report from Yingzhou.

307
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,440
Ji Dafu is dead. The situation has changed.

308
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,960
We need to bide our time and act opportunistically over there.

309
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,440
Forget it, it's just a drop in the bucket.

310
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,380
Not important.

311
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,040
It is just the beginning in Yingzhou.

312
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,000
A single gun makes it hard to sound.

313
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,760
Keep a close watch on other places.

314
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,900
Strike when they are unprepared.

315
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,100
Only then can we rise high.

316
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,820
Yes.

317
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,040
How is the deployment in Nanlang and Xichen?

318
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,320
Everything has been done according to your orders.

319
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,140
Good.

320
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,240
If Heaven aids me,

321
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,760
I will surely triumph over Heaven.

322
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,740
If Heaven does not aid me,

323
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,440
I will defy Heaven.

324
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:10,120
The people of Yingzhou are all happy about Ji Dafu's death.

325
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,360
Naturally.

326
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,120
Ji Dafu committed many evils.

327
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,400
The people of Yingzhou were all in a panic because of the Half-faced Demon.

328
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,120
They hate him to the bone.

329
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,480
Now the criminal has received just punishment.

330
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,400
It is right to be happy.

331
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,680
What a pity.

332
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,760
The people are singing praises that Mo Qianzhi has accomplished a lot.

333
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,300
But it was clear that Ji Dafu was tortured by harsh punishments.

334
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,120
Somehow, he became crazed.

335
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,400
Now our clue has been cut off again.

336
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,540
Now all the people of Yingzhou have seen it.

337
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,040
Mo Qianzhi detests evil as if it were his enemy.

338
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,880
He has made the decisive execution order.

339
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,540
It's me, Shen Du, who intervened.

340
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,840
One is praised by everyone.

341
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,400
The other is the White Ghost who terrifies people at a mere mention.

342
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,620
In the eyes of the common people,

343
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:03,080
you and Governor Mo are so different.

344
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,320
If my heart is at ease,that's all that matters.

345
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,800
Why fear the words of others?

346
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,680
The words of people can be fearsome indeed. Well...

347
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,120
Governor Mo has executed Ji Dafu publicly.

348
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,640
It seems to comfort the public's heart.

349
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,280
But it is also strange.

350
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,360
It was inconsistent with his usual cautious way

351
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,360
of doing things.

352
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,440
When the Half-faced Demon caused chaos in the city that day,

353
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,000
he mentioned the day of the Three Yang.

354
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,880
I remember his expression being somewhat strange at that time.

355
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,400
Is there anything special about the day of the Three Yang?

356
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,760
Isn't it just about to come?

357
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,520
Hold on a moment.

358
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,200
I've heard my mother say

359
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,840
this year's day of the Three Yang is indeed different from the previous ones.

360
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,960
It is the Three Yang's Deadly Day

361
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,200
which is rare in decades.

362
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,840
The Three Yang's Deadly Day?

363
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,000
What does that mean?

364
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,360
In any case, it means multiple inauspicious aspects.

365
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,700
She asked me to be especially careful

366
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,500
and instructed me not to leave the house under any circumstances.

367
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,760
Well, my mother believes in everything.

368
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,800
It's all hearsay after all.

369
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,320
But from what I know of Mo Qianzhi,

370
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,960
he is not one to care about such things.

371
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,160
Great Chief.

372
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,240
How did the investigation go?

373
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,840
It is just as you predicted.

374
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,640
I visited several households.

375
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,720
The girls on the city walls that day

376
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,440
who were abducted by the Half-faced Demon

377
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,880
were all rescued by the people from Governor Mo's government office.

378
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,720
However, there was no news afterward about them being sent back.

379
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,700
What?

380
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,040
Where are those girls?

381
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,320
Could it be that they were really taken away by Governor Mo?

382
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,000
It seems that the Half-faced Demon did not randomly abduct girls in the city that day

383
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,160
but took those girls away with a purpose.

384
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,440
However, I have checked it.

385
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,060
The family backgrounds of those girls

386
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,720
share no similarity.

387
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,056
It's Mo Xiuxiu.

388
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,520
Xiuxiu?

389
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,420
Do you remember the portrait of Mo Xiuxiu hanging inside the Mo Mansion?

390
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,040
Du Xiaowan

391
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,480
and the five women who were kidnapped by the Half-faced Demon that day,

392
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,760
between their eyebrows and eyes,

393
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,680
there are similarities with Mo Xiuxiu.

394
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,240
What if all this is not a coincidence?

395
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,960
Ji Dafu is dead.

396
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,000
The affairs in Yingzhou are not yet over.

397
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,360
If it's really as we suspected,

398
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,160
I'm afraid he was in collusion with the Huo'e Sect from the very beginning from behind the scenes.

399
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,920
On the day of Three Yang, they will act again.

400
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,420
What should we do next?

401
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,480
- Find them. 
 - Find them.

402
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,320
Find them?

403
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,880
Find them.

404
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,460
Those women who were kidnapped are the key.

405
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,640
Yingzhou is so big.

406
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,320
Where would these people be hidden?

407
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,080
Naturally, in those places that one would think impossible.

408
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,860
My Lord, everything is in readiness.

409
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,960
We're just waiting for the auspicious time.

410
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,120
Very well.

411
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,120
Xiuxiu, no matter what,

412
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,220
I must activate the formation today to bring you back.

413
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,184
Elder Brother Mo,

414
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,160
please let me go.

415
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,000
Considering I've always been obedient,

416
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,040
I beg you, spare my life.

417
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,540
Let me go.

418
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:02,400
I don't want to die yet.

419
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,464
Jing Lin.

420
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,188
Xiuxiu.

421
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,900
Thankfully, we arrived just in time. They are all alive.

422
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,040
Xiuxiu.

423
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,680
 Brother! 

424
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,720
 Brother, does it look good? 

425
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,320
 It looks good. 

426
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,276
 Brother! 

427
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,640
Elder Brother Mo.

428
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,990
Impossible.

429
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,680
Xiuxiu wouldn't call me Elder Brother Mo.

430
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,280
 She would only call me Brother. 

431
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,600
Impossible!

432
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,760
It's impossible that it would fail.

433
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,400
It's impossible that it would fail!

434
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,560
It's you people!

435
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,280
It was you who frightened Xiuxiu's soul away,

436
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,920
making her unable to find her way back.

437
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,660
Shen Du, you're so heartless.

438
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,820
In this world,

439
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:34,040
there is no way to resurrect the dead.

440
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,240
He has gone mad to the point of almost losing his humanity.

441
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,200
Humanity?

442
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,980
Not knowing others' suffering, do not persuade others to be good.

443
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:56,320
Shen Du, you should understand this principle.

444
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,540
If it were possible for the wrongfully dead to be resurrected, what would you choose?

445
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,560
Xiuxiu was the kindest

446
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,620
and most innocent person in this world.

447
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,540
Yet those scoundrels forced her to her death.

448
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,612
Mo Xiuxiu.

449
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,280
Was she not illâ€¦?

450
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,248
Who exactly...

451
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,880
caused Xiuxiu's death?

452
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,460
Before Xiuxiu died,

453
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:32,920
she kept asking why and what she had done wrong.

454
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,880
 Give me some food, please. 

455
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,820
 Give me some food, please. 

456
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,220
 What's the matter? 

457
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,320
   
 My Lord, there are displaced people blocking the road. 

458
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,160
 Take some food and distribute it to them. 

459
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,860
 Yes. 

460
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,160
 Brother, as we get closer to Yingzhou, 

461
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,720
 the number of displaced people increases. 

462
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,280
 If you take over Gannandao in the future, 

463
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,680
 I hope you will provide assistance for these displaced people 

464
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,440
 and give them a place of stability. 

465
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,280
 My dear sister, you are just too kind-hearted. 

466
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,620
 - Come, Xiuxiu. 
 - Welcome, honored guest! 

467
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,239
 Please come inside. 

468
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,639
 We will stay here for the night. 

469
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,760
 The horses must be tired after a day's travel. 

470
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,880
 Please come in. 

471
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,159
 Miss, are you feeling unwell? 

472
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,000
 Let me assist you to rest over there. 

473
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,780
 No need. My family is urgently waiting for the water. 

474
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,760
 I must hurry and take it back. 

475
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,120
 You are beautiful and kind-hearted. 

476
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,600
 Please accompany me for a part of the way. 

477
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,800
 All right, I will help you over there. 

478
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,580
 Thank you, Miss. 

479
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,040
 Let's go. 

480
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,640
 Save me! Save me! 

481
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,160
 I just encountered some bad people. 

482
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,760
 My family is waiting for me at the post station. 

483
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,560
 Please, can you take me back? 

484
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,030
 Rest assured. I will save you. 

485
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,780
 - Xiuxiu. 
 - Don't come over. 

486
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,080
 Don't. 

487
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,280
 - Stay away. 
 - Xiuxiu. 

488
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,080
 Xiuxiu, it's all right now. 

489
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,040
 Come back with me. 

490
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,360
 Nobody will hurt you anymore. 

491
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,960
 No, I was wrong. 

492
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,300
 Brother, but I just wanted to help people. 

493
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,900
 - What exactly did I do wrong? 
 - Xiuxiu. 

494
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,360
 Xiuxiu. Don't! 

495
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,000
 Xiuxiu! 

496
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,680
 Xiuxiu! 

497
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,892
 Brother... 

498
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,060
 Who are you? 

499
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,920
 Who I am is not important. 

500
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,760
 If you wish to revive your sister, 

501
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,280
 I might be able to help you. 

502
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,700
 Reviving the dead is utterly absurd. 

503
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,600
 The world is vast and full of wonders. 

504
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,720
 What Great Cang doesn't have doesn't mean I don't have it. 

505
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,480
 As long as your heart is devout enough. 

506
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,720
 You really know the art of resurrection? 

507
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,596
 Of course. 

508
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,120
 Moth passes through fire to be reborn. 

509
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,280
 It is the foundation of the Huo'e Sect. 

510
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,800
 If you truly wish to follow me, 

511
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,740
 I can resurrect your sister. 

512
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,800
 As long as you can resurrect Xiuxiu, 

513
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,960
 I, Mo Qianzhi, 

514
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,360
 will follow only your lead. 

515
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,960
What resurrection technique?

516
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,960
It's nothing but rhetoric to buy people's hearts.

517
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,360
You have obsessions in your heart.

518
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,040
Thus, you listened and believed.

519
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,760
Senior Brother,

520
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,640
do you not know that under your protection,

521
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,400
the Huo'e Sect has been rampant in Gannandao for many years

522
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,160
and has killed countless people?

523
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,500
Do you still believe they will resurrect Mo Xiuxiu?

524
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,760
Why not?

525
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,800
What reason do I have not to believe?

526
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,560
As long as Xiuxiu can be resurrected,

527
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,800
even if it means killing more people, what's the harm?

528
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,200
Don't those rats deserve to die?

529
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,280
It was the Half-faced Demon of Guangchun Clinic

530
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,480
who killed those people for me.

531
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,120
Xiuxiu kindly saved the refugees

532
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,460
only to be humiliated to death by another gang of villains.

533
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,460
How can I not avenge this?

534
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,560
 Save me! Save me! 

535
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,260
 - Someone is trying to kill me. Save me. 
 - Don't be afraid. 

536
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,300
 Under broad daylight, there is no absence of law. 

537
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,700
 With our lord here, you will surely be protected. 

538
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,000
 It's them, they are the ones trying to kill me. 

539
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,540
 Why do they want to kill you? 

540
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,840
 Xiuxiu, 

541
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,760
 I'm here to avenge you. 

542
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,440
They all deserve to die.

543
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,480
They should all be buried with Xiuxiu.

544
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,300
Shen Du, why do you disrupt the sacrifice?

545
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,740
Why do you just refuse to let Xiuxiu come back?

546
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,720
Those people deserve to die.

547
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,750
What about them?

548
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,320
What did they do wrong?

549
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,760
This world has always been unfair.

550
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,880
Shen Du, you know it clear enough.

551
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,200
Using others' lives for sacrifices.

552
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,120
You didn't hesitate to take five lives

553
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,620
to exchange for the resurrection you wanted.

554
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,400
Even if it worked,

555
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,350
do you think Xiuxiu...

556
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,440
could really accept it with peace of mind?

557
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,700
Senior Brother,

558
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,880
Xiuxiu is already dead.

559
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,440
Xiuxiu is not dead.

560
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,040
I will bring her back.

561
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,380
Guards!

562
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:17,220
Using death to resurrect, to bewitch the heart.

563
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:21,580
Harvesting people's internal organs for use in a sacrifice.

564
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:25,140
Well, after Madam Tang committed murder,

565
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,760
she removed the internal organs of the victims.

566
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,560
She was also deceived by the Huo'e Sect

567
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,920
and wished to conduct this resurrection ceremony.

568
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,600
Creating mystery and spreading terror.

569
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,440
Only to make people feel awe

570
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,840
can the Huo'e Sect thoroughly control these followers.

571
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,200
Xiuxiu.

572
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,400
Be careful.

573
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,250
Slow down.

574
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,040
Madam Yan,

575
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,240
is there really no way to bring people back to life?

576
