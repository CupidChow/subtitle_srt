00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,980
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,024
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:35,024 --> 00:00:38,222
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,222 --> 00:00:40,591
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:44,466
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,466 --> 00:00:47,601
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,601 --> 00:00:50,766
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,766 --> 00:00:55,902
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,902 --> 00:01:02,174
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,174 --> 00:01:08,582
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,582 --> 00:01:14,861
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,861 --> 00:01:21,174
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,174 --> 00:01:29,118
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:37,252
   

16
00:01:37,252 --> 00:01:40,187
   

17
00:01:43,974 --> 00:01:45,812
Shen Du!

18
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,960
Jing Lin, has the imperial physician not arrived yet?

19
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,060
Jing Lin has gone to summon the imperial physician.

20
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,780
The rain outside is too heavy.

21
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,160
He must have been delayed.

22
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,680
This won't do. If this continues, he will lose too much blood!

23
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,760
Butler, prepare hot water and gauze!

24
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,350
Yes.

25
00:02:06,074 --> 00:02:13,533
â™«  May you also look up to see the brilliant stars and moon  â™«

26
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:24,157
â™«  Among countless others, I've found only you  â™«

27
00:02:24,157 --> 00:02:28,944
â™«  Time is fleeting and fate is shallow  â™«

28
00:02:28,944 --> 00:02:33,809
â™«  The winter in warm memories  â™«

29
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,840
These tools are things I use when dealing with the dead.

30
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,640
But desperate times call for desperate measures.

31
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,924
Please bear with it.

32
00:02:44,924 --> 00:02:49,060
â™«  I have waited until time bloomed into flowers  â™«

33
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:54,000
â™«  The ice and snow slowly melting  â™«

34
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:59,062
â™«  I hear those gentle words  â™«

35
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:04,629
â™«  He said he loves her  â™«

36
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:09,252
â™«  The flower in the mirror, the moon in the water, present in my dreams  â™«

37
00:03:09,252 --> 00:03:14,616
â™«  Itâ€™s not illusory glamor  â™«

38
00:03:14,616 --> 00:03:17,184
â™«  Why fear the flying sand on the road ahead  â™«

39
00:03:17,184 --> 00:03:19,939
â™«  Chasing time, riding a white horse  â™«

40
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:23,978
â™«  Let's go together  â™«

41
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,340
Why is he so hot?

42
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,120
Butler, go and have a look at where Jing Lin is.

43
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,560
Let me know once you find him.

44
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,332
Yes.

45
00:03:55,286 --> 00:03:59,741
â™«  The flower in the mirror, the moon in the water, present in my dreams  â™«

46
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:05,194
â™«  Itâ€™s not illusory glamor  â™«

47
00:04:05,194 --> 00:04:07,704
â™«  Why fear the flying sand on the road ahead  â™«

48
00:04:07,704 --> 00:04:10,573
â™«  Chasing time, riding a white horse  â™«

49
00:04:10,573 --> 00:04:15,254
â™«  Let's go together  â™«

50
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:18,440
â™«  Love is pure and originally flawless  â™«

51
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,658
You have saved me once again.

52
00:04:20,658 --> 00:04:25,841
â™«  Let's spend our time together  â™«

53
00:05:08,826 --> 00:05:11,120
   

54
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,320
Tears are of no use.

55
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,340
Of no use at all.

56
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,700
Huo'e cannot die in vain.

57
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,660
Shen Du...

58
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,140
will receive the punishment he deserves.

59
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,000
And Huo'e...

60
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,540
will eventually be resurrected!

61
00:05:50,407 --> 00:05:52,080
   

62
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,240
Your Majesty.

63
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,880
Grand Empress Dowager.

64
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,460
Overnight, throughout Xiang'an City, the news has spread.

65
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:02,300
They all say that Great Chief Shen was stabbed in the street by Chen Huo'e yesterday

66
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,680
and was critically injured beyond cure.

67
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,840
Vice Minister Lai claimed quite confidently

68
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,120
that Chen Huo'e had been executed according to the law.

69
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,020
But a dignified court official

70
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,840
was unexpectedly wounded by someone already declared dead

71
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,440
right in front of the people.

72
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,120
This is more than just a flaw in the pursuit and trial of the criminal.

73
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,880
It's practically a slap in the face of our Great Cang Dynasty.

74
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,960
Your Highness.

75
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,820
Everyone knows Vice Minister Lai's utmost loyalty to our Great Cang.

76
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,380
The Imperial Inspectorate commands absolute obedience.

77
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,900
All this time it is where the authority of Great Cang resides.

78
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,200
Vice Minister Lai is the feared Black Fiend.

79
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,040
To enter the Imperial Inspectorate is to comply without exception.

80
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,100
Now, Chen Huo'e has escaped from the Imperial Inspectorate time and again.

81
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:54,040
It is hard not to doubt Vice Minister Lai's role in this matter,

82
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,180
whether it is due to incompetence or deliberate aggravation.

83
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,200
Grand Empress Dowager, I beg for your discernment.

84
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,120
Chen Huo'e had indeed died under torture in the Imperial Procuratorate.

85
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,200
The trial records and Chen Huo'e's confession and her belongings

86
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,400
have all been submitted.

87
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,760
But I had heard though Chen Huo'e was beheaded,

88
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,920
she still possesses the ability to resurrect.

89
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,760
The people are spreading rumors that one day Chen Huo'e will return.

90
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,120
Nonsensical talk!

91
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,980
Madam Xu, bring it out.

92
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,540
Great Chief of the Imperial Guards, Shen Du, respectfully reports:

93
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,320
"I have captured Chen Huo'e.

94
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,000
She is a rare mirror-image person.

95
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,600
She was apprehended and beheaded on the spot.

96
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,560
There is no longer a Chen Huo'e in this world."

97
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,640
Mirror-image person?

98
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,640
Could this be the secret of Chen Huo'e's repeated escapes?

99
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,360
Vice Minister Lai, you personally conducted the interrogation.

100
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,100
Yet you failed to discover the anomaly of Chen Huo'e's mirror image?

101
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,360
I was negligent!

102
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,640
Were you negligent

103
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,040
or did you think there was no need to report to me?

104
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,780
I wouldn't dare!

105
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,100
I would rather die a thousand deaths than dare to conceal anything from Your Majesty!

106
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:24,040
It seems the majesty of Great Cang needs a change.

107
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,200
Vice Minister Lai, you've let the criminal off the hook.

108
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,060
Although it was unintentional, it was a crime of negligence.

109
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,460
Your salary will be docked for one year.

110
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,080
You should also do away with that usual entourage of yours

111
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,280
when going out.

112
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,659
I thank Your Majesty for your mercy!

113
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:48,660
Madam Xu, arrange for the best imperial physician and the finest medicine

114
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,540
to ensure that Minister Shen makes a speedy recovery.

115
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,112
Yes.

116
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,200
Having made such a grave mistake, he is merely docked a year's salary.

117
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,240
Mother Empress truly shows favoritism towards Vice Minister Lai.

118
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,800
If Your Highness has an objection,

119
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,200
why didn't you bring it up in the court earlier?

120
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,520
Prime Minister Zhang, what do you mean?

121
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,256
Prime Minister Zhang.

122
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,800
Your Highness, Chen Huo'e has committed heinous crimes.

123
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,200
Our Mother Empress made her own decision.

124
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,200
We'd better not to discuss it here.

125
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,480
Prince Xian makes a fair point.

126
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,240
I was rash.

127
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,440
It's just you who likes to play the good guy.

128
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,320
You've lost so much blood

129
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,760
and had a high fever last night.

130
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,360
You must wake up.

131
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,360
I haven't yet helped your Shen family overturn their case.

132
00:10:59,346 --> 00:11:02,521
â™«  Heart burned, a withered body, a lifetime of solitude  â™«

133
00:11:02,521 --> 00:11:06,322
â™«  Heart burned, a withered body, a lifetime of solitude  â™«

134
00:11:06,322 --> 00:11:09,566
â™«  Passion burned, where it scattered, where it mottled  â™«

135
00:11:09,566 --> 00:11:12,910
â™«  Passion burned, where it scattered, where it mottled  â™«

136
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:17,740
â™«  Drifting in the mist  â™«

137
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,640
 Why have you come again? If you get caught, you'll lose your life. 

138
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,360
 I promised to bring you the kickball-shaped pastries from the West Market. 

139
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,680
 Although they got a bit squashed on the way here, 

140
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,320
 the taste should still be good. 

141
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,128
 Quick, have a taste. 

142
00:11:34,574 --> 00:11:41,270
â™«  Love is complicated, it hurts you and burns me  â™«

143
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:46,042
â™«  Flowers bloom and fall along the way, heavy rain pours  â™«

144
00:11:46,042 --> 00:11:49,590
â™«  The lights will intersect  â™«

145
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:55,076
â™«  You are my whereabouts  â™«

146
00:11:55,076 --> 00:11:58,391
â™«  Who can save me from loneliness and confusion?  â™«

147
00:11:58,391 --> 00:12:02,860
â™«  Understand my vulnerability, no words are needed  â™«

148
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,560
 I don't have any money on me. 

149
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,080
 Let me give this to you. 

150
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,220
 I don't want your money. 

151
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,400
 Do you think I'm a servant delivering dishes? 

152
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,720
 No, Iâ€¦ 

153
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,840
 This whistle was given to me by my father. 

154
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,840
 Look! There's the character "Shen" on it. 

155
00:12:23,274 --> 00:12:27,900
â™«  Who can help me distinguish right from wrong?  â™«

156
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,560
 I'll go first. Otherwise, they'll come to catch me again. 

157
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,528
â™«  Who can save me from grudges and karma?  â™«

158
00:12:33,528 --> 00:12:36,560
â™«  Soothe my sense of loss, never to escape  â™«

159
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,760
 Will you come back? 

160
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,240
 Of course. 

161
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,340
 Someday I will overturn the case for the Shen family 

162
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,480
 and take you out with honor and integrity. 

163
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,040
When you were in the detention center,

164
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,000
it was such a difficult situation and you could get through it.

165
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,680
This time, you can surely turn misfortune into fortune, too.

166
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,020
 So it really was you. 

167
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,260
You will!

168
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,272
You will!

169
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:27,420
Great Chief Shen, even if you are sick, you must stay spirited.

170
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,560
Change into some fresh clothing.

171
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,420
Perhaps it could speed up recovery.

172
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,140
 Fortunately, it was you! 

173
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,900
I've stitched up the wound.

174
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,720
He's lying here

175
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,780
just like any other corpse.

176
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,640
I've dissected so many male corpses.

177
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,240
Am I afraid to change his clothes?

178
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:06,080
 He places this wicker piglet under his pillow every night. 

179
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,320
 The handwriting on the letter is delicate and graceful. 

180
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,300
 It must come from the woman he can't forget. 

181
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,360
Rest assured.

182
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,000
I won't cling to you.

183
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,520
You saved me.

184
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,680
I took care of you.

185
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,140
We are even now.

186
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,460
When the three months are up,

187
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,580
I will divorce you as promised.

188
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,460
Three months.

189
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,940
Divorce as promised?

190
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,200
What did I hear?

191
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,880
- Chuichui! 
 - Sixth Miss.

192
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,860
How did you get here?

193
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,480
Such a big thing happened. How could I not come?

194
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,460
After this morning's court session, all Six Ministries are talking about it.

195
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,420
The White Ghost was fatally wounded by Chen Huo'e.

196
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,040
Is he going to pass away?

197
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,600
He is badly injured, butâ€¦

198
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,340
But what? You're going to worry me to death.

199
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,180
Sixth Miss, what exactly happened between you and White Ghost?

200
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,800
Nothing.

201
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,760
At this point, do you still want to hide it from me?

202
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,120
You two are a fake couple?

203
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,160
Chuichui, you must keep this a secret for me.

204
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,240
I had no other choice.

205
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,840
Did Shen Du threaten you?

206
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,020
Most certainly!

207
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,440
Three months.

208
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,080
Then you can escape from the White Ghost's lair?

209
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,640
That would be a good thing!

210
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,080
But in his current condition,

211
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,060
what if he won't wake up in three months?

212
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,460
It won't happen. He will definitely wake up.

213
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,080
But what if he won't wake up?

214
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,360
Will you just keep guarding him like this?

215
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,280
He became like this trying to save me.

216
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,599
Yes, I know.

217
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,119
But you have to think for yourself.

218
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,028
In case,

219
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,839
heâ€¦

220
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,480
Will you just keep living like a widow for him?

221
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,400
- Pah! What nonsense are you talking about? 
 - Just spit it out! Spit, spit, spit!

222
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,599
Since the two of you are a fake couple, no matter what happens to him,

223
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,800
you have to plan for yourself.

224
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,880
Just think, when you return to the Yan Mansion in the future,

225
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,320
if you end up as a divorced woman,

226
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,240
your family's madame along with your siblings,

227
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,000
will they still give you good days to live?

228
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,880
Wouldn't you and Aunt Jin be subjected every day to all kinds of disdain and exclusion?

229
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,380
I think it's better for you to find another good man to remarry.

230
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,000
No, Chuichui, what are you talking about?

231
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,808
The Ministry of Justice.

232
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,540
I think the Ministry of Justice seems to have no good men to remarry.

233
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,600
Jiang Langxing. Why not consider Jiang Langxing?

234
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,040
Although Jiang Langxing always

235
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,800
has a sour face and behaves properly,

236
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,560
he truly is a good man.

237
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,360
At times, he's quite adorable! He is good!

238
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,320
You want to set me up with Jiang Langxing?

239
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,144
Isn't he good?

240
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,700
All right. I'll think about it some more.

241
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,300
I've thought of a more suitable candidate.

242
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,400
Marshal Inspector.

243
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,260
Although Marshal Xu comes from humble origins,

244
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:41,480
he is tall and imposing and has a generous character.

245
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,360
If you can't become the Lady of the Shen family,

246
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,540
being Marshal Inspector's wife would also carry great prestige.

247
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,740
Brother Xu is a good man,

248
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,800
but I have no personal feelings for him.

249
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,540
Chuichui, please don't keep playing matchmaker anymore.

250
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,580
Affection can be cultivated.

251
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:00,580
From Marshal Xu's appearance, at first glance, he is someone who would dote on his wife.

252
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,200
That's so much better.

253
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,920
That's better than being with the White Ghost who annoys you all day long.

254
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,080
I am only injured,

255
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,400
not dead!

256
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,020
- Shen Du! You are awake! 
 - You are awake!

257
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,760
Take it slow.

258
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,988
Lu Chuichui,

259
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,980
it's not your place to run to my mansion and point fingers.

260
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,508
Get out!

261
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,200
Sixth Miss,

262
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,500
- I'll wait for you outside. 
 - Youâ€¦

263
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,672
Slow down.

264
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,380
Youâ€¦

265
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,960
When did you wake up?

266
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,820
Just now.

267
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,668
Just now?

268
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,040
You just suddenlyâ€¦

269
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,900
I just woke up all of a sudden.

270
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,984
- Thank you! 
 - Thank you!

271
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,520
If it weren't for you,

272
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,280
I would have died at the hands of Chen Huo'e.

273
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,240
You got so seriously injured because of it.

274
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:52,580
It's Chen Huo'e who was wrong, not you.

275
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,800
Weren't my injuries treated by you?

276
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,220
Where's the body of Chen Huo'e?

277
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,120
At the time, you were injured.

278
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,400
Jing Lin and I rushed to bring you back.

279
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,640
The corpse of Chen Huo'e was secretly taken away by someone.

280
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,360
Jing Lin went to investigate overnight

281
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:25,080
and speculated that it was someone from the Imperial Inspectorate who took her corpse.

282
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,440
Lai Luozhi.

283
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,600
I'm thinking,

284
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,880
Chen Huo'e's previous disappearance was a dereliction of duty by Lai Luozhi.

285
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,660
Now the people from the Imperial Inspectorate have stolen Chen Huo'e's corpse.

286
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,120
I'm afraid there must be a scheme.

287
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,720
We might as well wait a bit.

288
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,080
Use stillness to control action.

289
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,180
Let's see what move they will make.

290
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,440
You should rest well first.

291
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,060
 Butler, the Great Chief has already woken up. 

292
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,640
 Go quickly and ask the imperial physician to take a look. 

293
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,000
 My Lord has awoken! 

294
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,120
 Thank goodness! 

295
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,240
 Quick, go and call the imperial physician! 

296
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,740
Sixth Miss.

297
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,220
Chuichui.

298
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,380
You have finally come out.

299
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,660
You go and manage these people of the Shen Mansion.

300
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,760
Madam Shen's good friend is here. They're not even providing me with a meal.

301
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,180
Miss Lu, are you lacking silver?

302
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,520
You don't know. The new plays at the Furong Garden are really good.

303
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,800
The actor's performance is absolutely stunning.

304
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:30,620
I just used my pocket money to tip them.

305
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:33,560
My father has cut off my pocket money.

306
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,740
And this month's allowance hasn't been issued yet.

307
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:41,240
Well, we are besties.

308
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,580
Just say whether you'll take care of the meal or not?

309
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,500
Butler Shen.

310
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,440
Coming!

311
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,440
What's your order?

312
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,440
Please arrange for Chuichui and Miss Yun Que to have their meals.

313
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,180
- Prepare another meal box. I will take it to the main bedroom. 
 - All right.

314
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:01,840
Sixth Miss Yan, we rarely get to have a meal together.

315
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,600
Won't you join me?

316
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,720
Shen Du is bedridden with injuries. He just woke up and can't be left alone.

317
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,040
There are so many people in the Shen Mansion. They won't miss one person.

318
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,740
Yun Que, weren't you the one claiming that you would marry the Whiteâ€¦?

319
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,760
Shen Du? Shen Du was seriously injured.

320
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:41,040
You're not going to claim your merits. Instead, you're here seeking tranquility.

321
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,900
- I see through it. 
 - You see through it?

322
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,140
She sees through it. The White Ghost is not a good person?

323
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,760
Not a good match?

324
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,780
During this time, I have indeed seen one thing clearly.

325
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,080
Yan Xing, your ambition lies not with being Madam Shen.

326
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,160
Why spend a lifetime at the Shen Mansion?

327
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,020
Well said!

328
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,540
You two are still in the Shen Mansion. Keep your voices down.

329
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,840
Madam, the food you want is ready.

330
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,472
Servant!

331
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,420
At your service.

332
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:52,060
Carry out my orders. Now that they have entered the game,

333
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:56,620
let's add a bit more spice to it.

334
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,880
Right?

335
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,780
Let me tell you! He really is super handsome.

336
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,520
You're absolutely right!

337
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,280
In just the time it takes for a meal,

338
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,860
you two have become so intimate?

339
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,860
My meeting with Yun Que was very joyful.

340
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,820
- As if we were old friends at first sight. 
 - Close like sisters!

341
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:38,580
Chuichui and I both believe that only women truly understand women.

342
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,040
Our fate should not be decided by others.

343
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,880
Exactly! We should find our own path forward!

344
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,940
Therefore, we have decided to invite you to join us in three days

345
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,940
 to seek marital prospects together at Mingsheng Temple. 

346
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,880
Mingsheng Temple? Praying for a marriage match?

347
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:00,860
You don't really want to be Madam Shen for the rest of your life, do you?

348
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,920
Although I've lost interest in Shen Du,

349
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,920
 could it be that you and Shen Du are really a harmonious couple? 

350
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,280
 The three-month agreement no longer counts? 

351
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,160
Of course, it counts.

352
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,480
Then, why are you hesitating?

353
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:20,580
You wouldn't be in love with the White Ghost, would you?

354
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:30,960
When the agreed time comes, I will naturally leave him.

355
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,120
I am only focused on my career and reputation.

356
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,080
I haven't thought about remarriage.

357
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,120
Marital fate and career success are not mutually exclusive.

358
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,520
Exactly!

359
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,600
Three days later, we'll go to Mingsheng Temple first and pray for a marriage match.

360
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,500
 It's settled then. 

361
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,580
 Oh, right! In my room, there are freshly pickled fruits 

362
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,600
 that I haven't felt like eating recently. Please go try some. 

363
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,900
 I want to eat them. 

364
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,560
 Let's go! 

365
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,200
We're leaving! Don't miss me too much.

366
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,270
So much consideration.

367
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,340
Do you want me to choose for you?

368
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,420
What?

369
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,520
Do you want me to help you choose?

370
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,760
That's true. You are seriously injured now.

371
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,640
It's really not proper for me to leave you and go out.

372
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,580
Later, I will send those few dresses to Chuichui

373
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:45,740
and let her choose for herself. I won't be going after three days.

374
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,820
The dress is being chosen for Lu Chuichui?

375
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,200
Right. She has been staying at the Shen Mansion for the past few days.

376
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,380
It's a pity that the colors of my dresses are all not bright enough.

377
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,880
I'm afraid she won't like them.

378
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:06,440
Since you will go out with your besties, you don't have to worry about me.

379
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,400
The Shen Mansion is not without people to rely on.

380
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,660
As for three days from now,

381
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,880
I should be able to get out of bed by then. I will join you at that time.

382
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,340
No need, no need, no need! You've suffered such a serious injury!

383
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,580
You need to rest a bit longer before you'll be okay. You rest first, all right?

384
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,640
Isn't it just because I watched a couple of extra plays?

385
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,020
How did I fall asleep?

386
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,740
It must've been that that play was just too captivating.

387
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:29,240
Then, I justâ€¦

388
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,860
It's fine.

389
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,840
Today really is bright and sunny

390
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,500
with a clear sky as far as the eye can see.

391
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,000
Oh no!

392
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,580
Is it a human or a ghost?

393
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,456
It's a ghost!

394
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,580
What's there to fear about ghosts?

395
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,180
They were all people before they died.

396
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:12,400
You're not scared, but I am!

397
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,420
If it's a ghost, I'd be scared to death!

398
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,000
Every grievance has its perpetrator, and every debt has its debtor.

399
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,080
Whoever owes you, go find them.

400
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,620
I'm begging you, please go away! I'm begging you, please go away!

401
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,920
Back at the cemetery,

402
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:27,720
how come I didn't notice that you were such a scaredy-cat?

403
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,688
Oh, it's you!

404
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:42,840
Masked Man, it's so strange. I was so scared just a moment ago.

405
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,740
But as soon as you sit beside me,

406
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,540
suddenly this place seems not so scary anymore.

407
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:52,040
Perhaps it's because all the ghosts and ghouls here are afraid of me.

408
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,400
Why do you belittle yourself?

409
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,400
It's just a fact.

410
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,580
In this world, not to mention people,

411
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:05,260
even all evil spirits and ghosts fear not escaping me in time.

412
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,760
You're talking nonsense.

413
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,020
Why do you have to say something so scary?

414
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,320
You're clearly so good.

415
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:16,440
Look! It's just like in this void,

416
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,820
the invisible little fairies all want to be your friends.

417
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,672
If you don't believe me, look.

418
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,992
Watch carefully.

419
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,560
Little fairy, little fairy.

420
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,140
Would you like to be friends with Masked Man?

421
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,600
If you're willing,

422
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,280
just jump from this bowl into this bowl.

423
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,004
Is that okay?

424
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:55,460
You need Masked Man to personally invite you?

425
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,840
Masked Man, please extend an invitation to the little fairy.

426
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,080
Please join me, little fairy.

427
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,480
Look! The little fairy agreed.

428
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:23,239
The little fairy is willing to be friends with you and play games with you.

429
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:28,059
You are the most likable. Everyone will like you.

430
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,980
 All right, don't cry anymore! 
   

431
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,560
 You are the most likable. 

432
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,110
 Everyone will like you... 

433
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:41,420
 and they must all like you. 

434
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,350
Yes.

435
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:59,600
Little fairy, since you are also a friend of Lu Chuichui, can you do me a favor?

436
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,420
The little fairy agreed.

437
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,000
Well, are you scared?

438
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,360
You are really strange.

439
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,200
You're not afraid of the graveyard at night,

440
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,160
but you get scared so easily.

441
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,360
To say you're timid and scared of ghosts,

442
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,200
yet you're not scared of my mask.

443
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,120
What is there to fear in that graveyard?

444
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,280
Lying in that graveyard is my dearest mother I've been longing to see.

445
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,560
And you, you don't want to remove your mask,

446
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,320
simply because of the birthmark on your face.

447
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,280
There's nothing to fear about that, either.

448
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,660
By the way, I found out

449
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:09,600
that it seems the golden ring is not so effective in removing birthmarks.

450
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,200
Maybe you shouldn't use it.

451
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,900
What if it ends up scratching your face?

452
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,760
Well?

453
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,320
Do you want to take back the golden ring?

454
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,640
You keep it.

455
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,640
If I can't remove the birthmark,

456
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,680
I'll never dare to show my true face before you.

457
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,960
How can that be?

458
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,960
Having a birthmark is not your fault.

459
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,160
Whatever your appearance may be,

460
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,360
it should not affect the goodness inside a person.

461
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,400
I believe a person's appearance is just like

462
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,100
the ones for the roles in Chinese opera, Sheng, Dan, Jing, and Mo. 
  (Sheng: male roles; Dan: female roles; Jing: painted-face roles; Mo: supporting or secondary roles.) 

463
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,400
It's just a part of the character.

464
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,720
What do you think of my appearance?

465
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,440
Is it good or evil?

466
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,480
Is it loyal or treacherous?

467
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,580
When you are willing to take off the mask, I'll tell you.

468
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:20,940
What if I take off the mask and you don't wish to look?

469
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,480
What then?

470
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,200
Rest assured.

471
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,220
I gave you the golden ring in the hope that you could remove the birthmark.

472
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,940
But whether or not you can remove it is no longer important now

473
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:34,220
because I have long treated you as a friend.

474
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,760
I definitely won't judge a book by its cover.

475
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,448
Take it off from me.

476
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,172
Then I'll do it.

477
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,680
Lai Luozhi?!

478
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:01,860
Lu Chuichui, today, I've presented my true self to you.

479
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,120
Whether you are frightened or not,

480
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,520
please keep my secret for me.

481
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,960
Do not disclose this matter to a third party.

482
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,960
Remember what you promised me.

483
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,060
Don't go back on your word.

484
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,376
I trust you.

485
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,260
What are you thinking about?

486
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,620
Nothing. Look, Sixth Miss.

487
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:07,180
So many beauties and fair ladies, scholars and literati, have come here to seek marital fate.

488
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,824
They are here.

489
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,120
What a coincidence!

490
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,700
You have also come to seek marital fate?

491
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,500
What? Only allowing female officials from the Ministry of Justice to come,

492
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,920
yet not allowing us inspectors to come?

493
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,480
Of course not.

494
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,100
I am just marveling at this fate.

495
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,840
How it's so ingeniously arranged.

496
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,100
Isn't that right, Sixth Miss?

497
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,800
Stop talking! Let's go quickly!

498
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,744
Where to?

499
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,760
Didn't you say you were going to seek marital fate?

500
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,310
Seekâ€¦

501
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:57,900
Who would have thought, Jiang the Stickler, you would have this request too?

502
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,000
It's not apparent, Jiang the Stickler!

503
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,880
Fine.

504
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,680
Considering your age,

505
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,820
wanting to find a beauty beyond the books is only human nature.

506
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,380
Then I, Lu Chuichui, will accompany you; I'll risk my life to stick with you!

507
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,800
Sixth Miss, have a good chat with Marshal Xu!

508
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,800
I'll go and come right back.

509
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,664
Let's go!

510
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,040
You seldom come visit Mingsheng Temple. Right?

511
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,920
Let's walk around together.

512
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,440
You guys go ahead. Don't mind me.

513
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,640
 Shen Du, you must drink this bowl of medicine. 

514
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,320
 Pray for a marriage match at Mingsheng Temple? 

515
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,240
Jing Lin.

516
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,856
Great Chief.

517
00:42:11,018 --> 00:42:14,420
   

518
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,600
Brother Xu,

519
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,960
you must have something to say.

520
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:39,360
Sixth Miss, the other day I happened to overhear Lu Chuichui mentioning your marriage.

521
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,960
 Isn't this a joke? 

522
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,680
 How can a woman propose a divorce? 

523
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,600
 Why can't she propose it? 

524
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,920
 Don't forget it. 

525
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,560
 According to Great Cang's legal code, 

526
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:51,100
 if a husband and wife get a divorce due to incompatibility, 

527
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,070
 they shall not be punished. 

528
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,900
 Moreover, they don't have an actual marital relationship. 

529
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,000
 They've agreed to divorce. 

530
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,780
 Anyway, I've long told her to make arrangements and to find another good person. 

531
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:10,340
 It's just a pity. The inspectors and those from the Ministry of Justice, 

532
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:14,260
 none of them are suitable apart from Marshal Xu. 

533
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:22,080
I have to tear Lu Chuichui's mouth sooner or later.

534
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:32,690
