00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,950
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,996
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:34,996 --> 00:00:38,294
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,294 --> 00:00:40,663
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,663 --> 00:00:44,538
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,538 --> 00:00:47,673
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:50,838
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,838 --> 00:00:55,874
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,874 --> 00:01:02,246
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,246 --> 00:01:08,554
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,554 --> 00:01:14,933
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:21,246
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,246 --> 00:01:29,090
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:37,224
   

16
00:01:37,224 --> 00:01:40,259
   

17
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,500
Great Chief, I'm afraid there won't be a welcoming banquet today.

18
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,060
Young Master Pan found an important figure in the case of the headless corpse.

19
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,280
- Who is it? 
 - His name is Liu Zongyuan.

20
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,680
He rents next door to the victim Li Kaixiang.

21
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,820
After what happened, quite a bit of Li's fields ended up in his hands.

22
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,160
So, I went to his house to investigate only to find that he had just moved out.

23
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,040
Governor Mo, can you dispatch some people to look for him?

24
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,800
Bring him back if possible.

25
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,528
No problem.

26
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,980
Great Chief, my apologies.

27
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,600
This is an unexpected situation. Please forgive me.

28
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,360
The case matters more. Governor Mo, don't blame yourself.

29
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,650
Since he left not long ago and is still some distance away from leaving the city,

30
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,420
why not issue a city closure order?

31
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,270
I will have my guards search for him, too.

32
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,080
Maybe we can catch this person.

33
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,000
You're right, Great Chief.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,020
I will ask Bi Qiu to draft a decree to put the city under lockdown.

35
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,460
I hope we arrest the real culprit soon.

36
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,010
If we can also dispel the rumors

37
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,000
about the Half-faced Demons eating people in their sleep,

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,200
that would be even better.

39
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,860
I may be late tonight. Don't wait up.

40
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,060
Let's go.

41
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,880
I have to go.

42
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,540
It's still early. How about we visit Li Kairui in the jail?

43
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,050
We searched every corner of Yingzhou,

44
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,300
but Liu Zongyuan was nowhere to be seen.

45
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,640
He either escaped the city or he is hiding out in some mansion.

46
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,120
We've closed the city gates and set up checkpoints.

47
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,380
The chances of Liu Zongyuan escaping the city are slim.

48
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,680
Governor Mo, I suggest we search

49
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,960
the mansions where the suspect might be hiding one more time.

50
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,500
Better not.

51
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,160
The people in the city are already on edge because of the recent murder cases.

52
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,880
If they see us searching mansions in the middle of the night,

53
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,740
I'm afraid they'll be unsettled.

54
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,300
As you can see, we've set up checkpoints.

55
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,600
My people will inspect whoever wants to enter and leave.

56
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,760
He can't get away.

57
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,020
 Get in. 

58
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,700
 Next. 

59
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,300
 Write here. 

60
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,040
 What's in the bag? 

61
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,500
The troops of Yingzhou are truly disciplined.

62
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,420
The commander must have spent a lot of effort and money on them.

63
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,310
They have top-quality breastplates and shoulder guards,

64
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,960
unlike the usual border soldiers.

65
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,220
You are from the Imperial City. You must have seen a lot of fine military equipment.

66
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,500
The armor they have is nothing to speak of.

67
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,330
Yingzhou is located at the western border.

68
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,660
Defense is of utmost importance.

69
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,490
We save on expenses everywhere.

70
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,580
All the money I saved, I spent on military supplies.

71
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,920
There's no other way.

72
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,500
Great Chief, we found him.

73
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,020
This is Chief Clerk Yan from the Ministry of Justice. She has some questions for you.

74
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,500
    
 Madam Chief Clerk, I'm innocent, Madam!

75
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,620
Don't rush to plead your innocence. Just answer my questions.

76
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,840
As long as you can clear my name, I will do whatever it takes.

77
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,480
Do you know Liu Zongyuan?

78
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,880
Yes, he's on good terms with my older brother.

79
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,340
I invited him and my older brother for a drink that day

80
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,500
but something came up and he had to go.

81
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,660
Therefore, no one can prove my innocence.

82
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,940
Do you know where he's from?

83
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,720
I only know that he is a merchant,

84
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,880
who offered my brother advice on business.

85
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,500
Does Liu Zongyuan know martial arts?

86
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,020
No. He is just a merchant.

87
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,640
Are you sure?

88
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,810
I remember once a snake got into his house,

89
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,440
my brother caught it for him.

90
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,020
Chief Clerk Yan, what are you noting down?

91
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,260
The case details.

92
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,060
There's also a portrait of the Half-faced Demon.

93
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,040
I drew it with my imagination.

94
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,660
I didn't expect you to have such a talent.

95
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,560
Why don't you let me see what the Half-faced Demon looks like in your imagination?

96
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,250
You can see it when we go back.

97
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,100
If you look at it now, it can be very spooky.

98
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:49,680
If we attract the Half-faced Demon here, none of us would survive.

99
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,456
That's true.

100
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,260
Right after your brother died, there was nothing at the incision.

101
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:06,240
But one day, some of the crimes he had committed just surfaced at the incision.

102
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,180
Do you know about this?

103
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,320
No, I don't know anything.

104
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:18,320
In that case, you'd better come with us to check on the body.

105
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,700
We have no idea about those accusations.

106
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,980
You can explain to us if you come with us.

107
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,200
- Guards. 
 - Here.

108
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,140
No, no. I'd rather not see it.

109
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:34,180
That's too horrifying. I really can't stand it.

110
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:42,440
Besides, he was my elder brother.

111
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,840
That's one more reason for you to see his body.

112
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,770
You've been pleading your innocence. It's just some accusation.

113
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,720
Don't be so nervous.

114
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,120
Thenâ€¦ Please. I'm begging you.

115
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,240
I-I confess. I confess.

116
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,860
My brother had done some foolish things,

117
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,820
but nothing to be decapitated for.

118
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:18,300
My brother was a gambler when he was young, and our family went broke.

119
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,810
He reflected on himself, quit gambling, and started a small business.

120
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,820
He made quite some money.

121
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:28,220
But he started borrowing money again and even mortgaged the fields.

122
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,080
We suspected that he had started gambling again.

123
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,760
But it turned out that he had been tricked by a charlatan

124
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,220
introduced by a neighbor to waste his money on elixirs.

125
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,900
Because of that, we had a huge fight.

126
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,140
Shortly after, Liu Zongyuan, the neighbor who introduced him to the charlatan

127
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,220
came straight to Dafu's teahouse.

128
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,100
 Liu Zongyuan! 

129
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,340
 Gentlemen, please calm down. 

130
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,960
 I didn't come here to anger you. 

131
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,700
 I'm here to talk business with you. 

132
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,580
 We have nothing to say to you. 

133
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,920
 If you hadn't introduced that charlatan to my older brother, 

134
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,980
 would he have ended up like this? 

135
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,720
 How dare you even come here? 

136
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,920
 What have you done to his brother? He even sold all the fields. 

137
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,300
 How can you do this? Do you have no conscience? 

138
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,180
 I only mentioned that charlatan during a chat 

139
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,000
 as an interesting anecdote. 

140
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,600
 I had no idea that Brother Li would be so obsessed that he sold his properties. 

141
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,460
 I truly regretted it. 

142
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,580
 All I can do now is to help him minimize the losses. 

143
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,320
 I've been managing his business these days. 

144
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,760
 And I've bought those properties 

145
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,620
 that he sold off in his name. 

146
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,700
 If you don't believe me, here's the receipt. 

147
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,700
 Dafu, thisâ€¦ 

148
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,420
It turned out that Liu Zongyuan was a good guy.

149
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,310
The three of us agreed to get my brother out

150
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,420
for a drink in two days to persuade him to mend his ways.

151
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,380
 Well, Brother Ji. 

152
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:10,160
 I just remembered some issues I encountered in the business. 

153
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,740
 I'd like to ask you for advice. 

154
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,500
    
 Can we talk in private?

155
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,940
 All right. You two go ahead and enjoy the drinks. 

156
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,840
 We will talk outside and join you later. 

157
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,980
 Go ahead, gentlemen. 

158
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:27,980
I understand that they deliberately created an environment for us two brothers to be alone so that I could persuade him.

159
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,540
 Here, Older Brother. 

160
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,960
 Older Brother, look at you! What's going on with you? 

161
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,380
 You lost so much weight in just a few days. 

162
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,720
 From now on, stop believing in those charlatans. 

163
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,500
 Living your life well is better than anything. 

164
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,420
 Younger Brother, you don't understand. 

165
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,840
 Master Yuan truly has magical powers. 

166
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,380
 He can summon immortals. I have seen it with my own eyes. 

167
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:00,380
 Younger Brother, in my opinion, you should forget about those trivial matters at hand 

168
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:04,000
 and cultivate with me to become immortals. 

169
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,400
 Enough with your "immortals"! Those are just frauds! 

170
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,940
 Older Brother, we've worked so hard all these years, so howâ€¦ 

171
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:16,920
 How can you fall for those so easily? And you're obsessed? 

172
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,360
 Can you justify it to our parents in heaven? 

173
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,600
 - What about all our hard work? 
 - Enough, you are the fool here! 

174
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,200
 You don't even believe in your brother. Would I mean you harm? 

175
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,740
 Since we can't communicate, what's the point of trying? 

176
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,520
 Older Brother, youâ€¦ 

177
00:11:59,257 --> 00:12:01,469
   

178
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:18,320
And I have been jailed ever since.

179
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,420
I woke up to see such a sight!

180
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:25,560
I really can't figure out what exactly happened that day.

181
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,740
Chief Clerk Yan, I think it's about time. We should get going.

182
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,060
It's time? For what?

183
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,440
However, you'll need to get changed.

184
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,580
Why did you bring me to such a place?

185
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,150
Because I've found a clue, of course.

186
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,920
It's not easy to book the top courtesan. Hurry up.

187
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,060
Young Master Pan, you're finally here!

188
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,060
Come! Please proceed to the elegant room on the third floor.

189
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,360
Come on, this way.

190
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,070
This way.

191
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,220
 All right, I'm having fun! Drink with me! 

192
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,450
Please.

193
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,960
Young Master Pan, rest well here.

194
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,040
Xiuxiu will be here soon.

195
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,680
Like a dream, like a fairy, suddenly all is scattered.

196
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,700
"Where has the sunset glow gone, leaving the green screen void?"

197
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,010
You are really impressive.

198
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,140
You have acquaintances everywhere you go.

199
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,940
It seems that you are a regular here, too. Right?

200
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,920
I come here only to solve cases, nothing else.

201
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,260
Since Xiuxiu is the top courtesan, she must be very pretty.

202
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:16,260
I'd also like to see how the beauty of Gannandao differs from that of Xiang'an.

203
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,080
The hibiscus pales in comparison to the beautyâ€™s adornment.

204
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,660
The breeze by the water carries the scent of a beauty.

205
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,980
In your poem, "Autumn winds sweep gently, and the hibiscus flowers scent the air." 
    

206
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,460
Even the dew-laden lotus flowers can't compare with the beauty.

207
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:41,020
The fragrance borne by the wind is even sweeter than that of the lotus.

208
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:50,480
I only wonder to whom you dedicate such a verse.

209
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,980
The beauty dances like a spinning lotus flower.

210
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,540
A sight that the world should have yet to see.

211
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,480
It doesn't matter to whom it's dedicated.

212
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,900
What matters is that the beauty is right here yet she doesn't know my heart.

213
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:19,240
Miss Xiuxiu, I asked you to look into Liu Zongyuan.

214
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,060
What about the verses I asked for?

215
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,460
I have them in mind, naturally.

216
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:38,040
I also remember what you've asked me to do.

217
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,020
When Liu Zongyuan first came here,

218
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,540
he could barely afford to have tea in the main hall.

219
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,980
But only Heaven knows when he became so generous

220
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,600
and often asked for me.

221
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,880
 Let me tell you! That family is all fools. 

222
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,980
 I tricked them with nothing but some hand-written receipts. 

223
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,120
 His younger brother and brother-in-law really need some of the medicine. 

224
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,540
 Maybe we should get them to buy some elixir. 

225
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,240
 You're the worst! You're the worst! 

226
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,560
Liu Zongyuan must have colluded with the swindlers

227
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,500
to seize the victim's property.

228
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:37,100
In that case, Liu Zongyuan benefited the most from Li Kaixiang's death.

229
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,380
Step by step, he seized the Li family's properties

230
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,940
until he drained their assets dry and fled.

231
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,540
Maybe he chopped off the head of the victim

232
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,440
to link everything to the Half-faced Demon

233
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,360
to terrify the people and mislead us.

234
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,220
 Xiuxiu and Pan Chi haven't known each other for long. 

235
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:07,060
 Why would she confide in him so much and tell him everything? 

236
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,280
While you were watering the flowers, I wrote a new verse.

237
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,240
"Washed by the rain, a few flowers bloom gently.

238
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,400
On a cool summer day, she shows her delicate grace.

239
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,110
Like the lotuses unstained by mud. Tired of watching.

240
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,940
A butterfly brings a good mood over the wall.

241
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,619
The green leaves ripple with the gentle breeze. Gently hold.

242
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:28,440
A fragrance wafts from the beauty's sleeves.

243
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,800
The pretty young lady has her hair coiled up.

244
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,940
Secretly snips. A touch of bright red solidifies on the fingertips."

245
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:40,560
You two, keep this gentleman company.

246
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,980
Greetings, Young Master!

247
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,956
Whatâ€¦

248
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,650
I guess the boss lady is experienced.

249
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,260
Dressing as a man can't fool her.

250
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,820
Young Master, here's a toast to you!

251
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,550
You've been working hard on cases.

252
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,760
It's a rare chance to relax a bit. Drink up!

253
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,020
Iâ€¦

254
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,500
 Great Chief, why are you here? 

255
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,120
I can explain. I swear we went to the Fragrance Pavilion just to investigate the case.

256
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,220
I didn't summon those male escorts. I didn't touch them at all.

257
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,240
I believe you.

258
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,740
I'm not angry about that.

259
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,100
It's just that you should let me know if you're going out to work at night.

260
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,210
I couldn't find you at home, I thought something had happened to you.

261
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,110
It was a sudden turn of events, after all.

262
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,980
I will definitely let you know in advance next time.

263
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,520
Right, have you found Liu Zongyuan?

264
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,370
He tricked Li Kaixiang and got his properties.

265
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:55,440
And he's very likely the murderer.

266
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,120
We did find him.

267
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,660
Let's interrogate him now.

268
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,920
He's turned into a corpse, unable to speak now.

269
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:20,300
Liu Zongyuan lost his liver, and it was carved out from here.

270
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,560
"People laugh at the moths flying into the flame."

271
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,280
"Yet they don't know that mayflies

272
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,780
live at dawn, die at dusk. Not entering the cycle of reincarnation."

273
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,640
"Moths survive the fire and await reincarnation."

274
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,100
"An animal disguised as a human. Punishment awaits."

275
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,160
"Disrespect of the Huo'e. Disaster strikes from the sky."

276
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,420
Half-faced Demon and Huo'e Sect again.

277
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,340
Liu Zongyuan was a martial artist.

278
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,160
Look at the calluses on his hands.

279
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:31,480
So, Liu Zongyuan pretended to be unskilled in martial arts

280
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,100
as a merchant while secretly committing murder.

281
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,160
But later, someone took him out.

282
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:43,000
Perhaps we have overcomplicated it.

283
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,500
There is an easier way to find the real murderer.

284
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,860
Liu Zongyuan swindled the Li's properties and forced Li Kaixiang to loan money.

285
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,000
Who suffered the most?

286
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,240
Li Kaixiang is dead. Li Kairui is in prison.

287
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,400
And that leaves us withâ€¦

288
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,640
Ji Dafu.

289
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,160
That's right. Actually, I have been wondering.

290
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,690
Liu Zongyuan claimed that he had bought the properties back

291
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:08,560
in the name of Li Kaixiang

292
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,960
with nothing but some forged deeds.

293
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,700
How did Ji Dafu get scammed and believe that Liu was a good person?

294
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,780
No matter what, Ji Dafu runs a teahouse.

295
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:23,150
Wouldn't he have doubts about such a selfless act?

296
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,960
Either Ji Dafu is naive enough to trust others easily, orâ€¦

297
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,120
Or he never believed in Liu Zongyuan's story.

298
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,660
Or he never believed in Liu Zongyuan's story.

299
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:39,940
From beginning to end, he'd meant to take revenge on Liu Zongyuan.

300
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,000
Since Ji Dafu is a suspect,

301
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,800
we might as well look into him.

302
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,200
- Watch your mouth. 
 - What are you doing?

303
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,900
Don't push me.

304
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,900
- Get out of my way! 
 - My Lord, please do me justice!

305
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,400
These people are unreasonable and they're bullying me.

306
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,700
We have work to do. Let me go.

307
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,500
You must help me settle this.

308
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,100
You should report to the officials.

309
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,800
The governor will do you justice.

310
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,700
Right, I should go to the officials.

311
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,400
Why should I ask you for help?

312
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,600
Who are you people?

313
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,500
We're coming home to visit relatives and we have things to do.

314
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,300
So we won't bother you further.

315
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,100
I take my leave.

316
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,000
Let's go.

317
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:30,000
We inspectors pay respect to Chief Clerk Yan and Great Chief Shen.

318
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,600
What happened back there?

319
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,000
I'm Sun Tan, the leader of the inspectors in Gannandao. 
    

320
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,400
We were merely trying to stall you for a second

321
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,200
to not cross paths with Ji Dafu.

322
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,400
We've been investigating a case of usury

323
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,200
and the clues led us to Ji Dafu.

324
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,500
This person is elusive.

325
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,500
To avoid alarming the suspect, we resorted to this strategy.

326
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,000
Please don't mind us.

327
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,400
It's all right.

328
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,800
It's just that you were conspicuous.

329
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,200
If someone observant noticed you, wouldn't you be exposed?

330
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,700
You're right, Chief Clerk Yan.

331
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,800
We were reckless back there.

332
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,200
We will be careful.

333
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,800
If it weren't for the token,

334
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,800
it wouldn't have crossed my mind that you were inspectors.

335
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,400
Token of our marshal.

336
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,400
Please don't. I don't deserve this.

337
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,200
Seeing the token is as good as seeing our marshal. This rule, we understand.

338
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,500
Madam Shen, rest assured.

339
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,800
Whenever you need us for anything,

340
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,600
we will certainly go all out to support you.

341
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,300
You just said that Ji Dafu was elusive.

342
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,000
Was it because you found something?

343
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Ji Dafu appears to be a teahouse owner.

344
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,800
But he also runs an underground casino that is involved in usury.

345
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,200
A lot of money goes through his casino accounts

346
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,400
and gets circulated in suspicious ways.

347
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,000
Are you saying that Ji Dafu is very likely

348
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,400
gathering wealth for a mastermind

349
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,400
and laundering money through the casino?

350
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,800
This case is complicated.

351
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,200
We followed the leads

352
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,000
and found that many officials in Gannandao were involved.

353
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
So we had to count on ourselves.

354
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,200
If you wish to visit the underground casino,

355
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,920
you'd better disguise yourselves.

356
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,900
Do you remember it?

357
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,600
You're Sun Daniu.

358
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,200
- You'reâ€¦ 
- Liu Qingming.

359
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,800
I'm Second Brother Wan.

360
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,600
We are three businessmen who came to do business in Gannandao.

361
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,600
I think you overlooked the key issue.

362
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,900
What is it?

363
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,700
We are going to a casino.

364
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,700
Which one of you is adept at gambling?

365
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,500
Naturally, that would be me.

366
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,500
I assure you I'll end up winning their deeds.

367
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,600
   

368
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,200
This way, please.

369
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,700
This way.

370
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,500
Second Brother Wan.

371
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,400
 After you sit down, 

372
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,200
 wait for the waiter to serve the tea and give him a signal. 

373
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,440
This way, please.

374
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,200
 Someone will take you to the casino. 

375
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,000
 I'll be downstairs as a guard to assistant you when it's needed. 

376
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,600
 Place your bets! 

377
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,000
Stop, gentlemen.

378
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,200
You look new here.

379
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,400
Big!

380
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,800
Hurry. Don't waste my time.

381
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,400
These gentlemen are looking for some fun.

382
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,600
Just take them in.

383
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,000
All right. Understood.

384
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,800
Follow me.

385
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,400
 Come again! Come again! 

386
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,400
 Come on. Go on, come on! 

387
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,200
 Big or small? 

388
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,500
 - Big!  
 - Excuse me.

389
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,800
 Big! Big! 

390
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,600
Place the bets and have no regrets.

391
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,200
I won. It's all mine!

392
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,200
I won.

393
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,440
 Bet big! Bet big! 

394
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:10,500
 - Big! Big! Big! 
 - Small! Small! Small! 

395
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,500
Help out, will you?

396
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,200
Congratulations, everyone.

397
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,600
Again! Again! again!

398
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,500
I'm betting on big!

399
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,400
- Big. 
 - Place the bets.

400
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,400
How much are we betting today?

401
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,800
It's up to Second Brother Wan.

402
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,600
You'll play today.

403
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,800
What you win is yours. If you lose, it's on me.

404
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,800
All right.

405
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,100
For the first round, fifty taels.

406
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,300
- All right. 
 - Big.

407
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,000
Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets.

408
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,800
Big or small? Place your bets.

409
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,100
Look closely.

410
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,800
Fifty taels, look closely.

411
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,200
Big.

412
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,800
Place your bets and have no regrets.

413
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,500
 - I bet big! 
 - I bet small! 

414
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,000
 Something's fishy, indeed. 

415
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,200
One, two, two, five points, small.

416
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,320
Congratulations to everyone! Congratulations to everyone!

417
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,200
You're in bad luck today. Let Sun Daniu play.

418
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,700
I, Liu Qingming, have bad luck today.

419
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,400
Daniu, it's your turn.

420
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,800
My bellyâ€¦ My belly hurts so much.

421
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,900
What's wrong with him?

422
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,700
Oh, no! I need to go to the toilet.

423
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:58,000
But still, I'll watch you play before I leave.

424
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,600
Second Brother Wan never plays small.

425
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,000
He always plays big.

426
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,500
That's right!

427
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,800
I wonder how much you would like to bet?

428
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,400
A thousand taels. One round to determine the winner.

429
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,400
 A thousand? 

430
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,120
 What? A thousand taels? 

431
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,800
All right!

432
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,900
Such a large bet.

433
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,600
Shall we change the odds?

434
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,000
How about a 2-to-1 payout?

435
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,560
No problem.

436
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,800
Once the piece is placed, there's no regret.

437
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,460
A thousand taels. I'm betting on big.

438
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,800
 Open it! Open it! Open it! 

439
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,400
What are you waiting for?

440
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,800
 Open up quickly! 

441
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,600
 Exactly! 

442
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,000
 Open it! Hurry up! 

443
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 Right! What are you waiting for? 

444
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,400
When I was losing money, you opened it instantly.

445
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,600
What now? It's such a large bet.

446
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,300
Shouldn't you hurry up?

447
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,400
Exactly.

448
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,000
 Open it! Open it! Open it! 

449
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,900
 Open it! Open it! Open it! 

450
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,700
What are you waiting for? Open it.

451
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,600
That's right! Open it! Open it! Open it!

452
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,800
Open it! Open it! Open it!

453
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,200
 What's going on? 

454
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,600
 We've been waiting. 

455
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,000
- I won! I won! 
 - Impressive.

456
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,900
I won! I won! 
    

457
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,700
Gentlemen, you're so lucky today.

458
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,800
Why not take another bet when you're in luck?

459
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,800
Our boss wants to meet you in person.

460
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,200
No thanks. Tell your boss.

461
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,100
We've won enough for today.

462
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,800
Okay, I heard some distinguished guests have arrived today.

463
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,700
I, Ji Dafu, am the owner of this casino.

464
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,700
The bet doesn't matter that much.

465
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,200
What matters is to make friends.

466
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,200
I have prepared fine tea in the private room.

467
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,500
Please come upstairs to have some tea with me.

468
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,440
All right, let's hurry then.

469
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,656
Sixth Miss.

470
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,620
Gentlemen, pleased to meet you.

471
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:10,200
Come on in.

472
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,890
After you.

473
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,180
What are you doing?

474
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,540
So reckless.

475
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,860
Don't scare my guests.

476
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:21,000
Sir, he's basically useless now. What do we do with him?

477
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,280
Why would we keep someone useless? Throw him out.

478
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,640
Understood.

479
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,300
He dares to win so much money in my casino.

480
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,840
Does he think he can walk away with the money?

481
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,500
 It seems that the rumor of 

482
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:39,180
 the Half-faced Demon eating people's limbs originates from the casino. 

483
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,500
 The victims who had their limbs chopped off 

484
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,040
 dared not speak openly and claimed to have amnesia. 

485
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,100
Please don't mind us.

486
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,560
My subordinates are clumsy and lack discernment.

487
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,600
I hope they didn't scare you.

488
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,480
You scared me. What happened to that guy's arm?

489
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:16,180
It was nothing. His arm was too fragile.

490
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,760
It broke with just a touch.

491
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,120
As far as I see,

492
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:29,160
you gentlemen won so much money at our casino.

493
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,400
That's improper, isn't it?

494
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,470
We won the money. It's not like we stole it.

495
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,760
How is it improper?

496
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,480
In that case, I won't waste my time with you.

497
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,159
You have two options.

498
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,980
You either bet one round against me,

499
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,120
and return the money you won,

500
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:55,359
or keep the money you won and leave one part of your body.

501
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,639
Your choice.

502
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,260
I won't choose from either option.

503
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:02,000
I want the money and my limbs.

504
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,700
So, there's nothing to talk about.

505
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,940
Sir, someone wants to see you.

506
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,660
I'm busy. Send them away.

507
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,760
Governor Mo is one of the visitors.

508
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,120
Keep a close eye on them.

509
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,196
Step back.

510
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,592
Great Chief.

511
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:02,280
- Take them away. 
 - Understood. 
 - Understood.

512
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,580
Let's go. Behave.

513
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,144
Hurry up.

514
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,120
Outrageous.

515
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:22,040
How dare they set up a casino under my nose and spread rumors?

516
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,680
I reviewed the case files and found out that Ji Dafu's wife Li Xiulian

517
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,700
was the victim of a vicious case done by a gang years ago.

518
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:32,520
It happened because her older brother Li Kaixiang was unable to pay the debt.

519
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,920
So most likely, Ji Dafu used the rumor of the Half-faced Demon

520
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,080
to kill Li Kaixiang to avenge his wife.

521
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:41,020
This is outrageous. Does Ji Dafu have any respect for the law?

522
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:44,740
I can't believe such a villain got away. Guards!

523
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,560
Things have gone too smoothly.

524
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,240
Pass down the order. Apprehend Ji Dafu throughout the city.

525
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,744
Understood!

526
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:02,500
Great Chief. Chief Clerk Yan. Thank you for venturing into the casino today.

527
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,060
The case has been solved because of you.

528
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:07,100
Rest well tonight. Leave the rest to me.

529
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:11,760
Trust me. I will certainly bring Ji Dafu to justice soon.

530
00:37:26,242 --> 00:37:29,475
   

531
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,652
Half-faced Demon.

532
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,360
He managed to get away.

533
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,552
Shen Du.

534
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,480
Kill me.

535
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,280
All the meridians in his limbs were severed and his face was skinned.

536
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,460
Only a repeated offender could do this in such a short time.

537
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,640
What's wrong? What happened?

538
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,180
Bi Qiu is bleeding out. I'm afraid heâ€¦

539
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:34,120
Bi Qiu, what happened?

540
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,480
Half-faced Demon. Is it the Half-faced Demon?

541
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,180
I swear I'll make you pay!

542
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,380
Why did you do this to my subordinate? Come at me! Come at me!

543
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,840
Governor Mo, calm down first.

544
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,340
Did you see the murderer's face?

545
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,740
- Bi Qiu, what do you want to say? 
 - Please.

546
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,980
Please.

547
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:08,410
End my suffering.

548
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,600
Shen Du!

549
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,640
End my suffering.

550
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:57,060
Thank you.

551
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:04,240
Bi Qiu, rest assured.

552
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,560
I will treat your family as my own.

553
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,970
Don't blame yourself.

554
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:26,500
You can never take out all the villains in the world.

555
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,600
That I know.

556
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,044
It's just thatâ€¦

557
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:49,600
You can't bear to watch it with your own eyes.

558
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,996
So look away.

559
00:41:56,050 --> 00:42:06,010
