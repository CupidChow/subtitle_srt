00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,050
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,992
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:34,992 --> 00:00:38,290
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,659
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:44,534
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,534 --> 00:00:47,569
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:50,834
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:55,870
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:02,142
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,142 --> 00:01:08,350
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:14,729
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:21,142
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,142 --> 00:01:28,986
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:37,220
   

16
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,155
   

17
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,980
Give it to me.

18
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,480
That's more like it. Thanks!

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,840
Let's take a look over there.

20
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,770
 This is interesting! 

21
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,640
It's fortune-telling.

22
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,480
Let's read our fortune.

23
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,240
Confucius does not speak of superstition.

24
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,680
We've come to a temple.

25
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,360
Save your "superstition" speech!

26
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,244
Let's go!

27
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,040
The twenty-fourth lot.

28
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,380
Give it a try.

29
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,972
Iâ€¦

30
00:02:28,661 --> 00:02:30,531
   

31
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,180
It's the twenty-fourth lot again!

32
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,000
Wait! I didn't put the lot back properly.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,780
Let me try again!

34
00:02:44,214 --> 00:02:45,687
   

35
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,260
It's still the twenty-fourth lot!

36
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,320
Enough, since it's always the twenty-fourth lot,

37
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,600
let's see what it says.

38
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,116
Over there.

39
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,908
Twenty-fourth.

40
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,920
 - Fate ties you from the past life. 
 - Fate ties you from the past life. 

41
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,600
 - Now the time has come to accept destiny. 
 - Now the time has come to accept destiny. 

42
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,224
What does that mean?

43
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,780
Why isn't there anyone to interpret divination?

44
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,280
That's not right. Such fortune-telling can't be accurate.

45
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,240
I think it's quite accurate.

46
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,820
Confucius does not speak of superstition.

47
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,640
"Fate." Isn't it quite accurate?

48
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,408
Chuichui!

49
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,040
Chuichui!

50
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,980
Do you have feelings for me?

51
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,700
Don't listen to her!

52
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,160
Brother Xu,

53
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,520
I do find you different from the others.

54
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,040
But that's because

55
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,640
you never look down on female officials like the others at the Six Ministries.

56
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,740
You always help me wholeheartedly.

57
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,640
Therefore, I've long seen you like my older brother.

58
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,920
But there's only respect and nothing else.

59
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,640
Well, that's good! What a relief!

60
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,700
Look! If you don't mind accepting me as your sworn brother,

61
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,080
then I would truly be overjoyed.

62
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,672
Brother!

63
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,560
My sweet little sixth sister!

64
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,040
In that case, let the Mingsheng Temple be our witness.

65
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,340
From now on, we'll be sworn siblings.

66
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,800
This token is for you.

67
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,200
Holding this token,

68
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,160
you can command all the inspectors wherever you go.

69
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,860
This is too much. This is your token of command.

70
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,600
Your brother doesn't rely on this

71
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,400
to command the inspectors.

72
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,600
Here, take it!

73
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,980
No, I can't.

74
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,040
It's okay, take it.

75
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,300
In times of danger, it may save your life. 
    

76
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,040
I really appreciate it, Brother Xu!

77
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,280
That's more like it.

78
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,760
I will take my leave.

79
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,620
See you around, Sixth Sister!

80
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,320
Even Marshal Xu is not to your liking?

81
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,416
Yun Que.

82
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,320
Learn something useful from Lu Chuichui.

83
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,240
You are so weird.

84
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,440
It's one thing not to fancy the White Ghost,

85
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,840
but Marshal Xu is righteous and full of passion.

86
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,200
Isn't he the ideal lover women could dream of?

87
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,520
Why don't you like him either?

88
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,500
Yan Xing, do you think something is wrong with you?

89
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,850
Iâ€¦

90
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,280
How come you're criticizing me

91
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,380
just like when you criticized me for not liking Shen Du back then?

92
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,672
Could it be...

93
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,020
that you like Marshal Xu?

94
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,960
Is there a problem?

95
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,880
Marshal Xu saved my life.

96
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,400
And he's so manly.

97
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,600
If he has doubts, he just asks openly.

98
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,940
He's straightforward and never jealous or paranoid,

99
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,720
unlike some guys who can't speak up

100
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,560
and keeps everything to themselves,

101
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,380
as if they are ready to do something to you at any time.

102
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,000
Your preference changes quite fast.

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,080
Anyway, Marshal Xu is the perfect gentleman for me.

104
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,580
It's good that you're not competing with me and I don't have to share this time.

105
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,440
You never had to share anyone with me.

106
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,440
- I've decided. 
 - What?

107
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,040
I'm leaving the Shen Mansion.

108
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,600
I've had enough of that capricious White Ghost.

109
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,460
I will join Marshal Xu to be a chivalrous female inspector.

110
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,260
Okay, I support you!

111
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,700
If he doesn't accept you, I'll sit with you to protest.

112
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,180
That's my good sister!

113
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,160
You guysâ€¦

114
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,640
Where is Jiang Langxing?

115
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,520
He's so old-fashioned and boring that I dumped him.

116
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,920
 The Lady Serpent is such a beauty! 

117
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,560
 So beautiful! 

118
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,320
Why is it so crowded?

119
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,440
It's not the main hall.

120
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,550
Sixth Miss?

121
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,760
Registrar Lu!

122
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,120
What are you both doing here?

123
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,168
Pan?

124
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,780
Lu Chuichui, are you ever going to stop?!

125
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,080
Who else will you bring here?

126
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,940
I didn't call him here.

127
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,480
What's wrong? I'm not supposed to be here?

128
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,960
It's so lively here. I am Pan Chi.

129
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,560
Joining the fun is in my nature.

130
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,800
Are you also here for the Lady Serpent?

131
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,400
Lady Serpent?

132
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,940
Pan, are you okay?

133
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,119
I'm fine. I'm fine!

134
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,600
Stop hiding! I saw you!

135
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,000
Madam, Iâ€¦

136
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,800
Jing Lin, how come you're here?

137
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,500
Iâ€¦

138
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,720
Iâ€¦

139
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,920
I am here to protect Madam on behalf of the Great Chief,

140
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,540
lest someone harbors ulterior motives!

141
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,920
- Who are you talking about? 
 - Who do you think I am talking about? It's that person.

142
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,920
Shen Du sent you to follow me?

143
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,560
He's fine, right?

144
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,600
No, of course not.

145
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,480
Madam, during the days when you were not at home,

146
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,440
Great Chief couldn't bring himself to eat or drink.

147
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,220
He has lost so much weight!

148
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,240
He lost weight in just half a day?

149
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,340
Not only that, he's also haggard!

150
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,960
Every night, the Great Chief calls out your name.

151
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,200
Just like this.

152
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,720
Sixth Miss, don't leave!

153
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,656
Sixth Miss!

154
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,400
Did he really say that?

155
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,600
I didn't expect that he couldn't bear toâ€¦

156
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,520
Well, if that's the case,

157
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,000
I will go back with you.

158
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,420
For fear he falls ill because of this and blames me.

159
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,160
Sixth Miss, you're leaving?

160
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,240
Shen Du is injured.

161
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,720
I have to take care of him.

162
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,440
So block-headed!

163
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,208
See you around!

164
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,200
Fine, let her be! What a bummer!

165
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,640
-  Let's see the Lady Serpent. 
 - Lady Serpent.

166
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,120
Excuse me! Excuse me!

167
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,116
Excuse me!

168
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,620
Oh heavens! What a pretty Lady Serpent!

169
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,320
So beautiful!

170
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,940
She gave up the chance to attain immortality and came to the mortal world

171
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,820
to share her cultivated elixir that has been cultivated for a thousand years with everyone.

172
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,570
 Elixir? 

173
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,760
It's called the Elixir of Celestial Beauty.

174
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,780
It gives women tender and fair skin and unprecedented charm.

175
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,440
Single ladies may meet with their ideal matches.

176
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,500
Men can also ask for some to give to their loved ones.

177
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:31,640
The Lady Serpent wishes all the couples a long and happy marriage.

178
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,840
Lady Serpent, please bestow us with the Elixir of Celestial Beauty!

179
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,580
Ladies and gentlemen, the Elixir of Celestial Beauty is worth a fortune.

180
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,700
Supply is limited. Whoever wants it can get one with ten taels of gold.

181
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,480
- Tender and fair skin! 
 - So expensive!

182
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,020
Unprecedented charm!

183
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,000
Maybe there's a reason it's so expensive.

184
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,960
- That's true. Let's go! 
 - Let's go!

185
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:01,040
All right, the Elixir of Celestial Beauty is sold out!

186
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,980
- That's it? 
  - I've come three times and gotten nothing. 

187
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,860
If you wish to obtain the elixir, come back in three days.

188
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,360
Maybe next time. Let's go!

189
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,100
How do you feel today? Does the wound still hurt?

190
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,940
No.

191
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,440
Why do you look so sullen?

192
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,170
Do I?

193
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,320
Why do you look beaming with joy? Found someone you like?

194
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,920
But Jing Lin saidâ€¦

195
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,200
It looks like you're enjoying yourself.

196
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,880
That's right. While you're away, I am happy to enjoy peace and tranquility. I'm surely doing well.

197
00:13:19,877 --> 00:13:21,720
   

198
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,920
You went to see Xu Xiangren?

199
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,380
Yeah. It just so happened. What about it?

200
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,320
It just so happened?

201
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,980
At the temple where people pray for romance? And he gave you the marshal's token?

202
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,360
Brother Xu gave me this as my sworn brother. Don't be paranoid!

203
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,908
Whyâ€¦

204
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,560
Why would I be paranoid?

205
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,380
Indeed. You wouldn't be paranoid.

206
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,200
Once you've recovered, visit Mingsheng Temple as well.

207
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,180
It works like a charm. You might actually get what you wish for.

208
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,740
What would I wish for?

209
00:14:15,492 --> 00:14:17,840
   

210
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,920
Stop crying! What's all the fuss about?

211
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,880
Ma'am, my belly hurts so much!

212
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,940
May I come down for a bit?

213
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,580
I shouldn't have let you eat at night. Be careful. Don't get the tail dirty.

214
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,560
Be careful. Don't get the tail dirty.

215
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,720
- Thank you, Ma'am. 
 - Xiaobao, come out for a moment.

216
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,040
Guard the door.

217
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,624
All right!

218
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,720
What a fraud!

219
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,080
A cultivating Lady Serpent?

220
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:59,120
She's clearly a young lady kidnapped by traffickers.

221
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,460
Farewell, Miss.

222
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,088
Youâ€¦

223
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,060
I don't think I have anything of value with me.

224
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,640
Perhaps, only this is worth some money.

225
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,470
Please have it.

226
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,140
Here, take it!

227
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,320
Why do you have the Moth Jade? You're with the Huo'e Sect?

228
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,700
This isn't mine.

229
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,240
All my things were confiscated after I was kidnapped in Gannandao.

230
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,820
It's from the person who snatched me.

231
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:48,780
So you were snatched in Gannandao?

232
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,600
Was the trafficker someone from Xiang'an?

233
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:58,340
Judging by his accent, he should be a local at Gannandao.

234
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:05,140
The Huo'e Sect gained momentum in Xiang'an in a very short time.

235
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,000
How did it spread to Gannandao so fast?

236
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,620
That's not right.

237
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,680
When were you kidnapped?

238
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,780
I don't remember it very well.

239
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,960
But it's been months at least.

240
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:24,120
Miss, do you remember the way back home?

241
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,220
I have a way to travel between the Western Regions and the Jinwu Tribe.

242
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,060
How about this? Follow me.

243
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,980
I'll help you look for merchant caravans to the Western Regions.

244
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,560
Really?

245
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,160
Let's go!

246
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,200
Can you really attend the court meeting?

247
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,380
Your wound hasn't healed so you shouldn't move.

248
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,540
It's just a court meeting, not an arrest.

249
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:58,900
People would see you as a widow if I still don't show up.

250
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,820
Be careful, then.

251
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,060
These days,

252
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,984
- beâ€” 
 - Great Chief!

253
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,960
Great Chief. Madam. An oral edict came.

254
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,340
The Empress Dowager summoned Madam to the palace.

255
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,900
Grand Empress Dowager, this is Clerk Yan Xing.

256
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,160
I pay my respects, Your Majesty!

257
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,020
We're alone here. Spare the formalities.

258
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,000
Please rise.

259
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,820
Shen Du has done well in the case of Chen Huo'e.

260
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,860
I have not decided how to reward him.

261
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,580
Tell me. How should I reward him this time?

262
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,880
Whatever you bestow on him is a grace from Your Majesty.

263
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,680
No matter whether there is a reward, we will be deeply grateful.

264
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:27,860
You're still a minor official, but you have learned all the cliches in the officialdom.

265
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,500
Please forgive me!

266
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,960
Grand Empress Dowager, why must you give Clerk Yan a hard time?

267
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,510
Great Chief Shen was already leading the Imperial Guards

268
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,660
and he was made the Guard of the Capital.

269
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,240
He can't be promoted any further.

270
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,400
Why don't you give Clerk Yan some tangible rewards?

271
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,580
You are certainly siding with her.

272
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,760
I just feel that Clerk Yan's determination to become a female official

273
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,760
reminds me of my younger self.

274
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,480
So I feel like we are kindred spirits.

275
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,040
If that is the case,

276
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:09,580
then I shall promote Clerk Yan Xing to the position of Senior Clerk.

277
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:18,140
Grand Empress Dowager, I was going to take the exam this year, anyway.

278
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:22,480
I want to take the exam on my own and become a Senior Clerk.

279
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,880
Of course, you will take the exam.

280
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,200
The female officials of the Six Ministries are promoted and demoted based on ability.

281
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,360
The Empress Dowager is making you the Senior Clerk to present you with a greater challenge.

282
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,420
If you take the exam as a clerk, you remain a clerk even if you fail

283
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,680
and become a senior clerk if you pass.

284
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,820
But if you take the exam as a senior clerk, then you face greater risks.

285
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,860
If you fail, you'll be dismissed.

286
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:57,760
But if you pass, you'll have the opportunity to be promoted to Chief Clerk.

287
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:05,500
Do you dare to take the risk?

288
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:19,300
I wonâ€™t let Your Majesty or Madam Xu down.

289
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:24,200
All right. Madam Xu was right about you.

290
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,940
Senior Clerk Yan, I'm looking forward to your performance in the exam.

291
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:50,760
You and Shen Du are truly in love. It's so enviable!

292
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,280
Actually, heâ€¦

293
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,410
Actually, he sent me a message long ago,

294
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:59,120
asking me to take extra care of you

295
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,700
just in case you make a mistake due to nervousness.

296
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:09,940
He's probably afraid that I would disgrace the Shen family.

297
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,804
Is that so?

298
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,980
I don't think so.

299
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:20,680
I've known him for years and I've never seen him so concerned about someone.

300
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,900
Madam Xu, thank you for helping me today!

301
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,540
And thank you for telling me this!

302
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,240
I am very pleased!

303
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,940
And let me thank you for your trust.

304
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,060
Back then, when Jing Lin gave me the memorial on the case of Chen Huo'e,

305
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,260
I realized what you wanted.

306
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:45,200
We weren't so acquainted, yet you entrusted your life to me.

307
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,960
I trust you. And I trust that Shen Du wouldn't misjudge a person.

308
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,900
 But I feel my wife is perfect. 

309
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,000
 Let's go with this one. 

310
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,400
 It's simple. It suits you. 

311
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,500
 Although you have someone you can't let go of, 

312
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,200
 you have been nice to me. 

313
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,700
 Since it hasn't been three months yet, 

314
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,700
 let's cherish the rest of the days we have. 

315
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,640
I pay my respect to Your Highness!

316
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,100
All right. I've heard that you're marrying Young Master Han soon.

317
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,800
I've come to congratulate you!

318
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,900
Thank you, Your Highness!

319
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,000
What for?

320
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,700
You're the one getting married.

321
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,200
What does it have to do with me?

322
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,400
You certainly have lofty expectations.

323
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,500
I heard that you didn't even like Great Chief Shen.

324
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,200
What a pity!

325
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,640
Your taste really isn't that good!

326
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,280
Have a cup of tea from me.

327
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:12,300
May all your wishes come true!

328
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,300
If the wedding falls through,

329
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,500
you'd better not blame it on me.

330
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:09,000
   

331
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,400
I'm sorry! Are you all right?

332
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,100
I'm fine.

333
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:29,090
   

334
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,400
Sixth Miss! Sixth Miss!

335
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,200
Master wants to see you at home.

336
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,200
Third Miss is in trouble!

337
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,640
Young Master Han, let me see my sister.

338
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,400
What is this?

339
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,100
This silk net has grown during the day.

340
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,600
Please save Caiwei!

341
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,000
Sixth Miss.

342
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,400
We've asked for an imperial physician during the day.

343
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,400
But he couldn't form a diagnosis no matter what.

344
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,000
Have you ever seen such symptoms?

345
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,360
I can't tell what this is, either.

346
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,600
But judging from her look, I don't think she's ill.

347
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,900
I think she was poisoned!

348
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,300
Poisoned?

349
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,200
What kind of evil soul wants to hurt my daughter?

350
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,900
Poisoned?

351
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,900
It's Princess Yong'an.

352
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,600
Third Miss visited Princess Yong'an today.

353
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,000
You got my daughter into trouble.

354
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,200
Why did you also mingle with Princess Yong'an?

355
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,600
Stop talking nonsense!

356
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,800
Why would Princess Yong'an poison Third Miss?

357
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,000
Sixth Miss, don't try to show off!

358
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,400
The imperial physicians came and yet only you could tell it was poisoning?

359
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,600
I just feel it's poisoning,

360
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,400
but I can't determine what poison it is,

361
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,200
even less who administered it.

362
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,500
Transparent filamentous patterns on the body like silkworm cocoons.

363
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Silkworm cocoons.

364
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,900
Could it be Chen Huo'e?

365
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,600
No way. Chen Huo'e was executed.

366
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,400
I saw it with my own eyes.

367
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,700
She couldn't poison anyone.

368
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,000
I figured it out.

369
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,200
I went to the Imperial Guards and asked Guard Jing to check the archives.

370
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,300
The Huo'e Sect used to have a poison called "Butterfly out of Cocoons."

371
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,800
Fifth Brother, Chen Huo'e has been executed.

372
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,300
Can we find any former followers of the sect?

373
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,400
This is the tricky part.

374
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,800
Ever since Chen Huo'e died,

375
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:25,000
the Huo'e Sect seemed to have vanished into thin air and no news whatsoever since.

376
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,700
Even the Imperial Guards had no clues in their archives.

377
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,500
How can we conduct any investigations?

378
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:34,300
Should we go to Princess Yong'an?

379
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,600
Since it has to do with Chen Huo'e,

380
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,700
then let's not mention Princess Yong'an again.

381
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,000
We may be in serious trouble for slandering the royal family if we get Princess Yong'an into this.

382
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,800
We may be in serious trouble for slandering the royal family if we get Princess Yong'an into this.

383
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:56,000
Have you forgotten the extermination of the Jinxiu Workshop?

384
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,600
If it's the poison of the Huo'e Sect,

385
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,800
then it may not necessarily be Princess Yong'an's doing.

386
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,700
Yan Xing,

387
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,000
I'm afraid your sister was implicated by you.

388
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,400
- Han Shiyuan, youâ€” 
 - Mother.

389
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,600
Young Master Han is right.

390
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,700
I've implicated Third Sister and made her a target

391
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,500
for the remnants of the Huo'e Sect.

392
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,500
It's all my fault.

393
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,500
Rest assured.

394
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,500
I will save her even if it costs me my life!

395
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,400
Stop right there!

396
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,720
Who are you going to fight again?

397
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,360
Do you want me to lose another daughter?

398
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,400
Father.

399
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,800
Sixth Miss.

400
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,640
You are also my daughter.

401
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,600
Father, rest assured. I will be very careful.

402
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,600
And I swear I will save my sister.

403
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:04,380
   

404
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
That's not it.

405
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,960
 Butterfly out of Cocoons. 

406
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,000
 Where is the antidote formula of the poison? 

407
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,600
   

408
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:14,720
   

409
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,700
Mother,

410
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,660
I haven't come to see you recently.

411
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,400
Are you angry with me?

412
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,800
Actually, I wanted to visit you.

413
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,800
It's just thatâ€¦

414
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,520
I'm afraid of seeing someone.

415
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,620
That person...

416
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,780
usually acts like a devil.

417
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,340
Everyone is afraid of him.

418
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,220
But when he appears as a mysterious figure,

419
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,320
he's interesting and considerate,

420
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,120
completely different from his usual self.

421
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,520
Mother,

422
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,160
you have also seen him.

423
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,240
I even considered him a friend back then.

424
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:08,680
His mother has probably become good friends with you.

425
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,400
Mother,

426
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,740
he doesn't seem like a bad person to you either. Right?

427
00:34:17,779 --> 00:34:19,532
Thenâ€¦

428
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,800
Then what should I do?

429
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,639
Just think of me as the mysterious person,

430
00:34:32,299 --> 00:34:34,136
Masked Man.

431
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,800
Y-You're here?

432
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,816
I've always been here.

433
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:53,440
V-Vice Minister Lai.

434
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,360
Like I said, when we're here,

435
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,380
you can go on treating me as Masked Man,

436
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,320
and your friend.

437
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,020
Even the Black Fiend needs friends?

438
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:23,960
Perhaps it's worth trying.

439
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,400
That's true! Even the White Ghost can get married.

440
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,350
Naturally, the Black Fiend needs to make friends, too.

441
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,980
However, my friends and I must be equal.

442
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:43,700
We must help each other when needed and share secrets.

443
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,480
Youâ€¦

444
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,360
Why don't you go first?

445
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,360
I'll listen and see.

446
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,480
Sharing secrets...

447
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,720
I don't really have any secrets these days.

448
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,680
But I've run out of pocket money and dined at the Shen Mansion.

449
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,380
Does it count?

450
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,940
Okay, my turn now.

451
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:16,480
You have a secret to share with me?

452
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,220
I know you're close to Yan Xing.

453
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:25,840
I heard that her third sister was poisoned with "Butterfly out of Cocoons".

454
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:31,680
And I just so happen to have the formula for the antidote.

455
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,840
Where did you get it?

456
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,960
The Imperial Inspectorate arrested and interrogated Chen Huo'e twice.

457
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,140
You know about this.

458
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,860
I obtained the formula of the antidote back then.

459
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:50,200
Why are you giving it to me?

460
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,620
I can give you the formula but under one condition.

461
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:57,220
- What is it? 
 - Don't tell anyone it's from me.

462
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,760
Why not? You're doing a good deed.

463
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:06,780
Why can't I tell anyone it's from you?

464
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,880
Of course, you don't have to believe me.

465
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,540
Nor does Yan Xing.

466
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:16,280
Firstly, I'm not sure if the formula is authentic.

467
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,600
If it doesn't work or makes things worse, I take no responsibility.

468
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,300
Secondly, it contains a rare ingredient,

469
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:28,220
which is the blood from the heart of a mirror-image person.

470
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:36,060
Whether you can find it depends on Sixth Miss Yan's luck.

471
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,316
Sixth Miss.

472
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,140
You stayed up all night?

473
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,800
Chuichui, I can't keep you company today.

474
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,320
I am looking for a life-saving formula.

475
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,000
Sixth Miss, take a look at this.

476
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,800
The antidote for "Butterfly out of Cocoons"?

477
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,740
How did you know my third sister was poisoned?

478
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,400
Where did you get this formula from?

479
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,020
I-I got it from a friend of mine.

480
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,880
A friend?

481
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,020
Since when did you have such a resourceful friend?

482
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:00,800
Anyway, it seems that this formula

483
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,160
comes from the Imperial Inspectorate,

484
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,300
supposedly obtained during the interrogation of Chen Huo'e.

485
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,860
But we don't know if it's real.

486
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,500
I don't know if it works.

487
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,532
- The Imperial Inspectorate? 
 - Yes.

488
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,920
Chen Huo'e.

489
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,840
The one who makes the poison has the antidote.

490
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,960
Then who administrated it?

491
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,060
How did you just happen to get this?

492
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,400
Iâ€¦

493
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,800
Forget about that for now.

494
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,920
Maybe you should take this formula

495
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,940
to a pharmacy to discern its authenticity and see if it's poisonous.

496
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,880
And even if it is real,

497
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,840
it needs the blood from the heart of a mirror-image person.

498
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:44,580
But isn't Chen Huo'e the only mirror-image person in this world?

499
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:49,860
And wasn't she killed by your husband, the White Ghost?

500
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:55,320
Yeah, Chen Huo'e is dead.

501
00:39:55,820 --> 00:40:00,920
Where can we find another mirror-image person?

502
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,520
 Master Chen Wen has gone into the mountains for fasting. 

503
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,900
 We don't know when he'll return. Clerk Yan, you should know. 

504
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:13,540
 Marshal Xu? Let alone you, even I haven't seen him these days. 

505
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:46,920
Excuse me. Do you know where Pan Chi is?

506
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,920
You're looking for Pan?

507
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,120
He's been gone for days.

508
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,240
I heard he went with some beauty

509
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,900
to chase the Xichen merchant caravan.

510
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:04,460
Young people are really absurd. Absurd!

511
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:21,340
Your Highness, Third Miss Yan has been poisoned!

512
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,480
Third Mss Yan is poisoned?

513
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,920
And I heard it's a deadly poison that cannot be cured.

514
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,360
What I did was just a minor punishment as a warning.

515
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:37,140
I merely put some herbs that induce nightmares in her tea.

516
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,280
I have consulted the imperial physicians.

517
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,280
I'm sure it's not deadly.

518
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,020
So someone is trying to set you up!

519
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:51,340
Yes, that's right!

520
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,920
Third Miss Yan's life is not worthy of anything.

521
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,420
But her father, Academician Yan, works for Prime Minister Zhang.

522
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:02,700
Her sister, Yan Xing, is the wife of Shen Du.

523
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,960
If she dies,

524
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,860
wouldn't I be at odds with Prince Xian and the Imperial Guards?

525
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:15,720
No doubt the poisoner harbors such malicious intent.

526
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,140
 Beat him up! Harder! 

527
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:29,810
