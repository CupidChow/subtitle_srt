00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,950
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,994
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:38,292
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:40,661
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:44,536
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,536 --> 00:00:47,671
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:50,836
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,836 --> 00:00:55,872
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,872 --> 00:01:02,244
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,244 --> 00:01:08,552
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,552 --> 00:01:14,831
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,831 --> 00:01:21,144
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,144 --> 00:01:28,988
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:37,222
   

16
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,257
   

17
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,260
Chuichui, come and look.

18
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,140
Here's the finest silk delivered from Jiangnan.

19
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,400
Check out the pattern and fabric.

20
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,420
Should I find embroideresses to make you a bridal gown?

21
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:12,692
Chuichui.

22
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,600
Look. I'll wear this at the wedding.

23
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,324
What do you think?

24
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,720
Are you crazy?

25
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,460
I won't marry you.

26
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,500
Of course, you will.

27
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,520
One day, you will be willing to marry me.

28
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,460
Look.

29
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:51,020
These two garments look so well-matched together.

30
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,580
Let me go! You lecher. Let go!

31
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,520
Before you fall for me like you fell for Jiang Langxing

32
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,580
and agree to marry me, I won't let you go.

33
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,940
I won't fall for you.

34
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,040
No way.

35
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,600
What's wrong?

36
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,860
Are you still expecting someone to save you?

37
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,860
It won't happen.

38
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,880
Be it Jiang Langxing or Yan Xing, no one will come to save you.

39
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,420
I'm warning you. Do not hurt them.

40
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,840
I won't hurt them unless they ask for it.

41
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,096
Chuichui.

42
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,320
Chuichui.

43
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,800
It's everyone for themselves in this world.

44
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,560
You can't count on anyone.

45
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,820
You only have me.

46
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,160
Only me.

47
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,640
What's wrong? You're not going to hit me?

48
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,080
Chuichui, I truly adore you.

49
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,740
From now on, I won't force you again.

50
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,080
I will wait patiently until you

51
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,420
fall in love with me.

52
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,620
Jin.

53
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,580
Excuse me. Excuse me.

54
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,530
- Yan Xing! My Sixth Daughter! 
 - Slow down!

55
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,380
Mother.

56
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,600
They released you?

57
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,030
Thankfully, your father filed a complaint

58
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,500
saying that I was already a member of the Yan family.

59
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,350
It was Prime Minister Zhang.

60
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,000
He sent me a message, permitting me to file the complaint.

61
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,580
The Great Chief sent Imperial Guards with me to pick her up.

62
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,640
Madam, the Great Chief went to the palace.

63
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,560
Mother, you've been wronged!

64
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,820
I'm fine. But your younger uncleâ€¦ Your uncleâ€¦

65
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,820
Grand Empress Dowager is wise!

66
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,520
"Sorrow and Joy" is my creation.

67
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:06,060
It has nothing to do with Prince Xian and even less with my clansmen.

68
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,880
Prince Xian appreciates me just like Boya appreciates Ziqi.

69
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,960
This was all plotted by Lai Luozhi.

70
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,980
Your Majesty is wise. Do Prince Xian justice.

71
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,480
- Jinzang! 
 - Mother!

72
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,160
- Jinzang! Jinzang! 
 - Mother!

73
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,060
Still babbling nonsense at death's door.

74
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,840
Guards, throw him in the jar!

75
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,940
Lai Luozhi, how dare you carry out vigilante justice in the street!

76
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,420
Vice Minister Lai, I have something to tell you.

77
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,560
It's a secret I'm telling you only.

78
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,984
Back off.

79
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,020
You're just a powerless musician.

80
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:57,540
I'd like to hear what you have to say before you die.

81
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,080
My clansmen and I

82
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,900
are suffering this calamity all because of you!

83
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,380
- Younger Uncle! 
 - A'Zang!

84
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,950
Who dares?

85
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,420
- A'Zang! 
 - Step back! 
 - Younger Uncle!

86
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,800
Chest. Huo'e.

87
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:31,160
Xing'er, you must deliver this blood letter to the Grand Empress Dowager.

88
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,860
Take care of yourself.

89
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,780
And you.

90
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,620
A'Zang.

91
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,900
Younger Uncle.

92
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,748
A'Zang!

93
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,492
A'Zang!

94
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,020
No!

95
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,110
Younger Uncle!

96
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,052
Music Minister Jin!

97
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,020
Lai Luozhi, are you going to snatch the testimony

98
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,860
for the Grand Empress Dowager in front of everyone?

99
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,672
Step back!

100
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,120
What? Jinzang is dead?

101
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,840
Whenâ€¦

102
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,240
When did I order anyone...

103
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,280
to kill him?

104
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,900
Music Minister Jin couldn't bear the humiliation and cried out injustice for Prince Xian in the parade,

105
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:13,400
claiming it was plotted by Vice Minister Lai and then killed himself.

106
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:19,460
This is the blood letter written by Music Minister Jin. I beg for your discernment.

107
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,100
Grand Empress... Grand Empress Dowager!

108
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,240
When did Iâ€¦

109
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,540
When did I want the Jins dead?

110
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:07,980
Grand Empress Dowager, Jinzang bewitched the people with seditious words

111
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,640
and attempted to frame me before he died.

112
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,560
I've been wronged!

113
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,780
Vice Minister Lai made a fuss about an ordinary banquet

114
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,280
and turned it into a bloody case.

115
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,940
Now, everyone's discussing Music Minister Jin's tragic death on the street.

116
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,320
The Imperial Inspectorate should no longer be in charge.

117
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,780
Please entrust the Jin family to the Imperial Guards for custody.

118
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,680
Grand Empress Dowager, I disagree.

119
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,632
Enough!

120
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,520
You're still vying for power at this point.

121
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,180
You just won't give me a break.

122
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,600
Minister Shen.

123
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:01,000
Since you are not afraid of getting your hands dirty and insist on intervening,

124
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,980
then I'll entrust...

125
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,480
the Jin family to you.

126
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,340
Thank you, Grand Empress Dowager.

127
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,700
   

128
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,200
I pay my respect, Your Majesty.

129
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,600
You are truly wise.

130
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,100
But I didn't summon you.

131
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,800
Aren't you afraid that I shall convict you

132
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,200
for intruding into the palace in the middle of the night?

133
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,500
If Your Majesty wishes to punish me, I can only accept the penalty.

134
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,000
You know?

135
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,600
Only after I read all these

136
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,900
musical scores left by Jinzang tonight,

137
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:11,500
did I realize that he had accompanied me for so long.

138
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,980
 Why do you never give me some leeway? 

139
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,800
 How can I do that in a game? 

140
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,500
 Even if you lose, I won't punish you. 

141
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,700
 In that case, 

142
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,500
 will there be rewards if I win? 

143
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,900
 What reward do you want? 

144
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,900
 If I win this game, 

145
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,800
 will you make me the crown princess? 

146
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,100
 All right. It's a deal. 

147
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,000
 The wise foresee the future. 

148
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,200
 Your "Paired Swallows" move may seem simple, 

149
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,000
 but it has endless follow-up moves. 

150
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,400
 I haveâ€¦ 

151
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,700
 I have actually lost this game. 

152
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,900
 You must keep your word, Huan. 

153
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,700
 All right. Your wish will be granted. 

154
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:16,500
 Ever since I entered the palace, from every dance performance 

155
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,200
 to every significant day of mine 

156
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,200
 and every sleepless night, 

157
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:29,100
 he and his konghou had never missed out on a single event. 
 (The konghou is an ancient Chinese harp-like musical instrument.) 

158
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,100
This scroll is not yet complete.

159
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,600
He meant to perform it

160
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,400
at the grand ceremony after the reconstruction of Ming Hall.

161
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,200
He never spoke much.

162
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,700
Never.

163
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,800
He was so quiet

164
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,200
that I often forgot about his existence.

165
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:09,700
It's like there was only a konghou behind the curtain.

166
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:16,200
When I'm troubled, this konghou...

167
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:25,400
would play soothing melodies by itself.

168
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:35,900
This konghou will never sound again.

169
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,500
It's all my fault.

170
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,960
But I only have this one son.

171
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,000
You know?

172
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,600
I had my fortune told when I was young.

173
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,200
The fortune teller said that...

174
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,580
my brilliance was too great...

175
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,400
that it would scorch those around me.

176
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,000
He also said...

177
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,920
that I would end up in solitude.

178
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,800
I was infuriated at the time.

179
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,600
I even found someone to beat up that fortune teller.

180
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,000
But now that I think about it,

181
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,100
he was right.

182
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,700
Not a single person...

183
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,360
could stay with me until the end.

184
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,600
Minister Shen.

185
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,000
I know.

186
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,640
You've been seeking an answer, too.

187
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,200
Once this matter is completely settled,

188
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,760
I will give you an answer.

189
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,400
You're still up?

190
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,840
I was thinking about my uncle.

191
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,500
I know you were close to him

192
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,700
and would grieve over his death.

193
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:35,400
Tomorrow, I will send you back to keep your mother company.

194
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,800
The deceased can't be revived.

195
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,400
Grieving serves no purpose.

196
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,800
I was thinking about what my uncle had said before he died.

197
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,400
Chest. Huo'e.

198
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,600
Did Music Minister Jin learn something about the Huo'e Sect?

199
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,200
My younger uncle was just a musician.

200
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,600
He knew he couldn't hurt Lai Luozhi,

201
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,600
but he charged toward him to tear at his collar at all costs before he died.

202
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,500
What for? Just to humiliate him?

203
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,500
   

204
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,800
Is Chuichui back?

205
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,800
Did you find her?

206
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,800
Where on earth did she go?

207
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,300
If anything happened to her,

208
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,400
how will I explain to her deceased mother?

209
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,100
Rest assured, I will keep looking and bring her back.

210
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,800
All right.

211
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,000
   

212
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,720
You're really not afraid of death.

213
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,360
How dare you minor inspector barge into my mansion?

214
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,040
Where did you hide Lu Chuichui?

215
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,780
Do you know what you are talking about?

216
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,600
Inspector Jiang Langxing raided

217
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,120
the Vice Minister's mansion at night

218
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,700
and spoke disrespectfully. Guilt beyond pardon.

219
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,180
Imprison him in the Imperial Inspectorate for sentencing.

220
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,820
I won't allow another inspector to end up like Sun Tan.

221
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,360
You rookie, get out of here.

222
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:22,280
You injured my people for no reason.

223
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,080
Don't you owe me an explanation?

224
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,720
Lai Luozhi,

225
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,280
you know what you've done.

226
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,900
If you make a scene, guess who will be in deeper trouble.

227
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,320
And don't you forget.

228
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,800
I can easily get things from the imperial palace.

229
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,240
If you've hidden something here,

230
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,920
I have my way to get it.

231
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,650
Chuichui.

232
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,770
Chuichui.

233
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,280
Chuichui.

234
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,900
Chuichui! Chuichui!

235
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,300
She's just a random girl.

236
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,120
Yet you're so obsessed with her.

237
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,160
What do you know?

238
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,200
I am all alone...

239
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,680
in this world.

240
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,160
Only she understands me...

241
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,880
and feels for me.

242
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,000
I am also your family.

243
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,680
I am your older sister.

244
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,660
I won't spare anyone who ruins my plan.

245
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,240
I will take down

246
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:30,060
all of them one by one.

247
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,900
 I've been thinking about how to make you 

248
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,580
 vanish into thin air and never come back... 

249
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,500
 without him realizing that it is my doing. 

250
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,960
 Unfortunately, 

251
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,900
 he knows how to poison and kill people much better than me. 

252
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,080
 But I have figured it out. 

253
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,720
 Rather than killing you, 

254
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:49,020
 I'd better make it impossible for him to get you. 

255
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,496
 Marshal Xu. 

256
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,000
Chuichui!

257
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,200
Chuichui! Chuichui! Chuichui! Chuichui!

258
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,660
Are you all right? Let me see.

259
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,520
Are you hurt?

260
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,560
Chuichui.

261
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,160
Chuichui, it's me.

262
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,860
You fool.

263
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,000
What took you so long?

264
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,500
You are such a fool!

265
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,200
I went to rescue you at the Lai Mansion

266
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,120
and ran into Marshal Xu, who helped me out.

267
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,300
Only then did I realize that he had gotten you out.

268
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,900
I'm sorry.

269
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:35,260
I thought I wouldn't be able to see you again.

270
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,040
I failed to protect you.

271
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,520
From now on, I will not let you suffer any harm.

272
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,240
Chuichui,

273
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,330
I'm sorry.

274
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,772
I'm sorry.

275
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,308
I'm sorry.

276
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,340
What? You were abducted?

277
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,640
When did it happen? How come I had no idea?

278
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,040
He didn't hurt you. Right?

279
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,440
I'm fine.

280
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,680
Am I not sitting right in front of you here?

281
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,840
Why did Lai Luozhi abduct you?

282
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,350
I'm afraid...

283
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,640
she's been implicated by me.

284
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,300
No, that's not it.

285
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,880
Sixth Miss,

286
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,440
I'm sorry.

287
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,240
Actually,

288
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,680
there's something I've been hiding from you.

289
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:58,820
In fact, the friend from the Imperial Inspectorate

290
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,420
I mentioned was Lai Luozhi.

291
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,050
It was him?

292
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,560
At first,

293
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,720
I kept seeing him in my mother's graveyard.

294
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,020
I thought he was mourning for his mother and could be my friend.

295
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:20,880
Later, he saved me once by chance.

296
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,560
Then Iâ€¦

297
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,480
Then Iâ€¦

298
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,960
When your third sister was poisoned,

299
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,260
he gave me the antidote formula that worked

300
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:33,920
and urged me not to tell anyone.

301
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,360
So Iâ€¦

302
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,360
I had this hope that perhaps

303
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,120
he wanted to be a good person.

304
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,600
What should I even say? Chuichui.

305
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,020
Have you read too many dramas?

306
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,520
How could you believe him?

307
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,840
Chuichui,

308
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,080
if Jiang Langxing and I had arrived any later,

309
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,280
I'm afraid you would have been forced to marry the Black Fiend.

310
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,920
Right, Chuichui.

311
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,800
I remember your father built your mother's graveyard at great expense.

312
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,780
Why would Lai Luozhi go there so often?

313
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:21,320
His mother's graveyard just happens to be close to my mother's.

314
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,180
I've visited it once.

315
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:27,220
It looks quite inconspicuous.

316
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,120
There's a name on it.

317
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,320
Bi Luo.

318
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,940
Bi Luo?

319
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:39,300
Lai Luozhi's mother had such a beautiful name.

320
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:44,000
I'd say he was only pretending to be filial in front of Chuichui.

321
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,520
I think that Lai Luozhi has tried very hard to approach Chuichui

322
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,040
not just to win her over.

323
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,440
Right.

324
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,840
I think I saw something in Lai Luozhi's secret chamber.

325
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,860
The garment for the coronation.

326
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,600
Lai Luozhi probably thought I didn't know what that was.

327
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,920
So he just showed it to me directly.

328
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,600
At first, I pretended not to care.

329
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:19,380
But upon closer inspection, I realized that the embroidery

330
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:23,180
was not a dragon, but Taotie. 
  (The Taotie motif is one of the "four evil creatures" in Chinese mythology, representing greed and gluttony.) 

331
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,200
Among the nine sons of the dragon,

332
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,800
the fifth, Taotie, is the most insatiable.

333
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,620
It seems that Lai Luozhi's ambition...

334
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,040
has been laid bare.

335
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,120
I have things to do. See you around.

336
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,680
I'll see him out.

337
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,480
You can't go.

338
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,920
Have you forgotten Sun Tan?

339
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,980
He knew about Lai Luozhi's treacherous intentions.

340
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:14,080
Yet due to the lack of evidence, he was wrongfully executed.

341
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,079
Now we know that there is a garment but you're stopping me.

342
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,600
I know you want to avenge Sun Tan and clear his name.

343
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,419
But don't you forget. You took Chuichui away last night.

344
00:34:23,419 --> 00:34:26,080
Lai Luozhi knows she has seen that garment.

345
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,860
He will be on guard.

346
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:32,560
Would the Lai Mansion and the Imperial Inspectorate be more guarded than the imperial palace?

347
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:37,080
There is nothing I can't steal as long as I want to steal it.

348
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:41,880
I will dig into the ground to find what Lai Luozhi has hidden.

349
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,719
You've earned your title as the Saint of Thieves.

350
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,880
But the Lai Mansion and the Imperial Inspectorate

351
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,680
may be heavily guarded now, waiting to trap you.

352
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,879
They can be way more dangerous than the imperial palace.

353
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,320
Shen Du,

354
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,360
why did you become so indecisive?

355
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,400
Do men become like this when they get married?

356
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,240
You may become like this very soon, too.

357
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,560
Something has been wrong in Xiang'an these days.

358
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,880
People from Nanlang and Xichen are everywhere,

359
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,540
stationed at street corners, looking for houses and shops to rent.

360
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,800
Something is going to happen.

361
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,600
We are keeping an eye on them.

362
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,200
You can only keep tabs on a few of them.

363
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,488
Shen Du.

364
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,376
If something happens to me,

365
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,280
take care of Yun Que for me.

366
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,504
You'll do the same for me.

367
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,200
See you, Great Chief.

368
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:59,180
Jinzang, play something light, please.

369
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,324
Jinzang!

370
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,080
Grand Empress Dowager.

371
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,400
Grand Empress Dowager!

372
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,764
I'm fine.

373
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,860
It's the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month

374
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:59,120
when the Grand Empress Dowager should reward the court officials.

375
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,660
Why hasn't she showed up yet?

376
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,860
Indeed.

377
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:07,180
The Great Chief hasn't shown up, either.

378
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,680
The Grand Empress Dowager feels unwell.

379
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:16,620
Vice Minister Lai shall decide on the rewards

380
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:20,620
according to last year's record.

381
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

382
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,980
 I respectfully see you off, Your Majesty. 

383
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,360
On behalf of the Grand Empress Dowager,

384
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:57,640
I shall decide on the rewards and punishments based on your performance.

385
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,600
How could Lai Luozhi take over such a job?

386
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,560
Indeed, the Imperial Inspectorate is just a supervisory institution.

387
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,580
How can he break boundaries? This is inappropriate.

388
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,520
This is the Grand Empress Dowager's decree.

389
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,780
Do you want to bother Her Majesty when she's sick in bed?

390
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,200
You. And you.

391
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:18,200
Do you intend to defy the decree?

392
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:31,430
   

393
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,720
Vice Minister Lai, I'm the Director of the Ministry of Rites.

394
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,640
I'm the Chief Clerk of the Ministry of War.

395
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,360
You're rewarded.

396
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,100
You're rewarded.

397
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,020
 Thank you, Vice Minister Lai. 

398
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,740
   

399
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:02,960
Auntie, Mother Empress is seriously ill yet no one is allowed to visit her.

400
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,160
Prince Xian is still under house arrest.

401
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,840
Lai Luozhi is gaining momentum.

402
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,310
Auntie!

403
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,180
Half of the court officials have pledged loyalty to him.

404
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:21,080
The other half are at home doing nothing.

405
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,160
This court is about to descend into chaos.

406
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,040
The court is not yet in chaos,

407
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,520
but your heart is in disarray.

408
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,640
Once the heart is in disarray, you lose focus.

409
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,740
Auntie, how can I stay calm?

410
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:10,080
No matter what, you are always the princess.

411
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,360
Why are you panicking?

412
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:18,580
Auntie, you know very well that this title means nothing in the court.

413
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,880
His Majesty still doesn't speak.

414
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,140
The imperial physicians say that the sage speaks late.

415
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:28,000
But what if he never speaks?

416
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,280
Now that Mother Empress is ill,

417
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,540
if anything happens...

418
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:39,090
Auntie, the Regent

419
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:42,720
will be in charge of the entire court.

420
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,060
You want me to help you?

421
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,428
Of course.

422
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,240
You said it just now.

423
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,500
Your status as the princess means nothing in the court.

424
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:06,780
I've been cultivating for years and I've seen through worldly affairs.

425
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:11,300
No matter what happens, just remember one thing.

426
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,100
Serve His Majesty well.

427
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,356
Auntie.

428
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,680
No rush.

429
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,544
This is...

430
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,840
only the very beginning.
