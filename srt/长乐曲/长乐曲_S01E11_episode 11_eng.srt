00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,200
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,600
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,500
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,600
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,800
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,900
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:02,200
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:08,600
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,800
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:21,100
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:29,100
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:37,200
   

16
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,500
   

17
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,600
Sixth Miss. Well, you!

18
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,900
Your words just now indicate your loyalty to the Ministry of Justice.

19
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,920
It's so touching.

20
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,800
But in front of Vice Minister Lai, you can't say so.

21
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,400
- He is the Black Fiend. 
 - My Lord.

22
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,500
My Lord.

23
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,800
Yes. Sixth Miss, I am still frightened.

24
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,400
Do you really think you are a tigress?

25
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,700
T-That's the Black Fiend!

26
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,800
Even if you are the tigress, he could still kill you alive.

27
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,200
So, why would you provoke him?

28
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,800
 Princess of Valor is here. 

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,300
- Greetings, Princess of Valor. 
 - Greetings, Princess of Valor.

30
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,400
Madam Shen, you are wise and smart.

31
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,700
You are capable of investigating cases and managing household affairs well.

32
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,800
What a rare female talent!

33
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,200
Our dynasty encourages women to become officials.

34
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,500
Women can also be generals or prime ministers.

35
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,800
Madam Shen, you are really a role model.

36
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,600
Thank you, Princess of Valor.

37
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,600
May I know why you have come here?

38
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,700
Last night, Chen Huo'e came back to life.

39
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,400
This morning, Vice Minister Lai immediately went to the Grand Empress Dowager

40
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,400
to request the authorities to investigate the case.

41
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,700
This case is complicated.

42
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,600
I think the Ministry of Justice doesn't want to get involved either.

43
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,800
This case was handled by the Imperial Guards,

44
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,000
and now it is being re-investigated by Vice Minister Lai.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,900
The Ministry of Justice naturally has no right to investigate or inquire.

46
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,900
Yan Xing is a clerk of the Ministry of Justice,

47
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,600
but also the wife of the Great Chief.

48
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,400
I hear that you are quite skilled at managing your husband.

49
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,600
If you can persuade your husband to not get involved in this case,

50
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,200
and you can restrain your own curiosity to remain as a mere observer,

51
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,400
I am very willing to facilitate a good match

52
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,500
and personally ask the Grand Empress Dowager

53
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:26,100
to bestow a marriage for your third sister...

54
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,100
and Han Shiyuan.

55
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,600
I am quite busy.

56
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,100
I hope you can reply soon. All right?

57
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,600
Sixth Miss. Sixth Miss Yan.

58
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,800
You had nothing to do with that case.

59
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,400
All you have to do is to persuade the Great Chief.

60
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,000
Then your Yan family can obtain two marriages

61
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,100
bestowed by the Grand Empress Dowager.

62
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,400
What an honor to your family!

63
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,700
What are you hesitating for? Why didn't you just say yes at once?

64
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,400
Princess Yong'an and Vice Minister Lai obviously do not want

65
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,500
the Imperial Guards and the Ministry of Justice to be involved in this case.

66
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,900
But the more they do this, the more guilty they appear, do they not?

67
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,200
And, logically speaking,

68
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,300
Princess Yong'an has just cleared her name of the Buddha case.

69
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,200
Why would she be in such a hurry to get involved in this case?

70
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,800
Sixth Miss,

71
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,600
this is clearly a big trap. We should avoid it.

72
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,800
Are you even thinking of jumping in?

73
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,900
- Chuichui. 
 - Sixth Miss Yan!

74
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,800
You are the wife of the Great Chief.

75
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,400
I don't care what you want to do.

76
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,800
But don't ever involve the Ministry of Justice in this case.

77
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,500
The Ministry of Justice will not be buried with you.

78
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,900
Director.

79
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,200
Zhang Baohuan, who serves close to the Grand Empress Dowager,

80
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,730
is outside the Ministry of Justice

81
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:40,400
and asking Clerk Yan for a chat.

82
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,900
Oh my!

83
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,400
Don't cause any trouble. You aim high.

84
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,100
My Ministry of Justice aims low.

85
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,700
Lady Yan.

86
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,700
Lady Yan, I know you are busy.

87
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,700
Today, I come to visit you.

88
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,400
You wouldn't mind, would you?

89
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Not at all.

90
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,200
I'm here today, actually with nothing important to say.

91
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,300
I just wonder how Han Shiyuan has been recently.

92
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,000
Last night, Young Master Han went back to the Yan Mansion with Third Sister,

93
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,300
and the Imperial Guards did not make things difficult for him.

94
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,700
But I went to the Yan Mansion today and was told he was not there.

95
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,140
I guess he doesn't want to see me.

96
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,600
I wonder what the story is between you and Young Master Han.

97
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,700
Nothing special. We are just old acquaintances.

98
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,400
Since Han Shiyuan won the favor of Third Miss Yan,

99
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,100
it's good for him then.

100
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,400
In the future, if you have the chance,

101
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,600
please take good care of him.

102
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,200
Of course.

103
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,000
Then I will not disturb you any further.

104
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,200
I take my leave.

105
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,000
 Han Shiyuan keeps his stories 

106
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 with Zhang Baohuan and Princess Yong'an a secret. 

107
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,900
 Regarding Chen Huo'e coming back to life, it seems many forces are involved from behind. 

108
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,800
 Even involving the marriage of Third Sister. 

109
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,600
 Even Lai Luozhi wants to intervene in this matter. 

110
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,100
 Now, everyone seems to want me to stay out of it. 

111
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,700
 What should I do? 

112
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,400
   

113
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,000
Sixth Miss, you are here.

114
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Third Sister. Young Master Han.

115
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,600
I should thank you and the Great Chief for saving us last night.

116
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Why also send gifts to me today?

117
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,500
I think Madam Shen is here to interrogate me.

118
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,200
About what happened last night, Young Master Han and I really don't know anything.

119
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,500
Third Sister, don't worry.

120
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,800
We're going to get to the bottom of what happened last night.

121
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,000
I just want to know what your relationship with Minister Zhang and Princess Yong'an is.

122
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,600
I can't tell you.

123
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,400
You still don't tell me at this point?

124
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,600
If it wasn't for you, how could my sister have suffered so much?

125
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,000
Stop pressuring him.

126
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,900
I trust him.

127
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,160
- My sixth daughter, you are back. 
 - Mother.

128
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,680
Don't you have to work today?

129
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,680
You must be worried about those gifts,

130
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,880
wanting to see them for yourself at your third sister's place. Right?

131
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,320
Let me tell you.

132
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,480
This time, your husband has done it quite properly.

133
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,280
I am so proud.

134
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,240
Gifts? Just now, Third Sister also mentioned gifts.

135
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,000
What are you talking about?

136
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,480
Don't you know?

137
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,720
This morning, the Shen Mansion sent someone to offer their regards,

138
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,700
saying that you're worried about your third sister being frightened last night,

139
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,240
so he especially sent a lot of tonic gifts.

140
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,200
Those are valuable gifts.

141
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,800
I knew it had to be my son-in-law who paid.

142
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,720
Right, the kitchen has stewed some tonics.

143
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,640
Come on. I'll get you one.

144
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,020
Shen Du did this behind my back?

145
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,200
Why is he suddenly so warm to our family?

146
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,720
No need to ask.

147
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,000
It's because of you, of course.

148
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,180
Otherwise, why would Great Chief care about us, a modest Yan Mansion?

149
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:33,060
Would that man still want to win your third sister's heart?

150
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,340
Your third sister is really talented.

151
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,080
Indeed, she seems more

152
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,840
remarkable than you.

153
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,560
No, no way. I have to kill his hope.

154
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,300
I'll go urge your father tonight

155
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:54,120
to have him arrange the marriage between Third Miss and Han Shiyuan.

156
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,440
I have to let them marry as soon as possible.

157
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,440
Mother, what are you thinking about?

158
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,060
Has White Ghost hit you recently?

159
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:08,120
Have you two been arguing lately?

160
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,120
Let me tell you.

161
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,120
You must not take it lightly.

162
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,620
You must keep an eye on him. Never let your guard down.

163
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,440
Okay, I got it.

164
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,000
I feel a bit hungry.

165
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,320
Why don't you get me a bowl of soup?

166
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,280
I almost forgot. Just wait.

167
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:41,690
   

168
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,120
What a fine zither!

169
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,440
What a beautiful tune!

170
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,600
What delightful charm!

171
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,720
The piece played by Jinzang today

172
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,160
seems different from the past,

173
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,320
with a bit more of a Zen feel.

174
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,280
It makes me feel refreshed.

175
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:26,280
This is an ancient and elegant piece of music from Madam Xu.

176
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,640
A few days ago, when I went to the temple to worship Buddha,

177
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,560
an eminent monk bestowed upon me a scroll of sheet music.

178
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,160
It's said to have the effect of clearing the mind and spirit.

179
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,980
So I requested Master Jin to perform it.

180
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,080
Indeed, it was wonderful.

181
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,440
I remember,

182
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:56,040
back then, you dug up the lingzhi (reishi mushroom) on the mountain and gave it to me,

183
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,420
pleading me to deal leniently with the case of the Shen family

184
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:05,080
and release the young Shen Du from the detention center.

185
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,840
So today, what is your request?

186
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,760
I dare not.

187
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,040
Let him in.

188
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,920
Minister Shen,

189
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,000
I know why you are here.

190
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,860
Vice Minister Lai personally requested the re-investigation of the Chen Huo'e case.

191
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,280
Although this case has recently been investigated by you,

192
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,900
after all, five years ago, he's the one who handled it.

193
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:46,160
He confessed his negligence, wanting to make amends.

194
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,960
I can understand it.

195
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,280
Your Majesty.

196
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,100
In my humble opinion, the dead cannot be brought back to life.

197
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,060
The Chen Huo'e back then may not be the current Chen Huo'e.

198
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,920
Minister Shen,

199
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,460
since you're injured, there's no need to force yourself.

200
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,920
It's a minor injury.

201
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,896
It's no big deal.

202
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,880
All right.

203
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,680
Since Madam Xu is vouching for you,

204
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,480
then the case of Chen Huo'e

205
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,480
shall be handed over to the Imperial Guards.

206
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,280
Yes.

207
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,400
If that's the case,

208
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:36,240
let Prime Minister Zhang handle the Hongwen School examination.

209
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,440
After all, he is a civil official. It's easier for him to communicate with the scholars.

210
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,920
Minister Shen,

211
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,160
you shall be responsible for the security of the Imperial City, how about that?

212
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,860
Your Majesty, the security of the Imperial City is a matter of great importance.

213
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,380
No room for any mistakes. The Imperial Guards have limited manpower.

214
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,920
I'm afraid it's difficult to take care of everything.

215
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,480
You, troublemaker!

216
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,520
Usually, you only complain about not having enough power.

217
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,960
But today, you're making excuses.

218
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,760
Do you think I don't know what you're thinking?

219
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,600
- I dare not. 
 - Dare not?

220
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,240
I see you are daring

221
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,240
to set me up.

222
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,200
- Grand Empress Dowager, please calm your anger! 
 - Please forgive the offense!

223
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,120
All right!

224
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,640
Since I entrust you the security of the Imperial City,

225
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,040
naturally, you'll be given the authority to mobilize resources from all departments.

226
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,260
During the Hongwen School examination, where security is involved,

227
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:40,840
personnel from all departments will be at your disposal.

228
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,520
Thank you, Grand Empress Dowager!

229
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,040
Your Highness, Prime Minister Zhang has already taken over the Hongwen School.

230
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,840
That old man!

231
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,160
He has taken the lead again.

232
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,760
Interesting!

233
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,280
Your Highness.

234
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,240
Sir, perfect timing!

235
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,400
Let's see if these Imperial Yellow Peony are blooming beautifully.

236
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,000
So beautiful!

237
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,240
Prince Xian,

238
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,120
this time, the Grand Empress Dowager has entrusted me to handle

239
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,960
the Hongwen School examination.

240
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,960
The scholars of the Hongwen School are the foremost scholars in the country.

241
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,680
With the merits of this examination,

242
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,240
Prince Xian, you would get a further advantage by acquiring the position of Prince Regent.

243
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,840
Sir,

244
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,860
whether it is me or the Princess of Valor who becomes the Prince Regent,

245
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,560
we are all serving the Grand Empress Dowager and His Majesty.

246
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,640
Prince Xian, what you have said is incorrect!

247
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,340
His Majesty is slow of speech, and the Grand Empress Dowager is getting old.

248
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,260
Prince Regent is very important to Great Cang.

249
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:03,040
On this matter, Prince Xian, you must not take it lightly.

250
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,480
Sir, thank you.

251
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,160
You must correct everyone's misunderstanding

252
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:12,400
and make the scholars from humble backgrounds feel valued by you and me.

253
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,600
Yes, that is of course.

254
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,480
But Shen Du has obtained the authority of the security of the Imperial City,

255
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,400
adding more power and responsibilities.

256
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,560
Minister Shen is certainly capable.

257
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,380
No matter what kind of situation this guy is in,

258
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,480
what kind of mess he's in,

259
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,960
he always has a way to deal with it.

260
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,880
What do you think, Sir?

261
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,180
Prince Xian, you are right.

262
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,600
Well, Shen Du has obtained the authority of the security of the Imperial City,

263
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,920
then the situation in Xiang'an should be the more chaotic and lively, the better?

264
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,560
Prince Xian, maybe we should give him a hand.

265
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,720
What did you just say?

266
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,160
Go do your work.

267
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,840
Great Chief.

268
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,540
The Hongwen School examination was ultimately handed over to Prime Minister Zhang.

269
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,680
Grand Empress Dowager entrusted the Imperial Guards with the security of the Imperial City.

270
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,000
Is it to comfort us?

271
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,430
This is what I wanted.

272
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,640
You don't seem to be disappointed.

273
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,040
The wind is going to pick up.

274
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,080
During the Hongwen School examination,

275
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,320
Princess of Valor, Prince Xian, Prime Minister Zhang, and Lai Luozhi

276
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,960
will surely take some action.

277
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,760
- Be alert. 
 - Yes.

278
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,080
The security near the Hongwen School should not be underestimated.

279
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,400
You can allocate more imperial guards and inspectors for assistance.

280
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,980
And don't take the security of the Three Departments and Six Ministries lightly.

281
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,980
My Imperial Guards will personally keep a tight watch.

282
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,050
Especially,

283
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,240
Lintai.

284
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,024
Yes.

285
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,280
Who is it?

286
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,200
Great Chief Shen.

287
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,800
Thank you for the gifts you sent to Third Sister and the others.

288
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,960
They all liked them.

289
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,004
It's no big deal.

290
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,800
At today's court, was there anything interesting?

291
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,240
Nothing much.

292
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,960
Lai Luozhi requested the investigation to the Chen Huo'e case.

293
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,560
Did the Grand Empress Dowager grant it to him?

294
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,100
She granted it to me.

295
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,896
You?

296
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,820
You mean, the Chen Huo'e case will be still handled by the Imperial Guards?

297
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,560
That's great!

298
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,480
I'll go grind some ink for you.

299
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,600
No matter how you tidy up a puppy's den, it's still a puppy's den.

300
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,900
Your handâ€¦

301
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,240
Is it getting better?

302
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,200
Being bitten by a puppy, it won't heal that fast.

303
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,100
Great Chief Shen.

304
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,360
You keep reading the case files and take a rest.

305
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,600
I'll go cook for you. Okay?

306
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,520
- Can you cook? 
 - Don't underestimate me.

307
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,900
I am Sixth Miss Yan, after all.

308
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,800
Yes. You are widely praised...

309
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,500
for your talents in art, literacy, and handicrafts,

310
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,600
with knowledge of the past and present,

311
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,000
your reputation as a virtuous lady

312
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,840
is known throughout the Xiang'an.

313
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,360
Go.

314
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,000
Come on.

315
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,644
Please sit down.

316
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,100
Great Chief, these are dishes I cooked myself. Have a taste.

317
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,480
Try this chicken.

318
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,800
How is it?

319
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,752
Surprisingly,

320
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,700
it tastes nice!

321
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,900
See, see. I knew it.

322
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,020
Cooking and autopsies are pretty much the same.

323
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,640
Using the methods of preserving and dissecting a corpse to prepare this chicken,

324
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,420
the texture will be just like that of a freshly killed one.

325
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,100
Right.

326
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,400
Try this soup.

327
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:46,520
The inspiration for this spice comes from the spices used by Madam Tang to marinate corpses.

328
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,540
Smell it. Does it smell good? Right?

329
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,468
It smells good. Right?

330
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,440
What do you want?

331
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,900
Just tell me.

332
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,280
It works so fast.

333
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,900
Well, I wonder...

334
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,680
if I could participate in the Chen Huo'e case.

335
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,540
No.

336
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,400
Can't you see how complicated this case is?

337
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,280
Both the Ministry of Justice and the Judicial Government Office avoid it, yet you want to get involved in it.

338
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,040
I know.

339
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,200
Lai Luozhi and Princess Yong'an have both come to me today.

340
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,920
Through their words, they just don't want me involved in this case.

341
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,940
But I'm just a lowly clerk.

342
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,960
Could they possibly be wary of me?

343
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,220
What they are wary of is just the name Madam Shen.

344
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,500
Since you know itâ€¦

345
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,000
You have already taken on this case.

346
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,340
Now, I can't escape anyway.

347
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,000
How can I stay out of it?

348
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,200
If you encounter danger, can I not get involved?

349
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,000
Sorry.

350
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,300
There's nothing to be sorry about.

351
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:46,000
Finding out the truth and clearing the innocent one's name is what I desire as well.

352
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:51,580
All I want is that you grant me the authority to investigate the case.

353
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,780
Rest assured. I will definitely not hold you back or be a burden to you either.

354
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,060
But you have to promise me.

355
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:25,220
Consult with me about everything first before taking action.

356
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,600
- Don't act rashly on your own. 
 - Of course.

357
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:33,020
You are the Great Chief, my superior. Of course, I'm at your disposal.

358
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:37,760
From now on, I shall only follow your orders. Okay?

359
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,160
   

360
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,076
Boring.

361
00:29:50,515 --> 00:29:52,367
   

362
00:30:01,774 --> 00:30:04,908
   

363
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,000
Case handling by the Imperial Guards.

364
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,680
Is Master Chen Shoujie here?

365
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,200
I am Yan Xing, a clerk from the Ministry of Justice.

366
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,800
I have some questions to ask him.

367
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,980
That night, Madam was in a good mood

368
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:10,840
and personally made basin mutton, smoked chicken, baked flatbread, and cake.

369
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,800
She even gave me a bowl of wine.

370
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,880
 When I slept until midnight, I suddenly heard the master's shouting. 

371
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,100
 Madam! 

372
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,500
In the end, Madamâ€¦

373
00:31:35,245 --> 00:31:37,120
   

374
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,660
Madam, be careful!

375
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,270
   

376
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,700
Master! Master!

377
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,600
- Master. Master, Master. 
 - There's a fire!

378
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,164
- There's a fire! Moth. 
 - Master. Master.

379
00:32:28,164 --> 00:32:30,540
- It's on fire! It's on fire! 
 - Master. Master.

380
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,000
- Moth! 
 - Moth?

381
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,100
Is he talking about Chen Huo'e?

382
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,100
   

383
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,440
Don't get close to us.

384
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,880
You'll sit...

385
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,560
over there.

386
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,440
Since you handle cases for the Imperial Guards,

387
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,820
then you are no longer related to the Ministry of Justice.

388
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:42,040
No matter the great trouble you cause,

389
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,200
it has nothing to do with the Ministry of Justice.

390
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,000
The Ministry of Justice won't get involved in it.

391
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,620
No.

392
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,360
Sixth Miss, let me tell you!

393
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:13,159
No matter what, be sure to protect yourself.

394
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,360
If you die, I will certainlyâ€¦

395
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,900
I will certainly perform a grand opera for three days at the Furong Garden

396
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:22,040
to ensure you can't rest in peace even in the underworld.

397
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,660
Rest assured. I will surely not let you succeed.

398
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,239
 The third year of the Shengli Era, 

399
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,600
 Jinxiu Workshop was charged with the crime of insubordination for the delay of presenting Princess Runing 

400
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,480
 with summer clothes. 

401
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,880
 Since the summer clothes were ordered by the Prince Consort, 

402
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,300
   
 so he committed suicide in court to apologize. 

403
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:56,080
 Since then, Princess Runing had been at odds with the current Grand Empress Dowager. 

404
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,720
 And Jinxiu Workshop was accused of using patterns that violate regulations, 

405
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,500
 violating a major imperial taboo, so it was closed down. 

406
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,900
 The whole family of the Jinxiu Workshop's owner was executed. 

407
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,520
   
 That was the Jinxiu Workshop case. 

408
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,760
 Go 
 - Let go of me. 

409
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,820
 Violate regulations? Rumor had it that four years ago, 

410
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,400
 it was the Prince Consort seeking to display his achievements and present treasures. 

411
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,400
 But unexpectedly, he caused Princess Runing 

412
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,600
 to wear the same purple chrysanthemum pattern clothes as the former empress, 

413
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,100
 which angered the current Grand Empress Dowager. 

414
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,900
 But this case file is only vaguely written as "Violate regulations". 

415
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,200
 The case file is not that trustworthy. 

416
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,900
Come take a look, baked cake. Come on.

417
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,320
- Master Pan! 
 - Master Pan!

418
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:45,240
I didn't expect you to stay here. We've been looking for you.

419
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,060
Who are you two?

420
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,700
The day before yesterday at the Hongwen School, I witnessed your quick wit.

421
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,000
I heard you are also joining the Hongwen School examination.

422
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,120
In the future, we shall be schoolmates.

423
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,080
- I'm flattered. 
 - Let's go. We must have a drink.

424
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,410
- Let's go. 
 - Come on.

425
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,100
All right.

426
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,060
- Come on. 
 - This way. After you, Master Pan.

427
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,830
 Bravo! 

428
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:13,400
Prince Xian and Prime Minister Zhang cherish talents, so they specially told us

429
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,520
to communicate with the scholars from humble backgrounds in this examination.

430
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,920
So that in the future, we can better serve the court.

431
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,040
Please sit.

432
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,280
Please sit, no need to be formal.

433
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,780
His Majesty is benevolent and virtuous.

434
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,520
This Hongwen School examination

435
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,080
does not consider social status, family background, or recommendations.

436
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,520
Only judges by virtue and talent.

437
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,740
It can be said to set a precedent for our dynasty,

438
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:43,840
-  truly a fortune for scholars. 
 - Indeed.

439
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:48,720
Prime Minister Zhang told me to prepare some wine for you.

440
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:55,320
Students of the Hongwen School, be sure to communicate more with these talented individuals.

441
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,440
Here.

442
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,600
Please, please.

443
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,080
Come on. I toast to you all.

444
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:22,960
- What does it mean? 
 - Prince Xian has always valued scholars,

445
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,480
fearing that you might find it inconvenient

446
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,400
while living in Xiang'an.

447
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,500
So he specially sent this modest gift.

448
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:38,240
It is evident that Prince Xian is kind-hearted and benevolent.

449
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,900
Everyone, please accept it.

450
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:45,000
Is this a kind gesture from the noble classes?

451
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,920
Master Pan!

452
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,360
How dare he reject Prime Minister Zhang's gifts!

453
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,740
Ignorant!

454
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,840
Decadence behind gilded gates.

455
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,760
How dare he use such despicable means

456
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,280
to bribe and corrupt our hearts!

457
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,480
Poor lad.

458
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,680
Don't reject a friendly offer and face a penalty instead.

459
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,500
Are you Prime Minister Zhang's men?

460
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,400
Committing violence when the bribery fails.

461
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,040
Violence? I commit violence?

462
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,180
Violence, right?

463
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,840
In Xiang'an City, we are under the emperor's sovereign.

464
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,900
Don't be that stubborn, so you'll suffer less.

465
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,100
Be smart.

466
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,120
Who are you?

467
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,020
Prime Minister Zhang is soft, but Prince Xian is wise and brilliant.

468
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:25,360
To you scholars from humble backgrounds, threats and bribes are useless.

469
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,680
Might as well kill you all.

470
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,620
We just don't want to favor Prime Minister Zhang and Prince Xian.

471
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:33,200
So we have to die for it?

472
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,100
Kill!

473
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:08,280
Prince Xian will not let you off.

474
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,800
Go!

475
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,480
It's you!

476
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,340
Great Chief Shen.

477
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,500
Be careful.

478
00:41:09,231 --> 00:41:11,946
   

479
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:51,300
This man's strength is brutish. His hidden weapons have fierce power.

480
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,720
- Be careful. 
 - Yes.

481
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,060
- Chase! 
 - Hurry!

482
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,096
Your Highness.

483
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:25,200
