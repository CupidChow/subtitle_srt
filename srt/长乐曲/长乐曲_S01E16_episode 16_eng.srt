00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:32,030
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,968
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:38,266
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,266 --> 00:00:40,635
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,635 --> 00:00:44,510
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,645
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,645 --> 00:00:50,810
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:55,946
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,946 --> 00:01:02,318
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,318 --> 00:01:08,626
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,626 --> 00:01:14,805
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,805 --> 00:01:21,218
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,218 --> 00:01:28,962
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:28,962 --> 00:01:37,196
   

16
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,200
   

17
00:01:40,917 --> 00:01:43,050
   

18
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,120
Didn't sleep well?

19
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,840
I told you to come home with me, but you just wouldnâ€™t listen.

20
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,380
You told me you were going to the Archives to look for clues.

21
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,140
It looks like you didn't find any clues and may have even gotten a cold.

22
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,560
You have no idea. There were too many!

23
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,960
There's just so much, one thing after another.

24
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,660
Those people sure can write a lot. They record the most trivial matters.

25
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,500
Don't tell me you stayed up all night.

26
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,060
I couldn't sleep anyway.

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,600
Why don't you go back to the Shen Mansion?

28
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,420
In the worst case, you can sweet-talk Great Chief Shen a bit.

29
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,080
On what grounds?

30
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,500
I'm just analyzing the situation.

31
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,060
I saw everything with my own eyes yesterday.

32
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,960
This time, you may have really misunderstood him.

33
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,960
What have I misunderstood?

34
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,520
The day you were caught, Lai Luozhi arrived very soon.

35
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,840
Fortunately, Great Chief arrived just in time.

36
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,340
You cleared your name so quickly all thanks to Great Chief Shen.

37
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,480
In just a few days, so many new sects have emerged, claiming

38
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,580
they could bring the dead back to life and offer immortality.

39
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,190
An investigation is underway.

40
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,580
But most of the sects are roaming around and spreading evil doctrines.

41
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,120
It's difficult to track their next move.

42
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,240
Huo'e Sect.

43
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,860
This Huo'e Sect is dominant among all the sects.

44
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:27,840
And rumor has it that the key figure of this sect is the resurrected Chen Huo'e.

45
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,960
Mother! Hurry, let's go!

46
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,960
I-I'm not done yet.

47
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,280
Sixth Daughter, youâ€¦

48
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,420
Mother, what are you doing here?

49
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,320
I've come to pray for you and your dad.

50
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,180
Don't just believe in everything. Hurry, let's go!

51
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:50,760
- No, it's about to work. 
 - Go!

52
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,860
What's going on?

53
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,100
Listen up! Don't gather here! Disperse immediately!

54
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,600
- On what grounds? 
 - We have done nothing wrong!

55
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,720
Those who obstruct the Huo'e Sect will suffer retribution!

56
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,060
Arrest them all!

57
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,720
All of you. Karma will get you.

58
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,380
You will face retribution! You will face retribution!

59
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,500
 - Let me go! 
 - Hurry up! 

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,440
Mother, what were you doing there? It was so dangerous.

61
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,950
Keep it down.

62
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,280
I went there to pray for blessings for you and your dad

63
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,260
so that you can live long in peace.

64
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,120
- It's all a lie. Throw this awayâ€” 
 - You can't do that!

65
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,240
There will be retribution.

66
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,610
The sacred relic of Huo'e is the incarnation of a deity.

67
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,940
It is not to be violated.

68
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:53,340
Those who offend the deity will be strung up in the shape of a moth

69
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,340
- and get burned! 
 - Mother, where did you hear all this?

70
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,700
What do you mean? Even the kids on the street know.

71
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,440
Whoever offends the Huo'e Sect shall be consumed by a raging fire.

72
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,080
 I can't believe they have bewitched so many people. 

73
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,220
 I must look into it. 

74
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:14,040
Mother, you will be in serious trouble if you keep meddling with those sects.

75
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,480
Listen to me. Stay at home. Don't go anywhere anytime soon.

76
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,680
-  I'll take this. 
 - No, give it back to me.

77
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,900
You unfilial girl. Give it to me.

78
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,680
My goodness! Don't offend them, at least. Show some respect.

79
00:05:37,413 --> 00:05:40,520
   

80
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,432
It's so hot.

81
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,820
 Fire! Fire at the Historical Archive. 

82
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,040
 Fire! 

83
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,240
 - Hurry! 
 - Fetch some water! 

84
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,500
 Coming. 

85
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,260
 - Go fetch water! 
 - Fetch some water! 

86
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,120
 - Over here. Coming. 
 - Hurry! 

87
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,960
 - Over here! 
 - Get more! 

88
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,360
Sixth Miss!

89
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,250
 Fetch more water! 

90
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,130
 Hurry up! 

91
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,312
Sixth Miss!

92
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,448
 Hurry! 

93
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,240
 Fetch some water! 

94
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,880
 Shen Du! 

95
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,320
Shen Du.

96
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,997
â™«  Who can save me from loneliness and confusion?  â™«

97
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:47,968
â™«  Understand my vulnerability, no words are needed  â™«

98
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:51,220
â™«  Who can save me from my confusion and persistence?  â™«

99
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,077
â™«  Sheltering my loneliness, never allowing me to surrender  â™«

100
00:07:55,077 --> 00:07:59,564
â™«  I can't escape the shackles of our destiny  â™«

101
00:07:59,564 --> 00:08:03,085
â™«  Embracing the gentleness you've given  â™«

102
00:08:03,085 --> 00:08:09,128
â™«  Help me to see myself clearly, who I am  â™«

103
00:08:09,128 --> 00:08:12,340
â™«  Who can help me distinguish right from wrong?  â™«

104
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,179
â™«  Through the sea of people, just hold me tight  â™«

105
00:08:16,179 --> 00:08:19,428
â™«  Who can save me from grudges and karma?  â™«

106
00:08:19,428 --> 00:08:23,304
â™«  Soothe my sense of loss, never to escape  â™«

107
00:08:23,304 --> 00:08:27,616
â™«  Impurities of the past have settled, we've met several times  â™«

108
00:08:27,616 --> 00:08:31,804
â™«  Who can break free from fate?  â™«

109
00:08:31,804 --> 00:08:38,063
â™«  Crossing rivers and plunging into fire for you  â™«

110
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,280
Sixth Miss.

111
00:09:01,814 --> 00:09:07,756
â™«  Wishing to disappear in the hustle and bustle with you  â™«

112
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,332
You woke up?

113
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:46,360
You've inhaled a lot of smoke. Rest well these days.

114
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,672
I'm sorry!

115
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,080
And thank you for saving me.

116
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,860
Rest for now. Stop talking.

117
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,500
Sometimes, I talk without thinking.

118
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,760
If I've said something unpleasant, don't take it to heart.

119
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,372
Got it.

120
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:42,220
Do you think someone set that fire to destroy the county records and files?

121
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,880
Or they were targeting you.

122
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,900
Me?

123
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,980
Because I may uncover the truth?

124
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,720
It would be difficult to find someone as bold as you.

125
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,964
What are you doing?

126
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,640
I bumped into someone and it got stuck on me.

127
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,640
What exactly is it?

128
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,480
Perhaps only my master knows what this is.

129
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,520
Be careful.

130
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,760
What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?

131
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,400
No.

132
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,240
I-I'm fine.

133
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,280
Now you know how dangerous it is out there.

134
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,760
Get some good rest.

135
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,860
Stop running around.

136
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,420
   

137
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,080
Master, we're just having tea.

138
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,960
Why do we have to come so far?

139
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:12,420
Only here can you taste the flavor you want.

140
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,300
Try it if you don't believe me.

141
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,760
Is that how you drink tea?

142
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,800
You just downed it in one gulp!

143
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,320
Master, this is the powder from the crime scene.

144
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,680
It once appeared near the Jinxiu Workshop.

145
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,020
But I can't tell what it is.

146
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,172
Don't sniff it!

147
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,880
Interesting.

148
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,000
Flammable. Burns without a trace.

149
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,420
This is not something a common cultivator would use.

150
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:12,740
I'm afraid that it's something introduced from foreign regions.

151
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,500
From foreign regions?

152
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,720
Someone in the Ghost Market might know where this thing is from.

153
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,040
Master, it's a pity not to use your skills to solve cases.

154
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:31,700
I've taught you most of those skills.

155
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,600
It seems it's time for me to let go.

156
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,520
I've reached this age where I only look for some peace.

157
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:44,540
Every day I'm alive is a blessing!

158
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,910
If I can enjoy my tea leisurely every day,

159
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,660
I'll be content.

160
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,744
It's burning!

161
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,280
Look at you! You can't have tea in a hurry.

162
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,520
It's the same for solving cases.

163
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,680
If you're eager for success,

164
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,180
you will inevitably be misguided by what you see.

165
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,540
Misguided by what I see.

166
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,960
That's right, Master.

167
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,200
The evidence I have in hand,

168
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,580
does strike me as if it was handed to me on purpose.

169
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:26,280
Investigating a case is not just about seeking the truth.

170
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,960
It's also a contest with an enemy in the dark

171
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,960
to see who can gain control one step ahead.

172
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:41,600
If the case of the Jinxiu Workshop was a scheme to ruin the relationship

173
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,820
between the Empress Dowager, Princess Runing, and the Xiao family,

174
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:50,600
then this time, we are still unaware of the culprit's intention.

175
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,320
Don't rush!

176
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,500
Handling a case is like tasting tea.

177
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,220
It requires a lot of effort.

178
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,480
Everything should be savored like tea.

179
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,800
    
 You got it right!

180
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,800
It's the same for married couples.

181
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,700
Master, I'm talking about the case.

182
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,580
And that's what I'm talking about.

183
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,200
Discussing heroes over wine.

184
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,160
Talking about love over tea.

185
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:24,360
Tea tastes better and better with every sip.

186
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,920
It's the same with people.

187
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,880
Time reveals a person's true nature.

188
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,640
Nice tea! Nice tea!

189
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,160
   

190
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,320
Sixth Miss, wait!

191
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,928
Come here.

192
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,700
Why aren't you resting at home?

193
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:14,219
That old geezer Wu Taiming won't let you come in because you might bring "bad luck".

194
00:17:14,219 --> 00:17:16,119
It's all my fault.

195
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:20,040
Was Ji Fangming implicated or scolded?

196
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,380
The Historical Archive was almost burned down under his watch.

197
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,739
Wu Taiming dare not vent his anger on you.

198
00:17:25,739 --> 00:17:29,280
So, Ji Fangming took all the scoldings.

199
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,580
I'd better figure out how to apologize to him.

200
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,920
Right.

201
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,400
I heard that Great Chief Shen carried you home

202
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,860
in his arms in front of everyone.

203
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,400
Do you expect him to stand by and let me die?

204
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,320
Listen to yourself. You never say anything sweet.

205
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,680
So sharp-tongued!

206
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,560
Listen to you. There's nothing you wouldn't say.

207
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,820
So reckless!

208
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,600
Look at you.

209
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,780
You just returned to the mansion and you're already glowing.

210
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,080
Let me see.

211
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,530
What tricks did they play

212
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:14,600
to make your eyes so bright and spirited?

213
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,280
Wellâ€¦

214
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,200
You don't say.

215
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,680
I fell asleep as soon as I laid down last night.

216
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,070
Could it be that I've gotten used to sleeping with the lights on

217
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,540
in the Shen Mansion?

218
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:33,280
- On the contrary, I can't sleep here. 
 - All right.

219
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,660
I'm serious.

220
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,698
   

221
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,500
This isâ€¦

222
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,060
My savior. To repay your kindness,

223
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:51,620
I've prepared dishes that could help your eyes recover.

224
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,000
From now on, you have to keep a healthy diet, with no exceptions.

225
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,040
I will cook for you until you recover.

226
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,060
Why aren't you eating?

227
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,820
Could it be that you're picky with food?

228
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,240
Or you don't want to eat?

229
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,200
I made these out of goodwill.

230
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,120
Don't waste the food.

231
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,112
I'll leave you to eat.

232
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:26,965
â™«  One look confirmed our fate  â™«

233
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:30,742
â™«  Upon meeting again, I know you're the one for me  â™«

234
00:19:30,742 --> 00:19:35,220
â™«  Gazing at the stars, dreaming about old times  â™«

235
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,255
What's the rush, my wife?

236
00:19:38,255 --> 00:19:42,082
â™«  Lovers before the candlelight, do not ask their thoughts  â™«

237
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,720
Since when do you need someone...

238
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,040
to keep you company over meals?

239
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,040
But you cooked for me.

240
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,095
I'll enjoy the food better in your presence.

241
00:19:57,095 --> 00:20:00,823
â™«  Autumn moon and spring breeze, I only want you for my whole life  â™«

242
00:20:00,823 --> 00:20:02,823
â™«  The trace of your palm  â™«

243
00:20:02,823 --> 00:20:05,480
â™«  Your gaze  â™«

244
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,600
Like I said, what's the rush, my wife?

245
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,400
You're a grown-up.

246
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,260
Do you still need someone to feed you?

247
00:20:16,267 --> 00:20:18,071
â™«  The trace of your palm  â™«

248
00:20:18,071 --> 00:20:20,722
â™«  Your gaze  â™«

249
00:20:20,722 --> 00:20:23,495
â™«  Our love is heating up  â™«

250
00:20:23,495 --> 00:20:27,937
â™«  You are the only one for me  â™«

251
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,640
I can totally sense your goodwill.

252
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,660
Wife, please dig in.

253
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,140
From now on, always join me for meals.

254
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,960
Do you agree or not?

255
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,200
I depend on you for a living.

256
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,440
Do I even have a choice?

257
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,460
Good that you know.

258
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,140
- What's wrong? 
 - You have no table manners.

259
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,300
That's not true.

260
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,400
It's not true!

261
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,860
What's going on?

262
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,780
What a loving couple.

263
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,040
Others can only be envious.

264
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:41,860
This must be what it's like to be inseparable.

265
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,080
I just don't know how long they can stay like this.

266
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,120
Every grievance has a source.

267
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,060
Don't come after me!

268
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,280
Don't come after me! It wasn't me!

269
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,900
Don't come after me!

270
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,580
It wasn't me! Don't come after me!

271
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,232
Don't come after me!

272
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,570
   

273
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,480
Great Chief, when we arrived, we found him tied up to the eaves.

274
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,620
We waited for you lest we destroy the crime scene.

275
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,240
Great Chief, Chen Shoujie survived.

276
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,440
The guards we sent to protect him saved him in time.

277
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,840
But it seems that he has been quite shocked.

278
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,560
He's been acting crazy this whole time.

279
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,060
Now he can't even speak a complete sentence.

280
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,800
It looks just like the Furong Garden.

281
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,620
Back then, Han Shiyuan and Third Sister were also tied up and hung midair

282
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,600
with fires burning beneath them.

283
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,680
But it was the cold flame of the jugglers from the Western Region.

284
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,360
This looks like a real attempted murder.

285
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,500
Who on earth would want to murder Chen Shoujie

286
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,360
in such a cruel way?

287
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,800
Let's go.

288
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,540
 How did the Chen Mansion get burned? 

289
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,400
 How tragic! 

290
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,660
Who is that? Why is he hiding?

291
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,210
Jing Lin.

292
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,580
 What's going on? 

293
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,740
 What's going on? 

294
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,680
 Someone has been arrested. 

295
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,640
It's you.

296
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,720
This is Ji Fangming, who was guarding the Historical Archive.

297
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,320
We need your testimony and signature regarding the fire.

298
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,860
I saw you guys hurrying here when I was on my way to the Shen Mansion.

299
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,300
- Someone was burned to death in the east of the city. 
 - What?

300
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,400
- Burned to death? Who was it? 
 - It's one of us.

301
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,120
Officer Sun.

302
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,900
It was him?

303
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,340
Do you know about the Huo'e Sect?

304
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,620
It was Chen Huo'e who gave him a punishment, you know?

305
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,660
A few days ago, the fire at the Ministry of Justice

306
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:56,380
was a punishment for Madam Shen.

307
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,920
- Madam Shen? 
 - She almost got burned to death.

308
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,720
Perhaps the White Ghost has done too much evil.

309
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,440
Retribution fell upon his wife.

310
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,200
Hearing wind and rain at night,

311
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,880
sitting still as a bell.

312
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,780
Stuffed from the night snack, a few drinks are needed.

313
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,900
Did you figure out where the powder is from?

314
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,260
It's from the Western Region. It's very mysterious.

315
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,600
I put in some serious effort to figure it out.

316
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,360
Want a higher commission? No way.

317
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,660
You took the trouble to memorize the code and yet you came empty-handed?

318
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:50,360
In the worst case, you could have brought me some wine.

319
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,700
If you admit that you are the famous folksy detective Pan Chi,

320
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,900
I may consider buying you the best osmanthus wine in Xiang'an.

321
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,688
I am.

322
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,280
If I were the detective, would you pay me more for my work?

323
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,400
You wish.

324
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,100
It sounds pretty good.

325
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,720
Hurry back home. The Ghost Market is not safe these days.

326
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,800
Great Chief, you asked me to look into Ji Fangming.

327
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,000
I found that he once prescribed medicine for himself.

328
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,040
 He's sick? 

329
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,520
 I didn't know he had studied herbs. 

330
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,900
I followed him and found that he had health issues, something chronic.

331
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,680
Take this prescription to the pharmacy.

332
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:48,000
- I'd like to know what sickness he has. 
 -  Are you suspecting him?

333
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,720
That fire in the Historical Archive was set way too coincidentally.

334
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:09,960
The Great Chief must be busy. I just came to ask what tea he would like.

335
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,980
Please don't bother. Miss Yun Que, please go back.

336
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,880
Did you find something about the Jinxiu Workshop?

337
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,180
Miss, rest assured. The Great Chief will inform you when necessary.

338
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,472
I've got something.

339
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,880
This powder is from a plant unique to the Western Region.

340
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,600
It produces a unique scent once burned.

341
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,880
Those who smell it become exceptionally excited and even hallucinate.

342
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,480
It is said that if someone implies something

343
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,300
to those who smell it, it may induce an illusion based on the description.

344
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,600
Is it available in the Ghost Market?

345
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,720
Not really.

346
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,360
It is said that this plant may be common in the Western Region,

347
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,320
but it's hard to survive without a specific soil.

348
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,840
Therefore, for this powder to create a strong hallucination,

349
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,880
one can't store it for too long.

350
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,120
Could it be that someone has secretly planted it in Xiang'an?

351
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,660
Is the information true?

352
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,500
I learned from my friend Pan Chi in the Ghost Market.

353
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,000
The tips from him can't be wrong.

354
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,280
Did you know that Ji Fangming was ill?

355
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,600
You count on your connections

356
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,300
while neglecting the clues around you.

357
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,200
Back at Chen Shoujie's mansion,

358
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,920
the way he showed up and his reactions were strange.

359
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,440
Others were interested in what happened in the house.

360
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,800
But he was curious about our reactions to the incident.

361
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,608
Exactly.

362
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,520
And it occurred to me

363
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:27,240
that I'd once smelled a faint scent on Ji Fangming.

364
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,980
I didn't pay much attention to it.

365
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:34,600
Now that I think of it, it was somewhat familiar but not common.

366
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,200
I've only smelled it in one place.

367
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,700
Mingsheng Temple.

368
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,880
He's been there as well?

369
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,360
I told Chuichui to look into Ji Fangming

370
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,080
and inquire about his background.

371
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,060
He entered the Ministry of Justice with someone's recommendation.

372
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,400
Guess who that person was.

373
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,160
- Could it beâ€¦ 
 - That's right.

374
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,130
It was Chen Shoujie.

375
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,600
Apart from that, he had a clean record,

376
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,150
nothing suspicious.

377
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,300
That makes it all the more suspicious.

378
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,360
There must be some secrets.

379
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,480
Chen Shoujie had kindly recommended that he take on a job.

380
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:24,840
But that day at the crime scene, he pretended not to know him.

381
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,900
Chen Shoujie had made recommendations.

382
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,680
I've looked into them.

383
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,920
Their paths never crossed.

384
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:40,400
That means there is some middleman that ties them together

385
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,580
and we haven't found out about.

386
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,140
It seems...

387
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,780
we have to ask them in person.

388
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,400
Master Ji, here.

389
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,760
Clerk Yan, this isâ€¦

390
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,400
Finally, I don't have to read those random records anymore.

391
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,900
So you've found the murderer?

392
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:20,520
Yes, that's right. Chen Shoujie committed all those crimes.

393
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,720
He played dumb and deceived everyone.

394
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,520
In fact, those were his confessions.

395
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,900
- What? He confessed? 
 - Yes.

396
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,000
You know my husband.

397
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,880
The famous White Ghost.

398
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:37,660
In less than a day, Chen Shoujie confessed to everything.

399
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,100
He was playing dumb?

400
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,140
How is that possible?

401
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,820
Why not?

402
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,400
He was the one

403
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,880
who hid the key evidence of the case of the Jinxiu Workshop back then.

404
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,340
So many innocent people died.

405
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,850
They bought him off with 1,000 taels of gold.

406
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,640
He buried those in his own courtyard.

407
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,360
It took us several hours to dig them all out.

408
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:10,100
That was unexpected.

409
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,500
He hid it so well.

410
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:22,200
That's right! If it hadn't been for my husband, we might have still been kept in the dark.

411
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,900
Is he detained by the Imperial Guards?

412
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,720
He's detained in the Ministry of Justice.

413
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,560
Tomorrow, there will be a secret execution.

414
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,380
Secret execution. Why?

415
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,980
That's what they decided.

416
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:46,000
Perhaps there is something behind this case.

417
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,000
If Princess Runing

418
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,760
was put away in the Mingsheng Temple due to a false accusation,

419
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,820
then the Jinxiu Workshop was merely used...

420
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:58,440
- by the culprits to frame her. 
 - What?

421
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,780
Are you saying those deceased of the Jinxiu Workshopâ€¦

422
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,500
Please mind your words.

423
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,000
Therefore, we can't investigate more.

424
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,680
It's all my fault.

425
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,200
It's all my fault.

426
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,340
It's all my fault.

427
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,600
Who incited you to set up those people at the Jinxiu Workshop?

428
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,840
Still pretending?

429
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,340
You shall perish today!

430
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,480
An imposter?

431
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,480
Those who offend Huo'e must suffer the punishment.

432
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,720
Ji Fangming. It's really you.

433
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,800
You told me those things just to lure me here.

434
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,640
You had many chances to kill Chen Shoujie. But you didn't.

435
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,540
So we speculated that the murderer preferred

436
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:56,180
to torture him rather than kill him.

437
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:59,040
The killer wanted him to be sober more than anyone.

438
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,780
Otherwise, the torture wouldn't be so satisfying.

439
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,920
Ji Fangming, we caught you in action.

440
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,960
- Do you have anything to say? 
 - I'm not the murderer.

441
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,640
Nor do I know why I've come here.

442
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,560
Perhaps I was bewitched and came here in a state of confusion.

443
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,220
Great Chief Shen. Madam Shen. You have seen something like this.

444
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,680
I bet you understand.

445
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,960
I have absolutely no reason to kill Chen Shoujie.

446
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,920
It was for the owner of the Jinxiu Workshop, Kong Xianrong. Right?

447
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,920
After so many years,

448
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,560
hardly anyone dares to mention the convicts of that case.

449
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,412
I didn't expect that...

450
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,880
someone still remembers his name.

451
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,920
You set fire to the Historical Archive not to kill me.

452
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,800
You intended to burn the things there.

453
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,740
You meant to erase the clues tying you to Chen Shoujie

454
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:05,880
and Kong Xianrong, the owner of the Jinxiu Workshop.

455
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,120
Is that all you've got

456
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,260
to convict me as the culprit, Clerk Yan?

457
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,620
So you admit it.

458
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,580
I met Xianrong at a young age.

459
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,860
 Fate brought us to meet in a tea house while taking shelter from the rain. 

460
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,040
   

461
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,920
 Xianrong was articulate and talented. 

462
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,230
 We hit it off right away 

463
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,820
 and soon became close friends. 

464
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,700
After I failed the exam, 
    

465
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:44,900
 he introduced me to Chen Shoujie who got me a job. 

466
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:50,200
 Who would have expected that injustice would fall upon the Jinxiu Workshop? 

467
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,640
 Kong Xianrong was executed with his entire family. 

468
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,740
 I just stood in the crowd, watching them be executed, 

469
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,920
 their blood forming a pond. 

470
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,580
Why were you so certain that Kong Xianrong was wrongly convicted?

471
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,560
Over the years,

472
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,500
I've examined all local county records and investigated all criminal files.

473
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,480
My persistence was rewarded.

474
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,040
Finally, I discovered something.

475
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,000
Xianrong saw Chen Shoujie as his brother.

476
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,800
But Chen Shoujie betrayed that trust for his selfish desires.

477
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,900
So you killed his wife and tried every means to torment him.

478
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,160
She deserved to die! Madam Chen deserved to die!

479
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,920
Chen Shoujie was even worse!

480
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,120
Are you responsible for the death of Officer Sun?

481
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,920
What does it have to do with me?

482
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,780
So who told you to imitate Chen Huo'e as you commit crimes?

483
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,520
The moths fly to the flame.

484
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,440
Born in the morning, dead by evening.

485
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,880
Not entering the cycle of reincarnation.

486
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,820
Undying.

487
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,600
Put Ji Fangming in jail. Await court trial.

488
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,680
I'm avenging those who were wronged.

489
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,680
I did nothing wrong!

490
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,000
I did nothing wrong!

491
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,540
 Chen Shoujie deserves to die! 

492
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,840
   

493
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,660
Is the food not tasty today?

494
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,480
Why are you so silent?

495
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,860
What a reckless move to enrage Ji Fangming.

496
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,420
If anything happenedâ€”

497
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:50,480
Anyway, I made him confess.

498
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:57,840
Indeed. A simple and rough method works best in some cases.

499
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,280
Now I'm counting on you, the Great Chief of the Imperial Guards,

500
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,780
to proceed with the court trial.

501
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,580
I'm afraid it's not so simple.

502
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,640
Ji Fangming has been detained.

503
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:14,020
If we find evidence to convict him, then we can close the case. Right?

504
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:18,420
If Ji Fangming was the only culprit, then it's fine to close the case like this.

505
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:21,760
But something is not right.

506
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,200
What is it?

507
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,400
The Huo'e Sect is gaining momentum much faster than we imagined.

508
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,200
While Ji Fangming was trying to burn Chen Shoujie alive,

509
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:36,400
someone committed murder in the eastern city without any restraint.

510
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,680
Huo'e Sect.

511
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,900
Don't tell me that the person behind it is really the resurrected Chen Huo'e.

512
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,740
Your cooking...

513
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,100
hasn't improved at all.

514
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,600
But now that I'm used to it,

515
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,000
it's not so unbearable anymore.

516
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,880
It's fine if my cooking doesn't improve

517
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,960
as long as you have the appetite.

518
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,700
The man you arrested was avenging the innocent.

519
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,740
I offered you the evidence at the risk of my life.

520
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:50,720
You have to let me watch the interrogation.

521
00:40:55,982 --> 00:40:57,820
   

522
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,240
Ji Fangming, you killed the wife of Chen Shoujie

523
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,740
and got caught while attempting to murder Chen Shoujie.

524
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,680
What's the whole story?

525
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,200
Do you have any accomplices?

526
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,960
Confess everything.

527
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,040
You surely sound majestic.

528
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,980
I've seen too many people bluffing at the Ministry of Justice.

529
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:23,440
It doesn't work for me.

530
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,440
Ji Fangming!

531
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,520
At this point, you'd better come clean.

532
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,220
Stop playing tricks.

533
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,920
If you refuse to speak here,

534
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,240
I'll take you to the Imperial Guards.

535
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,920
I have plenty of methods to make you talk.

536
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:48,100
Are you trying to force a confession through torture?

537
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,400
Vice Minister Lai, you're right on time.

538
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,240
It's better to be timely than early.

539
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:00,960
If I didn't come, how could I observe your majestic aura?

540
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,520
The Empress Dowager entrusted this case to me.

541
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,280
I have my own judgment.

542
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,660
Just sit in and listen. Do not cause trouble.

543
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:14,440
Or you'll be charged with disrupting the court trial.

544
