00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,920
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,960
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,258
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,258 --> 00:00:40,627
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,627 --> 00:00:44,402
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,402 --> 00:00:47,537
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,537 --> 00:00:50,802
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:55,838
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,838 --> 00:01:02,110
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:08,418
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,418 --> 00:01:14,697
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,697 --> 00:01:21,110
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:29,054
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:29,054 --> 00:01:37,288
   

16
00:01:37,288 --> 00:01:40,180
   

17
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,400
Beat him!

18
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,004
   

19
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,480
Isn't he Young Master Han?

20
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,330
Stop!

21
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,100
Your Highness, this brat has no sense of shame!

22
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,120
How dare he show up at the front door of the Princess of Valor's mansion?!

23
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,620
Today, he must be taught a good lesson!

24
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,100
What are you doing here?

25
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,900
Your Highness, please save Third Miss.

26
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,260
Han Shiyuan, I gave you the chance, but you did not cherish it.

27
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,090
Now,

28
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,200
what will you use to plead with me?

29
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,440
Your Highness.

30
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,640
Your Highness.

31
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,020
As long as you are willing to save Third Miss, my life is yours.

32
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,460
From now on, whatever you ask me to do, I will never say no.

33
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,920
You dare to keep pestering Her Highness?

34
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,604
Enough!

35
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,200
You really are quite the romantic, arenâ€™t you?

36
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,000
You'd risk your life for her.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,520
Unfortunately, I wasn't the one who poisoned Third Miss.

38
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,080
I do not know how to save her either.

39
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,120
If you want to die with her,

40
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,200
then go die far away.

41
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,840
Donâ€™t sully my eyes here!

42
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,880
Madam Yang, throw him back to the Yan Mansion.

43
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,740
Do not let him die here.

44
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,536
Yes.

45
00:03:12,536 --> 00:03:14,200
Your Highness.

46
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,500
Your Highness!

47
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,920
Prince Xian, Yan Kuo is as timid as a mouse and is incapable of shouldering heavy responsibilities.

48
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,380
But his daughters can't be underestimated.

49
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,680
This time, Third Miss Yan has been poisoned.

50
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,100
I wonder if it was done by the Princess of Valor or Chen Huo'e.

51
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,220
If Third Miss Yan really dies from the poison,

52
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,080
I think the Princess of Valor won't be able to explain her relationship with Chen Huo'e.

53
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,800
In fact, it doesn't matter whether it was done by the Princess of Valor.

54
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,880
Shen Du will surely be on our side for his sister-in-law.

55
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,140
Even if Shen Du remains foolish and refuses to be on our side,

56
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,420
then the Princess of Valor will also not trust him anymore.

57
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,040
Sir,

58
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,480
how many things have you done behind my back over these years?

59
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,360
Your Highness, I know you are kind-hearted.

60
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,160
But to achieve great things, one must not be bound by trivial matters and must be ruthless sometimes.

61
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,959
You were born into the royal family,

62
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,820
you surely cannot escape from the schemes for power.

63
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:25,560
Even the Empress Dowager took steps cautiously to stay where she is now.

64
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,720
Crown Prince's death that year was mysterious and unclear.

65
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,140
- And the young emperorâ€¦ 
 - Impudent!

66
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,640
I misspoke!

67
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,360
But my loyalty to Your Highness is as clear as the sun and sky.

68
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,980
Sir, over these years, you have been devoted to protecting me.

69
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,360
Every single thing you have done has been to pave the way for me.

70
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,860
I am well aware of it.

71
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,700
But I truly don't want to see in-fighting and conflict within the family.

72
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,320
If it has to go this way, then I don't want to be the Prince Regent.

73
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,260
Prince Xian.

74
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,160
You must never have such thoughts.

75
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,240
You are the Prince Xian of the current reign.

76
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,280
In the future, you are destined to be the Great Cang's Prince Regent.

77
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,880
Every single thing that I have done

78
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,120
has been for you, Prince Xian.

79
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,900
How foolish!

80
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,900
How foolish!

81
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,490
Sir,

82
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:58,780
is power truly something people should be so captivated by?

83
00:06:21,852 --> 00:06:23,838
   

84
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,528
Great Chief.

85
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,840
Are you worried about Madam?

86
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,580
Nonsense.

87
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,700
Yes, it's my nonsense.

88
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,020
However, I might know

89
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:47,840
why Madam toiled all night at the Ministry of Justice yesterday.

90
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,960
Yan Mojie came for me yesterday.

91
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,720
He asked me to help him look through the family's records.

92
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,680
I heard the poison that Third Miss Yan got

93
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:05,080
is Huo'e Sect's "Butterfly out of Cocoons."

94
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,700
"Butterfly out of Cocoons?"

95
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,380
Yes, everyone in the Yan Mansion has been thrown into chaos these past two days.

96
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,640
It's indeed because of this.

97
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,380
The Yan Mansion has been thrown into chaos?

98
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,860
Why haven't I heard a word about it?

99
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,440
Perhaps Madam doesn't want to trouble you?

100
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,300
Even Yan Mojie knows to get your help when there's trouble.

101
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,080
How could she not know whom to seek help from?

102
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,860
Then she might have her own connections.

103
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,320
Today, I heard Madam went to the palace to look for the imperial physician.

104
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:40,480
I heard she also showed them an antidote prescription from the Imperial Inspectorate.

105
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,360
It's said to have come from a confession from Chen Huo'e's interrogation.

106
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,400
The Imperial Inspectorate?

107
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,340
Chen Huo'e.

108
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,420
I have already inquired with that imperial physician.

109
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,180
He said that the antidote is likely genuine.

110
00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:00,080
It's just that there's a very deadly ingredient in this antidote.

111
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,420
What is it?

112
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:06,720
It's the heart's blood of the mirror-image person!

113
00:08:11,465 --> 00:08:15,321
   

114
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,980
Anyone? No one here in the Lai Mansion?

115
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,920
Great Chief, I think this Lai Luozhi is doing something mysterious again.

116
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,140
Since it is so, don't be anxious.

117
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,180
Stay here. I'll take a look at the back.

118
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,600
- Great Chief. 
 - Don't worry.

119
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,520
Vice Minister Lai, you set up such a complicated setup,

120
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,820
isn't it just to lure me here?

121
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,720
What? I am here now, yet you are hiding.

122
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,820
This is unlike your usual style in the royal court.

123
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,740
Sorry to disturb you. I am sorry.

124
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,980
Great Chief, it's your first visit to my mansion, and yet you chased after the women of my family in the backyard.

125
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,160
If word gets out, it would be another joke.

126
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,720
Vice Minister Lai, put away these intimidating things.

127
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:18,260
These little tricks of course can't impress you.

128
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:22,420
However, Great Chief, you've trespassed into my mansion today.

129
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,280
I think you owe me an explanation.

130
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,820
If I didn't come,

131
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,760
would you give me the heart's blood of the mirror-image person?

132
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,300
What do you mean?

133
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,760
You intentionally poisoned Third Miss Yan, and let Yan Xing obtain the prescription.

134
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,240
Naturally, you have the heart's blood of Chen Huo'e...

135
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,440
for an exchange.

136
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,780
What you said is merely your speculation.

137
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,840
I donâ€™t acknowledge a single word.

138
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,460
However, I happen

139
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:07,920
to have a vial of the heart's blood of the mirror-image person.

140
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,280
Great Chief, don't.

141
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,180
What? Do you find the water dirty in my mansion?

142
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,640
Or are you worried it's poisoned?

143
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,540
I have always respected you.

144
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:02,130
Great Chief, you've made a big fuss and come with the imperial guards to my mansion.

145
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:07,600
If you cannot leave today, or after leaving you're found to be poisoned,

146
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,160
it'd be hard for me to explain to the Empress Dowager.

147
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,920
Where is the heart's blood of the mirror-image person?

148
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,760
Right in this teacup.

149
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,220
You tricked Great Chief into drinking it?

150
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:40,640
You've sealed the heart's blood of the mirror-image person in this teacup?

151
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,740
I specially found a skilled artisan from Xichen

152
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,900
to make this teacup of heart's blood.

153
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:02,740
Actually, the thing you're looking for has always been right in front of you.

154
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,760
Yet you are so wary of me, you didn't even dare to drink a sip of tea.

155
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:17,140
In fact, I am not that unworthy of trust.

156
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,156
Right?

157
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:28,020
In this world, the heart's blood of the mirror-image person is really hard to find.

158
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,800
And this teacup is ingeniously crafted.

159
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,700
Naturally, it won't be for free.

160
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,100
Vice Minister Lai, you have set up such a big trap to lure me here.

161
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,580
Just tell me what you want.

162
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,260
It's soothing to talk to a clever person.

163
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,500
In fact, I don't want anything.

164
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,440
Great Chief, just remember this favor of mine.

165
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,100
In the future, you have to repay it doubly.

166
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,840
Then there's no other way.

167
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,240
Let's see if you really love your wife so deeply,

168
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,220
that even your wife's sister is willing to gamble on an unknown promise to save her.

169
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,188
Iâ€¦

170
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,744
will take note of it.

171
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,040
Great Chief, I won't see you out.

172
00:16:11,712 --> 00:16:13,620
   

173
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,640
I don't understand why you went through all this trouble.

174
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,530
First poisoning, then providing an antidote,

175
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:22,200
even asking me to show my face in front of Shen Du.

176
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,470
What do you want to do?

177
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,100
   

178
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,500
You don't need to know.

179
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,920
I don't need to know?

180
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:53,120
Hasn't my family done enough for your big ambitions?

181
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,832
Now,

182
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,420
I don't even have the right to know.

183
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,900
I'm sorry, Older Sister!

184
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:17,019
I was just anxious. How could I not know your suffering?

185
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:23,100
Everything I've done is all about letting all of us get what we deserve.

186
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,639
Poisoning Third Miss Yan can arouse the suspicion of Prince Xian,

187
00:17:26,639 --> 00:17:30,660
the Princess of Valor, and the Imperial Guards.

188
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,220
This goal has already been achieved.

189
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,720
As for Shen Du, he is the most difficult to deal with.

190
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,860
The Imperial Guards and the Shen Mansion are both sealed up tight.

191
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,420
The spies I arranged have all been kicked out.

192
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,620
Shen Du is on Prince Xian's side?

193
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:55,000
No. Shen Du has always been neutral in the court.

194
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,900
Neither siding with Prince Xian, nor favoring the Princess of Valor.

195
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,020
And we don't deal with each other either.

196
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,080
The more cautiously he maintains neutral,

197
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,840
the more the Empress Dowager trusts him,

198
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,440
and the worse it is for what we're trying to do.

199
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:19,540
Then why not simply kill him? Or make a direct request to him?

200
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,600
The unknown promise is the scariest.

201
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,480
I want to make him feel uneasy,

202
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,820
fearful, and hesitant.

203
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,860
Wait for the fear to take root in him,

204
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:41,760
one day, I can make him play a role..

205
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,840
greater than dying.

206
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,140
Sixth Miss!

207
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,340
Sixth Miss, all the medicinal herbs have been prepared.

208
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,540
Only the heart's blood of the mirror-image person is missing.

209
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,580
But over at Prime Minister Zhang's side, your father met with some setbacks.

210
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,100
And over at Princess Yong'an's side, Shiyuan also got beaten.

211
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,580
I truly have run out of options.

212
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,940
I beg you! I beg you please think of another way!

213
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,520
- Madam, what are you doing? 
 - Mother.

214
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,630
Aren't you putting pressure on our Sixth Miss?

215
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,460
She's already trying to find a solution and getting tired like this.

216
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,280
What else can she do now?

217
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,812
There is...

218
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,720
There is... Great Chief!

219
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,320
Shut up!

220
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,340
Why should I shut up?

221
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,680
White Ghost killed that Chen Huo'e.

222
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,460
Now the retribution has fallen upon my daughter.

223
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:02,720
Why can't I just beg for White Ghost and ask him to think of a solution?

224
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,240
Even if Caiwei was once in the wrong against him,

225
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,780
but anyway, now she is also his sister-in-law.

226
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,840
- Mother. 
 - Right. Sorry, I'm late.

227
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,940
- Great Chief! 
 - No need for courtesy!

228
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:32,580
This is the antidote. The heart's blood of the mirror-image person is in this teacup.

229
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,940
Thank you for saving her life, Great Chief Shen!

230
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,612
Please rise.

231
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,640
Sixth Miss is my wife.

232
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,480
The matters of the Yan household are my responsibility as well.

233
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,120
The antidote is urgent.

234
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,820
- Thank you, Great Chief. Thank you, Great Chief. 
 - I'll go and use it for the medicine now.

235
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,860
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

236
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,680
Caiwei can be saved now. Caiwei can be saved now.

237
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,548
Come on.

238
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,860
Sixth Miss,

239
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,758
when will I be the first person you turn to when you need help?

240
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:21,097
â™«  I have waited until time bloomed into flowers  â™«

241
00:21:21,097 --> 00:21:26,850
â™«  The ice and snow slowly melting  â™«

242
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:30,520
â™«  I hear those gentle words  â™«

243
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,344
Sixth Miss!

244
00:21:55,574 --> 00:22:00,104
â™«  The flower in the mirror, the moon in the water, present in my dreams  â™«

245
00:22:00,104 --> 00:22:06,500
â™«  Itâ€™s not illusory glamor  â™«

246
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,040
It's fine now.

247
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,866
â™«  Chasing time, riding a white horse  â™«

248
00:22:10,866 --> 00:22:15,602
â™«  Let's go together  â™«

249
00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:18,057
â™«  Love is pure and originally flawless  â™«

250
00:22:18,057 --> 00:22:20,963
â™«  Let the vast universe change  â™«

251
00:22:20,963 --> 00:22:25,280
â™«  Let's spend our time together  â™«

252
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,440
Is what Lai Luozhi said reliable?

253
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,820
Does the heart's blood he gave really work?

254
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,880
Don't trust anyone completely.

255
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:45,420
Shen Du, I have something to tell you.

256
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:50,040
If I don't tell you now, I'm afraid I won't get another chance.

257
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,820
Do you know why Prime Minister Zhang insisted on

258
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,720
having the daughter of the Yan family marry you?

259
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:06,060
Prime Minister Zhang threatened my father and the whole family to settle this marriage.

260
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,760
It was supposed to be Third Miss marrying you.

261
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,400
Later on, I married you for her.

262
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,800
But Prime Minister Zhang still wanted me to find a way

263
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,080
to be his and Prince Xian's informant in the Shen Mansion.

264
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,720
But I really never helped Prince Xian do anything to harm you.

265
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,680
I know.

266
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,620
I trust you would not harm me.

267
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:33,348
You know?

268
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,060
Do you really trust me?

269
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,100
Sixth Miss.

270
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:49,080
Since you have never done anything to harm me, there's no need to feel guilty.

271
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,360
If there's anything that causes doubts in the future,

272
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,120
come and ask me directly. All right?

273
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,140
What are you doing?

274
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,380
Spit it out. Spit it out!

275
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,860
Spit it out.

276
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,480
- Hurry! 
 - You can test the medicine for your Third Sister,

277
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,320
so I can naturally do it for you.

278
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,320
Who asked you to do it for me?

279
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,500
Youâ€¦

280
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,020
I will use internal breath to spread the medicine throughout my body.

281
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:34,800
If I'm fine after a while, then your Third Sister can take the medicine.

282
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,380
Why are you so foolish?

283
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,040
I should test the medicine for Third Sister as her sister.

284
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,080
What's wrong with you? Do you feel any discomfort?

285
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,300
You've just recovered from your injury. How could you take such a risk?

286
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,240
Do you feel any discomfort now? Any part of you making you feel unwell?

287
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,860
Do you feel any discomfort?

288
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,960
Tell me.

289
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,120
I'm really fine!

290
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,480
Since Lai Luozhi deliberately lured me over,

291
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,920
the thing he gave me should be genuine.

292
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,920
But he just didn't expect I'd try it myself.

293
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:16,320
Otherwise, he might have put something lethal in it.

294
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,810
It hurts.

295
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,680
It hurts.

296
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,172
Let me see.

297
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,520
I wasn't poisoned to death,

298
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,880
but I was beaten to death.

299
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:12,380
The medicine is fine. Hurry up and bring it to Third Sister. Hurry!

300
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,920
Here's the medicine.

301
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,884
Hurry! Hurry!

302
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:56,560
Don't worry. She'll wake up soon.

303
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,500
It has already been two hours.

304
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,940
Mother.

305
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,940
Caiwei, are you awake?

306
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:20,680
- Mother! 
 - Third Sister, are you awake?

307
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,512
Sixth Miss!

308
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,172
Father.

309
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,500
Where is Young Master Han?

310
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,192
Third Miss!

311
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:39,000
Young Master Han, what happened to you?

312
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,900
Father! Father! The Princess of Valor has sent a gift box and an invitation.

313
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,940
Princess of Valor? Read it.

314
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,080
"I've heard that Young Master Han and Third Miss Yan are very much in love

315
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,460
and would never abandon each other in life or death.

316
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,020
This love is so ardent!

317
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:59,820
Like the blossoming Tangdi flowers, it moves me deeply and makes me envious.

318
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,880
I wish to fulfill this love with the highest intent.

319
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,840
As such strong feelings defy even the will of heaven,

320
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:09,420
Thus, I specially bestow a precious jade ruyi, hoping you a good marriage forever!" 
  ("Ruyi" means "as you wish". It is a ceremonial scepter symbolizing power, good fortune, and prosperity.) 

321
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,480
It seems the Princess of Valor

322
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,440
won't entangle herself with Young Master Han anymore, and will let you be together.

323
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,080
Sixth Miss.

324
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,350
Do you feel unwell?

325
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,004
No.

326
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,880
Why would Lai Luozhi do so?

327
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,320
Poisoning and then offering the antidote.

328
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,780
Why go around in such a roundabout way? What's the purpose behind it?

329
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,800
Perhaps his target is not your third sister,

330
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,760
but me.

331
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:25,420
He set a trap to make you owe him a favor?

332
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,400
What did he threaten you with? What did you promise him?

333
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:39,250
Don't worry, it's fine.

334
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,340
But your third sister...

335
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,860
has suffered this for nothing.

336
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:52,560
So the pursuit of justice

337
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,000
and the search for the truth

338
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,280
really bring the surrounding family unknown risks.

339
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,640
But the path we choose

340
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,840
is destined to be a tough road, isn't it?

341
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,940
Since we've decided, I won't regret it.

342
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,840
We must follow our hearts and give it our all to protect the people around us.

343
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:40,952
â™«  One look confirmed our fate  â™«

344
00:30:40,952 --> 00:30:44,829
â™«  Upon meeting again, I know you're the one for me  â™«

345
00:30:44,829 --> 00:30:49,657
â™«  Gazing at the stars, dreaming about old times  â™«

346
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,352
Sixth Miss.

347
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:55,640
â™«  Lovers before the candlelight, do not ask their thoughts  â™«

348
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,560
From now on, focus on doing what you think is right.

349
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:05,560
I will protect you and your family.

350
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,912
Shen Du.

351
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,196
â™«  Autumn moon and spring breeze, I only want you for my whole life  â™«

352
00:31:15,196 --> 00:31:17,000
â™«  The trace of your palm  â™«

353
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,751
â€‹â™«  Your gaze  â™«

354
00:31:19,751 --> 00:31:22,624
â™«  Our love is heating up  â™«

355
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:27,266
â™«  You are the only one for me  â™«

356
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,508
 Great Chief. 

357
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,860
What's the matter?

358
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,500
Do we escort Madam back home or go to the Imperial Guards?

359
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,420
- Shen Mansion. 
 - Yes.

360
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,480
Just now,

361
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,480
what did you want to ask me?

362
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,440
N-Nothing.

363
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,900
 Shen Du, you protect me, 

364
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,360
 help me, and support me. 

365
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,920
 In your heart, 

366
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,960
 what do you think of me? 

367
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,090
Youâ€¦

368
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,840
You can rest early. I have to review books.

369
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,548
Review books?

370
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,240
The examination for the female officials is approaching.

371
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,420
I've pledged before the Grand Empress Dowager and Madam Xu

372
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,600
that I will participate in the examination as a Senior Clerk.

373
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,580
If I fail, I won't even qualify to be a clerk.

374
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,960
Now that Third Sister's poison has been cured,

375
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,240
and the Chen Huo'e case has been settled,

376
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,300
it's a good time to review and study all night now.

377
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,360
So you moved all that stuff in and out tonight

378
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,700
just to borrow my light to study?

379
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:12,400
That's right! Donâ€™t you love brightness? I can save several lamps this way.

380
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:24,240
Then, I wish you success in your exams and may your wishes be fulfilled!

381
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,159
Thank you for your kind words!

382
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:54,400
It's rare for you to ask to meet me. What's wrong?

383
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,840
Well, thank you.

384
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,800
Third Miss Yan's poison has been resolved.

385
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:06,620
The prescription you gave me is genuine.

386
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:11,000
Of course, the prescription I gave you couldn't be fake.

387
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,520
I never lied to you.

388
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,344
You didâ€¦

389
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:28,780
All right, I'm the one who's been calling you Masked Man.

390
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:32,080
You didn't really lie to me.

391
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:37,420
Anyway, thank you.

392
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,244
Thank you?

393
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,720
That's it?

394
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,120
I'm afraid it's not enough.

395
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,840
Then what do you want?

396
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,720
You shouldn't ask me that.

397
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:57,700
You should be the one to think carefully about how you should thank me.

398
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:17,280
Lu Chuichui! Lu Chuichui!

399
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,930
I'm here.

400
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,220
Chuichui.

401
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:28,980
Chuichui! Chuichui, what's wrong?

402
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,160
Stickler!

403
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,790
Iâ€¦

404
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,470
Heâ€¦

405
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,520
I thoughtâ€¦

406
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,644
I thoughtâ€¦

407
00:36:45,644 --> 00:36:47,680
What happened?

408
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,860
Nothing. My feet are numb.

409
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,080
Your feet are numb? I was worried about you.

410
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,220
I thought something serious had happened to you.

411
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,420
Stickler! Stickler!

412
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,040
Can you take me home?

413
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,680
Come on, take it slow.

414
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,600
What are you doing?

415
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,260
Didn't you say your feet are numb? I'll carry you.

416
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,240
Stickler.

417
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,780
Well, if there is someone who is extremely cruel

418
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,480
and hated by everyone, but occasionally he also shows kindness

419
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,860
and helps others, is he a good person?

420
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,350
Is he worth making friends with?

421
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:50,120
You choose your friends by yourself.

422
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,020
You only need to ask your heart, not others.

423
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,120
If you think that person is a friend

424
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:00,420
and he is a good person, he will not hurt you.

425
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,100
Then he is worth making friends with.

426
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,900
Only ask my heart, not others?

427
00:38:40,348 --> 00:38:42,400
   

428
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,060
 Chi, 

429
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:22,260
 when you receive this letter, I am probably already participating 

430
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,220
 in the examination for the female officials of the Six Ministries. 

431
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,920
 This time, I have truly burned my boats, 

432
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,300
 staking my future as a female official of the Ministry of Justice. 

433
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:33,940
 I will not betray the trust that the Grand Empress Dowager and Madam Xu have placed in me. 

434
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:37,860
 Nor will I let down the help he has given me. 

435
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:59,871
   

436
00:39:59,871 --> 00:40:02,376
   

437
00:40:02,376 --> 00:40:05,016
   

438
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,680
Oh my, Sixth Miss! You rank at the top!

439
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,920
My Sixth Miss ranks first!

440
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,240
Oh my! That's wonderful, Sixth Miss!

441
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,440
You've finally been promoted to a Chief Clerk of the Ministry of Justice.

442
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,880
Iâ€™m about to have an eighth-rank friend to look after me!

443
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,160
What about you?

444
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,660
Me? I don't care.

445
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:30,380
After all, I have an eighth-rank friend. I don't care if I fail.

446
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:33,840
-  I'm so happy! 
  - Chuichui! Chuichui! 

447
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,740
You've made the list.

448
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,720
This time, I don't need to spend money to hire a teacher for you.

449
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,160
You are on the list entirely because of your knowledge!

450
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:47,560
Although you came last on the list, I am happy for you. 
    

451
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,780
    
 My precious girl!

452
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:53,260
Great Chief, Madam has been promoted to Chief Clerk of the Ministry of Justice.

453
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,020
Her official rank is now higher than mine.

454
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,140
Not convinced?

455
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,060
Not at all, Iâ€™m completely convinced!

456
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,372
Let's go!

457
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:16,360
Father, the transfer order makes no mention of the Yan family!

458
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,180
Did you look carefully?

459
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,080
I've checked line by line carefully.

460
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,600
In the transfer order personally signed by Prime Minister Zhang,

461
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,000
among the officials sent to the desert frontier, there is no Yan family.

462
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,260
Great! Thanks heavens!

463
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:36,740
My Yan family has finally escaped a disaster. Great!

464
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:41,920
Sixth Miss, today, our Yan family is truly experiencing double happiness!

465
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,560
Double happiness indeed!

466
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,880
Letâ€™s have a nice dinner tonight!

467
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:54,140
- Good! 
 - Good!

468
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,016
Mother!
