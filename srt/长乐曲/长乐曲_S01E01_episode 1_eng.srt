 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,956 --> 00:00:34,994
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:38,292
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:40,661
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:44,536
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,536 --> 00:00:47,671
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:50,936
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,936 --> 00:00:55,872
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,872 --> 00:01:02,144
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,144 --> 00:01:08,552
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,552 --> 00:01:14,831
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,831 --> 00:01:21,144
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,144 --> 00:01:29,288
â€‹â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:29,288 --> 00:01:37,222
   

16
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,230
   

17
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,791
   

18
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,520
 On your knees. 

19
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,800
 In the Fifth Year of the Yuanhe Era of Great Cang, Emperor Wenzong, Xiao Huan, 

20
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,960
   
 and the crown prince passed away in illness. 

21
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,580
 Xiao Qi, the Imperial Grandson still in swaddling clothes, ascended the throne, 

22
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,400
 signaling the start of the Shengli Era. 

23
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,760
 Empress Zhou Xu, who had long assisted in governing, 

24
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,099
 was honored as Grand Empress Dowager 

25
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,180
 and reigned over Great Cang from behind the curtain. 

26
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:19,440
 Long live Your Majesty! 

27
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,856
   

28
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:28,361
   

29
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,120
Reporting to Great Chief.

30
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,460
After interrogation, all suspects confessed

31
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,040
but has refused to divulge the mastermind.

32
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,640
Whiteâ€¦ White Ghost.

33
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,564
White Ghost. 
  (Also known as White Impermanence in Chinese folklore who guides the souls of the virtuous to hell.) 

34
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,677
   

35
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,480
I-I confess.

36
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,860
I only helped them transport people.

37
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,140
There's a buyer in Jiannan who wants 100 children as slaves.

38
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,192
Take him away.

39
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,920
Next time, don't wait for me to do it.

40
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,792
Understood. 
    

41
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,968
To the palace.

42
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,120
Mother, I heard that you were unwell, mourning for the Imperial Preceptor.

43
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,760
Thus, I have copied scriptures until dawn to pray for you. 
    

44
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,560
What a filial child.

45
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,000
I truly appreciate it. 
    

46
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,280
And you, Prime Minister Zhang, you've taught him well.

47
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,920
    
 I'm flattered.

48
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,260
Filial piety, loyalty, integrity, benevolence,

49
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:42,620
and magnanimity are in Prince Xian's nature. 
    

50
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,760
Minister Shen didn't come to the court meeting today.

51
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,780
Great Chief Shen is probably too busy making achievements 
    

52
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,200
to attend the court meeting. 
    

53
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:12,120
 Shen Du, Great Chief of Imperial Guards, has arrived. 

54
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,320
Grand Empress Dowager.

55
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,820
Minister Shen, please rise.

56
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,080
Reporting to Grand Empress Dowager.

57
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,880
The case of 100 missing children had me delayed.

58
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,960
All the suspects have confessed.

59
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,880
Pardon me for my late arrival.

60
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,880
This case has stirred up much panic in Xiang'an City.

61
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,360
I knew I did right by entrusting this case to you.

62
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,440
Minister Shen, what a coincidence.

63
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,380
Prime Minister Zhang has already asked me for rewards on your behalf.

64
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,660
Great Chief Shen has turned the tide so many times.

65
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,320
He is truly a role model for us all.

66
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,100
Thank you, Prime Minister Zhang.

67
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,640
I simply did my job. I do not need rewards.

68
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,960
Prime Minister Zhang never saw eye to eye with the Imperial Guards.

69
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,320
It looks like you've reconciled if I'm right.

70
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,372
Yong'an.

71
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,880
My apologies.

72
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,160
Seeing civil and military officials working together in harmony,

73
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,160
I feel truly blessed.

74
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,760
Minister Shen.

75
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,060
Today, I will bestow upon you a marriage.

76
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,192
What do you think?

77
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,100
 White Ghost has always acted wilfully. 

78
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,320
How did you know that he would agree to this assigned marriage?

79
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,200
Known as the White Ghost,

80
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,040
Shen Du may be fierce to others,

81
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,960
but he is just a minion

82
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,440
eagerly seeking promotion in front of the Grand Empress Dowager.

83
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,280
Was he worried that she might lose

84
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,020
her trust in him if he turned her down?

85
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:14,860
Even a ghost claiming lives has personal desires.

86
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,380
Sixth Missâ€¦

87
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,800
- Morning, Sixth Miss. 
 - Morning.

88
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,920
- Morning, Sixth Miss. 
 - Morning.

89
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,940
- Morning, Sixth Miss. 
 - Morning.

90
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,180
Clerk Yan, you're up so early.

91
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,440
Watch out.

92
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,280
I just set out the flower petals to dry.

93
00:08:45,012 --> 00:08:47,872
   

94
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,200
I'm sorry, Clerk Yan.

95
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,000
It's okay.

96
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,800
- Morning, Yan Xing. 
 - Morning.

97
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,340
- Morning. 
 - Morning, Sixth Miss.

98
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,777
- Morning. 
 - Morning.

99
00:09:08,777 --> 00:09:11,029
   

100
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,560
Didn't you have breakfast?

101
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,300
I'm speechless. You see that?

102
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,940
What can women do at the Ministry of Justice?

103
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,320
Madam Xu who works for Grand Empress Dowager would accuse you

104
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,820
of hindering her plan of cultivating female officials.

105
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,180
Why are you so talkative today? Don't you have work?

106
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,840
Get to work.

107
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,628
Archive these.

108
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,030
My Lord.

109
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,240
   

110
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,960
Yan Xing.

111
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,640
Bring the tea.

112
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,760
My Lord, today, the inspectors sent us a case that happened in Yangui Mountain.

113
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,620
It's said that a housewife saw a ghost and hanged herself.

114
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,920
My Lord, you know.

115
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,960
I have tons of trivial cases piling up.

116
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:37,000
My subordinates and I barely have time to eat, let alone to sleep.

117
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,160
I've been applying to the higher-ups for more staff.

118
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,160
Yeah.

119
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,360
We finally recruited a clerk two years ago,

120
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,136
and yetâ€¦

121
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,612
she's a woman.

122
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:59,040
Archive it directly once the inspectors finish the investigation.

123
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,480
Avoid unnecessary issues.

124
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,152
Understood.

125
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,920
 Yangui Mountain. 

126
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,200
 Suicide. 

127
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,780
There are no rules in Xiang'an City. We have to mourn even for a county magistrate.

128
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,660
The Imperial Preceptor passed away just a month ago.

129
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,700
Look at the decorations. They show no respect.

130
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,760
What do you know? The Imperial Preceptor could see fate. He evenâ€¦

131
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,060
He even predicted that the Grand Empress Dowager would be governing.

132
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,820
- Really? 
 - All the officials will pay respect to him today.

133
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,390
The Black Fiend is here.

134
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,660
Hurry.

135
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,500
Hide.

136
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:48,140
Who is that? Why is everyone panicking like they are seeing a ghost?

137
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,010
Don't you know the Black Fiend? 
  (A Buddhist character that represents the embodiment of evil.) 

138
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:53,100
He established the Imperial Inspectorate that tortures prisoners.

139
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,540
I heard that they have hundreds of torture devices.

140
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,470
Whoever enters complies.

141
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:00,700
Those who don't comply wish for death as a relief.

142
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,820
The White Ghost is here. The White Ghost is also here.

143
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,260
So this is the White Ghost.

144
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,380
The White Ghost is the Great Chief of the Imperial Guards.

145
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,620
The Imperial Guards report directly to the Grand Empress Dowager.

146
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,080
Investigation, surveillance, assassination. You name it.

147
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,980
Stop crying. The White Ghost is here.

148
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:20,920
His name dispels clouds in daylight and stops children's crying at night.

149
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,660
These two are running into each other. It's going to be a good show.

150
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,980
The road is only so wide. Who will yield?

151
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,880
Who knows? Lookâ€¦

152
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,744
Stop the carriage.

153
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,140
Great Chief Shen, you came after all.

154
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:47,620
I thought you were busy preparing for the wedding and couldn't make it.

155
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,980
How can my wedding be as important as state affairs?

156
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,680
Prime Minister Zhang proposed it. The Grand Empress Dowager approved of it.

157
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,420
It shows that your wedding is also a major event.

158
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:07,260
What a pity. Your previous brides lacked a bit of luck.

159
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,300
Please stop making fun of me.

160
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,000
To avoid missing the auspicious time, we'd better get going.

161
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,700
The west street is too narrow even for two entourages to pass by each other.

162
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,250
Tear down everything blocking the way so that our caravans can pass at the same time.

163
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:34,080
Tear down everything blocking the way so that our caravans can pass at the same time.

164
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,180
Great Chief.

165
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,832
Let's go.

166
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,640
 Shen Du. 

167
00:14:02,896 --> 00:14:05,263
   

168
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,688
You two have kept me waiting.

169
00:14:36,688 --> 00:14:39,680
- Prime Minister Zhang. 
 - Prime Minister Zhang, I'm late.

170
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,960
Not really. You're just on time.

171
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,960
Everyone, start the ceremony.

172
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,140
 The auspicious time has arrived. 

173
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,970
Thank you, Clerk Yan.

174
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:01,300
The real culprit was caught all thanks to you. 
    

175
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,460
Don't mention it. It's my job at the Ministry of Justice.

176
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:08,100
Oh, right! The other day, you asked us to find herbs that could detect poison.

177
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,620
I found out that they're available in the nearby mountains.

178
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,780
Why don't you come with us and gather them?

179
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,460
No need. Get back to work. I'll gather them myself.

180
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,360
Then I'll take my leave.

181
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,032
Take care.

182
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,840
Prime Minister Zhang, thank you for presiding over the sacrificial ceremony.

183
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,860
Great Cang will surely witness a peaceful and prosperous year as the Imperial Preceptor prophesied.

184
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:55,000
We held this ceremony on this auspicious day picked by Prince Xian

185
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,480
on behalf of the Grand Empress Dowager after he consulted with a folk diviner.

186
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,040
I simply followed orders and fulfilled my duty as a minister.

187
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,340
Great Cang is blessed with a noble emperor and wise ministers.

188
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,300
We're truly lucky to witness this golden age of peace and prosperity.

189
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,520
Indeed. Indeed.

190
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,456
Assassin!

191
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,776
Seal the mountain.

192
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:37,150
Sister.

193
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,840
Are you picking the leaves to make medicine?

194
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,800
No, I'll use them for autopsyâ€¦

195
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:51,440
Yeah. I'm using them to make herbal medicine. How do you know?

196
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,140
I can tell by the way you're dressed.

197
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,820
Are you a physician? 
    

198
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,720
You could say that.

199
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,540
Here, take it. I've picked enough.

200
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,239
Madam Zhang from the village fell ill. I came to pick some for her.

201
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:18,120
A doctor said that the tea made from it was useful.

202
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,700
- Let me pay for it. 
 - I don't want money.

203
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,160
I picked it in passing.

204
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,000
Thank you, then.

205
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,260
Sister, my name is Qi Yeyun. What's your name?

206
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,320
Are you going down the mountain? There's a shortcut. It's faster.

207
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,500
Stop there.

208
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,700
No one shall leave the mountain today.

209
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,520
What happened? I'm from the Ministry of Justiceâ€”  
 - Be quiet. Come with us.

210
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,340
Hurry up.

211
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,360
What is this all about?

212
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:59,780
Vice Minister Lai, here are the people in the mountains at the time of the incident.

213
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:10,180
Someone dared to attack a high official during the sacrificial ceremony at Ming Hall.

214
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,660
I was lucky enough to dodge the arrow.

215
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,900
Yet, I have lost a trusted subordinate.

216
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,400
Today, I will surely make the assassin pay.

217
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,740
 Assassin. 

218
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,340
 Who's the assassin? 

219
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,660
The assassin is among you.

220
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:30,740
I advise the assassin to confess now.

221
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,060
I can grant you an easy death.

222
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,280
You can't escape even if you don't confess.

223
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,500
If no one confesses before the incense burns out, everyone dies.

224
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,580
Hold on.

225
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:03,020
Vice Minister Lai, I am Yan Xing, a clerk from the Ministry of Justice. May I take a look at the body?

226
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,940
Perhaps I can find out who the assassin is.

227
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,644
Approved.

228
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,400
 It's evening now. The sun is in the west. 

229
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,800
 So the location for the shootingâ€¦ 

230
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:37,060
How's it going, little clerk? Can you tell me who the assassin is now?

231
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,240
I haven't found out who the assassin is.

232
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,900
But the assassin shot the arrow from afar.

233
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,740
The direct sunlight would have affected his aim.

234
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,240
So he must have shot the arrow with the sun on his back.

235
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:07,240
Judging from the trajectory, the best hiding spot would be in the trees.

236
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,880
In the forest on the northwest peak.

237
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,640
After the incident, you sealed the mountain right away.

238
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,020
So people from other mountain ranges couldn't be the assassin.

239
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:22,040
Vice Minister Lai, please kindly release those who can't be suspects.

240
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:27,140
I have made myself clear. I will release them if you find out who the assassin is.

241
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,920
You failed. Shoot them all.

242
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:39,280
Vice Minister Lai, I have a better idea.

243
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:08,420
Shooting the assassin is not enough to deter others.

244
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,400
I have raised a few fighting dogs, capable of tearing apart criminals.

245
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,340
Why not let my dogs have a try at it?

246
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,060
It may be a slow death, but...

247
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,420
it's more interesting.

248
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,520
I haven't lived up to my title as the "Black Fiend".

249
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:38,480
Now that I've learned your measures, I have no choice but to admit my inferiority.

250
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,660
Jing Lin.

251
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,860
Stay back.

252
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,108
Stop.

253
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,880
- Go away. 
 - Go away.

254
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,860
The assassin is among them.

255
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:43,280
The assassin must be strong and fast, and knows how to climb.

256
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:53,860
Vice Minister Lai, you can give these people a good disciplining.

257
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:59,480
Let me think. What kind of death suits them better?

258
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,820
Vice Minister Lai, please wait a little longer.

259
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,000
Give me some time and I will surely catch the assassin.

260
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,680
I swear with my life.

261
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:20,860
Great Chief Shen, how many hours should I give her?

262
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,960
Six hours.

263
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,860
In six hours, if you can't solve the case,

264
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,100
you shall perish with them.

265
00:23:36,162 --> 00:23:38,177
   

266
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,820
 Archers tend to have calluses on three parts of their hands. 

267
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:49,180
 This person only has calluses on the palm. Excluded. 

268
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,440
   

269
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,700
Great Chief, Lai Luozhi wanted to catch the assassin.

270
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:58,720
But he tossed the case and suspects to us and asked for execution with our fighting dogs.

271
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,760
Do you think he's up to something?

272
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:07,320
Isn't it obvious? He was sure that the clerk couldn't solve the case.

273
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,160
He didn't want to mess with the Ministry of Justice.

274
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:15,640
He didn't want to mess with them. Aren't you afraid of taking the blame?

275
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:23,300
I've been the son of a convicted official. What else could scare me?

276
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:29,640
 The assassin was located at the northwest peak of the mountain, which is covered with lacquer trees. 

277
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,820
 The lacquer tree branches gave some suspects blotches. 

278
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,560
 But none of them had any blotches when they were caught. 

279
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,040
 Those who developed severe blotches didn't hide among the lacquer trees. 

280
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,600
 The one in the middle. The mud on his shoes was not from the lacquer tree forest. Excluded. 

281
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,240
Find the murder weapon and we will convict the assassin.

282
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,340
 Why is it so bright? 

283
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,240
Any last words?

284
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:37,020
Time is almost up. You still haven't found the assassin.

285
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,880
Once we find the murder weapon in the lacquer tree forest, we canâ€”

286
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,260
Save it.

287
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,900
You're running out of time.

288
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:52,860
You may still fail even if you find the murder weapon. Am I right?

289
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,180
Should I give up just because I may fail?

290
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,580
You may fail yet you bet with your life.

291
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:03,600
You're either foolish or undervaluing yourself.

292
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,160
I'll write a will when the time comes.

293
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:17,240
Please deliver it to the Yan Mansion in the east of the city.

294
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,060
Take her away. See her off.

295
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,700
Understood.

296
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,524
Great Chief Shen.

297
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,840
You really don't recognize me?

298
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,480
Should I recognize you?

299
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,040
Great Chief, we found the murder weapon.

300
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:54,420
Just as Clerk Yan had guessed, it was buried under the fallen leaves.

301
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,860
It seems that you're quite lucky.

302
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,420
The murder weapon was found at the last moment.

303
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:06,920
Once I match the suspects' calluses to the weapon, I will determine who the assassin is.

304
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,260
It seems I am quite lucky today. It's just the right time.

305
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:20,180
Vice Minister Lai, I doubt you're here at the right time out of sheer luck.

306
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:26,040
The murder weapon was brought back from Yangui Mountain.

307
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:30,300
I bet you heard about it quite some time ago.

308
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,560
Six hours have passed. Clerk Yan, hurry up.

309
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:41,660
I can't wait to see who's audacious enough to come after me.

310
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:52,940
Both of you. Please grip the bow as you normally do.

311
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:09,260
I think I've found the assassin. The calluses on their hands are almost identical.

312
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,900
But the calluses from nocking the arrow are different.

313
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:19,460
One person has calluses on the inner side of the thumb,

314
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,480
which means he nocks the arrow with his thumb.

315
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,710
Any skilled archer knows that it's a slanted grip

316
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:28,200
with a low push, which results in less accurate shooting.

317
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,900
The other one has calluses on the purlicue.

318
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,540
Such a straight grip with a high push ensures precision.

319
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:38,960
Therefore, you are the assassin.

320
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,240
Stay put! Step back.

321
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,080
Stay back. Let me go, or I'll kill her.

322
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,620
Don't you know where you are? Do you think you can escape?

323
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:59,440
Name the mastermind. I might let you die with dignity.

324
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,620
Let her go.

325
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:09,840
Since we have evidence, we don't need a confession.

326
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,360
- Prepare to shoot him. 
 - A-Are you going to shoot her as well?

327
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,760
She is not an Imperial Guard.

328
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,360
She's just a lowly clerk without any official rank.

329
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,140
It's no big deal if she dies.

330
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:27,740
Shen Du! You heartless White Ghost. How can you be so cruel?

331
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,500
If you die here today, I will honor your loyalty to the nation.

332
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:40,140
As far as I know, the salary of a clerk is meager.

333
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:44,740
But the Ministry of Justice offers the highest compensation amongst the Six Ministries.

334
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,120
Consider it a tribute to your parents.

335
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,300
My spirit will haunt you forever.

336
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:58,240
What a coincidence. The thing I fear the least...

337
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:02,720
is an evil spirit coming for my life.

338
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:10,300
Don't move!

339
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,880
Thank you.

340
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,880
You are not that dumb.

341
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,180
Since there's no way out, all right.

342
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,480
Confess. Who sent you to kill me?

343
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,356
It wasâ€¦

344
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,000
It was him.

345
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:09,240
Great Chief Shen, no wonder you were eager to kill him. Impressive.

346
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:14,540
Vice Minister Lai, isn't it ridiculous to fall for the nonsense made up by a dying criminal?

347
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:18,180
How dare you talk to our Vice Minister like that?

348
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,520
Please think twice, Vice Minister Lai. If Great Chief Shen sent the assassin,

349
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:32,060
why would he make the arrest and look for the murder weapon instead of killing the assassin?

350
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:38,020
I was just kidding. How could I believe you would want to kill me?

351
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,160
Don't take it seriously.

352
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,296
I never...

353
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,460
took it seriously.

354
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:55,160
Now that the assassin is dead, I can rest assured.

355
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,060
I have no reason to stay.

356
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,056
I'll take my leave.

357
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:21,780
 I failed to watch the suspect. I deserve to be punished. 

358
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,120
Forget it. He's dead.

359
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,290
You guys.

360
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:36,360
Take Clerk Yan and the rest of them...

361
00:32:37,264 --> 00:32:39,960
- out there. 
  - Yes, sir! 

362
00:33:03,804 --> 00:33:07,000
Great Chief, that clerk has been staring at you.

363
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,120
She's not afraid of you.

364
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,180
What's so fancy about that?

365
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:14,080
Don't you know that Xiang'an is full of dull women?

366
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,800
True. Your look certainly attracts some lustful and fearless women.

367
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,760
No more nonsense or I'll send you to serve at the Imperial Inspectorate.

368
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,540
Please don't. I want to work here for the rest of my life.

369
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:32,120
Now I get it. Your fiance, Third Miss Yan, is the daughter of Academician Yan.

370
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,500
So this Sixth Miss Yan will be your sister-in-law.

371
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,760
She seems to have some brains.

372
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,820
She knew I did that to save her.

373
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,200
Whether we'll be in-laws

374
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:51,660
depends on whether her elder sister has the courage to marry me.

375
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,540
Whatâ€¦

376
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,600
Thank you for saving us, Clerk Yan.

377
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,880
Please rise.

378
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,420
I serve in the Ministry of Justice. This is my job.

379
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,700
If not for Clerk Yan's godlike ability to solve the case,

380
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,980
we would have been killed.

381
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,420
It's getting late. Hurry up and go home.

382
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,600
Thank you, Clerk Yan.

383
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,188
Let's go.

384
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,656
Sister.

385
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,880
I saw how you solved the case.

386
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:31,080
You were wise, brave, and composed. And you saved me.

387
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,780
Get up.

388
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,779
Therefore, I'd like to learn from you.

389
00:34:34,779 --> 00:34:36,910
Please don't turn me down.

390
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,920
I am just a minor clerk without a title. How can I accept disciples?

391
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:46,619
Besides, your parents wouldn't allow you to learn from a woman.

392
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:50,200
I'm an orphan. The people on the Yangui Mountain brought me up.

393
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,120
I'm free to pick anyone as my master.

394
00:34:54,588 --> 00:34:55,980
   

395
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,780
But you are not the disciple she wants. Kiddo.

396
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:05,080
Sister, is it true?

397
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,160
Hop on, Sixth Miss.

398
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,740
See you.

399
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,560
How did you know I was with the Imperial Guards?

400
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,900
That nosy little fellow from my family's shop told me about it.

401
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,340
He said his cousin's classmate's cousin's cousin-in-law

402
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:30,360
saw a few villagers and a female clerk in the Yangui Mountain

403
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,240
getting arrested by the Imperial Guards.

404
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,640
A clerk and a female.

405
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,140
Who else could it be?

406
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:42,140
It seems that your fellow would work better at the Ministry of Justice than you.

407
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,680
I was so anxious when I heard about it.

408
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,000
Thankfully, I heard you were working on the case.

409
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,720
Then I felt reassured.

410
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,660
Is there any case you can't solve in this world?

411
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:58,940
Besides, don't you have an acquaintance there?

412
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,280
No way.

413
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,140
Shen Du still hasn't recognized you?

414
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,240
Did he go blind?

415
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:23,200
Never mind, I'll take you home first.

416
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,800
I'm not going home. Just take me to the Ministry of Justice.

417
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,480
Ministry of Justice?

418
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,200
Sixth Miss Yan.

419
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,160
I must sign up for the female official's assessment tomorrow.

420
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,600
Women from Xiang'an City want to be elegant ladies

421
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,940
well-known far and wide like your third sister.

422
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,860
Only you wish to become a female official.

423
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:46,580
You are already a female official. I can't be left too far behind.

424
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:51,840
Rest assured, I will become a female official of the Ministry of Justice this year.

425
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,180
Turn right to the Ministry of Justice.

426
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,440
The assassin you sent committed suicide on the spot.

427
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,740
In that case, the two major powers will confront each other.

428
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:09,300
Have you figured out about the prophecy given by the Imperial Preceptor before he died?

429
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,420
It is said that apart from our nation witnessing great leadership,

430
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,320
and a peaceful and prosperous year, there was something else.

431
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,440
But no one could tell what it was.

432
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,060
It seems that no one knows.

433
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,960
On the night the Imperial Preceptor died,

434
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,540
both the White Ghost and the Black Fiend were at Ming Hall.

435
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,013
They are truly unpredictable.

436
00:37:32,013 --> 00:37:35,000
   

437
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,240
What happened?

438
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,000
I am Sixth Miss Yan. Let me in.

439
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,360
By the heavenly decree, here comes the edict.

440
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:55,020
Miss Yan is widely praised for her talents in art, literacy, and handicrafts.

441
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,820
With knowledge of the past and present,

442
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:01,340
- her reputation as a virtuous lady is unmatched in Xiang'an. 
 - Mother.

443
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,700
I am delighted to hear that.

444
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:08,160
Now, Shen Du, the Great Chief of the Imperial Guards, is at the age to get married.

445
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,360
Only a virtuous woman can be his match.

446
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,120
It happens that Miss Yan is still single,

447
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,360
who is a perfect match for Shen Du.

448
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:20,120
Therefore, I bestow on them a grand wedding in three days.

449
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,036
Respect this!

450
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:27,180
Academician Yan, accept the decree.

451
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,240
 Shen Du? 

452
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,800
Thank you, Grand Empress Dowager. 
    

453
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,080
Thank you, sir.

454
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,420
Congratulations, Academician Yan.

455
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:45,220
You've raised a talented and virtuous lady renowned in Xiang'an. 
    

456
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,260
My dear Caiwei.

457
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,660
We can't marry her off.

458
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:03,580
A young lady's marriage has always been at the behest of her parents and the matchmaker.

459
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:07,900
Moreover, this is a marriage bestowed by the Grand Empress Dowager.

460
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,840
But that's the White Ghost.

461
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,920
If Caiwei marries him,

462
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:17,000
how can she ever live in peace?

463
00:39:21,142 --> 00:39:23,540
   

464
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,760
This is so unpredictable.

465
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,760
It's completely out of my imagination.

466
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,000
What a tragedy.

467
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,340
Mother, why are you staring at me?

468
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:57,700
People say that great wisdom appears stupid.

469
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,560
Perhaps you're the best illustration.

470
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,580
I always feel that I lack ability and status,

471
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:10,320
rendering you a concubine's unappreciated daughter.

472
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,860
So I always want you to learn from your sister and adopt the manners of a lady.

473
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:19,540
Then you can marry into a good family to secure a promising future.

474
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,680
Mother, you know I don't want that.

475
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,910
Yeah, I used to be so mad,

476
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:29,020
blaming you for being foolish, ignorant, and uneducated.

477
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:35,480
But now I suddenly feel that it's fine to be ignorant and uneducated.

478
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:39,160
It's quite good to be ignorant and uneducated.

479
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,700
Mother, I'm not ignorant and uneducated.

480
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,380
Think about it.

481
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:48,000
Among all the women in Xiang'an City,

482
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,900
why did the Grand Empress Dowager choose your third sister?

483
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,320
It's because of her exceptional talents.

484
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,300
The madame has been teaching her music and painting, poetry, and songs.

485
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,940
She is proficient in everything.

486
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:06,850
Who would have thought that she'd marry the White Ghost

487
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:09,740
and jump into the fire?

488
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:13,180
Mother, Shen Du is the Great Chief of the Imperial Guards.

489
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,200
He's not as bad as you say.

490
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:23,820
So you think that Madame and your third sister are making a fuss and putting on a show?

491
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:28,400
Anyway, if she manages to marry him,

492
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:34,800
she will be so tormented that she'll wish for her death.

493
