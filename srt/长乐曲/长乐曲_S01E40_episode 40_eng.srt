 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,956
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:34,956 --> 00:00:38,254
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,254 --> 00:00:40,623
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:44,498
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,498 --> 00:00:47,633
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:50,798
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,798 --> 00:00:55,934
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,934 --> 00:01:02,106
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,106 --> 00:01:08,514
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,514 --> 00:01:14,893
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,893 --> 00:01:21,106
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful,

14
00:01:21,106 --> 00:01:29,150
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:37,184
   

16
00:01:37,184 --> 00:01:40,580
   

17
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,020
Mother Empress, I beg you

18
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,060
to punish Zhang Xingwei according to the law.

19
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,160
But please consider his past merits

20
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,360
and deal with the members of the Zhang family with some leniency.

21
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,720
Grand Empress Dowager,

22
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,340
the Zhang family has served as Prime Minister for three generations.

23
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,520
They have contributed to Great Cang.

24
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:29,460
One person's mistake should not implicate an entire innocent family.

25
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,000
Minister Shen, do you really think so?

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,100
I know well the suffering of being in detention.

27
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,980
I only hope...

28
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,500
the truth can be cleared.

29
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,380
 The eighth year of the Shengli Era, 

30
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,980
 Prime Minister Zhang Xingwei 
   

31
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,640
 was given poisoned wine to kill himself. 

32
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,760
 Prince Xian, Xiao Zhong, volunteered to defend the borders 

33
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,100
 and won't return for ten years. 

34
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,200
 The Jinxiu Workshop case was overturned and the injustice redressed. 

35
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,400
 Shen Bingzhu's alleged treason was re-examined. 

36
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,640
 Officials of the Zhou family were all prosecuted. 

37
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,300
 The relatives of the Zhou family were demoted and sent back to their hometown, 

38
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,720
 and forever barred from entering Xiang'an. 

39
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,980
 The Shen family's slandered name was finally cleared. 

40
00:04:10,858 --> 00:04:14,133
   

41
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,281
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

42
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:35,300
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

43
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,950
Father.

44
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,820
Mother.

45
00:05:40,823 --> 00:05:43,780
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

46
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,816
I finally did it.

47
00:05:45,816 --> 00:05:48,940
   

48
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:58,531
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

49
00:05:58,531 --> 00:06:04,839
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

50
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:11,118
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

51
00:06:11,118 --> 00:06:18,393
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

52
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,560
 By heavenly decree, here comes the edict. 

53
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,480
 The case of former Minister Shen, Shen Bingzhu, collaborating with the enemy 

54
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,320
 was actually an unjust case. 

55
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,200
 The loyalty of the Shen family is witnessed by everyone. 

56
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,080
 A monument of loyalty and courage is now specially bestowed. 

57
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,120
   
 The Shen family's deceased can be buried with honor. 

58
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,100
 All related family members shall be treated with privilege. 

59
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,560
 Uncle Shen, do you see it? 

60
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,020
 He finally cleared the Shen family's name. 

61
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,540
Smart.

62
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,248
Good.

63
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,900
Mother Empress, I know my mistake.

64
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,620
I beg Mother Empress to punish me.

65
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:10,120
If I wanted to punish you, I'd have done it long ago.

66
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,328
Yong'an,

67
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,590
I don't punish you,

68
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,520
not because of the relationship between mother and daughter,

69
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,120
but because you only funded the local soldiers,

70
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,920
which does no harm to Great Cang or the state.

71
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,200
But if you dare to harbor a hint of rebellious intentâ€¦

72
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,019
I would never dare.

73
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:39,240
I have already surrendered all my private assets to the national treasury.

74
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,079
My life is also at your disposal.

75
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:49,520
Rise. Such a mistake must not be made again.

76
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,180
I will keep this in mind.

77
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,440
Yong'an, do you think funding the local area

78
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,600
with some provisions, would win the people's hearts?

79
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,460
The so-called people's hearts cannot be bought.

80
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:19,480
Now that your royal brother is defending the borders and you are here in Xiang'an,

81
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,600
you should perhaps do something for Great Cang.

82
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,460
I don't have to tell you more. Right?

83
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:32,320
I will surely do my utmost to assist His Majesty sincerely.

84
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,780
Good that you understand.

85
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:41,380
As it is said, the rise of governance lies in following the will of the people.

86
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:46,380
The fall of governance lies in going against the people's hearts.

87
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,380
When the people abhor toil and worry, I provide them leisure and joy.

88
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,800
When the people detest poverty and lowliness, I enrich and elevate them.

89
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,780
Go ahead, speak.

90
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,120
When the people fear danger and downfall, I ensure their safety.

91
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,700
When the people dread extinction, I nurture and multiply them.

92
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,760
Good! Very good!

93
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,360
Qi'er has finally spoken up! Qi'er!

94
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,020
Your Majesty has grown up. Finally.

95
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,960
You have started to speak. Good.

96
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,560
Aunt, hurry up! Come here!

97
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,460
His Majesty has spoken.

98
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,160
Runing.

99
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,940
I pay my respect, Grand Empress Dowager.

100
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,600
Rise, rise now. This is a family gathering.

101
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,980
No need for formalities.

102
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:54,260
The lily sachet you sent to me, I have accepted it.

103
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,760
I just prefer the sachet of night-blooming jasmine.

104
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,652
Runing,

105
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,540
you didn't return it this time.

106
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,350
You are giving me face.

107
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,240
I've taken note of it.

108
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,740
I will gift you the night-blooming jasmine sachet.

109
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,920
By heavenly decree, here comes the edict. 
    

110
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,220
"I have heard that Yan Xing, the Chief Director of the Ministry of Justice,

111
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,240
possesses both virtue and talent, has solved many strange cases.

112
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,700
Hereby is specially promoted to the Director of the Ministry of Justice.

113
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,540
Granting her the plaque inscribed by my own hand of Expert Detective

114
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,280
    
 to display her achievements."

115
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,220
Respect this!

116
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,920
Thank you, Your Majesty, for your great kindness.

117
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,520
Director Yan, please rise.

118
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,840
We were delivering the imperial decree around Xiang'an City for quite a while.

119
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,740
We went to the Shen Mansion.

120
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,090
Unexpectedly, you are here in your maternal home.

121
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,670
Thank you for your efforts.

122
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,600
Hot tea has been prepared. Please come in.

123
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,900
I must rush back to the palace to report, so I won't disturb you any further.

124
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,900
Thank you. Please.

125
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,900
Sixth Daughter, you are truly capable. A raise in salary?

126
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,500
   

127
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,580
What a glory to the family!

128
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,210
What a glory!

129
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,240
What a glory!

130
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,860
This is the first plaque personally written by His Majesty since he assumed the throne.

131
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,340
Really?

132
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:57,300
After I died, I could meet my ancestors with pride.

133
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,740
Father, why would you say such things?

134
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:10,100
Although I really want to keep this plaque in the Yan Mansion,

135
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,660
in a few days, you should still take this plaque back to the Shen Mansion.

136
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,760
Now that you are married, staying at your parental home all the time is quite inappropriate.

137
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,140
Father, I have already divorced Shen Du.

138
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,820
There's no reason to return to the Shen Mansion.

139
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,340
Father, do you want to drive me out?

140
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,400
Look. Why would I possibly mean that?

141
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,670
You are just having a quarrel.

142
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,540
It's easy to get over; argue then reconcile.

143
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:43,340
You can't just stay here and not solve it. Right?

144
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,560
Look.

145
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,720
After she has become the director, her temper has grown even bigger.

146
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:02,862
   

147
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,960
My Lord, congratulations!

148
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,260
Your salary has increased again.

149
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,420
I don't really care.

150
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,920
- Right, right. 
 - Mere material possessions.

151
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:32,760
As an official, I do not seek fame or profit,

152
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:39,440
but to cultivate myself, harmonize the family, and govern the nation.

153
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,100
Yes, yes, you are right.

154
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,220
But then again, the reason you received the reward this time

155
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,700
is that you were acting righteously.

156
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,620
Right? Look.

157
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:56,640
Back then, Great Chief and Director Yan were deep in peril,

158
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,780
all others shunned to avoid it.

159
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:05,440
Only you bravely stepped out and offered help.

160
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,560
I truly admire you. Really! My Lord.

161
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,120
Xiao Feng, do you know why this is?

162
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,640
I don't know.

163
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,620
I have been an official for twenty years.

164
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,120
The most valuable experience isâ€¦

165
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,820
What is it?

166
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,440
Please tell me.

167
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,300
Burning a cold stove.

168
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,280
How to burn the cold stove? When?

169
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,060
That's all knowledge.

170
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,680
- Burning a cold stove? 
 - Xiao Feng.

171
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,860
Qi Yeyun, constable of the Ministry of Justice, is here to report for duty.

172
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,780
- Yeyun? 
 - Correct.

173
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:02,920
I am the head of the Constable Department, Feng Gui.

174
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,280
Come on, everyone. Drop everything you're doing.

175
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,580
Come over and meet the new guy. Hurry.

176
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,940
Hurry.

177
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:18,380
Well, we all warmly welcome you

178
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:22,420
to join us, the Constable Department.

179
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,500
- Welcome, welcome. 
 - Welcome, welcome.

180
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,680
Burning a cold stove.

181
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,280
All right, all right, get to your business.

182
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,460
This Qi Yeyun calls Great Chief brother-in-law.

183
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:37,160
It's certainly a hot stove. No need to burn at all.

184
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,606
You have a long way to go.

185
00:16:39,606 --> 00:16:42,584
   

186
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,820
- Very well. 
 - Comfortable, Father?

187
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:52,020
Comfortable. My girl is massaging my back, of course, it's comfortable.

188
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,240
Father, well, this worker is working hard. Right?

189
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,460
Of course. It's good.

190
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:07,239
Girl, our pawnshop can never keep a worker for long.

191
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:12,040
Luckily, we have such a diligent son-in-law.

192
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,980
Langxing, come, sit down, and rest for a bit. Have some tea.

193
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,140
It's all right, I can continue working. I'm not tired.

194
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:26,659
Langxing, I think you're missing a set of golden armor.

195
00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:29,440
I'll order a set for you.

196
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,420
No, no need.

197
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:35,520
You already gave me a golden cap last time. I really don't need it.

198
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,730
Just accept it. Let me tell you.

199
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:41,320
Golden armor suits you best.

200
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,500
Wellâ€¦ It's too valuable.

201
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,780
I really can't accept it.

202
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,850
Do you want it or not?

203
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,020
Yes.

204
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,000
Right. Just accept whatever my father gives you.

205
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,130
My girl is right. You must accept whatever an elder gives.

206
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:03,740
My girl is right. You must accept whatever an elder gives.

207
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,680
Exactly.

208
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,616
Yes.

209
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,040
I-I'm going to get back to work.

210
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:26,360
Grand Empress Dowager, the reconstruction of Ming Hall has been completed.

211
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,500
The melody composed by Music Minister Jin for Ming Hall's reconstruction

212
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,240
only needs the ending to be completed.

213
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,360
I have already asked the palace musicians to complete the final section of the melody.

214
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,120
Grand Empress Dowager, please appreciate it.

215
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:41,840
Good, I trust you and most at ease.

216
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,600
This piece is only lacking a title.

217
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,020
I'm not talented enough. Please grant it a title, Grand Empress Dowager.

218
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:54,560
All things prepared, it's a golden age.

219
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,820
Let's name it the Melody of Golden Age.

220
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:04,680
I think, when Ming Hall reopens,

221
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:09,440
I wish to invite the civilians of Xiang'an to visit inside,

222
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:15,680
to share the joy, and enjoy the Melody of Golden Age.

223
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,500
   

224
00:19:50,784 --> 00:19:55,828
   

225
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,840
Great Chief, Sixth Miss said since you're divorced, don't disturb her anymore.

226
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,040
Great Chief, please return.

227
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,076
I take my leave.

228
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:42,760
Great Chief, this is the ninth time you've been turned back.

229
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,060
- I thinkâ€¦ 
 - I thinkâ€¦

230
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,340
this gift isn't good enough, not enough to move her.

231
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:54,020
Sixth Sister, this is already the ninth time.

232
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,980
Great Chief has shown great sincerity.

233
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,100
Don't be mad at him. Go back home.

234
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,760
Yes. Sixth Daughter, he is the Great Chief and stays all day outside our house.

235
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,680
With people coming and going, it doesn't look decent.

236
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,720
Just show some mercy.

237
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:17,400
Mother. Third Sister. Why do you all speak for him?

238
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,240
It's he who wanted the divorce,

239
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,840
I simply fulfilled his wish.

240
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,280
Besides, I didn't ask him to stay outside the house all day.

241
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,200
Wait! Where are you going?

242
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,020
To eat. I'm hungry, Mother.

243
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:40,100
Then I'll go and make you the meal. Take it easy. Be careful.

244
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,608
Jing Lin.

245
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,880
Let's go buy some more.

246
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,550
   

247
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,940
Really?

248
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,960
Everyone in the Xiang'an City knows about it.

249
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,720
Great Chief Shen has been turned away nine times.

250
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,960
Yet he still went for the tenth time.

251
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,240
It's really funny.

252
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,000
Isn't this Great Chief Shen?

253
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,840
Nowadays, White Ghost is always giving gifts in vain.

254
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,240
Can this tenth attempt to woo his wife succeed? 
    

255
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,100
They have bought quite a few gifts, and they're rather expensive.

256
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,480
- This time it should be fine. 
 - Great Chief.

257
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,180
I've bought the latest ear ornaments and hairpins.

258
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,160
- Take this. 
 - Iâ€¦

259
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,040
I really can't carry any more.

260
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,280
Why don't you get more people to carry it?

261
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,080
We are not short of people.

262
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,760
You don't understand.

263
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,880
The less people know about this, the better.

264
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,340
Everyone in the entire Xiang'an City knows about it.

265
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,740
- No one knows about it. 
 - We support you, Great Chief!

266
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,960
Get the girl back soon.

267
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,960
- No one knows about it. 
 - We support you.

268
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,380
Great Chief, we support you.

269
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,200
That's good.

270
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,520
All the men of Xiang'an City must take him as a warning.

271
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:11,160
They have to know they must not offend their wives.

272
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,780
Grand Empress Dowager, Director Yan is here.

273
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,120
Please invite her in.

274
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,820
Yes.

275
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,016
She's here.

276
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:36,120
Greetings, Grand Empress Dowager.

277
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,060
Rise and speak.

278
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,280
Come closer.

279
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,280
Today, I summoned you to the palace.

280
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,200
Firstly, the festival is coming soon.

281
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,340
Madam Xu and I want to have a casual chat with you.

282
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:09,820
Secondly, there is good news for you.

283
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,920
Grand Empress Dowager has already issued an imperial decree,

284
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,020
ordering to reform the system of taking official positions through family lineage

285
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,920
to select officials based on their merits.

286
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,440
Regardless of background,

287
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,440
everyone can have an equal opportunity to pursue honor and distinction

288
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,480
and serve the country.

289
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,320
All the scholars from humble backgrounds

290
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,960
will surely be grateful to you for your appreciation of talent

291
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,560
and will study diligently to serve the country.

292
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,330
   

293
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,020
Turn around.

294
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,400
Move on. Next one.

295
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,016
Raise your hand.

296
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,360
Move on.

297
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,036
Turn around.

298
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,530
Good.

299
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,920
Pan Chi.

300
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,340
It really is you.

301
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,280
What's wrong?

302
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,600
Can't I take the exam?

303
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,280
Of course, you can.

304
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,680
Here, we welcome candidates from all over the world.

305
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,520
But I heard that

306
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,120
someone is not interested in becoming an official.

307
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,220
Indeed, one will become like the one he always hangs out with.

308
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:29,820
You're starting to sound more and more like Lu Chuichui.

309
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,800
Are you saying Chuichui is bad?

310
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,220
- You said that. 
 - You!

311
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,680
I'm not interested in being an official.

312
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,800
I just have to prove myself with this exam,

313
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:45,280
and check whether your exam is truly fair or not.

314
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:50,160
All right, then take the exam

315
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,240
and check carefully.

316
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,040
There's something I have long wished to do.

317
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:02,200
It's something that's been inconvenient to do for a long time.

318
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,760
In my heart, I have never forgotten Chen Baiyi.

319
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,120
On behalf of Chen Baiyi and scholars from humble backgrounds,

320
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,680
I extend thanks to you.

321
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,760
Director Yan,

322
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,280
you always think of others.

323
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,000
Maybe you should think more of your own.

324
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,760
Me?

325
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,440
What do you mean?

326
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,740
See. I give the scholars the chance to take the exam.

327
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,640
What about you?

328
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,640
Do you think you could give a chance

329
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,720
to someone around you?

330
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,600
There is a saying, "Cherish the one around you."

331
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,140
Wake up. I am here.

332
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,560
Mother.

333
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,080
Why do you wake me up early in the morning?

334
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,380
Today is my day off.

335
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,440
Get up and get dressed.

336
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,720
Otherwise, we'll be late for the ceremony.

337
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,080
What ceremony?

338
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,680
Come in and put the stuff well.

339
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,960
Be careful.

340
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,320
Yes, yes.

341
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,520
Third Miss, take it easy.

342
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,440
Put all the things over there.

343
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,040
Yes.

344
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,040
Be quick.

345
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,880
Be careful, don't bump or knock anything.

346
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,760
Be careful, put them down gently.

347
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,550
Mother.

348
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,420
What's the matter?

349
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,900
Well, I went to the ancestral hall to consult our ancestors

350
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,400
and went to the temple to find the priestess.

351
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,940
They all said that you got married

352
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,340
without the proper ceremonies,

353
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,320
and somehow got divorced.

354
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,700
This is a great disrespect and a serious taboo.

355
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,520
You've deceived the ancestors and the Matchmaker God.

356
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,240
In the future, you will encounter tribulations.

357
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,520
Mother, so you mean, even the gods won't allow me to divorce?

358
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,920
No, no.

359
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,040
I have figured it out.

360
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,920
If you want to divorce, then do it.

361
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,420
But the tribulations must be solved.

362
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,360
The only way to solve them

363
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:51,020
is to go through the entire wedding ceremony properly.

364
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,880
After registering it to the gods,

365
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,060
then you can formally get a divorce.

366
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,920
Yes, Sixth Sister.

367
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,460
I also asked the priestess.

368
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,200
The tribulations aren't only bad for you,

369
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,280
but also bad for the Yan family.

370
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,780
I am also a bit scared.

371
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,800
Yes, Sixth Sister.

372
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,920
Look. Third Sister is still pregnant.

373
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,600
It's better to believe it.

374
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,760
Rather than take it lightly.

375
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,830
   

376
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,840
 One should always be with the one he loves. 

377
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,300
 Treating each other with mutual respect and valuing each other. 

378
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,120
 This is what makes a lifetime happy. 

379
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,760
 From now on, 

380
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,280
 you won't be alone anymore. 

381
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,500
 I will definitely try to help you find out the truth. 

382
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,840
 This virtuous lady... 

383
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,760
 is me. 

384
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,380
 With your ability, you want to flirt with me? 

385
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,040
Bridal snatch.

386
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,600
Can it really work?

387
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,070
Yes.

388
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:49,420
   

389
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,100
What are you doing? They're about to get married.

390
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,480
Who said to give my bestie

391
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,200
a grand wedding full of sincerity?

392
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,204
Changed your mind?

393
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,760
Of course not.

394
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,640
I'm just afraid of getting scolded by her.

395
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,260
How can you be more rigid than Stickler Jiang?

396
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,480
What's there to be afraid of?

397
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,440
You should be afraid of being abandoned.

398
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,440
Great Chief, to marry a woman,

399
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,820
you should have the courage to do it and never give up.

400
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,080
Great Chief.

401
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,360
Congratulations, Great Chief.

402
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,100
My wife said, although Sixth Sister was reluctant,

403
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,880
she still sat down to do her makeup.

404
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,040
Great Chief, don't you still understand?

405
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,000
Madam is so clever.

406
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,040
Can she not see that today is a trap?

407
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,920
Since she can sit down to do her makeup, it means she accepts it.

408
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,280
Exactly.

409
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:01,360
Even the dignified Great Chief falls short compared to the Imperial Guard Jing.

410
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,500
Great Chief, attack.

411
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,456
Go.

412
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,360
Sixth Miss, I have come to take you home.

413
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:51,010
Final credits

414
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:56,020
Final credits

415
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:00,990
Final credits

416
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:05,970
Final credits

417
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:11,070
Final credits

418
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:15,940
Final credits

419
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:21,000
Final credits

420
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,940
Final credits

421
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,120
All right, take a look.

422
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,660
So pretty.

423
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,720
My girl is really pretty.

424
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,080
Beautiful.

425
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,360
Truly as beautiful as a flower.

426
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,840
I really can't get enough.

427
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,440
You are so much like me.

428
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,500
Mother, enough.

429
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,280
Guys, have you figured out the answer

430
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,360
to the first riddle of the lantern?

431
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:18,819
A line of white egrets soars into the blue sky.

432
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,280
 Congratulations. You got the last riddle correctly. 

433
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,840
 Luckily, you had me, Lu Chuichui. 

434
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,460
Otherwise, relying on you blockheads, you would never get it right.

435
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,600
Yes, yes. Chuichui is right.

436
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,080
Our Yan family is a scholarly clan.

437
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,480
To marry a woman from our Yan family as a wife,

438
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,360
you must have outstanding talent.

439
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,780
The next challenge requires composing a good poem

440
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,860
to express your genuine feelings.

441
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,040
It seems that Great Chief has reached the second challenge.

442
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,820
The poem challenge is not that easy to pass.

443
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,200
Day by day, sick with wine in front of the flowers.

444
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,080
Not minding you're getting old in the mirror.

445
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,960
Seeing the sky at dawn and the clouds at dusk.

446
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,280
I miss you while walking.

447
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,440
I miss you while sitting.

448
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,840
Standing alone on a bridge, sleeves filled with wind.

449
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,320
After people return under the new moon.

450
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,920
 Enjoyments and pleasures, with whom to share. 

451
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,360
 Fortunate to know you, 

452
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,480
 so we can cross and return. 

453
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,760
 Thank you for arriving in time. 

454
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,440
 Your ears are all red from the cold. 

455
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,240
 What are you doing? 

456
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,800
 I just want others to see how close we are. 

457
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,500
Sixth Daughter, I think you should go out there.

458
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,000
I can't stand hearing

459
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,280
these crooked poems composed by Great Chief Shen anymore.

460
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,240
Yes, Sixth Miss, don't let him recite any more poems.

461
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,880
We are all of this age,

462
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,440
and can't stand being tormented.

463
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,760
 Good poem, brilliant. 

464
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,400
 You've passed. 

465
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,760
Please, Great Chief.

466
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,480
This is the final challenge.

467
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,800
It's a martial contest.

468
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,120
If you want to marry my sister,

469
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,280
you have to beat both of us first.

470
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,940
Otherwise, don't even think about taking my sister away.

471
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,060
Great Chief, this challenge is in the bag.

472
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,180
Don't move! What are you doing?

473
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,300
Great Chief, go.

474
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,160
This is completely cheating.

475
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,560
Let Fifth Brother and a child compete in a martial contest.

476
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:34,780
- Does this count as a challenge? 
 -Then I'll compete dancing with him?

477
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,440
 - You've lost.  
 - What?

478
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,210
They...

479
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,360
can win against Shen Du?

480
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,680
I think he lost on purpose.

481
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,120
Oh no, Sixth Sister! Shen Du has lost, and left despondently.

482
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:12,690
   

483
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,640
Shen Du.

484
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,040
You are still here?

485
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,240
My wife is here.

486
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,520
Where can I go?

487
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,240
Well, well, Shen Du.

488
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,960
You put on a show to lie to me.

489
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,044

490
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,360
I am a dull husband,

491
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,800
can't woo such a smart wife properly.

492
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,760
So I had to do some tricks.

493
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,320
Don't blame me.

494
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,860
Don't let it happen again.

495
00:40:09,846 --> 00:40:14,814
â™«  The night is still long and the moonlight shines in the west window  â™«

496
00:40:14,814 --> 00:40:19,356
â™«  Starlight is hidden in your eyes  â™«

497
00:40:19,356 --> 00:40:25,796
â™«  With one touch, my heart flutters like the shadow of a candle, swaying and trembling  â™«

498
00:40:25,796 --> 00:40:30,651
â™«  The more one cares, the deeper it's concealed  â™«

499
00:40:30,651 --> 00:40:36,176
â™«  Leaves fall and turn yellow, with a thousand lines of yearning  â™«

500
00:40:36,176 --> 00:40:40,900
â™«  Years pass like stanzas of poetry, romantic yet sad  â™«

501
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:46,487
â™«  Two hearts collide between dawn and dusk  â™«

â™«  Embraces come unexpectedly  â™«

503
00:40:52,243 --> 00:40:55,176
â™«  I want to be with you, shadows become a pair  â™«

504
00:40:55,176 --> 00:40:59,172
â™«  I want to hold you, staying by my side  â™«

505
00:40:59,172 --> 00:41:03,157
â™«  Passing through the obstruction of a storm  â™«

506
00:41:03,157 --> 00:41:05,859
â™«  I want to be your moonlight  â™«

507
00:41:05,859 --> 00:41:09,810
â™«  To accompany you to every dawn  â™«

508
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:16,483
â™«  How I wish I could just forget the length of time  â™«

509
00:41:16,483 --> 00:41:19,099
â™«  I want to be with you, shadows become a pair  â™«

510
00:41:19,099 --> 00:41:23,271
â™«  I want to be with you, never forgetting each other  â™«

511
00:41:23,271 --> 00:41:27,156
â™«  There is always a place where the clouds and the sea meet  â™«

512
00:41:27,156 --> 00:41:29,993
â™«  I want to accompany you forever  â™«

513
00:41:29,993 --> 00:41:33,828
â™«  I will wait until my black hair turns grey  â™«

514
00:41:33,828 --> 00:41:42,988
â™«  In this life, I will only keep you in my heart  â™«

515
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,240
May you have a baby soon.

516
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,440
May you be a happily married couple.

517
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:24,000
My Wife, shall we go home?

518
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,384
Let's go home.
