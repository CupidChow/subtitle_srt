00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,950
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,994
♫  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  ♫

4
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:38,292
♫  The past hides blood and tears  ♫

5
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:40,661
♫  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  ♫

6
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:44,536
♫  The truth cannot be fully revealed  ♫

7
00:00:44,536 --> 00:00:47,671
♫  Fate is full of twists and turns  ♫

8
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:50,836
♫  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  ♫

9
00:00:50,836 --> 00:00:55,972
♫  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  ♫

10
00:00:55,972 --> 00:01:02,244
♫  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  ♫

11
00:01:02,244 --> 00:01:08,552
♫  At least you share my joy and sorrow  ♫

12
00:01:08,552 --> 00:01:14,831
♫  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  ♫

13
00:01:14,831 --> 00:01:21,244
♫  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  ♫

14
00:01:21,244 --> 00:01:28,988
♫  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  ♫

15
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:37,222
   

16
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,500
   

17
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,096
   

18
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,520
Sixth Sister is married.

19
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,850
And Third Sister is about to get married soon.

20
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:06,020
My Fourth Daughter, you refuse to go home with your husband so resolutely.

21
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:09,160
What are you going to do here at your maiden home?

22
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,720
My husband asks me to go home simply because he wants me

23
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,980
to live my desolate life that appears splendid for the reputation of the two families.

24
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,180
How is it any different from before?

25
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,160
Why can't I be like Sixth Sister and focus on studying to pursue a career path?

26
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,520
Even if I'm only an embroideress, I'll be making a living on my own.

27
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,760
But a divorced woman will inevitably be judged.

28
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,300
The reputation of our Yan family will be tarnished.

29
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,260
Even your sisters will be looked down upon by their husbands because of you.

30
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:49,220
Father, I grew up listening to you emphasizing the reputation of the Yan family.

31
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,040
The Yan family's reputation is indeed important.

32
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,520
But the price is too high if we have to sacrifice Fourth Sister's happiness.

33
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,440
Our family has gone through so much these days.

34
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,400
It wasn't our reputation that got us over these troubles.

35
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,660
Wife, please take a seat.

36
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,580
Father, Young Master Han surely won't look down on me because Fourth Sister gets divorced.

37
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,300
Nor would Great Chief look down on Sixth Sister for this.

38
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,640
As long as we don't belittle Fourth Sister, who would look down on her?

39
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,580
Caiwei is right.

40
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,740
My Lord, we've finally settled down

41
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:38,020
and managed to live a peaceful life in Xiang'an.

42
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:43,740
Why should we make the children suffer just for our reputation?

43
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,860
When a girl grows up, she’s beyond her father’s control.

44
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,840
As for the future,

45
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,180
you can decide for yourself.

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Thank you, Father.

47
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,800
 - Welcome, Jinzang! 
 - Academician Yan. 

48
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,590
 Please come inside. Please come inside. 

49
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,260
Here's a small gift.

50
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,760
- Academician Yan, Congratulations! 
 - Please come in.

51
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,030
- Please come in.  
 - Come on in.

52
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,540
Come, let’s sit inside.

53
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,320
 - Sixth Daughter. Your Younger Uncle!  
 - Younger Uncle!

54
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,530
 Minister Zhang! 

55
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,540
Please come in.

56
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,160
- Minister Zhang, please take the seat of honor. 
 - That's wrong!

57
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,236
Shiyuan.

58
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,410
- I'm here just to… 
 - You should sit on the groom's side.

59
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,180
That's right! The groom's side! The groom's side!

60
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,880
- That's right. 
 - Of course, the groom's side.

61
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,240
Why isn't the wedding starting?

62
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,960
Sixth Miss, did your father really agree to Fourth Miss's divorce?

63
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,640
This time, he actually values his child over his reputation.

64
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,800
That's good.

65
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,960
When it's your turn to get divorced, your father will be used to it.

66
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,380
Me?

67
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,620
Your three-month deal with the White Ghost is almost up.

68
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,820
Why are you reluctant to get ready?

69
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,820
White Ghost won't make things hard for you. Right?

70
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,180
Why hasn't he come yet?

71
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,200
Vice Minister Lai. Please come inside.

72
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,440
The wedding is starting without the guests?

73
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,300
How can we start without you?

74
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,160
What's wrong? I serve in the court together with Academician Yan and you.

75
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,160
You are welcome here, but I'm not?

76
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:13,000
Besides, when Third Miss Yan was dying from the poison of Chen Huo'e,

77
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,750
I provided her with the antidote.

78
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,680
I basically saved her life.

79
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,790
Why can't I come to her wedding...

80
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,900
for a cup of wine?

81
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,452
You want a cup of wine?

82
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,200
Naturally, we will serve you.

83
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,540
Great Chief Shen. Vice Minister Lai.

84
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,470
I apologize for the inadequate reception.

85
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,076
Today is...

86
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,360
my younger brother's wedding.

87
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,540
I am truly grateful to have both of you here.

88
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:14,310
Why don't we get seated first and catch up later? What do you think?

89
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,556
That's enough.

90
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,400
I brought the wedding gift and won't disturb you any further.

91
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,659
Great Chief Shen, I take my leave.

92
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,000
Thank you for coming to my daughter's wedding today.

93
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,780
Your presence lights up this humble abode!

94
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,320
That's right.

95
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,020
- Please be seated. 
 - Take your seats.

96
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,260
Please.

97
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,660
 The auspicious moment is upon us. 

98
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,560
   

99
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,400
Good.

100
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,620
Prime Minister Zhang didn't bother my father with the civil officer appointment.

101
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,320
Was it because you helped?

102
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,940
No.

103
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,592
Really?

104
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,936
Thank you.

105
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,200
Urgent report from Gannandao!

106
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,940
Urgent report from Gannandao!

107
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,660
Grand Empress Dowager, an urgent report from Gannandao.

108
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,860
Gannandao?

109
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,320
Yingzhou Governor Mo Qianzhi submitted a memorial,

110
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,500
stating that there have been cases of cannibalism committed by a "Half-faced Demon".

111
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,100
What?

112
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,560
They say the Half-faced Demon acts when the victim is unconscious

113
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,680
and eats only one part of the human body at a time.

114
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,940
The victims wake up, finding themselves missing some limbs.

115
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,990
This is absurd.

116
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:03,080
In this transparent and harmonious world, how can this calamity be tolerated?

117
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,220
At first glance, it's truly terrifying.

118
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,840
But if we think about it, it shares some striking resemblance

119
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,920
with the Chen Huo'e case.

120
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,280
It's a fraud revolving around supernatural powers.

121
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,910
May Your Majesty's wisdom be the judge.

122
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,880
Rumors abound only when the truth is not clear.

123
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,720
I believe the top priority is to send someone capable to Gannandao as soon as possible

124
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,110
to assist Mo Qianzhi in unraveling the truth and quelling the rumors.

125
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,400
Wan'er,

126
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,240
who do you think

127
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,260
is the most suitable for this job?

128
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:44,660
Perhaps Your Majesty has already made the decision in your heart.

129
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,412
Clever girl.

130
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,400
Grand Empress Dowager, they have arrived.

131
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,700
- I, Shen Du, pay my respects, Your Majesty. 
 - I, Yan Xing, pay my respects, Your Majesty.

132
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,380
Great Chief Shen.

133
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:34,921
   

134
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,780
Minister Shen, do you see?

135
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:45,820
Someone is trying to induce chaos in Gannandao

136
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,100
with this case.

137
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:54,960
I remember that you once had some connections

138
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,860
with the Yinzhou Governor Mo Qianzhi.

139
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:01,620
Thus, I am sending you and your wife

140
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,380
to Gannandao to look into this case

141
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,580
of the cannibal Half-faced Demon.

142
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,080
I humbly receive the command.

143
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,760
Please stay, Chief Clerk Yan.

144
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:35,080
Give the brocade robe to Chief Clerk Yan.

145
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,808
Come up.

146
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,940
Considering that you two are newlyweds and are soon to be sent to Gannandao for official duties,

147
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,580
Grand Empress Dowager has specially prepared some brocade robes for you to choose from to protect against the wind.

148
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,820
This is…

149
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:06,100
This is a confidential decree from the Empress Dowager for you. Open it and have a look.

150
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:19,636
   

151
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:27,140
Chief Clerk Yan, I remember I once asked you

152
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,780
what reward you would like.

153
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,740
 I only ask that Grand Empress Dowager, from now on, 

154
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,140
 please address me as Clerk Yan instead of Madam Shen. 

155
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,920
You don't wish to bear the title of Madam Shen

156
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,420
and aspire to be a female officer of the Ministry of Justice.

157
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,240
The task I entrust to you today

158
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,040
is for you to fulfill the duties of a female officer

159
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:57,400
to work for the Ministry of Justice and me.

160
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,600
Chief Clerk Yan, do you understand?

161
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

162
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,040
I accept the imperial decree.

163
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,770
   

164
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:24,340
 Many supernatural cases have occurred in Gannandao. 

165
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:29,300
 I fear that the Yingzhou Governor Mo Qianzhi may have harbored ulterior motives. 

166
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,480
 I order you to secretly investigate and observe his actions, 

167
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,080
 and confirm whether he has accomplices in the court. 

168
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,840
 Once the red-feathered gray pigeon arrives, the message can be delivered. 

169
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:51,380
 Did the Empress Dowager issue this secret decree because she suspects 

170
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,560
 no one but Shen Du? 

171
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:59,660
 Did she assign this job solely to me because she knew that our marriage is a sham 

172
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,320
 or was she trying to test me? 

173
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,800
Why are you smiling?

174
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,040
The brocade tribute from Shazhou features exquisite embroidery.

175
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:17,479
I am laughing at you because you spent hours there and ended up picking this.

176
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,179
You have truly let down the Empress Dowager's kind intentions.

177
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:23,440
Such embroidery patterns can be seen everywhere in Xiang'an.

178
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,320
The Empress Dowager awarded it to me. What matters is that I like it.

179
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,100
I actually find this embroidery delicate and graceful.

180
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,660
Only the complicated ones are tacky and gaudy.

181
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:37,520
Forget it. As long as you like it since it's a reward to you.

182
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,920
 If Mo Qianzhi indeed harbors ulterior motives, 

183
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,500
 what should he do then? 

184
00:17:55,844 --> 00:17:58,633
   

185
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,760
I knew my disciple wouldn't

186
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,400
invite me for tea without a reason.

187
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,240
It turns out that you want to ask me about Yingzhou Governor Mo Qianzhi.

188
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,940
You should ask your husband about him.

189
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,600
It's quite a reach to ask me when the answer's close at hand.

190
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,740
Why?

191
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,160
Mo Qianzhi was once the prized student and close disciple

192
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:34,140
of Shen Du's father, Shen Bingzhu.

193
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,420
No wonder.

194
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,200
So they're old acquaintances.

195
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,320
Not just acquaintances.

196
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,320
Mo Qianzhi was a talent of great potential and a promising career path.

197
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,560
Until later, when the Shen family committed a grave crime,

198
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,820
he risked his life to plead their innocence before the emperor,

199
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:55,640
and even fought to save Shen Du from execution, sending him instead to the detention center.

200
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,520
As for himself, he was exiled to the frontier,

201
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,640
with no hope for promotion ever again.

202
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,660
What a pity. What a pity.

203
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,640
I'm afraid you came to me today

204
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,560
because Mo Qianzhi is involved in some cases. Right?

205
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:24,340
You should remember that I may have retired,

206
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:29,820
but my ability to see through people remains unchanged.

207
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,640
You're worried that if you look into him,

208
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,060
it will implicate another person who's close to you.

209
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,180
Am I right?

210
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:51,420
Master, I still have a lot to learn.

211
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:57,480
Whoever wants to be a proper investigator has to go through what you are undergoing.

212
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,540
No matter how trivial the detail or how close the suspect is to you,

213
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,500
do not be afraid to doubt them.

214
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,960
Be brave and seek verification.

215
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:13,380
Trust could also be a drive for investigation.

216
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,200
All right. I've told you everything.

217
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,200
Brew me another pot of good tea, will you?

218
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,060
All right, Master.

219
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,620
That's more like it.

220
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,128
All right then.

221
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,940
Shen Du is going to Gannandao?

222
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,000
- Those things in Yingzhou… 
 - Rest assured, My Lord.

223
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,640
Everything has been taken care of.

224
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,920
If Shen Du is going, let him go.

225
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,080
But he could be lifting a stone to hit his foot.

226
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,480
My Lord, the letter from Lintai disappeared.

227
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,860
What? The letter is gone?

228
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:06,300
I have looked into it. The letter is nowhere to be found.

229
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,860
Besides, the letter disappeared during the Hongwen School examination

230
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,380
after Shen Du was appointed the Guard of the Capital.

231
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,200
Very good, Shen Du.

232
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,240
Are you really going to overturn the ruling on the old case

233
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,440
concerning your family?

234
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,620
Hurry up. Speed up.

235
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,380
I have prepared everything you asked for.

236
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,980
There were a few items I couldn't find.

237
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:38,400
But I managed to find them at my father's pawnshop.

238
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,960
Would Uncle Lu let me have them?

239
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,620
Of course, I am his beloved daughter. He would certainly agree.

240
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,420
Right, Marshal Xu said he had a mission and couldn't see you off.

241
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,500
He told me to remind you to keep the token he gave you.

242
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,740
If you ever run into trouble, seek help from the local inspectors.

243
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,880
Right, I almost forgot.

244
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:03,420
Your pen pal Chi's letter came to the Ministry of Justice.

245
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,064
Take a look.

246
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,420
Chi says that she's on her way to Yingzhou.

247
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:19,620
Then I can bring her all the gifts this time.

248
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,820
Master, all the rare items you wanted are here.

249
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,680
Am I not impressive?

250
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,160
Well, let's hit the road then.

251
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,460
- Travel safe. 
 - Master. Take care, Master.

252
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,640
What are these rare treasures for?

253
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,760
It's for a friend.

254
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,620
All this trouble for a friend?

255
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,360
We have only one cart.

256
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,180
The load capacity is limited.

257
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,360
We're traveling light.

258
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,340
Leave behind...

259
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,880
the unnecessary items.

260
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,920
Great Chief, don't worry about the load.

261
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,400
I just asked for two carts.

262
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,700
Madam can carry as much luggage as she pleases.

263
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,560
This is a business trip,

264
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,680
not a tourist one.

265
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,540
Necessities only.

266
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,700
These are all necessities.

267
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,480
 My Sixth Daughter! 

268
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,500
Great Chief.

269
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:50,180
Sixth Daughter, I brought you something.

270
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:53,500
This is medicine for sprains. Cured meat. Salted fish.

271
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,140
- And your third sister and your father— 
 - Mother…

272
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,120
We only have one cart and the load is limited.

273
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,220
Necessities only.

274
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,600
You don't have carts?

275
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,860
Your father has one. They can bring it over now.

276
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,732
No need.

277
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,000
- Jing Lin. 
 - Yes.

278
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,520
Where is the second cart?

279
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,360
I-It should be arriving soon. I'll go check.

280
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,840
Let's go.

281
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,360
I thought only one cart was allowed.

282
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,440
The Great Chief says yes when he means no, and no when he means yes.

283
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,120
I told you this is not an easy job.

284
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,810
Hurry up.

285
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,320
My Sixth Daughter, it's your first trip away from home, and the frontier is harsh and cold.

286
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,920
Be careful in everything you do.

287
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:43,800
If you run into trouble, don't act tough. What matters is to stay alive.

288
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,920
Mother, I am going to solve a case. It's not like going to war.

289
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,620
Take good care of yourself.

290
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:56,200
Also, tell Father to try to avoid the strife at court.

291
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,340
No matter what, wait for us to return.

292
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,480
Write me letters if anything happens.

293
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,040
I got it.

294
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,080
Don't worry about anything at home.

295
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,300
On the other hand, we can't help you if anything happens to you.

296
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,980
You must help each other out.

297
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,240
Mother-in-law, rest assured.

298
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,780
I will take good care of my wife.

299
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,428
Good to know.

300
00:25:27,454 --> 00:25:31,052
   

301
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,976
You woke up.

302
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:06,700
I thought that, given how deeply you were sleeping, you could sleep all the way to Yingzhou.

303
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:11,080
I-I didn't sleep well last night.

304
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,760
I'm not usually like this.

305
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,200
 The scenery outside of Xiang'an is indeed different. 

306
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,120
Madam, what's wrong?

307
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,580
Nothing, I'm just looking at the scenery.

308
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,560
May I read it?

309
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,256
Stop the carriage.

310
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,680
Keep watch around and turn your backs.

311
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,264
Understood.

312
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,480
Tell me whenever you feel unwell.

313
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,680
Thank you.

314
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:10,440
I'm worried that you might throw up in the carriage and dirty it.

315
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,540
I'll be careful.

316
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,280
But your people are so poor at handling the carriage,

317
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,100
going left and right all along.

318
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,620
We've been followed ever since we left the city.

319
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:32,320
How do we shake off the tails if we don't change lanes swiftly?

320
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,160
 There are scouts. 

321
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,200
 North and west of the forest. 

322
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,340
 Change lanes now. 

323
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,240
 Understood. 

324
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,380
I didn't expect that we'd be followed by so many people.

325
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:55,860
The trip to Yingzhou is likely not going to be that simple.

326
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,560
The Imperial Guards and the carriage convoy will proceed along the original route.

327
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:45,040
Make sure you shake off all tails and join us in Shanyang City.

328
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:56,929
   

329
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:31,960
Remember what I said. No one should disturb them.

330
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,740
Rest assured.

331
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,320
Great Chief. Madam. The room is ready.

332
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,460
You can rest in your room after eating.

333
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,800
Jing Lin.

334
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,960
Hasn't the luggage arrived?

335
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,360
Madam.

336
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,320
The luggage cart will arrive in about an hour.

337
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:20,720
Great Chief, Madam has packed her luggage with the medicinal ingredients for your diet.

338
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:27,340
Are you saying that those big boxes she brought were filled with medicinal ingredients?

339
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,840
That's right. Those are ingredients Madam collected from various places.

340
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:36,120
Madam deliberately didn't tell you, probably because she knew you don't eat medicinal cuisine.

341
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,760
Who's there?

342
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,516
Come here.

343
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,040
Master, help.

344
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,360
Help, Master.

345
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,508
Qi Yeyun.

346
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,420
Thankfully, you came out.

347
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,980
Otherwise, he would have strangled me.

348
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,064
Let me see.

349
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:51,100
Shen Du, why are you so harsh on a kid?

350
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,560
What kind of kid sneaks around outside someone's room in the dead of night?

351
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,700
He's definitely up to something.

352
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,220
Weren't you also pacing back and forth outside someone's room in the dead of night?

353
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,400
The sound of your footsteps kept me awake.

354
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,840
Were you also up to something?

355
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,460
I ate too much at night and was trying to digest.

356
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,064
Jing Lin.

357
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,000
You shook off the tails?

358
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,740
Even the kid followed us here.

359
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,560
It's my negligence!

360
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,560
I didn't follow you all the way.

361
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,660
I just followed you to the outskirts of the city

362
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:32,910
and sneaked into the carriage while no one was in it.

363
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:37,140
I hid in the carved cabinet under the seat and ended up here.

364
00:34:39,259 --> 00:34:41,920
Master, am I qualified to be your disciple?

365
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,339
I want to learn your skills and become an expert in investigation like you.

366
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:47,480
Master, please take me in.

367
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,719
Stop.

368
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,760
Don't call me "Master". Call me sister instead.

369
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,760
We need to discuss it properly.

370
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,240
Since you've followed us here, you might as well stay

371
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,160
and come back with us to Xiang'an.

372
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,480
Thank you, Sister.

373
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,560
Jing Lin, are there any spare rooms left?

374
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,760
Yes, I'll arrange for it.

375
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,080
Imperial Guard Jing, who permitted you to do that?

376
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,850
You're right.

377
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,040
We were both commissioned to work on the case by the Empress Dowager.

378
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,020
Can't I even get a room for a staff member?

379
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,600
Brother-in-law, I don't need a room.

380
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,540
As long as you take me in, I’m fine with staying in a woodshed and sleeping on the floor.

381
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,840
What…

382
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,280
did you just call me?

383
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,840
Brother-in-law.

384
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,260
Sister wouldn't let me call her master.

385
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,040
I should call her "sister".

386
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,020
Since I'm calling her that, I should call you brother-in-law.

387
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,060
Isn't that right?

388
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,000
If you don't like that,

389
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,920
I can call you Great Chief Shen or Master Shen.

390
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,280
I don't like any of them.

391
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,560
This is a business trip.

392
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,520
Irrelevant people can't tag along.

393
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,780
You're too frail to handle any heavy work.

394
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,480
- Jing Lin. 
 - Yes.

395
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,180
I shall drive him out right away.

396
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:32,440
Who told you to drive him out?

397
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,000
From now on, he will stay with you.

398
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,200
From now on, he will stay with you.

399
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,400
- What— 
 - Train him a bit to make him useful.

400
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,400
- Huh? 
 - What do you mean by "huh"?

401
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,120
Is it so difficult to look after a kid?

402
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,120
Yes, Great Chief.

403
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,620
After you, kid.

404
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,440
Brother-in-law, no.

405
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,480
I don't want to be trained!

406
00:37:07,232 --> 00:37:09,144
   

407
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:23,690
   

408
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,180
How come there's no one in the prefectural office during the day?

409
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,800
Great Chief has arrived.

410
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,580
Is there no one on duty at the Yíngzhōu Prefecture?

411
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,160
I, Bi Qiu, Commandant of Yingzhou, greet Great Chief Shen and Chief Clerk Yan!

412
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,320
I was unaware of your arrival, and I apologize for the lack of proper reception. 
    

413
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,840
It's fine. Where is Governor Mo?

414
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,040
Replying to Great Chief. He's out for work.

415
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,660
I have already sent someone to call for him. He will be here soon.

416
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,620
 Governor Mo has arrived. 

417
00:37:59,328 --> 00:38:01,360
   

418
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,120
I am Mo Qianzhi.

419
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:07,460
I apologize for the lack of proper welcome and any offenses caused.

420
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,800
Governor Mo, were you handling a case just now and came into contact with a corpse?

421
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,520
How do you know?

422
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:25,000
People who deal with corpses inevitably get the scent of death.

423
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,280
You must be the renowned Chief Clerk Yan from Xiang'an.

424
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,000
You are such a keen observer.

425
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,520
I truly admire you.

426
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,040
Xiang'an is quite far from Yingzhou.

427
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,960
And you're a young lady.

428
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,420
You must have endured much hardship on the way.

429
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,200
Thank you for your concern, Governor Mo.

430
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,100
It was a smooth journey without much hardship.

431
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:54,860
Senior Brother, how have you been lately?

432
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:58,580
Great Chief Shen, you flatter me.

433
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,560
Apologies for my negligence.

434
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,960
Cases have been piling up these days.

435
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,640
I haven't had time to prepare a welcome banquet for you.

436
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,880
For the sake of the people, let’s start the investigation today,

437
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,460
solve the case as soon as possible, and bring peace to the people.

438
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,920
What do you think?

439
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,320
That's inappropriate.

440
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,960
Great Chief came all the way here.

441
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,840
Even if there's no feast, you should prepare some tea to welcome him.

442
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,280
But you prepared nothing.

443
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,240
Aren't you being disrespectful to Great Chief?

444
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,196
It's fine.

445
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,680
I came here to work on a case, not to sightsee.

446
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:52,380
We can return early if we solve the case fast.

447
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,220
Jing Lin,

448
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,320
take A'Yun for a quick meal.

449
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,950
I'll work on the case with Chief Clerk Yan.

450
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,120
Understood.

451
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,816
Imperial Guard Jing, please follow me.

452
00:40:13,885 --> 00:40:16,560
   

453
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,800
Great Chief, here is the case file.

454
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,440
This is a headless corpse. Don't get scared.

455
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,980
She's quite bold.

456
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,940
Don't underestimate my wife.

457
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,640
The deceased is Li Kaixiang.

458
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,440
The suspect is his younger brother, Li Kairui.

459
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,240
They started arguing after a few drinks.

460
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,340
The younger brother passed out drunk

461
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:51,060
and woke up only to find his elder brother decapitated and the head still hasn't been found.

462
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,320
Any clues?

463
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,500
Judging from the coagulated blood,

464
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:03,440
the victim should have been alive when he was decapitated.

465
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,920
He was decapitated alive?

466
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,040
It seems like there are only two possibilities.

467
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:17,140
One is that the victim was unconscious and it was a quick death.

468
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:21,100
The other is that the murderer is an expert

469
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:25,040
who fought the victim and cut off his head during the fight.

470
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:29,080
But I examined the body and found no bruises whatsoever.

471
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,020
The coroner found no internal injuries either.

472
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,700
So the second possibility is ruled out.

473
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,800
What a brilliant analysis.

474
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,320
Great minds think alike.

475
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,820
No wonder you're the top female investigator of the Ministry of Justice.

476
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,780
Pan?

477
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,780
What are you doing here?

478
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,280
Chief Clerk Yan, long time no see!

479
