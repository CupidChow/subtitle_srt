00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,980
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,026
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:35,026 --> 00:00:38,224
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,224 --> 00:00:40,593
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,593 --> 00:00:44,568
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,568 --> 00:00:47,603
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,603 --> 00:00:50,868
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,868 --> 00:00:55,904
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,904 --> 00:01:02,276
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,276 --> 00:01:08,584
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,584 --> 00:01:14,863
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,863 --> 00:01:21,176
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,176 --> 00:01:29,020
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:37,254
   

16
00:01:37,254 --> 00:01:40,289
   

17
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,136
How come...

18
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,340
you've forgotten me so quickly?

19
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,740
Chen Huo'e?

20
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,720
I don't care who you are impersonating. Don't play tricks here.

21
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,920
Before I take action, I suggest you hand over the antidote to me.

22
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,920
Otherwise, I don't mind killing Chen Huo'e again.

23
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,080
Anyone who has fought me even just once,

24
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,140
no matter how much time has passed, I can always recognize them.

25
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,920
Chen Huo'e has fought with me several times.

26
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,480
So no matter how hard you try to hide your style of fighting,

27
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,580
it's all in vain.

28
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,980
The fake will always be fake.

29
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,920
It's just a pity that there is only one bottle of antidote.

30
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,380
I wonder if you dare to take it.

31
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,560
For the people, you will truly risk your own life.

32
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:34,140
I have no interest in taking the lives of those lowly people.

33
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,940
The antidote is real.

34
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,640
Of course. Your target has always been only me.

35
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,040
What other tricks do you have? Play it all at once.

36
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,740
The poison on that porcelain bottle

37
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,260
should be enough for you to enjoy for a good while.

38
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,680
This poison will travel with the blood,

39
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,780
circulate and spread throughout your entire body.

40
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:15,920
Then, your body will become extremely stiff.

41
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,679
Eventually, you will become like a breathing tree.

42
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,480
You are really troublesome.

43
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,700
Wouldn't it be nice for you to just die here quietly?

44
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,090
The grandmaster of the Huo'e Sect, your real leader,

45
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,180
is that person in the royal court. Right?

46
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,060
You have been impersonating Chen Huo'e and playing tricks everywhere,

47
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,380
constantly changing identities to expand your power.

48
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,480
It's not just for the sake of establishing a Huo'e Sect in Yingzhou...

49
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,960
but to covet the whole of Great Cang.

50
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,320
Great Chief Shen, the more you know,

51
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,700
the quicker you will die.

52
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,560
My only mission this time

53
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,580
is to annihilate you, Shen Du, and your entire entourage in one fell swoop.

54
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,060
Now you are already in my grasp.

55
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,980
I wonder...

56
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,840
who will be the next one.

57
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,100
 Great Chief! 

58
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,944
 Shen Du! 

59
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,260
Then I'll just pick one myself.

60
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,004
Shen Du!

61
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,620
Shen Du.

62
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,424
Great Chief.

63
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,812
Great Chief!

64
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,160
Shen Du.

65
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,700
Shen Du.

66
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,480
Shen Du.

67
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,840
Shen Du.

68
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,040
Shen Du.

69
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,400
Shen Du.

70
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,460
Shen Du.

71
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,388
Shen Du.

72
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,712
 Shen Du! 

73
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,732
 Shen Du! 

74
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,640
The Great Chief seems to have been inflicted with a strange poison.

75
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,520
- Is there an antidote? 
 - My medical skills are limited.

76
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,340
I cannot tell what poison it is.

77
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,740
You cannot tell what poison it is?

78
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,720
The townspeople who took the antidote brought back by the Great Chief have shown improvements.

79
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,680
However, the Great Chiefâ€¦

80
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,859
These vile tricksters keep inventing inexplicable poisons to harm others.

81
00:08:35,859 --> 00:08:39,080
- I must uproot their den. 
 - Saving him is the priority.

82
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,320
But I have already searched Guangchun Clinic and Mo Mansion thoroughly.

83
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,980
I found nothing related to the poison.

84
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,580
All that's left is to turn over the places the Huo'e Sect has been and examine them all.

85
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,820
Chen Huo'e is treacherous and cunning.

86
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,420
She would not place the antidote in an obvious location.

87
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,852
The Great Chief is cured?

88
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,960
Acupuncture to seal acupoints. It's just a temporary measure.

89
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,240
I can't think of other ways now

90
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,520
to slow down the stiffening of his body.

91
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,120
If no antidote can be found, I'm afraid heâ€¦

92
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,880
The poison in Shen Du is not a poison from the Central Plains.

93
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,480
I have translated books from the Western Region.

94
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,020
I discovered the tricks of the Huo'e Sect

95
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:21,560
were very similar to the sacred arts of the Jinwu Tribe as told in legends.

96
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,220
Then let's go seek medical advice and medicine now.

97
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,440
We must not.

98
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,860
Years ago, the Jinwu Tribe suddenly cut off all contact with Great Cang.

99
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,380
They have shown great resistance towards the people from Great Cang.

100
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,130
Going there rashly will not only fail to save him

101
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,060
but might also trap us there.

102
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,880
Then what should we do?

103
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,620
If I remember correctly, I am the one among us who knows the Western Region best.

104
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,540
I shall go and retrieve the antidote.

105
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,100
I'll go too.

106
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,580
You need to stay here and watch.

107
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,780
Shen Du risked his own life to protect the people of Yingzhou.

108
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:01,960
You should also protect him and even more so, take good care of Madam Shen.

109
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,700
Fortunately, we are not far from the Jinwu Tribe.

110
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,400
Before I return, do nothing.

111
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:20,260
Thank you, Young Master Pan. We will repay your great kindness someday.

112
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,150
Be careful on your way.

113
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,684
Wait for my return.

114
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,255
   

115
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,460
Sir, I have something good on me. Take a look.

116
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,080
Who are you?

117
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,560
I told you there was something good for you to take a glimpse at.

118
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,580
People from Great Cang are indeed cunning.

119
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:52,246
â™«  May you also look up to see the brilliant stars and moon  â™«

120
00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:03,024
â™«  Among countless others, I've found only you  â™«

121
00:13:03,024 --> 00:13:07,718
â™«  Time is fleeting and fate is shallow  â™«

122
00:13:07,718 --> 00:13:13,248
â™«  The winter in warm memories  â™«

123
00:13:13,248 --> 00:13:17,504
â™«  Never mind the destined solitary fate  â™«

124
00:13:17,504 --> 00:13:22,220
â™«  Blazing a lifetime of magnificence  â™«

125
00:13:23,476 --> 00:13:27,911
â™«  I have waited until time bloomed into flowers  â™«

126
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,840
Shen Du,

127
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,760
I've cooled it down for you. Take a sip.

128
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,420
Didn't you tell me last time you had sprained your shoulder?

129
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:50,220
You can't drink by yourself and need me to feed you.

130
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,840
Could you get up and take a sip? Just one sip.

131
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,596
â™«  Chasing time, riding a white horse  â™«

132
00:13:58,596 --> 00:14:02,474
â™«  Let's go together  â™«

133
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,880
Shen Du, get up.

134
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,680
Get up and look at me, Shen Du.

135
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,580
I've missed you.

136
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,512
â™«  Why fear the flying sand on the road ahead  â™«

137
00:14:36,512 --> 00:14:39,292
â™«  Chasing time, riding a white horse  â™«

138
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:41,360
â™«  Let's go together  â™«

139
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,894
I've missed you.

140
00:14:43,894 --> 00:14:46,572
â™«  Love is pure and originally flawless  â™«

141
00:14:46,572 --> 00:14:49,080
â™«  Let the vast universe change  â™«

142
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,888
â™«  Let's spend our time together  â™«

143
00:14:52,888 --> 00:14:55,544
   

144
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,520
Madam Shen still hasn't eaten in the past few days?

145
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,160
She has been staying by his bed this whole time, administering acupuncture every two hours.

146
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,160
She refuses to rest no matter what anyone says.

147
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,440
She won't let anyone else get close.

148
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,360
If this continues, Madam Shen might collapse first.

149
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,560
So what do you propose we do now?

150
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,570
Counting the days, if things go well for Young Master Pan,

151
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,820
he should have been back from Jinwu by now.

152
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm afraid that before the Great Chief's antidote arrives, she will collapse first.

153
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,120
Madam, please get some rest.

154
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,900
Or maybe you could eat something.

155
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,200
If the Great Chief wakes up and finds you've collapsed from exhaustion, he would certainly be very upset.

156
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,960
Before he wakes up, I will not collapse.

157
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,340
Young Master Pan has returned.

158
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,180
I was afraid that if I didnâ€™t come back soon, you wouldnâ€™t be able to hold on any longer.

159
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,240
Did you find the antidote?

160
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,139
This isâ€¦

161
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:24,139
Su Guang, the saintess of the Jinwu Tribe.

162
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,840
 I asked you to invite him here discreetly. 

163
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,240
 It was to invite, not to carry him over. What's wrong? 

164
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,260
 He's very cunning. I simply couldn't invite him. 

165
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,720
 All right, off you go. 

166
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,976
 You're awake. 

167
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,584
 It's you. 

168
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,220
It's the vine-wrapped tree.

169
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,320
Do you understand this poison?

170
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,140
This poison is primarily made from the larvae of the wood-boring moth

171
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:13,020
and supplemented with toxic plants like poison arrow wood, zinnia, and Aconitum from the Western Region.

172
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:18,180
Who would have thought this little moth could be turned into such a potent poison?

173
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,780
But only the saintesses of our tribe knows the secret method of making the poison.

174
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,500
It's never been passed on externally.

175
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,200
If it's not passed on, why does the leader of the Huo'e Sect have this concealed poison?

176
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,780
Could there be more to this matter?

177
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,980
I'll make a long story short.

178
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,080
Because this poison is too sinister, it has long been banned by our tribe.

179
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,840
But many years ago, a saintess of our tribe went missing.

180
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,000
There has been no news of her since.

181
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,760
So it seems this saintess might be connected to the Huo'e Sect

182
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,740
and could have taught them this poison.

183
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,340
Impossible. Saintess Daisi would never collude with a heretical cult.

184
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,080
You're a saintess, you must have the antidote to save people. Right?

185
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,260
Before coming, I heard a rough account from Pan Chi.

186
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,560
I looked through books and specially compounded this antidote.

187
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,840
I hope it will be effective.

188
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,960
I am deeply grateful for today's antidote.

189
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,960
You saved my life before. I agreed to come with you.

190
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,540
But the antidote should be counted separately.

191
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,880
Don't forget what you promised me.

192
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,080
A man's word is his bond.

193
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,960
Young Master Pan is really something.

194
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,800
He has even left a trail of romantic debts in the Western Region.

195
00:21:35,005 --> 00:21:38,409
   

196
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,780
Shen Du. Shen Du, you're awake?

197
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,170
How are you feeling now?

198
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,480
Are you still feeling uncomfortable anywhere?

199
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,960
Take it slow, slow down.

200
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,700
I've been asleep for so long,

201
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,080
I even started to miss you.

202
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:38,640
If you dare to bully me like this again, I will ignore you from then on.

203
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,000
It won't happen again.

204
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,080
The Great Chief is awake.

205
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,700
You little brat, you must not look at things you aren't supposed to see.

206
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,800
If you call me a brat again, I'll get angry.

207
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,700
If you don't accept it, let's duel.

208
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,800
Kid.

209
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,400
May the heavens protect and turn peril into safety.

210
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,900
What's the matter with you, kid?

211
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,600
Didn't I tell you not to look at things you shouldn't?

212
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,400
You canâ€™t look! You canâ€™t look!

213
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,400
Why are you so thoughtless?

214
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,400
 Shen Du, I really missed you. 

215
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,200
It seems you truly fell for him.

216
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,200
You have been unconscious for days.

217
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,800
You should not drink too much tea.

218
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,700
Give me your hand.

219
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,400
The pulse is stable.

220
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,000
It seems the poison has mostly been resolved.

221
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,200
If you have something to say, just say it.

222
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,500
Do you want to have a meal or bathe and change clothes?

223
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,800
Don't move.

224
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,300
Do you feel uncomfortable?

225
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,900
About Yingzhou, I've asked Jing Lin to keep an eye on it.

226
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,500
In the city, Sun Tan leads the inspectors to maintain order.

227
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,900
This matter will soon come to an end.

228
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,000
What about the remnants of the Huo'e Sect?

229
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,600
I've had Jing Lin block the news that my poison has been cured.

230
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,000
Will they really believe it?

231
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,520
The point is to make them afraid to be certain.

232
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,500
How is the information gathering going?

233
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,800
My Lord, it's now being rumored in the city

234
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,800
that the White Ghost from the capital city is near death

235
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,400
and his wife didn't even wait for her husband to breathe his last

236
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,600
before getting involved with that famous detective Pan Chi.

237
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,400
It's said that Shen Du's wife is an old acquaintance of Pan Chi

238
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,800
and the relationship has always been ambiguous.

239
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,200
Like the sting of a wasp,

240
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,600
the most poisonous thing is a woman's heart.

241
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,400
Although the camp has been destroyed by the imperial soldiers,

242
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,600
as long as Shen Du dies, there will inevitably be chaos.

243
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,600
By then, the entire Yingzhou will be in your grasp.

244
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,100
To prevent deception, inquire again.

245
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,700
 Yes! 

246
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
It is cinnabar.

247
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,000
This is from the day of the fight.

248
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,100
It fell off Chen Huo'e.

249
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,600
I had Jing Lin search Guangchun Clinic again.

250
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,700
Indeed, in the corner, we found the lost granules of cinnabar.

251
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,700
Cinnabar is often used in alchemy.

252
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,100
It is produced in very small quantities. Hence, it's extremely precious.

253
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,900
Ten gold pieces per bushel is not too much.

254
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,800
How could the Huo'e Sect have it?

255
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,600
If one were to consume small amounts over a long period,

256
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,200
it would act as a preservative in advance.

257
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,000
That's why the body can remain uncorrupted for a long time after death.

258
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,800
So the Huo'e Sect had prepared

259
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,100
this technique of resurrection for its followers long ago.

260
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,700
The mining of cinnabar is strictly controlled by the imperial court.

261
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,700
Yet the Huo'e Sect can easily possess it in large quantities.

262
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,500
It seems they infiltrated the mining industry of Great Cang long ago.

263
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,700
Such great ambition is far beyond imagination.

264
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,200
You mean to say...

265
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,300
the mastermind behind the Huo'e Sect wants toâ€¦

266
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,500
Cry.

267
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,100
Cry for what?

268
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,900
I can't cry out.

269
00:28:48,928 --> 00:28:51,378
   

270
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,600
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

271
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
It's time to change the style of your bewitching incense.

272
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,400
You are indeed still alive.

273
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,300
Do you really think I am made of paper?

274
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,840
You are not Chen Huo'e.

275
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,400
Is your true face so impossible to show?

276
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,480
Have you really seen through everything, Shen Du?

277
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,800
Shen Du.

278
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,400
Great Chief, she has escaped.

279
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,000
Watch them closely.

280
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,700
I want her captured alive.

281
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,000
Yes.

282
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,900
There exists a way to make items burn up so quickly.

283
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,400
The incident was sudden.

284
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,100
The smoke was too thick at the time.

285
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,800
I only smelled an acrid odor.

286
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,000
What are you thinking about?

287
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,800
Do you remember Saintess Daisi I mentioned to you?

288
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,900
According to rumors, she developed a kind of combustion-aiding technique.

289
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,300
Not to mention this wall,

290
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:56,800
even this whole courtyard could be consumed by flames in an instant.

291
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,800
 Great Chief, 

292
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,200
 a witness to the granary fire from that year has been found. 

293
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,400
 According to him, at that time, 

294
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,400
 an extremely pungent odor was smelled in the vicinity. 

295
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,700
 Moreover, the fire looked very strange. 

296
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,100
 Purple lights were flickering out of it from time to time. 

297
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,500
Jinwu combustion technique.

298
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,700
If one were to burn the granary using this technique,

299
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,800
indeed, it wouldn't take half a day.

300
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,200
In that case, Saintess Daisi of the Jinwu Tribe

301
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,300
seems to be inextricably linked with the Huo'e Sect.

302
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,100
What do you mean?

303
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,000
What is the purpose of your visit here?

304
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,300
Although Great Cang seldom interacts with the Jinwu Tribe,

305
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,800
we know that the disappearance of the saintess is a major event.

306
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,600
So peaceful.

307
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,000
I guess there might have been premeditation.

308
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,100
I did not intend to conceal it.

309
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,700
Saintess Daisi eloped with a man from Great Cang.

310
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,800
Her whereabouts have been unknown ever since.

311
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,000
The tribe leader wanted to calm the situation down.

312
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,400
However, during these years, many times,

313
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,100
there appeared the illusion techniques and recipes only our saintesses knew.

314
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,700
I think it is necessary to quickly uncover the truth

315
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,500
to avoid unwarranted disaster for the sacred sect.

316
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,560
Man from Great Cang?

317
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,000
Jing Lin.

318
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,840
Great Chief.

319
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,600
Send someone on a fast horse to report back to the capital

320
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,900
that the crisis in Yingzhou has been resolved.

321
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,500
Yes.

322
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,339
After being outside for so long,

323
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,400
you finally came in.

324
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,099
You really don't stand on ceremony.

325
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,900
There's something I'm not sure if it's appropriate to say.

326
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:13,000
If it's inappropriate, don't say it.

327
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,680
I advise you to fulfill the promise

328
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,940
to divorce Yan Xing amicably as soon as possible.

329
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,610
In what capacity are you speaking to me now?

330
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:27,760
As her close friend who disguised as a woman?

331
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,120
Merely a couple in name.

332
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:43,060
The esteemed Great Chief really has some confidence!

333
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,548
It's better...

334
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,760
to be careful with what you say.

335
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,540
The White Ghost is on the knife's edge every day,

336
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,260
how should you bring Yan Xing happiness?

337
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:23,100
It seems there's no need for you to worry about the safety of my wife.

338
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,590
As long as I, Shen Du, am here,

339
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,880
no one can harm Yan Xing.

340
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,260
You are really arrogant and domineering.

341
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:38,320
I really don't know what Yan Xing sees in you.

342
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,560
All right. Since you've said it today, please keep your word.

343
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,580
Otherwiseâ€¦

344
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,500
Otherwise what?

345
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,220
Otherwise, even if it's the ends of the earth,

346
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,360
I will definitely return and take her away.

347
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:00,060
You should have seen the affection between me and my wife very clearly.

348
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,820
Today, I'll lay my words here.

349
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:07,200
You can't wait for that day.

350
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,850
That's the best.

351
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,340
Are you leaving with the saintess?

352
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:20,180
Aren't you also interested in the whereabouts of Saintess Daisi?

353
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,220
The saintess has a noble status.

354
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,680
She must be well-protected.

355
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,920
What a good cup. Just smashed it like that.

356
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,760
What a pity.

357
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,700
I was reckless.

358
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:03,400
Thanks to you risking your life to obtain the antidote from Chen Huo'e.

359
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,940
After the poisoned residents in the city took it, they all quickly recovered.

360
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:11,740
Seeing the people recover and lead a peaceful life,

361
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:15,780
I just feel that even if handling cases is tough,

362
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,820
it's all worth it.

363
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,920
Great Chief, thank you. Thank you, Great Chief.

364
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,460
Thank you for saving me. Thank you for saving all the residents of Yingzhou.

365
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,440
You are a good official. This is a little token of our gratitude.

366
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,580
Please don't refuse it, accept it.

367
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,740
Great Chief, thank you for saving my life.

368
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,700
Thank you, this is a token of my gratitude.

369
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,460
Great Chief, this is a small token of my gratitude. You must accept it.

370
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:46,000
Thank you, Great Chief. Thank you for saving my life.

371
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,680
You are truly a good official.

372
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,120
We'll never forget your great kindness for the rest of our lives.

373
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,440
Yes, thank you, Great Chief. Thank you, Great Chief.

374
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,040
You are really too kind.

375
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,980
It's all what the Great Chief should do. No need.

376
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,160
- Please don't say that, really.  
 - Don't refuse it, please.

377
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,060
- Thank you, Great Chief. 
 - Thank you, Great Chief.

378
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,560
The Great Chief is really a good official.

379
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:10,640
Still laughing. Help me hold it.

380
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,240
These were all given to you by them.

381
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,820
This full-hearted sentiment, of course, you should hold it yourself.

382
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:21,460
I think you should deal less with Pan Chi in the future

383
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,860
lest you learn his rebellious nature.

384
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,760
Glib and articulate.

385
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,280
Before he left, he didn't even come to say goodbye.

386
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,700
It seems he went to provoke you.

387
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,790
The relationship between Saintess Daisi and the Huo'e Sect

388
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,060
is a matter of great importance.

389
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:41,920
I think his visit must have another purpose.

390
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,520
Then that's even better.

391
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,580
If he dares to covet someone else's wife again,

392
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,700
beware that I will break his legs.

393
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,820
Are you embarrassed, My Wife?

394
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,500
There are people around.

395
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:01,587
â™«  Upon meeting again, I know you're the one for me  â™«

396
00:40:01,587 --> 00:40:06,140
â™«  Gazing at the stars, dreaming about old times  â™«

397
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,108
I'm cold.

398
00:40:09,108 --> 00:40:12,683
â™«  Lovers before the candlelight, do not ask their thoughts  â™«

399
00:40:12,683 --> 00:40:16,630
â™«  Affection is bound, lasting forever  â™«

â™«  I have someone I long for in this life  â™«

402
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,444
What about now?

403
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:27,900
â™«  Deeply in love, you are the one I have chosen  â™«

404
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,320
â™«  Autumn moon and spring breeze, I only want you for my whole life  â™«

405
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,720
Lean forward a bit more.

406
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,880
â€‹â™«  Your gaze  â™«

407
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,360
I am holding something in my hands.

408
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,460
Lean forward a bit.

409

â™«  Autumn moon and spring breeze, I only want you for my whole life  â™«

413
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,974
â™«  You are the only one for me  â™«

414
00:41:12,194 --> 00:41:16,440
â™«  Embracing each other, how serious we are about our love  â™«

415
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,280
I'm cold.

416
00:41:19,641 --> 00:41:23,140
â™«  From dawn to dusk  â™«

417
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,404
Really cold.

418
00:41:24,404 --> 00:41:27,240
â™«  You and I, forever inseparable  â™«

419
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,060
You are not allowed to tease me in the future.

420
00:41:30,959 --> 00:41:34,599
â™«  Slowly immersing myself, I become undaunted by perils for love  â™«

421
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:39,316
â™«  I charge into battle with unmatched resilience  â™«

422
00:41:39,316 --> 00:41:42,210
â™«  Because you are my responsibility  â™«

423
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,884
It's much warmer now.

424
