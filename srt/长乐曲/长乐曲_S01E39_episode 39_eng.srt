00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,950
 "Go Ahead Fearlessly" - Liu Yuning 

3
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,993
â™«  Grudges and karma, right and wrong  â™«

4
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:38,291
â™«  The past hides blood and tears  â™«

5
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:40,660
â™«  It is hard to catch up after years of separation  â™«

6
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,535
â™«  The truth cannot be fully revealed  â™«

7
00:00:44,535 --> 00:00:47,670
â™«  Fate is full of twists and turns  â™«

8
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,835
â™«  Life and death, fortune and misfortune go hand in hand  â™«

9
00:00:50,835 --> 00:00:55,871
â™«  Obsession is hard to get rid of, keeping the truth 
 and getting rid of the lies, let the wind blow  â™«

10
00:00:55,871 --> 00:01:02,243
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

11
00:01:02,243 --> 00:01:08,551
â™«  At least you share my joy and sorrow  â™«

12
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:14,830
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

13
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:21,143
â™«  The mountains and rivers are bright and beautiful, 
 holding hands, together we return  â™«

14
00:01:21,143 --> 00:01:28,987
â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

15
00:01:28,987 --> 00:01:37,221
   

16
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,200
   

17
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,280
Sure enough, this is much more interesting.

18
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:50,160
Lai Luozhi, how dare you act so recklessly in court?

19
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,640
You simply disregard the law, unworthy of being a court official.

20
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,760
If the emperor does nothing, the world will never be at peace.

21
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,860
Vice Minister Lai is devoted to the country.

22
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,700
If justice is not served, we will not accept it.

23
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,180
Betraying loyalty and righteousness,

24
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,240
you treacherous ministers dare to speak so boldly.

25
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,620
To be ruled by a woman is the real calamity of Great Cang.

26
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,580
Very well. You've shown your true colors.

27
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:28,560
I'd like to see who is the bane of Great Cang.

28
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,332
Guards.

29
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,080
May I give it a try?

30
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,576
Guards.

31
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,940
Look around.

32
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,940
These are the Imperial Personal Guards of Great Cang.

33
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,600
I've long heard that the Imperial Guards are colluding with the Imperial Inspectorate.

34
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,140
I didn't expect that even the Imperial Personal Guards would have sided with Lai Luozhi.

35
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,000
Grand Empress Dowager, your days in the sickbed must have taken a toll on you.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,120
Maybe I should remind Your Majesty what to say and what to do.

37
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:58,700
Does Your Majesty really have nothing to say to the officials?

38
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,800
Lai Luozhi, how dare you lead troops to surround the palace with the intention of rebellion?

39
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,520
The mandate of Heaven shall be entrusted to the one chosen by the people.

40
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,660
Lai Luozhi, how dare you?

41
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:15,540
That's unexpected. Your Majesty actually chose to fight to the death.

42
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,440
What a pity. It doesn't have to be like this.

43
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,260
At this point,

44
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,460
you know how to write the edict of abdication. Right?

45
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,080
This is ridiculous! How are you qualified to inherit the throne?

46
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,860
What if I am qualified?

47
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,820
Then, you shall ascend the throne as appointed by Heaven.

48
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,800
Your wild ambition is insatiable. It calls for punishment.

49
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,220
How noisy. Drag these pedantic people out

50
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,620
and cut off their tongues.

51
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,580
Shen Du, what are you waiting for?

52
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,900
You're not qualified to claim the throne.

53
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,848
Royal Guards!

54
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,460
I, Shen Du, have purged the traitors among the Royal Guards.

55
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:24,480
We're here to arrest the rebels and protect Their Majesties.

56
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,750
Don't you want to avenge those dozens

57
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,340
of your family members who died from injustice?

58
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,590
Think about your father Shen Bingzhu.

59
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,260
Don't you want to vindicate him?

60
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,080
I will find out the truth myself and bring justice to my family.

61
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,200
You want me to join you?

62
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,788
You don't deserve it.

63
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,740
 So, according to your speculation, 

64
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,540
 the Huo'e Sect has gained momentum over the years 

65
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,740
 due to support from someone in the court, 

66
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,300
 and this person is very likely Lai Luozhi? 

67
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,710
 There's no solid evidence, but various signs indicate 

68
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,600
 that he has everything to do with this. 

69
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,040
 The Huo'e Sect coveted control over the court 

70
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,280
 and sought to incite discord within the royal family 

71
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,020
 with dirt on Princess Yong'an and others. 

72
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,920
 It is evident that the mastermind is elusive and plotting something huge. 

73
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,580
 They even dared to get their hands on the cinnabar controlled by the imperial court. 

74
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:26,420
 I am certain that your speculation is most probably the truth. 

75
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,700
 What is your plan? 

76
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,672
 Our enemies lurk in the dark. 

77
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,620
 We'd better play along and lure them into the trap. 

78
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,080
 Lure them into the trap? 

79
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:45,330
 All right. I'd like to see how your tactic will work. 

80
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,720
 Grand Empress Dowager, this is the medicine Shen Du discovered from the Jinwu Tribe. 

81
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,500
 He sent it here secretly. 

82
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,000
 It is said to be the remedy that can cure you in half a month. 

83
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,580
What a sneaky maneuver!

84
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:05,540
You feigned allegiance and put yourself and those around you at risk.

85
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,820
Instead of saying I feigned deception,

86
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:12,200
it's your arrogance that led you into the trap I had already set.

87
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:17,260
There's no point in saying more. It's not certain who will win yet.

88
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,920
The Huo'e rises, revealing the masses.

89
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,940
They are not real envoys.

90
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,980
I have never fully trusted you, either.

91
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,800
The commanders of the Six Garrisons have pledged loyalty to me.

92
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,840
Just now, they've besieged the palace.

93
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,880
Do you think you stand a chance?

94
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,510
The tide has turned.

95
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:45,540
You're regretting it? But it's too late!

96
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:50,480
Shen Du, you could have been the founding minister to my kingdom.

97
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,520
What a pity.

98
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,460
Kill them all.

99
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,000
Kill!

100
00:08:44,911 --> 00:08:47,251
It's going to be fine.

101
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:49,791
I will protect you.

102
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:55,311
You will surely ascend the throne.

103
00:08:55,311 --> 00:08:57,791
You surely will.

104
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,571
I won't let you die in vain.

105
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:52,131
General Zhenyuan, you reacted swiftly and took out the rebels.

106
00:10:52,131 --> 00:10:56,071
You're truly the leading general guarding the border of Great Cang.

107
00:11:11,191 --> 00:11:12,431
 Prince Xian. 

108
00:11:12,431 --> 00:11:15,271
 The Six Garrisons have sided with Lai Luozhi. 

109
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:18,171
 The troops within the city are no match for them. 

110
00:11:18,171 --> 00:11:21,331
 Now all the counties are under the watch of the Huo'e Sect. 

111
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:23,351
 Only one person can turn the tide. 

112
00:11:23,351 --> 00:11:24,711
 To not alert the enemies, 

113
00:11:24,711 --> 00:11:28,590
 please lend us your helping hand to lift the siege of Xiang'an 

114
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,170
 and pacify the turmoil. 

115
00:11:30,171 --> 00:11:33,331
Thankfully, you sent me a confidential letter conveying the decree.

116
00:11:33,331 --> 00:11:36,511
I didn't expect that someone would dare to collude with the enemies

117
00:11:36,511 --> 00:11:39,811
to create chaos at the borders to keep me there.

118
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:42,871
    
 He wouldn't have expected that a squad of elite warriors

119
00:11:42,871 --> 00:11:45,271
had already set out for Xiang'an.

120
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,431
Lai Luozhi bewitched the people.

121
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:52,251
But he didn't realize that those were my close kin in the palace.

122
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:54,631
His Majesty is my nephew.

123
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,030
As a civilian of Great Cang,

124
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:59,860
I must stand by Great Cang and its people at the moment.

125
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:03,551
The Huo'e Sect has numerous disciples.

126
00:12:03,551 --> 00:12:06,060
The various branches of Huo'e Sect in Great Cang

127
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,310
will join me in rising against you.

128
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,131
What are you going to do?

129
00:12:10,131 --> 00:12:13,851
Do you want all the people in Xiang'an to be buried with you?

130
00:12:13,851 --> 00:12:17,031
Great Chief, the rebels out there have been annihilated.

131
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,411
Lai Luozhi,

132
00:12:37,411 --> 00:12:39,151
it's time to surrender.

133
00:12:39,151 --> 00:12:43,991
Just now, the Huo'e Sect branches you deployed have all been eradicated.

134
00:12:45,411 --> 00:12:48,271
Your momentum

135
00:12:48,271 --> 00:12:50,271
is lost.

136
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:51,570
 During the grand assembly, 

137
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,010
 Lai Luozhi will deploy his troops around the palace. 

138
00:12:54,011 --> 00:12:56,951
 Jiang Langxing informed the inspectors in different areas. 

139
00:12:56,951 --> 00:13:00,671
 The inspectors will uproot the Huo'e Sect strongholds. 

140
00:13:14,071 --> 00:13:15,631
All inspectors, listen up.

141
00:13:15,631 --> 00:13:17,831
Destroy all the strongholds of the Huo'e Sect.

142
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,371
Arrest all the cultists.

143
00:13:19,371 --> 00:13:21,971
- Don't let anyone run away. 
 - Understood.

144
00:13:39,091 --> 00:13:42,150
 Brother Liang, if you produce the new crossbows you designed 

145
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,830
 which fires multiple arrows at once, 

146
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,951
 then our troops can fight ten times the enemies. 

147
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:51,671
 Then, with just a squad of elites, we may triumph over the many. 

148
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:53,671
What marvelous weapons you make.

149
00:13:53,671 --> 00:13:56,371
You have contributed greatly to the pacification.

150
00:13:56,371 --> 00:13:59,691
All thanks to Brother Shen's support and encouragement.

151
00:14:28,531 --> 00:14:32,911
You petty ants and hypocrites.

152
00:14:32,911 --> 00:14:35,231
You let the Grand Empress Dowager rule the nation.

153
00:14:35,231 --> 00:14:37,391
Incompetent and unjust!

154
00:14:37,391 --> 00:14:40,671
Who is the culprit who poisoned the foundation of our Great Cang?

155
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,091
It's her. Zhou Xu!

156
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:44,911
Lai Luozhi,

157
00:14:44,911 --> 00:14:48,291
you established Huo'e Sect, bewitched the people, and persecuted loyal ministers.

158
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:51,071
You have hurt so many people.

159
00:14:51,071 --> 00:14:53,951
What right do you have to speak so arrogantly here?

160
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:57,591
My Huo'e Sect thrived throughout Great Cang

161
00:14:57,591 --> 00:14:59,670
because I created a beautiful dream

162
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,550
where the dead could be brought back to life.

163
00:15:03,551 --> 00:15:05,731
Who can escape

164
00:15:05,731 --> 00:15:09,771
a life consisting of birth, aging, sickness, and death?

165
00:15:09,771 --> 00:15:12,331
Who can avoid...

166
00:15:13,031 --> 00:15:17,071
the pain of losing loved ones?

167
00:15:17,071 --> 00:15:21,391
Let alone the common people, even the high officials had no choice.

168
00:15:21,391 --> 00:15:24,190
Didn't Mo Qianzhi also yield to me

169
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,170
and act based on my instructions?

170
00:15:28,271 --> 00:15:30,231
Despicable creature.

171
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:32,871
I just hate people like you,

172
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:37,131
who uphold so-called righteousness and morality, thinking so highly of yourself.

173
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:39,711
How could I work with a rebel like you?

174
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:43,551
If my father were alive, he wouldn't allow it, either.

175
00:15:44,951 --> 00:15:47,340
I am first a civilian of Great Cang

176
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,810
and then a member of the Shen family.

177
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:56,831
Your father was also a fool.

178
00:15:56,831 --> 00:16:00,671
 I only seek to have a clear conscience and not let the people down. 

179
00:16:00,671 --> 00:16:05,111
 How can I collude with you? 

180
00:16:05,111 --> 00:16:07,460
He thought he upheld integrity,

181
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,670
unaware that he had made many enemies.

182
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:13,731
Many people wished to put him to death.

183
00:16:13,731 --> 00:16:17,151
You are as stupid as your father.

184
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:20,111
With nothing but some petty tricks,

185
00:16:20,111 --> 00:16:22,511
I managed to bring down your entire family.

186
00:16:22,511 --> 00:16:25,651
You're sinister enough to persecute loyal ministers.

187
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,311
Even Heaven's law wouldn't grant you power.

188
00:16:28,311 --> 00:16:30,551
Heaven's law?

189
00:16:30,551 --> 00:16:32,491
Then let me ask you.

190
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:37,291
Who convicted your father?

191
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:42,151
Who was responsible for the misery of your family?

192
00:16:49,111 --> 00:16:50,711
Zhou Xu.

193
00:16:50,711 --> 00:16:53,770
You hold the young mute emperor as hostage to dominate the court.

194
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,911
Have you ever woken up in the deep night,

195
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:59,771
feeling guilty toward the late emperor, who was my father?

196
00:17:02,071 --> 00:17:07,231
I am the chosen one with the supreme bloodline.

197
00:17:07,231 --> 00:17:11,830
Today, I shall restore order to Great Cang and reclaim my power.

198
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,351
 The late emperor? 

199
00:17:13,351 --> 00:17:15,191
 Could he beâ€¦? 

200
00:17:16,871 --> 00:17:21,931
I am the son of the late emperor and Consort Shu.

201
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:28,351
The phoenix leads nine chicks.

202
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:30,951
The world is at peace.

203
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:33,251
Returning to the fundamentals and clarifying the source.

204
00:17:33,251 --> 00:17:35,831
Re-establishing order in the universe.

205
00:17:37,271 --> 00:17:39,211
Returning to the fundamentals and clarifying the source.

206
00:17:39,211 --> 00:17:41,771
Re-establishing order in the universe?

207
00:17:43,711 --> 00:17:49,171
Could it be that the Imperial Preceptor's prophecy really had a second half?

208
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:52,391
That is not true.

209
00:17:56,031 --> 00:17:57,631
I'm the Chief Director Yan Xing of the Ministry of Justice.

210
00:17:57,631 --> 00:17:58,871
I pay my respect, Your Majesty.

211
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:01,091
I pay my respect, Grand Empress Dowager.

212
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:04,651
Please rise.

213
00:18:07,551 --> 00:18:09,191
Grand Empress Dowager,

214
00:18:09,191 --> 00:18:14,211
there was a second half to the prophecy that wasn't handed in.

215
00:18:14,211 --> 00:18:16,631
But it was not what Lai Luozhi just said.

216
00:18:16,631 --> 00:18:18,451
Do you have evidence?

217
00:18:18,451 --> 00:18:22,371
The true prophecy is hidden in this baby's clothes.

218
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,411
Azure sky at sunset.

219
00:18:33,411 --> 00:18:35,731
Brings upon misfortune.

220
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,471
That's right.

221
00:18:38,471 --> 00:18:40,591
The Imperial Preceptor made a prophecy.

222
00:18:40,591 --> 00:18:44,811
The latter half referred to someone with wild ambitions in the court

223
00:18:44,811 --> 00:18:48,331
so that Your Majesty would stay alert of those around you.

224
00:18:48,331 --> 00:18:51,031
Lai Luozhi managed the Huo'e Sect for years.

225
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:53,511
The cultists were committing crimes.

226
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:55,170
The Imperial Preceptor noticed it

227
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:59,050
and had doubts about Lai Luozhi's real identity.

228
00:18:59,051 --> 00:19:00,831
But without evidence,

229
00:19:00,831 --> 00:19:05,331
he had to convey his suspicions to the world through the prophecy.

230
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:12,890
    
 He probably realized

231
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,310
that Lai Luozhi was watching him.

232
00:19:15,311 --> 00:19:19,751
He had to embroider the prophecy within the patterns on the brocade

233
00:19:19,751 --> 00:19:22,531
to send it away when he had a chance.

234
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:27,731
However, Lai Luozhi sent assassins to silence him first.

235
00:19:32,691 --> 00:19:34,951
Heaven's vengeance is slow but sure.

236
00:19:34,951 --> 00:19:40,231
Yuanniang who couldn't read found the brocade with the latter half of the prophecy

237
00:19:40,231 --> 00:19:42,351
 and made it into the lining of baby's clothes. 

238
00:19:42,351 --> 00:19:44,905
And thus it remained.

239
00:19:44,905 --> 00:19:49,204
   

240
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:55,291
If Yuanniang were just an ordinary woman,

241
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:58,551
how could she afford such fabric?

242
00:19:58,551 --> 00:20:04,011
The fabric on the inside wasn't something accessible to an ordinary person.

243
00:20:06,631 --> 00:20:10,111
The Imperial Preceptor was pedantic and obstinate.

244
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:13,491
Should I give up Great Cang to a stupid child,

245
00:20:13,491 --> 00:20:15,991
or that inept Prince Xian,

246
00:20:15,991 --> 00:20:18,791
or that bossy Princess Yong'an?

247
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:23,991
As long as the Grand Empress Dowager is still in court, no one can be at ease.

248
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,551
Once upon a time,

249
00:20:27,551 --> 00:20:31,711
Princess Runing was honored and distinguished.

250
00:20:31,711 --> 00:20:36,711
But someone changed the pattern of her clothes,

251
00:20:36,711 --> 00:20:39,711
and she was accused of treason...

252
00:20:40,511 --> 00:20:43,271
and ended up as she is now.

253
00:20:45,431 --> 00:20:48,751
So, Princess Runing

254
00:20:48,751 --> 00:20:52,151
was also framed by you?

255
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:56,411
How could I have succeeded so easily had you not been paranoid?

256
00:20:56,411 --> 00:20:58,331
It's all your fault.

257
00:20:58,331 --> 00:21:02,511
You are the greatest threat to my clan.

258
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:07,911
As a descendant of the Xiao family, I shall right the wrongs for Great Cang.

259
00:21:07,911 --> 00:21:11,431
The throne is rightfully mine.

260
00:21:11,431 --> 00:21:14,351
I am the rightful heir to the throne.

261
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:16,831
But you are not the son of the late emperor.

262
00:21:16,831 --> 00:21:21,671
You are the son of Consort Shu and her lover.

263
00:21:32,831 --> 00:21:36,231
Consort Shu used to be the carefree Princess Bi Luo of Nanlang.

264
00:21:36,231 --> 00:21:39,331
She was in love and engaged with General Kongshan in secret.

265
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,111
It could have been a beautiful story.

266
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:46,590
Yet her father, King of Nanlang, forced her to marry the late emperor of Great Cang.

267
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,791
Princess Bi Luo wouldn't comply.

268
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:51,390
In a rage, the King of Nanlang killed General Kongshan

269
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:54,250
and threatened to kill his entire clan.

270
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:58,091
Bi Luo had no choice but to bribe the eunuch to avoid the inspection

271
00:21:58,091 --> 00:22:00,651
and became who we knew as Consort Shu.

272
00:22:00,651 --> 00:22:06,231
Thus, she lost her love and her name.

273
00:22:06,231 --> 00:22:09,871
She stayed alive for the sake of General Kongshan's clan,

274
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:14,151
and because she was pregnant with General Kongshan's child.

275
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:29,271
It can't be true. No way.

276
00:22:29,271 --> 00:22:31,591
My mother consort wouldn't lie to me.

277
00:22:31,591 --> 00:22:36,371
I am a descendant of the Xiao family, a prince of the late emperor of Great Cang!

278
00:22:36,371 --> 00:22:40,431
Back then, one of those who escorted Princess Bi Luo to Great Cang

279
00:22:40,431 --> 00:22:43,771
noticed that she was unwell and discovered the truth.

280
00:22:43,771 --> 00:22:48,371
That person was attacked by assassins but made it out alive.

281
00:22:48,371 --> 00:22:52,431
Lai Luozhi, you are not a descendant of the Xiao family.

282
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:05,051
Lai Luozhi, your life is a complete lie.

283
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,830
No way.

284
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,410
My mother consort wouldn't lie to me.

285
00:23:22,411 --> 00:23:24,551
My mother consort wouldn't lie to me!

286
00:23:24,551 --> 00:23:28,051
You petty people are Zhou Xu's lackeys.

287
00:23:28,051 --> 00:23:30,251
You fabricate lies to deceive everyone,

288
00:23:30,251 --> 00:23:34,951
just to prevent me from ascending the throne and rectifying the mistake.

289
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,451
The moths flying to the flame,

290
00:23:53,451 --> 00:23:55,951
born at dawn,

291
00:23:55,951 --> 00:23:58,391
dead by dusk.

292
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,100
It turns out...

293
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,751
that the moth flying to the flame...

294
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:53,071
is nothing but a splendid dream.

295
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,792
- Open the door. 
 - Understood.

296
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,291
Greetings, Imperial Guard Jing.

297
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:19,191
Lai Luozhi was arrested. The Great Chief ordered me to come and swiftly send you all home.

298
00:25:19,191 --> 00:25:23,351
You have suffered. Please forgive us for our negligence.

299
00:25:23,351 --> 00:25:26,271
That's great! Imperial Guard Jing, you're being too polite.

300
00:25:26,271 --> 00:25:28,700
The Great Chief locked us up

301
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,450
to protect us from Lai Luozhi's persecution.

302
00:25:31,451 --> 00:25:33,591
How could we not understand that?

303
00:25:33,591 --> 00:25:36,291
- That's right! 
 - That's right!

304
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:42,171
Shen Du, you need to understand.

305
00:25:42,171 --> 00:25:46,351
An arrow shot from a bow can't be taken back.

306
00:25:46,351 --> 00:25:51,091
I've thought it through. Please inform the Grand Empress Dowager.

307
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,351
Come back another day, Director Yan.

308
00:26:20,351 --> 00:26:23,071
The Grand Empress Dowager is going to summon me.

309
00:26:23,071 --> 00:26:25,751
She won't have time for you.

310
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:29,551
Lai Luozhi and his people have been convicted.

311
00:26:29,551 --> 00:26:34,051
Why are you here to see the Grand Empress Dowager?

312
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:39,151
I have made a great contribution to the pacification this time.

313
00:26:39,151 --> 00:26:42,080
Do I need to tell a sixth-tier official

314
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,070
about what reward I'm going to ask for?

315
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,611
Then I must see Her Majesty together with you.

316
00:26:49,611 --> 00:26:52,771
The merit shouldn't be yours alone. I also made an effort.

317
00:26:52,771 --> 00:26:56,471
You can't keep the reward all to yourself.

318
00:26:56,471 --> 00:27:00,411
If you want a reward, have your supervisor hand in a memorial.

319
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:03,351
Director Yan, go back.

320
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:09,271
Who brings a gift to ask for rewards?

321
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,691
I bet it's the evidence

322
00:27:13,691 --> 00:27:17,311
that can disturb the court in this box.

323
00:27:17,311 --> 00:27:19,091
You came for the Shen familyâ€”

324
00:27:19,091 --> 00:27:20,950
Director Yan,

325
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,392
speak cautiously.

326
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,931
Now that we are divorced, you have no ties with the Shen family.

327
00:27:28,931 --> 00:27:31,891
So stay out of my family business.

328
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,380
Fine.

329
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,890
Even if I am not a member of the Shen family,

330
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:45,450
I will see this matter to its end.

331
00:27:45,451 --> 00:27:50,271
I'm not standing here as your wife

332
00:27:50,271 --> 00:27:52,891
but as the Chief Director of the Ministry of Justice.

333
00:27:52,891 --> 00:27:55,670
It's my pursuit to reinvestigate wrongful cases

334
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:58,470
and bring justice to the innocent.

335
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:07,211
Great Chief Shen, the Grand Empress Dowager summons you.

336
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,951
As an official, you should know very well that

337
00:28:11,951 --> 00:28:14,140
the Grand Empress Dowager only summoned me, the leader.

338
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:17,070
How can you come here without an invitation?

339
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:20,391
Are you breaking into the hall?

340
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:26,031
If you go in there alone, I won't see you again.

341
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:05,651
His Majesty caught a mild cold.

342
00:29:05,651 --> 00:29:09,951
He will rest for a day and attend the court meeting tomorrow.

343
00:29:09,951 --> 00:29:15,051
My ministers, do you have any reports to make?

344
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:24,211
Qiao Wenzhi, you're temporarily in charge of Gannandao.

345
00:29:24,211 --> 00:29:28,271
Do you have matters to report today?

346
00:29:28,271 --> 00:29:32,531
Reporting to Grand Empress Dowager. Ever since Lai Luozhi was convicted,

347
00:29:32,531 --> 00:29:35,471
all has been well and prosperous in Great Cang.

348
00:29:35,471 --> 00:29:37,911
Gannandao has been thriving.

349
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:42,331
The world is at peace. There is nothing to report.

350
00:29:42,331 --> 00:29:44,951
"The world is at peace"?

351
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:47,991
Lai Luozhi has been brought to justice.

352
00:29:47,991 --> 00:29:53,191
But the brochure he left behind was very useful.

353
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:58,851
Qiao Wenzhi, you illegally imported goods from Xichen

354
00:29:58,851 --> 00:30:04,211
through Gannandao to sell them in Great Cang for profit.

355
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,431
Grand Empress Dowager, I have been wronged.

356
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:10,391
The so-called evidence left behind by those rebels

357
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,491
in Gannandao is absolutely invalid.

358
00:30:12,491 --> 00:30:14,731
Absolutely invalid?

359
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:26,231
Then, what do you say about the fabricated ledgers?

360
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:30,871
It wasn't submitted by Lai Luozhi's people.

361
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:35,591
The forged ledger documented twice the real cost

362
00:30:35,591 --> 00:30:38,591
of the reconstruction of Ming Hall.

363
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:42,531
But all the ministries were involved in this.

364
00:30:42,531 --> 00:30:45,060
-  I'm not the only oneâ€” 
 - Qiao Wenzhi.

365
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:49,751
Don't talk nonsense! Don't talk nonsense!

366
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:58,611
Grand Empress Dowager, Qiao Wenzhi is my subordinate.

367
00:30:58,611 --> 00:31:01,670
He embezzled the money from the court out of greed,

368
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,750
which is a serious crime.

369
00:31:03,751 --> 00:31:07,211
I was negligent.

370
00:31:07,211 --> 00:31:10,051
I deserve any punishment.

371
00:31:10,051 --> 00:31:12,300
Negligent?

372
00:31:13,111 --> 00:31:15,391
Prime Minister Zhang truly has a wealth of knowledge.

373
00:31:15,391 --> 00:31:17,351
What an exquisite choice of words.

374
00:31:17,351 --> 00:31:21,931
But Qiao Wenzhi is indeed loyal to you.

375
00:31:21,931 --> 00:31:25,411
I bet most of the embezzlement ended up

376
00:31:25,411 --> 00:31:28,191
in your pocket, Zhang Xingwei.

377
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:33,811
Zhang Xingwei, what else do you have to say?

378
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:39,691
I have nothing to say.

379
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:41,744
Prince Xian.

380
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,391
Mother Empress.

381
00:31:44,391 --> 00:31:46,511
Let me ask you.

382
00:31:46,511 --> 00:31:49,591
How should we deal with him?

383
00:31:49,591 --> 00:31:52,291
Mother Empress is wise, I believe you have your opinion.

384
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:54,471
I have my opinion?

385
00:31:54,471 --> 00:31:59,391
But now I am asking for your opinion.

386
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:02,231
Prime Minister Zhang has been my mentor since I was young.

387
00:32:02,231 --> 00:32:07,131
He has always led by example and taught me to prioritize the nation.

388
00:32:07,131 --> 00:32:11,251
I don't believe that he would commit such a crime just for money.

389
00:32:11,251 --> 00:32:15,271
There must be something behind this.

390
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:21,471
Prince Xian, how foolish!

391
00:32:21,471 --> 00:32:26,311
I have deceived you for years, acting like a decent minister.

392
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:29,751
Yet you still plead for me?

393
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:37,871
Very well. What a touching bond between mentor and disciple.

394
00:32:37,871 --> 00:32:41,711
Prime Minister Zhang, let me speak on your behalf.

395
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:45,671
You didn't spend a single dime on yourself.

396
00:32:45,671 --> 00:32:48,491
You bribed others in the court

397
00:32:48,491 --> 00:32:53,671
so that they supported Prince Xian with you.

398
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,600
Grand Empress Dowager.

399
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,000
At this point,

400
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,100
I will no longer conceal the truth.

401
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:20,600
Prince Xian knows absolutely nothing about all this.

402
00:33:21,991 --> 00:33:24,600
It was all my doing alone.

403
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:29,400
Please sentence me to death as a warning to others.

404
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,300
Do you think your sins will be erased

405
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,600
as long as you sacrifice yourself?

406
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,600
Those loyal officials who died wrongfully accused

407
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,500
because of you

408
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:47,600
can never be brought back to life.

409
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,000
Minister Shen, bring it up.

410
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:10,231
 By heavenly decree, here comes the edict. 

411
00:34:10,231 --> 00:34:15,000
 The criminal, Shen Bingzhu, secretly corresponded with the enemy, 

412
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,500
 burned down our army's granary, 

413
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,300
 leaked the weapon designs, 

414
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,200
 colluded with foreign forces, 

415
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,300
 and conspired with the rebel army. 

416
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,500
 He shall be sentenced to death. 

417
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,700
 The entire Shen family shall be detained and exiled. 

418
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:33,500
 Convey the edict widely. 

419
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:37,600
 I do not seek to be renowned. 

420
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,800
 I only seek to have a clear conscience 

421
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,100
 and not let the people down. 

422
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,400
 Shen Bingzhu was indifferent to wealth and fame, 

423
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,400
 never wanting to get involved in court disputes. 

424
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,100
 All he cared about was the people. 

425
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,000
 No matter what happened, 

426
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,900
 he only did what he should do, 

427
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,800
 as long as the people lived well. 

428
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,800
 I receive my wage from His Majesty. 

429
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,100
 Naturally, I shall share his burden 

430
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,500
 even at the cost of my life. 

431
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:06,800
â™«  Tossed about by the wind and rain, I will never regret it, 
 I will accompany you for my whole life  â™«

432
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,660
I, Shen Du,

433
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:12,500
am here to seek justice for my father,

434
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,000
Shen Bingzhu.

435
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,500
 I, Shen Du, the son of the criminal official Shen Bingzhu, 

436
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:23,000
 denounce my father for colluding with enemies 

437
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,400
 and conspiring with the rebels. 

438
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,800
 I report! 

439
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,400
 I, Shen Du, the son of the criminal official Shen Bingzhu, 

440
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:37,000
 denounce my father for colluding with enemies. 

441
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:44,800
â™«  Unravelling fate, fearlessly, a dream returns  â™«

442
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,400
Seek justice for my father,

443
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,300
Shen Bingzhu.

444
00:35:51,900 --> 00:36:01,000
â€‹â™«  In this life, my heart returns untainted of dust and ash  â™«

445
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:12,300
Sixteen years ago when Great Cang was at war with Xichen

446
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,300
and in dire need of provisions and fodder,

447
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,200
the main granary

448
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:23,700
that stored the provisions suddenly caught fire.

449
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:28,200
All the provisions of Great Cang were burned to the ground.

450
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,700
Shen Bingzhu, who was guarding the provisions,

451
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,400
was found guilty of conspiring with the enemy

452
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,800
and severely punished.

453
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:50,600
The grain bag bearing the granary's seal

454
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:55,800
should have been burned to ashes.

455
00:36:56,751 --> 00:36:58,791
But it appeared...

456
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,100
a thousand miles away in Gannandao.

457
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,800
The traitorous letter you presented to the late emperor

458
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,300
was found not to have been written by Shen Bingzhu.

459
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:20,000
Prime Minister Zhang, will you explain it to me?

460
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,800
When the war began, my disciple came to me.

461
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,400
It was then I learned

462
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,900
that he had colluded with local officials to scalp the provisions.

463
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,600
They bought the provisions at a low price

464
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,500
and sold them when the price rose to profit from the price difference.

465
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,800
However, the war with Xichen broke out.

466
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,500
But they had sold out all the provisions,

467
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,000
leaving only piles of thatch in the granary.

468
00:37:51,551 --> 00:37:53,991
Prime Minister Zhang.

469
00:37:53,991 --> 00:37:57,791
It had never crossed my mind that

470
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,800
such a heinous crime concerning the foundation of Great Cang

471
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,400
would have something to do with you.

472
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,000
Grand Empress Dowager.

473
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,600
Nor had I imagined that...

474
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:19,000
one day I would do something utterly heartless

475
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,900
to cover up my disciple's crime.

476
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,470
I found someone...

477
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:38,000
to fabricate that treasonous letter,

478
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,300
imitating Minister Shen's handwriting.

479
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,800
You forged the letter.

480
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,000
Then, how did the granary catch fire?

481
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,200
Prime Minister Zhang.

482
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:57,151
Do you want me to investigate further?

483
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,900
Grand Empress Dowager,

484
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,800
I am solely responsible for this.

485
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:08,800
My family and I shall pay the price. Let it end here.

486
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,300
If you keep looking into it,

487
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:14,000
it may shake the foundation of Great Cang.

488
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,500
We will be caught in a dilemma, trying to protect someone important.

489
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:22,000
It's not worth it, Grand Empress Dowager.

490
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,800
Protect someone important?

491
00:39:29,231 --> 00:39:32,711
Who are you referring to?

492
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:44,900
There are things I can't speak about openly.

493
00:39:51,071 --> 00:39:53,431
 Great Chief Shen, please. 

494
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,900
 Do you trust me so much? 

495
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,000
 Aren't you afraid 

496
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,900
 that you will disappear along with this box? 

497
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,200
 Over the years, 

498
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:32,400
 I have seen you serving the people of Great Cang at all costs. 

499
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,600
 I believe you will make a fair judgment. 

500
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,600
 I am not afraid... 

501
00:40:38,991 --> 00:40:41,351
 to risk my life. 

502
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,900
Then let me speak on your behalf.

503
00:40:59,591 --> 00:41:03,591
Before Minister Shen took over the granary,

504
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:08,000
the local official there was my nephew Zhou Miao.

505
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,700
   

506
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:15,500
He feared that he'd be caught and colluded with Lai Luozhi

507
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,800
to set our Great Cang granary on fire

508
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:22,800
with Jinwu Tribe's combustion-aiding technique.

509
00:41:24,471 --> 00:41:26,851
Grand Empress Dowager, youâ€¦

510
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:28,391
Guards.

511
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,500
Take Zhou Miao out for a thorough interrogation.

512
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,500
All those involved in this from the Zhou family

513
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,000
shall receive more severe punishment.

514
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,300
Grand Empress Dowager, spare me!

515
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,800
 Please spare me! 

516
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,600
Prince Xian,

517
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,200
let me ask you one more time.

518
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,400
What will you do with Prime Minister Zhang?

519
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,600
Mother Empress, I beg you

520
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,600
to punish Zhang Xingwei according to the law.

521
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,600
But please consider his past merits

522
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:13,800
and deal with the members of the Zhang family with some leniency.

523
