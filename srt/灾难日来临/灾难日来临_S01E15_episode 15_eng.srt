1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,840
 Everything needs my permission. 

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,620
 Overdoing it because you want to save someone is strictly forbidden. 

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:11,930
 President Lee's husband is reported missing due to the landslide. 

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,750
 The back of the ear is sunken, it's a subdural hemorrhage. 

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,110
 He's in danger. We need to save him somehow. 

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,600
 You've never made a hole in someone's head before.
-But if we leave him like this, he will die. 

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,170
 It's a success, right?
-Let's move him. 

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,950
 Sometimes, there are times when not doing anything is the best. 

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,630
  Just act like you are trying to find the injured area. 

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,500
 Are you telling me to do a fake surgery? 

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,040
 You promised to just close it and come out, so why? 

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,100
 I did not abandon my pride as a doctor to sacrifice a life for my ambition. 

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:44,780
  If Lee Hae Sung found out about your medical malpractice, how would it turn out? 

14
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,200
 Just why is this happening? 

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,560
 Seriously, why?!! 

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,910
  He performed surgery while having PTSD... 

17
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,290
 I got you now, Dr. Lee Hae Sung. 

18
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,810
Yay!!

19
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,200
You both were great. Congratulations.

20
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,340
Thank you. Ddol Mi, you should receive congratulations.

21
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,810
What did I do? It's all you.

22
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,100
You did it,...
- Ah!

23
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,960
 This is Mirae Hospital Emergency Measures Chief Kang Joo Ran. 

24
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,030
 Right now, in the conference room, 

25
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:21,850
  we will hold a committee meeting concerning Emergency Department Surgeon Lee Hae Sung's license suspension. 

26
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,490
License suspension?

27
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:29,500
 Episode 15
- All the Chief doctors of every department, please come to the conference room. 

28
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,580
I prepared it well without any flaws.

29
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,340
Already?
-Yes.

30
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,190
Well the more realistic it is the better.

31
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,130
We can hand it to the Ministry of Welfare like this.

32
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,650
Let's get it finalized. How much time until the meeting...?

33
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:56,230
Nurse Park Ji Na, what kind of ruckus is this?

34
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:00,570
Did something happen to the husband of President Lee?

35
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,930
Yes. I've something to say to you.

36
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,610
Excuse me.

37
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,790
Prepare well for the meeting.

38
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,210
There is 35 minutes left.

39
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,150
If there is a lump of cancer, what do you do? You need to take it out.

40
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,780
Are you saying Teacher Lee is a lump of cancer?

41
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,360
On top of it, it's malignant. He even causes metastasis everywhere.

42
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,360
Then why did you let him in DMAT?

43
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,400
You let him in because you acknowledged his abilities.

44
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,170
You got it wrong. There would definitely be things happening at the site that someone needed to be responsible for.

45
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:41,930
And because Han Woo Jin is too precious to waste, I just needed someone to be the expendable solider.

46
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:47,820
But that expendable soldier... is among us.

47
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,020
How can you... say...

48
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:56,680
Ji Na... you and Han Woo Jin, come to your senses.

49
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,560
I've to go.

50
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,530
Oh, yea, Park Ji Na. I'm going to advise you as a father;

51
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:13,430
Lee Hae Sung already lost. In the future, stand on the winning side.

52
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,340
Lee Hae Sung's dogmatic

53
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,420
and impractical procedure, because there was a problem with the surgery,

54
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,720
has finally resulted in a great accident.

55
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:40,450
I want to propose and bring up Lee Hae Sung's license suspension to the Ministry of Welfare.

56
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,490
Then, we will get started with the discussion.

57
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,630
It has probably started right?

58
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,600
What's going to happened to Dr. Lee?

59
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,520
It won't be good.

60
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:00,310
The bereaved family convicted him. If the other doctors believe that the license suspension is valid,

61
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,570
there is almost never a time where the situation was turned around.

62
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,630
I mean.. does it make sense that it's happening in the hospital?

63
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,820
It's too much between us doctors.

64
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:15,100
It's a misfortune... because the opposition is the Hospital Director.

65
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,440
Still, if they are real doctors, then won't they take Dr. Lee's side?

66
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,300
I know he protected President Lee's son, but

67
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,220
who will stand by his side? It's probably a planned go-stop.

68
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,250
The problematic depressive craniotomy;

69
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,390
this was a technique that people used before the imaging technology was developed.

70
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,310
If you consider that it was a disaster scene and an emergency situation,

71
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,880
you can't say that it's an absolute wrong judgment.

72
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,120
Even if it is in a calamity, rules are rules.

73
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,800
Regulations maintain social justice.

74
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,520
Doctor Lee is a general surgeon. He is not a neurosurgeon.

75
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,600
Even though people have their own specialties, if that becomes void just because it was an emergency situation, specialties become pointless...

76
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,860
And why do we have training then?

77
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,900
But in an emergency situation, Lee Hae Sung--

78
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,480
Do you think that this is the only thing?

79
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:07,060
Doctor Lee, for the now deceased patient, even though it was in the domains for a thoracic surgeon,

80
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,590
it's because he forcefully did the surgery.

81
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,050
That's because the thoracic surgeon was totally...

82
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,350
Wasn't it a situation where they weren't able to come?

83
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,140
Chief Kang, have a seat.

84
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,860
What is Teacher Lee's opinion?

85
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,600
Then, while waiting, if the patient dies,

86
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,400
then did I not have to show up here?

87
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,720
What?!!

88
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,340
The heart is stopping. And even when I waited so fervently, the thoracic surgeon did not come.

89
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:41,180
If I do something, maybe the person might survive.

90
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,700
Is that a sin?

91
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,330
Are those wrong words?

92
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:49,190
If it's a no, then it's a no!

93
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:53,810
Isn't it because you don't want to take responsibility?

94
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:59,090
Fine. Let's confirm something.

95
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:04,070
Doctor Lee Hae Sung, right now, you have PTSD, correct?

96
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,570
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

97
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:12,500
At the scene, I heard that your hands shook and you couldn't make normal actions.

98
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,830
With that symptom, you made a hole in the patient's head, huh?

99
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,530
With that shaking hand.

100
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:25,490
Chief Kang. While having PTSD,

101
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:32,190
what do you think about the decision of a general surgeon to drill a patient's head?

102
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:36,610
Am I excessive or is Lee Hae Sung excessive?

103
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,800
Let's vote.

104
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,320
Yes, I've prepared it all.

105
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:48,080
You can just mark 0 or X on the voting paper I'm handing out right now.

106
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,020
If you believe that a license suspension is O, then X...

107
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,230
We can't vote.

108
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:59,870
If you want to withdraw, then do so.  Director Park, she can withdraw, right?

109
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:04,800
Of course, according to the principle, freedom of choice.

110
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,570
We failed to meet the quorum, Director.

111
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,870
What do you mean by fail to meet the quorum?!

112
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:18,570
Under hospital rules, the quorum requires 1/3 of all the department heads present.

113
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,390
I don't see the Director of General Internal Medicine.

114
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,370
The Assistant Director went overseas.

115
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:28,040
The OB/GYN, pathologist and ophthalmologist, those 3 Chief doctors have left due to the earthquake.

116
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,800
So, those 5 people are missing. It's a failure to meet quorum.

117
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,510
But in this calamity--

118
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:39,150
If it's a calamity, rules are rules, right?

119
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,810
You should keep the justice of the society.

120
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,840
How did it go?

121
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,510
Due to your help, with failure to meet quorum, I was able to block it.

122
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,670
Oh, yeah?

123
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,130
For now, I stalled time.

124
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:16,390
The OB/GYN and pathologist doctors are on the Director's side.

125
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,790
They would come back because it came known that the hospital is restored.

126
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:24,830
It seems the Director is also thinking of that and that's why he backed down without a fight.

127
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:29,130
Ahh.. in the end.. don't we have a method?

128
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,200
It resulted in a losing favor for the Hospital Director.

129
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,600
Thank you for making such a difficult decision, Supervisor.

130
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,920
No.

131
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,480
We need surgeons like Dr. Lee.

132
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:47,160
I continually kept on thinking that if I was as courageous as Doctor Lee, I would have also saved the patient.

133
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,400
If there is anything else, do call me.

134
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,100
Yes, thank you.

135
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,190
I understand why I'm doing this now. 
 - Without realizing it, you feel proud and happy, right?

136
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:04,080
Well, the heart beating like that...

137
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,680
What are you doing here?

138
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,870
Aigoo, hello.

139
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,250
What are all these?

140
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,850
Since this is a disaster hospital, the stock has been supplied.

141
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,270
Chief Kang told us to organize the warehouse.

142
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,650
Do it later.

143
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,410
Do it later, so leave right now.

144
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,500
Leave. Leave now.

145
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,490
You've worked hard, Director.

146
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:27,350
I'm Kang Seung Hoon, the representative of the volunteers.

147
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,930
Just comfortably, call me Kang... 
 - And I am Mr. Go.

148
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,830
Goodness!

149
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,480
Organizing supplies... seriously.

150
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,640
What are you doing here?

151
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,140
It's a storage space. Where nurses get their medicine.

152
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,370
I heard from Dr. Lee.

153
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,190
He'd probably be thinking I'm in a state I deserve.

154
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,910
But that isn't the end.

155
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:31,270
Why are you trying to take away his license? He's a good doctor.

156
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,590
I know, what a waste that is. He's a good doctor.

157
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,620
Then, why are you...

158
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:40,070
Because I think he is of no use for the future of Mirae Hospital.

159
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,710
So if you don't need it, you get rid of it?

160
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:47,210
Everything that Lee Hae Sung does... bothers me. You and Han Woo Jin, too!

161
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:51,530
Why are you getting angry?

162
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,660
Why are you so aggressive, Dad?

163
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:03,570
I put my whole life for this hospital. My whole life.

164
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:08,900
There's nothing that hasn't been done with my own hands.

165
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:15,280
I won't let the hospital crumble like this. I won't lose to anyone.

166
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:21,230
You said to stand on the winning side. I'm going to stand on the right side.

167
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:29,210
Ji Na, in this world, where is there such a thing as the right side?

168
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:33,270
The person who wins is right. That's justice, you know?

169
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,110
I don't know.

170
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,300
I don't even want to know.

171
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:50,630


172
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,990
It seems like my eyesight is getting bad again.

173
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,220
Who?

174
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,370
Why?

175
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,390
What do you mean why? It's my uncle.

176
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,900
Oh.

177
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,620
Lee Hae Sung, what happened?

178
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,880
You see that you heard that his license is still okay.

179
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,570
Even if you gather some doctors that are on the Director's side, it could be game over.

180
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,770
He should wake up quickly.

181
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:58,860
That worry, is it because of your uncle or Lee Hae Sung?

182
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:06,140
Well, it must be because of both.

183
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:11,160
I am jealous of and hate Lee Hae Sung.

184
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,600
If I was someone like that to you...

185
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:21,300
No. Truthfully, I expected more than that, but now...

186
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,650
My worries include you, too.

187
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:30,120
Since you turned your back to my father, it is clear what he will do.

188
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,680
Why I wasn't able to do this before...I regret it.

189
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,900
You and I would have been different now.

190
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:50,500
That regret... it might not be too late.

191
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,960
I can see the Han Woo Jin that I know again.

192
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:00,440
So, it's new and good.

193
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:09,910
I also have late regrets. That's why I'm regretting it even more.

194
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,380
I found it after a long time, because it was buried underneath.

195
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,660
Who's in charge of this patient?

196
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,000
Ohhhh... What are you doing?

197
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,060
My medical license is still active.

198
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,580
I'm not talking about your license, Lee Hae Sung. You have been fired from this hospital.

199
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:28,730
The Director said to not even come. This is troublesome.

200
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:32,490
In a situation where there are many patients and few doctors, let me help, Dr. Yoo.

201
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,630
I said I don't need help.

202
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:38,220
If Director sees, chaos will ensue!

203
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,120
I guess Teacher Yoo only sees the director of the hospital and not the patients, huh?

204
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,330
What does it got to do with me when it isn't even my patient?

205
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,820
If it isn't your patient, I guess he he'll die?

206
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,680
What do you mean he will die? Only his leg is swollen a bit.

207
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:58,250
Ouch! Why do you hit people and use violence?

208
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,080
If I report this to the chairman, then you're fired. Fired, you know that?

209
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,090
I'm already fired, so what do you mean fired?

210
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,360
Look at you talking. Huh?

211
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,740
What are doing fighting when there is a patient?

212
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,440
Fighting? What fighting? He hit me.

213
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,770
Quiet down.

214
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,300
What is it, Dr. Lee?

215
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,990
I think this patient's leg will need to have a fasciotomy.
 

216
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,900
The edema on the legs is getting worse and worse. And truthfully, I'm getting suspicious of compartment syndrome.

217
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,540
If he goes in shock, then we will lose this patient.

218
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,930
What were you doing until the patient became like this, Dr. Yoo?

219
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:33,610
Right this moment, administer 1L normal saline full drip.

220
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,860
What's the matter?

221
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,530
The Electrical Corp employee... his leg is strange.

222
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:52,330
I think we need to perform a fasciotomy.

223
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,710
Why?

224
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:57,610
Lee Hae Sung and I are thinking the same thing. It's compartment syndrome.

225
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:01,330
If we don't do surgery right away, an amputation or he can even die.

226
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:05,400
I opened a surgery room out there, please do the surgery.

227
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,900
I'll watch over that patient.

228
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,960
I don't think I can do the surgery, I'm sorry.

229
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,280
Why? What?

230
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:25,260
I'm tired and I think Dr. Yoo can handle that surgery.

231
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,300
Dr. Yoo?

232
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,800
Dr. Yoo is someone who can do the surgery with his mouth.

233
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,000
There's no one from orthopedics to perform surgery either.

234
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,540
You're the only one, Dr. Han Woo Jin.

235
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,510
I'm sorry. I'm too tired out.

236
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:46,610
Please look for another doctor.

237
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,530
Prof. Han.

238
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:58,100


239
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:13,930
Ah! What is this?!! What is this?

240
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:17,100
Hey!! This is Dr. Lee's friend.

241
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,160
Why is it so big?

242
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,260
An Dae Gil, you have no responsibility do you?

243
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:27,420
After you burst the patient's blood vessel while dozing off, can you sleep right now?

244
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:30,410
It's because of you, Teacher Lee and I...

245
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:34,460
We went through so much trouble trying to save Chief Choi's daughter. But can you sleep right now?

246
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,920
So that's why you shouldn't order me around while giving me some rest.

247
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,580
Am I a robot? Being fine without sleep?

248
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,290
This here is an illusion of passion.

249
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,100
Are you the only one who didn't sleep? Huh?

250
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,890
Nurse Park can't sleep, I can't sleep, Teacher Lee can't sleep...!

251
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:50,020
Stop using violence. I'm not your subordinate.

252
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,870
Do you know what kind of situation this situation is right now?

253
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:57,170
In a situation where Doctor Lee might get his license suspended, can you fall asleep?!

254
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:00,450
That.. What does that mean?

255
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:04,140
Eh, you useless guy, An Dae Gil.

256
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,400
She's a strange woman. Why is she always like this to me?

257
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,540
Ah, seriously.

258
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:20,560
Indeed, she's the Chief Kang. She blocked it with that.

259
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,480
Congratulations on the reverting of your license.

260
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,080
I'm worried from now on.

261
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:31,200
I really can't imagine Lee Hae Sung not being a doctor.

262
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,010
I don't think I did any wrong.

263
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:39,180
I'm not sure... How about counseling? Is it doable?

264
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:43,550
It's not easy meeting people who are in despair.

265
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:47,270
Still, I think I'm relieved that I became psychiatrist.

266
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:50,580
Just by listening, I can treat them.

267
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,300
Thanks to them, I got this precious thing in treatment.

268
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,400
Wow. Is it an apple?

269
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,550
It's good.

270
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:05,540
I ate it, too, but I felt sad.

271
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,900
Due to the earthquake, people lost their houses.

272
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,440
I heard apple grows on the apple tree.

273
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,950
A grandma got body aches while trying to get at least the apples.

274
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,460
It's a tear filled apple.

275
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,630
Ah, so digusting! I'm going to throw it away.

276
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,720
Hey!!

277
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,380
An Dae Gil, have you gone crazy? What are you doing?

278
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,740
Jung Ddol Mi tried to cut my nose with this.

279
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,450
Who is she to always use violence?

280
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:36,680
I've never gotten hit by my parents.

281
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,230
Don't get so agitated and tell me properly. Where's Dol Mi?

282
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,080
When she couldn't even perform a thoracentesis and had a nurse do it for her.

283
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,260
Hey! You should know what you can say and what you can't.

284
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,590
Don't blame others. Just thinking about doing your duties as a doctor correctly.

285
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,600
Don't be like this, too, Doctor.

286
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,510
It's you who had went through surgery that you aren't confident of in the first place.

287
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,760
There is no Doctor that does surgeries with confidence.

288
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,330
So what kind of situation are you in right now?

289
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,650
Your medical license is right under your nose.

290
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,930
Stop saying those kinds of things.

291
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:22,200
I was really mean, right? Just now.

292
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,210
Yes, it wasn't cool.

293
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,370
It's not because of my pride.

294
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:31,100
I know, you must be frustrated.

295
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:35,500
You must have wanted to do a good job as that surgery was an important surgery.

296
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,080
You didn't want to make any mistakes.

297
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,670
You must resent yourself who makes mistakes.

298
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:45,290
'Why couldn't I do it well?' You must be frustrated and angry.

299
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,990
And you might be sorry, too.

300
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:51,540
You think it's all your fault if something happens to the patient,

301
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,540
And the calm expression must have been haunted with fear.

302
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,650
You probably think that you caused this to happen to Lee Hae Sung's medical license.

303
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,060
Is psychiatry a skill?

304
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,430
Am I that obvious?

305
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,110
He is showing that much of a temper so it's not noticeable.

306
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,010
Do you think it would be obvious?

307
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:11,120
Then how did you know?

308
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:16,180
I thought what would you think if I was in your place.

309
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:19,700
That's the basics of psychiatry. Putting yourself in someone else's shoes.

310
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,730
Dr. An.

311
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:28,430
It's not your fault, Dr. An. Don't be too bothered about the surgery.

312
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,630
Just, I was tired, I'm sorry, and if I apologize, it's the end.

313
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,800
If it doesn't happen again, good.

314
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,600
Good?

315
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,950
Doctor, So Yeon is okay now, right?

316
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,530
She is over the danger zone.

317
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:51,150
Her recovery is outstanding.

318
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:52,370
Thank you, Doctor.

319
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:55,610
It's not it; Dr. Lee did all the work.

320
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:59,280
He sewed those blood vessels quickly and accurately.

321
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:03,330
The scar on her body will heal quickly, but

322
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:06,830
I'm worried about the wound to her feelings.

323
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,960
It's an age where she would be sensitive for awhile.

324
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,240
A person's mind changes.

325
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,460
Even with a leg like this,

326
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,170
I thought it would be good if she just lived.

327
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,300
Now,

328
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,270
how will she live like this?

329
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,840
Our So Yeon will win over it because she is like her father.

330
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,780
Except the part where she is great at dancing.

331
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,660
Then, you guys can talk.

332
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,500
I've something to attend to.

333
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,180
Thank you, Doctor.

334
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,040
So Yeon,

335
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,180
I'm saying this because your sleeping, but...

336
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,140
it's not because you're my daughter,

337
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,730
...coldly and objectively,

338
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,340
you're really pretty.

339
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,720
My daughter,

340
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,690
you're pretty.

341
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,110
Did you get hurt?

342
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,440
Ah.. It's nothing.

343
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,560
Because he said to be in a safe state for awhile.

344
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,170
What about So Hyeon?

345
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:32,560
She will be moved to the normal hospital soon.

346
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,860
Ah.. that's a relief.

347
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,210
Is the Chief inside?

348
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:39,940
His kid is in that state, I wonder how he worked.

349
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:44,490
I heard blood can't be hidden, you're just like your brother.

350
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,760
Excuse me?

351
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,770
Both brothers don't look at themselves and only worry about others.

352
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:54,800
Reckless, quick tempered and easily angered.

353
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,510
It's cold, right?

354
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,590
Yeah, it feels cold.

355
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:06,100
It is compartment syndrome.

356
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,920
The fibular artery is weak compared to the other side, right now.

357
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,850
Then, do a fasciotomy. Why aren't you doing it?

358
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,970
Prof. Han said he can't do it as he's tired.

359
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,260
What?!!

360
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,830
It should be easy for Prof. Han.

361
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:28,460
Lee Hae Sung, come see me for a bit.

362
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,430
Hey, An Dae Gil.

363
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,820
Doctor Yoo was looking for you... to make a person out of you.

364
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,900
Huh? Who is making who a person?

365
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,260
That doesn't make sense.

366
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:44,080
I'm sorry for earlier.

367
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,530
Earlier? What?

368
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:48,950
Being quick tempered, so arrogantly...

369
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,550
Forget it, An Dae Gil.

370
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:54,350
I don't really remember what arrogant act you have done, but

371
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,140
I was like that too back then.

372
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,650
Wow, Dr. An is handsome.

373
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:59,920
Like a man.

374
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,750
No. Well.

375
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,670
Doctor.

376
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:11,900
That Amsa-dong, isn't that your hometown?

377
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,460
Amsa-dong is where my house is.

378
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,540
The harm is getting worse as it goes.

379
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,880
It's getting worse as the golden time passes.

380
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,020
It's impossible.

381
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,850
Why? What's the matter?

382
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:37,150
Just now, I saw my mother's name.

383
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,420
Lee Bo Reum.

384
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,300
No, until we make sure, it's not true.

385
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,550
Yeah, they could have the same name...

386
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,100
What should I do?

387
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,890
Where do we verify it?

388
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:53,330
Firefighter, let's go ask him.

389
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:57,020
Born April 7, 1956, Lee Bo Reum, Female.

390
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,260
Please verify the death toll.

391
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:03,540
If I worked hard to help others,

392
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,070
I thought mom will be helped, too.

393
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,990
Even when Dong Ha returned...

394
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:13,590
Look, he's safe.

395
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,920
People helped.

396
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,640
My mom will be like that, too.

397
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,610
That's what I thought.

398
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,140
Doctor.

399
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,550
Hae Sung.

400
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,830
It's not true, right?

401
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:51,070
Tell me it's not true.

402
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,170
First, calm down.

403
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,970
It's not true, right? It's not.

404
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:59,830
It isn't true, right? Tell me it isn't.

405
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,990
I'm sorry, So Yool.

406
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:27,200
The potassium level is high.

407
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,030
This patent is seen by Chief Kang?

408
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,170
Is the person who will perform the surgery decided?

409
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,780
Chief Kang did check,

410
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,560
but I don't think there is a person to perform surgery right at this moment.

411
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,070
They're all doing surgeries...

412
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,920
From earlier he has been vomitting.

413
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,030
Doctor! Bed 11 is having a seizure!

414
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:43,240
You need to come here fast.

415
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,150
I see a tall T wave.

416
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,580
He has an arrhythmia, so do the ABGA again.

417
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,160
Calcium Gluconate 1 ampoule.

418
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,040
Administer it 13 drops/min in IV form.

419
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,600
Yes, Doctor.

420
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:10,530
Doctor Eun is so pitiful. What do we do?

421
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:12,470
There is much grief.

422
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,990
If she worked hard here,

423
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:17,100
she believed that someone will help her mother over there.

424
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,610
I am going to bring her there.

425
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:21,910
Doctor Lee Hae Sung will?

426
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:24,240
I don't have anything to do at the hospital anyway.

427
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,650
It's too far to walk.

428
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,410
I'll take her on my motorcycle.

429
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,680
Lee Hae Sung.

430
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,110
The patient who came due to an electrical shock, you need to perform the procedure.

431
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,360
Me?

432
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,420
Professor Han, you know Doctor Lee's situation.

433
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,510
The patient's condition isn't good.

434
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,990
It's hyperkalemia.
 

435
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,180
Tall T waves.

436
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:48,930
Seeing that the electrocardiograph is getting worse, if there's ventricular tachycardia, it could be the end. So, I'm getting uneasy.

437
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,770
ABGA is getting worse, too.

438
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,560
Professor Han can do it, then.

439
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:55,590
Yes?

440
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,280
I...

441
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,630
I need to care for Boss Lee's husband, too. I have things to do.

442
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:04,370
The director of the hospital told him to never step in performing the surgery though.

443
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:08,250
You obviously know the director of the hospital doesn't want him in, so why are you like this?

444
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,170
Let's do it. I'll do it.

445
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:15,360
If it's to that degree, we can't waste any time.

446
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,690
Doctor Lee.

447
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,560
It's not good for the patient to keep dragging it on.

448
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,240
If I'm going to get fired anyway, I have nothing to be scared of nor hope for.

449
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,500
What about Doctor Eun?

450
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,620
I should bring her there after I'm done performing the surgery as fast as possible.

451
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,220
Jung Ddol Mi, you'll help, right?

452
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,650
Do I really have a choice?

453
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,890
Nurse Park, too, please hurry up and prepare.

454
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,830
It was like that, huh.

455
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,860
I thought you changed.

456
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,560
What are you talking about?

457
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,540
That you're regretful, that you want to return to the old you.

458
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,020
That's not it.

459
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,560
It's because there is a reason for everything.

460
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,890
That's right. I'm sure you have a reason.

461
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,840
Did you want to push it onto Doctor Lee if something went wrong during the surgery?

462
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,570
Is that why you dragged Dr. Lee in while doing my uncle's surgery?

463
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,920
It's not like that.

464
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,050
I heard that you needed an expendable soldier.

465
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,410
Knowing the Director's thoughts,

466
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,450
And that soldier was Dr. Lee and you agreed.

467
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:16,360
If something goes wrong, it'll just get pushed onto Lee Hae Sung.

468
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,230
If it is a success, it's not Teacher Lee's doing?

469
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,820
I told you it's not like that.

470
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:26,070
Passing the surgery that you can perform to Dr. Lee Hae Sung and saying that you have stay by my uncle's side?

471
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,640
Does that make sense?

472
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,000
Park Ji Na.

473
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,910
I...

474
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:35,650
was regretting leaving you.

475
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,560
So I thought about going back, but...

476
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,960
I'm sorry.

477
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,850
It's not what you think.

478
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,670
I'm still an idiot,

479
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,460
and you're still the worst.

480
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:57,120


481
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,500
You must succeed. Even though you have a license, it's time-limited.

482
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,380
We are performing the surgery because we got consent from the guardian, but...

483
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,170
if something goes wrong, the director of the hospital won't stay still.

484
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,990
It's not a hard surgery, so don't worry too much.

485
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,810
Okay. So he's performing a fasciotomy?

486
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:23,860
Yes. The guardian signed it knowing that he is a doctor outside of the hospital.

487
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:27,780
There isn't much of a problem because Lee Hae Sung still has his license, but

488
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,410
I thought you should know.

489
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,490
So, I'm thinking of telling you my opinion...

490
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:41,190
Dr. Yoo... discharge the patient, Im Jung Hwa in room 502.

491
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,740
Yes? Isn't that patient Lee Hae Sung's mother?

492
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,160
There was no agreement with the guardian.

493
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,670
Teacher Lee, too, went in performing the surgery without my permission.

494
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,390
Discharge the person from the hospital.

495
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:52,300
However, the one who is in charge of it is Professor Han Woo Jin.

496
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,250
It just changed.

497
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,080
To you.

498
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,620
You're doing well.

499
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,730
It's my major.

500
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:11,200
I did orthopedics for three years

501
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,060
and worked at a pizza shop for three years.

502
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,570
With this, it's not that difficult.

503
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:20,010
If Jung Ddol Mi can do it, why can't Professor Han?

504
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:23,930
If the Director says anything, tell him that I did it.

505
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:26,070
Other hospitals, too,

506
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,790
have medical staff come in and out.

507
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:31,080
Would they say anything if I say I did it?

508
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:36,520
I don't understand why the Hospital Director is so antsy about not being able to get a hold of you.

509
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,340
It's all done now.

510
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,850
Something big has happened.

511
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,170
What? What is it?

512
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:44,290
Your mother...

513
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:46,620
Mom? My mom?

514
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,470
Yes, I think you need to go.

515
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,350
Go ahead. I can do it.

516
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,280
You finish well.

517
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,740
No.

518
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,710
You can't have her leave.
-I said move.

519
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:03,120
Lee Woo Sung, what is it?

520
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,230
This black pig is telling us to discharge mom.

521
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,400
What does that mean, Doctor Yoo?

522
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,940
The person in charge, Professor Han...
-The person in charge from now on is me.

523
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,690
It's according to the Hospital Director's orders.

524
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:18,900
He said to move the patient you performed surgery into this room.

525
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,180
Move.  
 - I can't move.

526
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,470
Why are you always doing this to me?

527
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:26,590
If you are going to nitpick, go nitpick to your brother who does anything his way.

528
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,280
Wait.

529
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,050
Wait for what?

530
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:32,760
I have to do what I was told!

531
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,110
You've to knock at least.

532
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:45,640
You can't do this to my mother  unilaterally.

533
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,480
You are the one who was  unilateral in the first place.

534
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,190
I even gently warned you.

535
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:54,120
Not to do anything at Mirae Hospital.

536
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,130
I wasn't wrong.

537
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:03,240
Performing a decompressive craniotomy on the increased cranial pressure patient.

538
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,920
What's so wrong?

539
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,500
Enough.

540
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,790
We are already on parallel lines.

541
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:11,520
Let's do our own work.

542
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,490
If you are going to forcefully discharge her like this, are you saying for my mother to die?

543
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:16,220
So!

544
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:19,430
If you don't want your mom to be released,

545
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:21,830
you yield Lee Hae Sung!

546
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,090
Is that...

547
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,250
the only reason?

548
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,500
A place where every room and bed is important,

549
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,390
as a disaster hospital,

550
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,650
a person in a vegetative state to be forcefully discharged,

551
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:35,000
we can bring this up to the ethics committee.

552
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,730
What do you want to do?

553
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:39,520
If...

554
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,360
something happens to my mom,

555
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,770
I won't stay still.

556
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:47,010
If something goes wrong,

557
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:51,010
it becomes your fault for what happens to your mother due to what you had done.

558
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,610
What do you wish for me to do?

559
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,660
Crawl.

560
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,930
Crawl... in front of me.

561
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,260
Earnestly.

562
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,480
Why?

563
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,050
What happened?

564
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,970
Let's wait a little more and see.

565
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:54,980
He says to discharge her after two days though.

566
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,990
I'll try to find a way.

567
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,890
That the two brothers only live thinking of others,

568
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,220
Doctor Jung Ddol Mi said that.

569
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:09,170
I do the thinking about others,

570
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,840
so can't you just think about mom?

571
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:17,260
It'll be fine if you do that.

572
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:26,630
Really? The Director?

573
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:31,160
Yes. Right now, Teacher Lee's mother is out in the hallway.

574
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,120
She's in a vegetative patient... What should we do?

575
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,050
I don't understand where does he want her to go at this state.

576
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,100
Please look after this patient.

577
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,810
You shouldn't leave this patient's side.

578
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:43,270
Yes.

579
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,110
Oh, it's peaceful.

580
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:55,780
Yes?

581
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,680
I thought that you weren't going to come out of the office.

582
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,170
What is it?

583
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,520
Talk to me about it.

584
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,080
About Lee Hae Sung's mother being released.

585
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,820
Sit.

586
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,850
I'm sorry.

587
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:22,160
That I changed the person in charge without your consent.

588
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,000
If you keep on doing this,

589
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,300
I will blow the whistle.

590
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,620
That I caused a medical accident.

591
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:34,790
The personnel that manipulated the chart.

592
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:37,370
The fact that it occurred with the lead of the Hospital Director.

593
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,860
It wasn't enough leaving my boat.

594
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:56,400
So, you want to crash my boat?

595
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,890
What do you earn from it?

596
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:02,140
Are you going to endure the sense of guilt?

597
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:07,710
I'm not moving not really because I earn or loose anything.

598
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,510
Is that right, Professor Han?

599
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:14,060
I didn't know you would say this.

600
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:18,460
There's a good thing after becoming a disaster hospital.

601
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,450
A patient with a low possibility...

602
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:23,980
should be thrown out.

603
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:28,260
If we hold an ethics committee meeting, Lee Hae Sung is 100% discharged from the hospital.

604
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,530
Now, I will hide my claws.

605
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:38,590
Anyways, I had no plans in really kicking her out.

606
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,320
Then why?

607
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,070
I'm giving him fear.

608
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:47,680
He should listen to my words in my boat.

609
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,240
The captain of this boat is me.

610
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,240
If you don't want to listen to me, you can become the shark's bait in the open sea.

611
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:00,790
Be careful. Be careful.

612
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,930
What happened?

613
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:09,580
It's a situation I don't know.

614
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,220
I'm just following orders from people higher.

615
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,540
Who?

616
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:16,040
The Director said to re-admit her.

617
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,880
Ah, our mom is saved.

618
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,640
Mom.

619
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,720
What about your mom? Did things go well?

620
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,410
Yeah. I don't know why but the Director changed his mind.

621
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:36,230
He's really a scary person.

622
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:39,410
He holds and then releases your lifeline.

623
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:40,780
It's pretty good.

624
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,610
From now, you should perform fasciotomies. You are better than me.

625
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,730
Huh? Really?

626
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:50,230
Even a bug learns to roll. Always ripping the heart

627
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,510
to tie it, then ripping it, it's really unnatural.

628
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:54,350
You try to do this type of surgery.

629
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:56,980
Do you think you would be flying high like right now?

630
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,600
It's a hyperkalemia patient.

631
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,230
Pay attention to the heart and the blood pressure tests.

632
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,970
Take good care of So Yeon, too. 
 - Okay.

633
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,510
Patient Lee Yeon Tak, too.
-Yes.

634
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:07,760
Thanks. 
 - Okay.

635
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:13,430
Oh, what was the name of the patient you last mentioned?

636
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,090
I'm saying there are lots of patients.

637
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:16,310
No.

638
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,400
What about So Hyo Jun?

639
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,680
Oh, An Dae Gil is taking care of him.

640
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,640
That's a relief.

641
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,220
No. Where do you think that is?

642
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:26,180
Then what do I do? Mom is like that. I have to go even if I need to walk.

643
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,330
Do I not go just because it's far?

644
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:28,960
Do you know what it's like outside right now?

645
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,660
In a panic, people aren't even following the law.

646
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,960
Do you know what will happen if a girl steps out?

647
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,360
You definitely can't go. No way.

648
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,300
Doctor An.

649
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:41,850
If you must go, go with me.

650
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:46,890
I was late, right? Let's hurry up and go.

651
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:48,420
What about your mom?

652
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,080
It's been resolved.

653
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,480
You can go? Is it fine for you to be absent in the hospital?

654
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,360
Woo Sung will be here with her.

655
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,370
Your mother became like this. Can you stay still like that?

656
00:41:58,370 --> 00:41:59,720
I'm sorry.

657
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,340
In this situation, why would you be sorry?

658
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,880
Thank you.

659
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:07,770
We're going on a motorcycle, so it'll be cold. Wear this.

660
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:11,040
No, you'll be colder. You wear it.

661
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,000
I'm going.

662
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,200
Doctor.

663
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,100
Send off your mom.

664
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,610
You don't have to come back, so rest at your home.

665
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:32,390
That's right. Even if you do come, you won't be able to concentrate.

666
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:34,700
Just rest well... what the...

667
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,210
This.

668
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,600
Here's the helmet, Doctor.

669
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,330
Don't worry about the hospital, and just escort your mom.

670
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:47,850
Thank you. I'll be back.

671
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:49,410
Put the helmet on.

672
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,530
Let's go in.

673
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:03,900
Yes.

674
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:09,720
I should have learned how to ride a motorcycle.

675
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:05,680
♫   That dazzling morning ♫ 

676
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:12,090
♫   You couldn't say anything ♫ 

677
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:20,300
♫ Even once ♫

678
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:25,610
♫ When you haven't even shown anything ♫

679
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:31,710
♫ You're getting farther, you're leaving ♫

680
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,500
I want to be alone.

681
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:42,290
♫ Will we meet again sometime? ♫

682
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:50,290
♫ I long for you, I miss you ♫

683
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:57,300
♫   Forgotten and disappeared♫ 

684
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:04,430
♫   Everything, that smile♫ 

685
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:12,430
♫ Only your voice remains ♫

686
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:24,340
I got it from the hospital. It must be your mother's possessions.

687
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,570
I know.

688
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:37,830
Every morning, my mom held this and prayed.

689
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,010
It always began with "Our daughter So Yool,"

690
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:47,690
and it always ended with "Our daughter So Yool."

691
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:53,700
She was a mom who knew nothing but her daughter.

692
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:57,560
During this time, I couldn't even find my mom.

693
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:03,100
Let's go before it's too late.

694
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,570
I don't want to go.

695
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,440
I don't want to see things breaking or falling.

696
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:14,830
I don't want to see people hurt either.

697
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,650
I, who is sending Mom like this,

698
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:22,000
am helping others as if nothing happened,

699
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,660
I feel like I'm sinning to Mom.

700
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:27,650
I can't go.

701
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:01,700
I know it's weird saying this all of a sudden, but

702
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:07,160
I feel like I have yet to become a doctor.

703
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,760
Why?

704
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:16,390
From a doctor's perspective, I worry more about the patients, but honestly,

705
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:20,730
I'm more worried about the person riding a motorcycle.

706
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:28,660
So, the person in there

707
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:31,180
should get well fast, so

708
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:36,000
that Doctor Lee's license won't be suspended... those thoughts.

709
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:41,240
Is everybody shaken up among the doctors?

710
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:01,940
After sending mom like that,

711
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,880
I still get hungry.

712
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:11,190
I'm such a bad daughter.

713
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:16,880
Seeing you take care of your mother with such devotion,

714
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,150
I reflected a lot.

715
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,560
I thought in the future, I

716
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:27,270
have to be good to my mom, too.

717
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,340
What is this?

718
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:36,000
What do I do now?

719
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,500
I can't do anything either.

720
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,040
It's not your fault.

721
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,350
I hate everything.

722
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:45,040
Everything breaking and falling...

723
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:49,460
Seoul, too, the hospital, too,

724
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,210
I hate them all now.

725
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:07,000
Ahjumma, give us another bottle.

726
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:25,350
I'm letting you see every side of me.

727
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:30,520
Hey... It's a side of you that I can't even see with my eyes open, but I'm being patient because I'm your friend.

728
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,610
Thank you, friend.

729
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:40,010
You seriously...

730
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,930
are zero points as a man, but

731
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:44,320
you're the best as a friend.

732
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,370
Hey.

733
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:47,810
I don't have any charms?

734
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:49,360
What kind of man has charms?

735
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,840
Well, for example,

736
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,900
cute Doctor An Dae Gil?

737
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,950
An Dae Gil?

738
00:49:56,950 --> 00:50:00,530
Hey... why? He's cute and sharp.

739
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:03,420
A bit of an introvert but also rebellious.

740
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:07,060
Hey, am I obedient and like a deer?!

741
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:10,480
That's why we are just friends.

742
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,250
I'm so thankful!

743
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,780
You said you're going to go to your aunt's? I've to go back.

744
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:21,080
Just a moment.

745
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:26,450
Why?

746
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:28,310
You want to come back a-again?

747
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:53,810
I know that this place is peaceful and safe.

748
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:57,010
I'm curious about the hospital, too.

749
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:01,410
Not curious about An Dae Gil?

750
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:03,280
Hey.

751
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,410
I.. understand if it's about An Dae Gil, but

752
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:09,280
if it's about hospital...

753
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:24,300
It doesn't bite you?

754
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:25,990
You're not scared?

755
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,070
You aren't answering.

756
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:30,680
It doesn't bite?

757
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:34,440
It...doesn't bite?

758
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,880
It doesn't bite. It's soft.

759
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,860
Whose dog is it?

760
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:50,860
Dong Ha, you're hurt. You can't keep on going around like this.

761
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,780
Hey, what are you doing?

762
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:58,550
Ah, the dog is hurt?

763
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:02,570
Hey, I'm a doctor who looks after humans. I'm not a vet. Give this to me.

764
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:06,690
You're a doctor if you help when one is sick. You fake.

765
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:09,890
Hey, what do I do if you talk like that, too?

766
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:13,960
I'm also someone who gets hurt! Doctors make mistakes, too!

767
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:21,360
Right, the dog can't say anything, so

768
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,250
it won't betray me.

769
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:24,940
I'll fix him.

770
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:29,600
You've to stay still, Mr. Dog.

771
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:35,320
You guys didn't really give him water, right?

772
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:38,420
The dog's tongue is very dry and he has signs of dehydration.

773
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:43,260
Okay, I'll give him water. So, you guys go inside and rest.

774
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:46,630
I'm bored. There's no cartoon movies either.

775
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:50,580
Mom is busy.

776
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:52,030
You're bored?

777
00:52:58,230 --> 00:52:59,650
Is it fun?

778
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:00,920
Ahjussi is the best!

779
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,970
You fixed the dog, too! Best, best, best!

780
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:05,900
Best? I am?

781
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:11,890
I don't really know what you said.

782
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:13,190
Here take this.

783
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:27,010
 Ahjussi. You're a good person. 

784
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:28,950
 Thank you. 

785
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:37,600
Since these kids are innocent, they know everything.

786
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:47,190
Hey, if there's something you guys want to eat, tell me!

787
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:49,900
Give us chicken!

788
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:57,200
Why are you looking at me like that?

789
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,060
Don't you regret coming back?

790
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:02,270
I regret it.

791
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:04,070
But what can I do?

792
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:06,780
I came here after getting connected with Lee Hae Sung.

793
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:08,210
Thanks.

794
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:10,230
You,

795
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:13,580
that thing, I'll keep it a secret.

796
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:17,690
Hey! If you say something, I become a doctor with many psychological problems.

797
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:20,020
You know that it will affect my job, right?

798
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:25,240
But, can't I tell just one person?

799
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,620
Who?

800
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:29,920
Hey. That's even worse!

801
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,750
Doctor Eun!

802
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:33,450
He's running like the wind.

803
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:35,820
Doctor Eun, you came back faster than I thought.

804
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:37,850
Are you okay? 
 - Yeah.

805
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:39,830
Ah, this.

806
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:42,020
Aigoo, why is it so heavy?

807
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:43,690
Are you really okay?

808
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:45,540
Nothing happened, right?

809
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:49,090
Yeah. I'm okay. I sent Mom off, too.

810
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:51,950
It's a relief that nothing happened.

811
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:54,620
You're kind of weird.

812
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:58,020
I'm someone who has become dead tired after escorting Dr. Eun on the motorcycle the whole day.

813
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,790
It harder for the person sitting in the back.

814
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:03,240
This motorcycle is rotten away.

815
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,740
Let's go in, Doctor. 
 - Oh, okay. Hey.

816
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:08,560
Hey, Eun So Yool!

817
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,630
Isn't this too much?

818
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:15,340
You guys look really close. It's obvious!

819
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:52,920
What's this smell? Wow, this is real food!

820
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,100
Wow, I really wanted to eat this for awhile.

821
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:57,840
This looks good! Is this homemade?

822
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,350
You're really fast.

823
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:02,080
My hands are typically very fast. You haven't seen me suture?

824
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,340
Doctor Eun, what is all of this--

825
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,090
Did you send off your mother well?

826
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:07,990
Yeah, I sent her off well.

827
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:11,430
While I was there, I bought crab and spicy rice cake from my mother's hometown.

828
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:12,980
You've been tired of packed lunches.

829
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:14,970
That's right.. always eating fried side dishes.

830
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:17,160
I really missed this soybean paste soup...

831
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,800
When did you have the time to prepare all these?

832
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,140
Doctor Lee has helped me properly.

833
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:24,780
I only acted like a deer.

834
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,540
Can I really eat this?

835
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:28,560
Because I have to be conscious of An Dae Gil.

836
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,140
Huh? Why do you have to be conscious of me?

837
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:34,110
Hey. You. Hurry and eat lots.

838
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:35,600
Okay.

839
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,900
Ah, why do you have to be conscious of me?

840
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,120
What?

841
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,030
To someone who has lots of charm,

842
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:51,080
I feel sorry that you've to eat these streets' tteokbokki.

843
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:04,700
Yes.

844
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:12,370
What?

845
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:15,150
Why are you always running away?

846
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,500
Because it's not my place.

847
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:30,370
I'm asking because I really don't understand.

848
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:36,030
Why? Exactly why did you revolt against the Director...

849
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:39,820
When you already knew what kind of situation Lee Hae Sung was in, why didn't you perform that surgery?

850
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:43,070
And...

851
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:46,810
when I criticized you of being the "worst,"

852
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:49,690
you should have made excuses or said something.

853
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:53,060
Did you do a conference with the director?

854
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:55,670
Did you change your mind?

855
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:57,450
It's nothing like that.

856
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:01,230
You know that I was trying to go back to you.

857
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:03,810
My tastes are right.

858
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:07,090
Don't think of coming back to me.

859
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:11,120
Are you being sincere?

860
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,470
Yeah.

861
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:24,510
Then, like this,

862
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:31,610
is it okay for me to remember you as the "worst" and an awful man?

863
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,220
Rather than remembering, I'd rather you forget me.

864
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,780
Yeah.

865
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:43,240
Han Woo Jin doesn't exist to you anymore.

866
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,020
This is really cruel.

867
00:59:53,610 --> 00:59:56,300
Once it's a no, it should be no forever.

868
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:00,350
Like a fool.

869
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:02,230
So miserably...

870
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:07,660
Like what you said, I'll forget you.

871
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:10,340
At least I'll try.

872
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:19,590
Yes.

873
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,900
Professor Han Woo Jin?

874
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,510
Yes.

875
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:31,100
I'm Mirae Group's corporate lawyer.

876
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:34,610
Why are you looking for me...?

877
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:38,450
Regarding the President Yong Woo's incident, Chairman Park Gun has

878
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:41,950
sued you and Lee Hae Sung for medical malpractice.

879
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:45,170
Sued?

880
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,740
What do you mean by medical malpractice?

881
01:00:53,100 --> 01:01:01,130


882
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:16,020
 I think there will be a problem if he doesn't wake up soon. 

883
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:18,630
  The Hospital Director will also try to suspend Han Woo Jin's license. 

884
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:21,220
  Do you want me to surrender? 

885
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:22,830
 What do you mean, national bankruptcy? 

886
01:01:22,830 --> 01:01:24,780
 Yeoido, Gongbok-do had cracks from the earthquake 

887
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:26,140
 and it's filled with water. 

888
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,210
  If something goes wrong, a sacrifice can follow. 

889
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:29,560
 Well, we don't even know if they might die or not, 

890
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,360
 do I tell them to just go and die? 

891
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,880
 Then, does this mean our country can go bankrupt? 

892
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:36,680
  Is a firefighter only an occupation to earn money? 

893
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,150
  The patient's condition isn't good. 

894
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:39,190
  There is so much bleeding, 

895
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:41,820
  That if we don't move him now, the patient's life will be endangered. 

896
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:43,510
 This surgery is impossible. 

897
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:45,930
  If he does die, who will carry the responsibility that follows? 

898
01:01:45,930 --> 01:01:47,790
  Please stop putting patient's lives on a balance beam. 

899
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:50,870
  Just like Dr. Lee Hae Sung, Dr. Han Woo Jin, 

900
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:53,360
  will you put your medical license on the line? 

901
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:56,290
 I will put my medical license on the line.
