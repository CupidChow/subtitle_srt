1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,550
  Why is it that we always wander around when an accident occurs? 

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,310
  Why does it always repeat? 

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,600
 I am specially appointing Goo Ja Hyuk as chief. 

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,950
  The roads have to be opened first for electricity, gas, phone, etc. to work. 

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:11,880
 Stay away from the building! 

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,390
  Do you think we carried him here only to clean up a corpse? Do something. 

7
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,120
  There is nothing we can do. Move him to another hospital. 

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,800
  If the hospital is like this, with hope are we going to save people? 

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,510
 Jung Ddol Mi, let's do surgery. 

10
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,090
 I said that we have no time! 

11
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,280
 Even if there is a 1% chance of survival, I will do everything I can. 

12
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,550
 Because I'm a doctor and that's what they do. 

13
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,840
 You can create a fuss later but please follow my words for now. 

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,730
 For a disaster, 72 hours is the golden time! 

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,640
 For a disaster, 72 hours is the golden time! 

16
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,990
 If we don't smooth things over at that time, 

17
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:03,980
 the damage of human life and property will increase geometrically. 

18
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:11,870
 So please, let's get moving. 

19
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,840
 End of meeting. 

20
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,030
  Episode 6 

21
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,250
Director of the fire department, see me for a second.

22
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,250
You've worked very hard.

23
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,980
You know that the fire department is very important at these times.

24
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,840
I'm doing my best.

25
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,460
Uhm...for handling this disaster,

26
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,800
consider saving life and providing water as the first priority.

27
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,810
Fire control is not the priority.

28
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,540
Yeah? But normally, they consider fire as the first priority...

29
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,680
There's information that public opinion is not good,

30
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,170
that 911 is busy extinguishing fire in rich towns.

31
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,030
It's unfair.

32
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,140
They are rescuing even without proper equipment in the field!

33
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,080
That's a conspiracy!
-I know, I know.

34
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:12,380
In our Yeonggwang district, too.  It's just that the road is so narrow that the rescue can't be done quickly.

35
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,620
Whatever, this kind of public opinion doesn't help disaster management.

36
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,390
What do you think I should do?

37
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,030
Save lives. Saving lives is the best you can do.

38
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:28,640
Yes, sir. Since this is something that my superior tells me to do despite the difficulties,

39
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,250
I will make sure to do it.

40
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,570
Please take care of Yeonggwang district. That's my local constituencies.

41
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,090
Yes!

42
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,630
Is there no way to get in contact with Department Head Kang in Mirae Hospital?

43
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,610
There are no satellite calls from them, and things are not yet restored to normal.

44
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,910
That is worrisome. I wonder how they are doing.

45
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,900
Minister...

46
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,860
The minister.

47
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,480
Ah, yes.

48
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,020
For now, as you have directed, we have undertaken the  Lemicon factory in China,

49
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,390
and we are withdrawing from India and Australia.

50
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,770
And we are buying construction materials in cash.

51
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,370
I like it. A monopoly is the important thing.

52
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,510
Hurry and do the research in one day, and gather the Yeonggwang Redevelopment Project team together again.

53
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,390
I understand!

54
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:38,600
I will set up Seoul again. This Goo Ja Hyuk will.

55
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,130
Did he regain his consciousness?

56
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,730
Oh Professor. Yes.

57
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,790
A while ago, he said he was in pain so I gave him some painkillers and he dozed off.

58
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:04,160
After looking at his x-ray, nothing was fractured. 
 So, I just bandaged him.

59
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,720
It's a relief that nothing is fractured.

60
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,950
I'm sorry. I'm sensitive these days.

61
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,310
I was really shocked.

62
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,200
It's wasn't like the normal you.

63
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,610
How could I be the same as my normal self? It's the first earthquake for all of us.

64
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:30,300
I know, right. It's my first time in an earthquake, too.

65
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:38,920
You need to meet your mom and dad quickly. Hm?

66
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:56,030
Supervisor, the patient is urinating well, and the wound is...

67
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,700
Oh, I'm not in Busan.

68
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,060
Since the patient's blood pressure is now up, stop the norepinephrine (medicine administered intravenously to raise blood pressure), and the volume status is improving.

69
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,310
It was hung because the patient was I/O negative (In/Out ratio of fluids, meaning the patient was fluid depleted/dehydrated), and I told you to take it out if it improves,

70
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,380
and you can sleep?

71
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,340
The norepinephrine hasn't yet gone through...

72
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,480
Stop sleeping and do it properly.

73
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,900
You can't even open your mouth in front of an intern. So embarrassing.

74
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,490
With those skills...

75
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,240
Doctor! 
-What?

76
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,150
Are you trying to give the excuse that it has been a long time since that policy ended?

77
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,650
Hey, even if you don't know, someone else has to know it very well.

78
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,370
Doctor, you know that you shouldn't be this way to me.

79
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,430
How long have you known me that you can make things difficult for me?

80
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,160
You holding onto me so I can't even go home.

81
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,660
What? Now you're telling me to not even sleep?

82
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,900
And what? I'm screwing around?

83
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,710
You didn't even feed me anything, or let me sleep!

84
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,200
Oh, I'm so irritated I can't speak.

85
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,780
There isn't anyone as shameless as you!

86
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,140
Hey, no. Hey!

87
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,420
Hey, Jung Ddol Mi. Stop!

88
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,430
Hey, Ddol Mi! Are you really leaving? Hey!

89
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,920
Hey, don't be like that.

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,980
I was worried that you hadn't eaten. I was waiting for you to say let's eat together.

91
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,530
Oh, yeah yeah!

92
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,720
It's true that I haven't been looking into any books these days because I've been busy.

93
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,650
But you know what, even if you scrape (attack) me like that, I'm not embarrassed at all.

94
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,980
Why? Because all I have to do is study!

95
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,280
What are you doing, still not taking it?

96
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,660
If you don't eat then, 
 I'll eat them all later.

97
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,400
Oh my, oh my.  What's the occasion? Jelly? And coffee?

98
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,090
Oh.  I have a situation,

99
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:49,900
That intern An Daegil seems to have good eyes for women.

100
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,420
He tried to flirt with me, with that jelly.

101
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,370
If you don't eat it, I'm going to get rid of it. I'm going to eat it all by myself, I'm hungry too.

102
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,790
Oh ok.  Go ahead, eat it.

103
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,280
So, the intern tried to flirt with you?

104
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,860
Please don't make a big deal of it.

105
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,040
Rather than it being his fault,

106
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,980
I don't know whether it's my fault or not.

107
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,800
Are you okay?

108
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:39,300
Actually, I'm used to things like this.

109
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,690
In Busan, the boys would give me things like this regularly...

110
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:57,560


111
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,370
We're enduring with two generators?

112
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,530
Yes. A few years ago, when there was a huge blackout in Jamsil,

113
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:15,560
hospitals were sued because they couldn't run the dialysis machines properly.

114
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,960
I always said that we shouldn't make those kinds of mistakes.

115
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,900
Please check and confirm.

116
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,300
Ah, yes. You, please check.

117
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,320
Normally, I did.

118
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,320
Oh! 
-What? What is it? What?

119
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,230
Oh! What's wrong with this?

120
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,000
Oh.

121
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,610
What's going on? 
 -This didn't leak.

122
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,770
If so, the alarm should've...

123
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,300
I know.  I said I'm aware of that.

124
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,970
Exactly how much do we have left?

125
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,130
Ugh, we should have charged it.

126
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,260
That's because the director said to cut the budget...

127
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,990
Seriously, what are we supposed to do?

128
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,470
Then, we won't even last for 2 days?

129
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,730
Even if something goes wrong, I know nothing about it.

130
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:02,260
I clearly told you that we should prepare according to the law!

131
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,400
The government will soon come to provide things.

132
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,520
But still, plan for transfer, Chief Kang.

133
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,000
There's a big chance we'll close down the hospital.

134
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,200
 There's not much gas left! 

135
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,030
We're the only place in Seoul left that you can get gas from.

136
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:27,560
You have to escape from Seoul so you won't starve. Okay?

137
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,050
Now, one liter for $10.

138
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,940
 Here, take these two containers. 

139
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:35,010
Two barrels has 40 liters, so it's $400.

140
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,200
Okay, here's it is.

141
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,390
Chief, I need to buy some gas. It's urgent.

142
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,800
I need to transfer the patients to the hospital. They're the twins who were just born.

143
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,680
Go and stand in the back of the line.

144
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,460
This is an urgent situation. If I don't move them quickly, the mother and twins will all die.

145
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,370
I know it's urgent but-

146
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,630
Get in line! Don't you know that there's no one here who isn't in an urgent situation?

147
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,290
It's really urgent, please let me cut.

148
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,040
Look at this guy trying to cut. My mother is a patient, too!

149
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,580
I'm sorry. I'm just asking for this favor. I'm sorry.

150
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:16,470
This man, who does he think he is? Seriously.

151
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:45,450
Blood pressure is 80. The pulse is around 110 and 120.

152
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,550
The hemovac drain and blood flow are normal.

153
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,790
As you can see, his urine is also coming out well.

154
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:56,810
A lot will flow out. Check on the I/O carefully. Don't forget to use an IV to flow in what flows out.

155
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,650
Go rest.  You seem tired after trying to run away.

156
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,170
Why would you bring that up?

157
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:07,720
The one who's been suffering is you, Doctor. I can take care of it here-

158
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,080
Go! If there's a problem, you're just going to call me again.

159
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,460
You can't go in here.

160
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:18,030
Do something for her. The kid is slowly dying.

161
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,400
Yes.

162
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,840
Is this his friend? The one with Damage Control?

163
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,920
Yes.

164
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,790
Another surgery in two days?

165
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:41,320
Yes. I think his condition will be recovered by then.

166
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,120
Dr. Lee.

167
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,440
Think of it as luck until now,

168
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,100
but from now on don't bring in emergency patients or even lay a finger on them.

169
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,300
Excuse me?  What do you mean by that?

170
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,140
I don't think the hospital's electricity will even last 2 days.

171
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,890
If we can't use a respirator, this patient...

172
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,570
Excuse me?

173
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:09,590
They originally said that the emergency generator could support two days,

174
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,650
but we've been deceived by the numbers on the document.

175
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,420
If the numbers are right, everything will pass.

176
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:21,520
All of the effort we put in trying to save them is about to be turned into dust.

177
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,450
Then, are we closing down the hospital?

178
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,330
There are only emergency patients who can't breathe or walk by themselves here.

179
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,590
They said to have a transfer plan.

180
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,330
A transfer plan?

181
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,210
The phone and the internet are all cut off. Do you have someplace you can contact?

182
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,970
What are you going to transfer patients with?

183
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,160
Helicopter? One-by-one.

184
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,030
How are we going to move 200-300 patients to what region and to what hospital?

185
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,800
They said they will accept it?

186
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,710
With our hospital is like this, are there no patients in other hospitals in Seoul?

187
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,150
Emergency personnel couldn't even move their vehicles and brought in a patient on a shopping cart-

188
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,950
Then what are you saying we should do? We can't do this, we can't do that.

189
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:10,270
Should we gather all of the dead patients and hold a mass funeral? Would that be better?

190
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,290
Have we ever even imagined

191
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,450
the electricity not coming into the hospital?

192
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:32,030
Oh, how do you know this? It seems you know a bit about this.

193
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,270
You wait a bit.

194
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,870
I'm going to win this.

195
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,670
Here you go.

196
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,370
Oh...you're even good to a kid.

197
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,010
Uncultured An Dae Gil

198
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:46,070
is actually quite compassionate.

199
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,270
I couldn't say anything earlier because I didn't have the opportunity.

200
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,470
But even if you did that because you had feelings for me,

201
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,260
I'll only accept the jelly and the canned coffee.

202
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,890
Not your heart.

203
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,130
Excuse me?

204
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,170
Because your father is an talented and famous doctor,

205
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,110
you must be rich.

206
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:11,570
But even still, you so easily signed the guarantee for someone else,

207
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,340
and it was a surgery that even the hospital director was against.

208
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,840
You're actually better than you look.

209
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,070
Aigoo, if there's a Nobel Meddlesome Prize, you would be the winner.

210
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,610
When was it that you were lecturing me? And now you're sweet-talking me.

211
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,310
The lip service isn't a joke.

212
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:29,750
Whatever I say goes. Don't be so stubborn.

213
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,310
Is it not possible for you to have a conversation without using violence?

214
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,620
Violence?  What violence?

215
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,070
This finger is violence, too? Huh?

216
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,660
Oh, I'm sorry.

217
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,440
Twin's father!

218
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,150
Why are you like this?!

219
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,230
Are you okay? 
- Why are you like this?

220
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,220
What's going on?

221
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,880
How did it become like this?

222
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:09,360
I barely found a place where they were physically handing out gas-

223
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,660
With their hands?

224
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,270
All of them have either collapsed or burned down.

225
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:16,460
Even the perfectly normal ones lost their electricity so no gas is coming out.

226
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,210
Even if I want to get gas, it's not possible.

227
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,820
What should I do?  My twins and my Sung Mi...

228
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,900
We got here after so much trouble.

229
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,620
Our Sung Mi, who couldn't even eat seaweed soup, is so pitiful. What should I do?

230
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,480
Be strong. You can't give up here.

231
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:40,820
Actually, the power from the hospital's emergency generator is almost used up. It's sooner than we thought.

232
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,920
It's true that it's in your hands.

233
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,720
You've to be strong.

234
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,100
Yes, I should.  I understand that.

235
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,820
Even though there's a possibility that I might die,

236
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,880
I'll take gas from any abandoned cars. I'll steal it if I have to.

237
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,390
  The treatment is done, right? 

238
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:04,350
Will you be okay?  It may hurt a lot.

239
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:08,040
I'm the twin's father and Sung Mi's husband. 
 I'm the only one they have.

240
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,170
I will be strong and get the gas somehow.

241
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,390
Please take care of my babies and my wife.

242
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,940
Yes.

243
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,640
If we put gas in the boat that I brought,

244
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:30,380
we could take patients out of here and overcome this.

245
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,860
But it's hard to do it myself.

246
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,900
Please come out if you want to help me find gas.

247
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:43,340
I ask of you.  Let's do it together.

248
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:48,050
Excuse me. Is it really possible to escape together using the boat?

249
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,990
Can the patients get on as well?

250
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,770
If we have gas.

251
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,410
I'll go.

252
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,770
Everyone, let's go out to the battlefield.

253
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,200
Let's go! Let's go! 
- Yes.

254
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,030
Is this food?

255
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,690
They can't think of making anything else
 as the gas is turned off.

256
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:31,060
Even if it's like this for us, the fact that patients are getting this kind of food, too...

257
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,670
We can finish this in one scoop. Who can we even take care of?

258
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:37,770
What are we going to do about the new mother? We should give her some seaweed soup, at least.

259
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,890
For her to produce milk, we have to give her some soup.

260
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:46,720
We don't even have an incubator here. It's not possible that we have powdered milk.

261
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,000
Then the twins... The twins will starve.

262
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,050
Twin's mom.  Have some water at least.

263
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,450
You, Intern An Daegil.  What are you doing here?

264
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,970
I have to let the new mother eat some seaweed soup at least.

265
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,070
Where did you get this?

266
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,570
I brought it from my house.

267
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,770
Wow.

268
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,940
There's no more left. This was the first and last.

269
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,360
Oh.  Dr. An, you were here?

270
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,870
Yes.

271
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,870
The container leave it here.  I'll come to get it later.

272
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:48,690
I found some in the storage room. I thought it'd be good to use as a diaper for now.

273
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,790
Why is a new mother crying like this?

274
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,380
You'll really get a red nose like that. Then there'd be a problem.

275
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,330
I'm so thankful.

276
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,520
In a place where there's nothing,

277
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,460
I know how hard it is to get a sip of water or a spoonful of food,

278
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:15,430
but I wonder if I have the right to eat this.

279
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,360
Everyone's sincerity chokes me...

280
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,150
I'm so thankful, I don't know what to do...

281
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,570
Just raise the twins well.

282
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,780
Please eat it quickly.

283
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,300
Mom,

284
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,120
it's actually better that you're sleeping.

285
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:54,840
It's also good that you didn't see the Seoul I saw today and what happened to the Han River.

286
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:01,360
It's a relief that you didn't have to see me eating udon from a cup.

287
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,300
Mom,

288
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,240
compliment me that I'm doing really well.

289
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,620
So I can get the courage.

290
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,860
So I won't regret.

291
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,220
Ok.

292
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,090
Woo Sung is doing really well. He brought some more people he saved today.

293
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:40,420
He didn't say anything, but that's alright.

294
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,700
Oh.

295
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,120
I said I was taking care of her well but it seems you couldn't trust me.

296
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,740
You changed it already.  I came here for no reason.

297
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,550
I'm not a mama's boy,

298
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:05,160
but I don't know why I miss my mom again and again so much.

299
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:10,670
Ah. I got confused because you didn't tell me she changed rooms.

300
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:14,900
Every patient leaves this hospital room after they are cured.

301
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,460
As soon as there was an empty room, I moved her.

302
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,750
Oh, yeah?

303
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:22,300
When my mom wakes up, I'll treat you something really big.

304
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:33,700
 

305
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,120
  All of the electricity is out so why would you ask that? 

306
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,580
Captain, your house was on the first floor, right?

307
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,750
Hey, Woo Sung, look at the floor well.

308
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,220
Hyun, really...

309
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,180
I'm sure it's nothing.

310
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,120
They probably went to their relative's.

311
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,020
We fought.

312
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,520
She probably took Seo Yeon and went to her relative's.

313
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,820
It's a relief.  A huge relief.

314
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,640
It's really a relief among all this misfortune.

315
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,390
Give me the light.

316
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,500
We fought well.

317
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:00,500
Any explanation will probably seem like an excuse, but

318
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,640
please live.

319
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,430
I'm so sorry, Min Cheol.

320
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,670
What are you doing, Dr. An?

321
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,190
Oh, Prof.

322
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,550
What were you doing?  Holding the patient's hand?

323
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,020
Platelet count.

324
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:39,020
A patient whose hand you were holding on so tightly to is about to go.

325
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,070
You might as well prepare yourself.

326
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:41,970
Eh?

327
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:44,020
The light will be gone,

328
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,720
there will be no medicine or the blood.

329
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,210
Even Japan, which is skilled in disaster relief, needs at least three days to provide supplies.

330
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:55,450
Will this patient be able to last until then?

331
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:01,290
You lost your reasoning because the patient was your friend

332
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:04,690
and you were delirious to Doctor Lee Hae Sung's shocking show.

333
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:09,430
The patient will leave soon and the hospital will end up taking more burdens.

334
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:12,530
Become a doctor who expects at least that much.

335
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:15,010
Don't just be emotional.

336
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,370
Professor, as you can see, I didn't even get to sleep,

337
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:35,570
but...

338
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:39,990
Of course, I've been looking after him, so the patient has gotten a lot better.

339
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,190
A doctor's sincerity is very important.

340
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,020
He got better?

341
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,450
What were you doing while the platelet count became like this?!

342
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:51,360
Eh.. What?

343
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,480
When did it drop so much?

344
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,290
Go downstairs immediately and bring a blood platelet IV.

345
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,150
Right away!! 
- Yes.

346
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,420
Yes..

347
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,300
The chart!!

348
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,080
Here.

349
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:16,030
Look, your brother who saved you is doing fine, right?

350
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:20,180
We will save him. Don't worry.

351
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,610
He didn't die.

352
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:27,310
So, stop crying.

353
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,970
Dr. An Dae Gil,

354
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:34,480
take her somewhere, play with her, and console her.

355
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,320
I'll do the baton touch for the emergency room.

356
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,300
Why? Why would I?

357
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,220
Let's go.

358
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,360
Hey!

359
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,710
What is it now?!

360
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:55,460
Look at the platelet count examination!

361
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,770
It dropped so much, can't you tell?

362
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:03,310
No way, Prof. Han didn't say anything when he looked at the chart. Why are you making such a big deal?

363
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,550
Prof. Han looked at the chart and didn't say anything, you say?

364
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,900
Say something reasonable, will you?

365
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,770
Hey, look at it yourself.  With your own eyes.

366
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,910
Platelets...

367
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,530
Is this all you have?
- Yes.

368
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:26,370
Is this even enough? Anyways, Professor Han Woo Jin is going to use this for the patient in the ICU.

369
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,500
Yes, the ICU.

370
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,910
Yes.

371
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,450
Give us blood platelets.

372
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:51,230
Doctor Yoo Myung Hyun took it all,

373
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,790
saying that Prof. Han Woo Jin was going to use it.

374
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,150
Prof. Han?

375
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,340
There isn't any left?

376
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,820
No.  Whatever we had, he took it.

377
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,190
You need to have some. We need to put in at least a little.

378
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,830
Who did he say it was for?

379
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,930
Does it say anything on the records?

380
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,100
He's in the ICU.

381
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,810
The ICU?

382
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,430
It dropped suddenly.

383
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:21,680
Even until a few hours ago, it wasn't this bad.

384
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,600
I'm sorry.

385
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,500
I also think it's weird...

386
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,740
What's the matter?

387
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,550
So the platelets? Could you hand them over?

388
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,950
Why? 
- What do you mean, why?

389
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:51,740
We are all trying to save patients.

390
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:54,600
Anyhow, your patient will die.

391
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,060
My patient has recovered a lot.

392
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:03,470
We have to make difficult decisions with our limited resources.

393
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,370
Has the answer come out?

394
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,240
Prof Han.

395
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,110
This patient and that patient were both ones that I watched over,

396
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:18,310
and I was the one who didn't give up.  But why are you the one that is giving the answers?

397
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,600
What?

398
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:22,390
Share it evenly and give it to them.

399
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:25,360
This is what I, the caretaker, did.

400
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:31,260
Because he is the patient you took a scalpel to, listen to your words?

401
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,250
Lee Hae Sung,

402
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,670
this is the moment to decide.

403
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,590
This is the moment where we have to decide between the two.

404
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,260
You're trying to kill both of them. Don't you know?

405
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:50,590
Only God can make that choice, not doctors like us.

406
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:54,120
God? This is just a simple calculation.

407
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,960
Even 8 packs aren't enough. It's better to give it to the person with the higher survival rate.

408
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,710
This is a calculation that even an elementary school student can do.

409
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,620
How is life a arithmetic calculation?

410
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:07,330
The platelets. Give them to the patient in the isolation room.

411
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:09,810
Chief Kang.

412
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:12,620
Prof. Han, let go of that collar.

413
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:15,310
Think about the others around you watching.

414
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:20,010
Dr. Lee Hae Sung, give up.  We don't have a choice.

415
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:22,530
Chief, you saw it, too.

416
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,880
A younger patient recovers more quickly!

417
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,610
Why give up without even trying?

418
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:30,380
We're doing this so we won't give up. We have to save at least one life.

419
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,760
We have to be cool-headed.

420
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,870
Prof. Han's words weren't wrong from the beginning to the end.

421
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:42,800
Even though Patient Jung Min Cheol is on the brink of death, his rate of recovery is very fast.

422
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:47,990
But giving it to the patient in the isolation room without a single thought is-

423
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:51,480
That patient... Is it because he's a VIP patient?

424
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,440
Lee Hae Sung!

425
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,700
If you tell me it's not,

426
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,260
then I'll believe that.

427
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,290
It's not.

428
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,930
Lee Hae Sung, think logically.

429
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:08,250
Who has a higher chance of survival?

430
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:12,190
If the platelets are given to Kang Min Cheol,

431
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:15,260
the patient in the isolation room could be in danger.

432
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,370
There are no more blood platelets?

433
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:20,070
Then it's right to give up on that patient.

434
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:23,630
From now on, don't give him medication or even administrate to him.

435
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:26,400
This is the choice and the focus we're going with.

436
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,320
Leave him to die?

437
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,260
In a place where there's no electricity or medication,

438
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,370
you're the one who made it like this.

439
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,120
Don't forget.

440
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,060
You agreed to follow the hospital rules, that's why you remained here.

441
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,850
If you're going to continue to be like this,

442
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,490
I have no choice but to report it.

443
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:11,820


444
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,490
This patient and that patient are both Doctor Lee's patients.

445
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:18,990
Prof. Han's words are right

446
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:21,040
and Prof. Lee's words are right, too...

447
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,630
Call all of them into the emergency room.

448
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:52,710
As you know, the hospital's blood supply is dried out.

449
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,800
We can't contact the blood bank and

450
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,580
there's no way for them to know and send it to use either.

451
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,800
But...

452
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,070
I have a very good solution.

453
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:13,030
My MR motorcycle.

454
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:16,350
Are you telling us to ride that and go?

455
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,760
Doctor Yoo is always fast. You're very smart.

456
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,730
That's why I like you.

457
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:22,040
I'm trusting you, Dr. Yoo.

458
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,200
I want to go but I have to care for the patients.

459
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,140
You know that

460
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,400
the emergency room will be in chaos without me.

461
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,990
I heard most of the electricity went out so it's going to be too dark.

462
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:35,530
Hey, the patient's life is dark.

463
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:38,190
That's right, Min Seok. You said you delivered pizza before.

464
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,680
You go.

465
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,580
Because I have night blindness, I can't ride a motorcycle in the dark.

466
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,480
An Dae Gil, there's only you.

467
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,310
I only ride 4 wheelers.

468
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,560
Just go. It's the same. 
 -What's the same?

469
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,050
So unfair, it's a sports car!

470
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:55,040
This guy... is a motorcycle athlete.

471
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,390
What are you saying?

472
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:01,420
I don't even have a motorcycle license,

473
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:04,620
and I'm not confident because yours is really big.

474
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:08,850
Min Cheol is a friend but truthfully, I'm scared.

475
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,910
What is this, all of you?!

476
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:18,410
 Me. I'll go. 

477
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,530
Do you know how to ride a motorcycle?

478
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,860
Is it a lot different than a bicycle?

479
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:30,230
Do you even know where the blood bank is?

480
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,390
The navigation on my smartphone runs really w-

481
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:37,460
That's right. It doesn't work.

482
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,310
Fine.

483
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,050
I'll go.

484
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:57,490
Let me ask a favor, Yoo Myung Hyun and An Dae Gil.

485
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:00,220
Don't cause any trouble like you did a while ago.

486
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:04,940
Until I return, you must keep the patients alive.

487
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:09,670
Otherwise, you guys will have to choose your coffins,

488
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:14,540
whether they are made from wutong wood or apple wood,

489
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,790
then you guys do whatever you want.

490
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:22,000
And also, everyone here

491
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,480
take some blood out and donate it to the patients at least.

492
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:35,270
That way,

493
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:41,120
for a doctor who can't even go outside,

494
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,430
isn't saving a hundred patients the least you could do?

495
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,310
Should I follow along?

496
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:14,460
It's dangerous outside and if you have a lot of blood then it can become heavy-

497
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,030
You're more scary.

498
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,490
What did I do that you're like this?

499
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:20,640
Hey, Jung Ddol Mi. 
 -What?

500
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,340
I think you're quite capable. You turned them into useless troops in a second.

501
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,740
Ah, well I didn't do it to be like that-

502
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,710
You weren't sleeping?

503
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,460
What is this?

504
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,560
  This will protect you. 

505
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,320
  Everyone in the subway survived because of this sound. 

506
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,180
  This will protect you, too. 

507
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,650
  Please save my brother. You must. 

508
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:05,990
She's probably saying it's best if you take that with you, or something like that. Right?

509
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:10,330
I got it. I'll go and return safely.

510
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:13,020
Jung Ddol Mi, go and put her to sleep.

511
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,270
Na Ri, let's go and sleep.

512
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:17,220
You'll grow taller that way.

513
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,930
You need to sleep early. If you don't, you'll end up like that unnie.

514
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:23,320
Seriously...

515
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,830
I heard.

516
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,760
That you're leaving now.

517
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,490
The patient's platelet count is really bad.

518
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:51,340
You know what it's like outside.

519
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,000
Even if I know, I have no choice.

520
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,460
I don't want to see a patient die in front of my eyes while I can't do anything again.

521
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,590
Hae Sung.

522
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:03,020
Just together. With all of us together,

523
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:07,340
I wish for nothing to happen to anyone. 
So, don't stop me.

524
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:12,590
I won't stop you. I know I can't stop you anyway.

525
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,250
I'm just like this because I'm worried.

526
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:19,220
I'm going so I can survive, so my heart can be at ease.

527
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,210
If I don't go, then I will have to get medicine from you.

528
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,370
Wear this.

529
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:27,690
I bought this as a present for you when you started working at Hangang Mirae Hospital.

530
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:31,040
The night air is cold.

531
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,610
If you catch a cold, it'll get complicated for the patients you're trying to save.

532
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,490
Thanks.

533
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:42,810
On the way to and from the blood bank, don't even blink or get off the motorcycle.

534
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:46,700
It's much more dangerous outside than what you're thinking.

535
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,910
I got it.

536
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,380
I'll be back.

537
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,450
I'm sorry. You weren't even in but I put her to sleep without asking.

538
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:25,150
It's okay.

539
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,360
She's hard of hearing, right?

540
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,700
Yes. Without any parents,

541
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,650
it was a bit iffy for me to ask her to stay in one place with strangers.

542
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:35,670
I understand; you did well. It's more comfortable here anyway.

543
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,760
You don't have a pillow. Pillow...

544
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,850
Oh, I should at least give her my neck pillow.

545
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:48,540
As expected, a mother is different.

546
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:51,010
Is that so?

547
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:54,270
I saw the picture of your son on the desk.

548
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:57,300
Even if you placed him somewhere safe, you would probably be worried.

549
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,350
You're really amazing.

550
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,510
What is it that keeps me here?

551
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,830
What?

552
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,860
My trust towards people.

553
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:16,680
The trust that someone will help my son just as I help others here.

554
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,230
Yes.

555
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:22,680
But did the kid go somewhere?

556
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,460
Ah, it's nothing. He's doing well.

557
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:29,890
You should go and rest.

558
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:33,420
It's a protocol that you get some sleep when there are no patients in the emergency room.

559
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,890
Yes.

560
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:37,220
Then, I'll leave.

561
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,280
Rest.

562
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:05,970
Please protect Dong Ha.

563
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,790
Please forgive me,

564
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:14,430
for all my shortcomings,

565
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,630
and save my son.

566
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:21,050
Protect him.

567
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:08,940
 When going and coming back from the blood bank, don't even blink or get off the motorcycle. 

568
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:13,220
  The outside is much more dangerous than what you're thinking. 

569
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,580
  I got it, I got it. Escort this man to the back. 

570
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:29,190
  It's dangerous, dangerous. 
- It's dangerous! 

571
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:31,350
 It's dangerous! No! 

572
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:35,980
What?  Hey!

573
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,700
Are there no sinks around here?

574
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,870
Using that water won't put out this fire.

575
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:43,980
The water in the fire trucks are already used up. The fire extinguishers are empty. Shit!

576
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,720
What about the aquarium at the intersection? Is there no water there?

577
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:49,790
How many buckets of water would it take to put out this fire?

578
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:54,830
Before we get resources, we have to help the wounded.

579
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:59,450
If this gets completely burned down, we'll be penniless! We won't be able to live!

580
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:02,250
You cannot go into the house because of the fire. Please calm down.

581
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:05,650
Headquarters, this is Yeonggwang Rescue Team.

582
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:09,530
Yeonggwang Area 43, there's a fire break out, we need support.

583
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:12,490
Yeonggwang Area 43, there's a fire break out. We need support.

584
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:16,350
 Yeonggwang rescue team, stop putting out the fire. 

585
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:21,030
 This is disaster management policy, focus on assisting disaster victims. 

586
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:25,490
 I repeat, don't try to put out the fire, focus on disaster victims. 

587
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:30,570
 I repeat, don't try to put out the fire. Focus on the disaster victims. 

588
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:35,550
Right now! Right now! Hurry and give us support. Otherwise the fire will get bigger and bigger.

589
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:39,250
 I repeat, don't try to put out the fire, focus on disaster- 

590
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:42,850
Elder, don't be like this!
- Stop him! Stop him!

591
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:46,090
Did I pay all my taxes just to see you all stand there and do nothing?

592
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,790
Don't be like this, Father.

593
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:49,190
Aigoo. Elder.

594
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:52,770
You're here to put out a fire, so why are you just standing idly by?

595
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:56,730
We can't do anything, Father! 
 -No, it's our house.

596
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:14,570
Retreat.

597
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:16,990
Take them and retreat.

598
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,510
I said retreat!

599
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:25,070
Here.

600
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:20,690
 Hey! 

601
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:23,550
 Hey there! What are you doing? 

602
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:44,130
This won't do. His platelet count dropped so much.

603
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:49,310
Blood is seeping from the wound. What about the JP drain?
 

604
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:51,490
It drained 20 CC in an hour.

605
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:56,750
The liver functions are normal, but there is bleeding from the intestines in the JP drain.

606
00:45:56,750 --> 00:46:00,270
Check on the JP drain regularly.

607
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:02,850
His blood platelet count is only 50,000.

608
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:05,190
It needs to go up in order for him to get another surgery.

609
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:09,390
Before Dr. Lee left, he told us to transfuse the patient's blood.

610
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:10,550
Is that so?

611
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:13,950
Should I go for a blood test?

612
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:18,330
If you're willing to do it, go ahead. First go draw blood and then test it.

613
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:19,410
Yes.

614
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:24,310
Manager, it's not just this patient's problem. All of the blood in the hospital is used up.

615
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:26,630
We need to find a plan.

616
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:33,050
I understand.

617
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:39,170
Hello, I'm Kang Joo Ran. The Director of Mirae Hospital for disaster measures.

618
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:44,550
Right now, we can't contact the blood bank, so we can't give blood.

619
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:48,050
 Among the medical staff and guardians, if there is anyone willing to donate blood, 

620
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:51,110
 please sign up. 

621
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:55,650
When there are volunteers, please go check their blood.
- Okay, Doctor.

622
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:59,630
 I ask you all to volunteer. 

623
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:06,490
We have to do the impossible.

624
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,750
Things will be more complicated.

625
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,790
No. Stay laying down.

626
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:32,250
Blood transfusion?

627
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:36,010
Yes. I did cross examinations, and they said it was okay.

628
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:42,910
How touching. The sense of duty of saving a patient's life that you even share your blood.

629
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:46,150
I don't have that type of sense of duty.

630
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:48,070
Then what is this action?

631
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:52,170
Ah...I just want to do this.

632
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:04,820
How many people do you think died and how many people do you think got injured from this earthquake?

633
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:12,000
It should be quite a lot. I saw on the way, there was a lot of damage.

634
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,580
Then 5000 people?

635
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:19,580
10,000 people? No, 100,000 people?

636
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:25,140
Your donating blood can save one person.

637
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,860
Out of those so many patients, what meaning does it have?

638
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:32,430
Jung Ddol Mi,

639
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:37,400
you should treasure yourself. I saved your life with difficulty.

640
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:42,470
If you raise your hand to ride a motorcycle like you did before, aren't you being a bit too much to me?

641
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:45,880
I'm sorry.

642
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:52,450
Teacher, may I ask you something?

643
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:53,890
What?

644
00:48:55,080 --> 00:49:01,550
When you saved me, did you save me thinking I was one of the 7,000?

645
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:03,130
7,000?

646
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:06,940
I heard that's how many people die in a car accident each year.

647
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,030
At the Busan Hospital, when I came in as a TA on a stretcher,

648
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:15,650
did you think that this child is also one of the 7,000, so

649
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:18,850
it's fine even if I give up?

650
00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:21,220
Jung Ddol Mi.

651
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,720
Professor,

652
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:27,150
even though I don't know if I can save anyone by donating blood,

653
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:33,450
even if it's one life out of many, isn't it the one-and-only life to that person?

654
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:40,430
Whether it's one out of 7,000 or one out of 100,000, I can't do calculations like that.

655
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:45,880
Because this patient is in front of my eyes, I want to save him.

656
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:54,390
Maybe, when you saved me, you had those same feelings.

657
00:49:55,390 --> 00:50:00,950
To anyone else it's one out of 7,000 but to the patient, it's 100%?

658
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:06,250
I don't know what caused you to change like this, but

659
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:12,520
the teacher I saw at Busan Hospital at that time, I want to see again.

660
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:20,940
Jung Ddol Mi, there are many patients in this world.

661
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:27,270
Even if I get fingers pointed at me saying I'm a cold doctor,

662
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:30,350
I'm a doctor that acts based on reality.

663
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:34,000
More than the one patient in front of my eyes,

664
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,360
saving the countless number of patients in the future, that's a more heroic doctor.

665
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:44,720
If you think that the me you saw at Busan Hospital was cool, then

666
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:50,130
Professor Jung, you have to get a little older.

667
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:55,910
Professor!

668
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:03,180
Can a doctor who can't even save the one patient in front of him,

669
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:06,740
save tens of hundreds of people?

670
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,940
  Professor Han Woo Jin! 

671
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,040
 Professor! 

672
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:31,470
  Your recovery is fast. You're even walking around now. 

673
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:33,710
 Professor, can we take a picture together? 

674
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:37,040
 What picture? 
- Like you, I want to become a doctor. 

675
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,780
 My mentor, Han Woo Jin. Proof shot. 

676
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,760
 Are you good at studying? 

677
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,760
 I don't know because I haven't tried, but if I try, I'll do well. 

678
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,220
 One, two! 

679
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,560
 What are you doing? 

680
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:55,840
 You even saw bare skin. This way, we can call it even. 

681
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,860
 Professor! 

682
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,620
 It came out well. 

683
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,600
How did a person change that much?

684
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:26,890
Can I have it all?
- Just know that this is the last of it.

685
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:29,400
Go over there with it.

686
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:38,550
Sung Hyun.

687
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:44,830
That man. It was a relief that he was alive. Did he have to use violence?

688
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:49,060
Hey, you rascal. Don't say things like that. Did you not see that man's hand?

689
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:54,420
His skin was wrinkled. The bag in the factory is probably everything he has in life.

690
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:57,340
It's like the sky is about to fall. What wouldn't he do?

691
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,340
Even though headquarters wouldn't allow us to do it, why don't we just put out the fire?

692
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:03,680
With what? Our hands?

693
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:08,130
We depend on equipment to put out fires. Equipment.

694
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:13,120
Without water or a fire extinguisher, we're not firemen or EMTs,

695
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:16,700
but just people who eat and poo.

696
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:19,410
Hyun Suk.
-Yes!

697
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:21,750
Can we use the wireless?

698
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:27,890
No. Not yet, but I'm still waiting.

699
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:31,000
Give it to me. Give that to me.

700
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,560
Minister Seok of Health and Welfare Ministry...

701
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,430
I heard he's injured.

702
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:39,370
Really?

703
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:43,200
There was an incident where the crane fell over because of a sinkhole before the earthquake.

704
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,320
At the Donggang intersection.

705
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,720
The name on the identification card was Seok Joong Won.

706
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,060
So where was he transferred to?

707
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:56,020
That's the weird part. Mirae Hospital said they didn't move him.

708
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:59,420
A doctor from Mirae Hospital took Minister Seok's uniform and

709
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:04,210
he said to not worry because he will personally look for a guardian.

710
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:07,500
I think his name was Kang...Chul...

711
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,880
Anyway, they said it was a female doctor.

712
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,050
You're driving me crazy!

713
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:15,910
Hey, hey. The minister is here...

714
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:21,540
I apologize. Choi Il Sub, the captain of Yeonggwang rescue team, keeps making a fuss.

715
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:26,620
That dumbhead. Turn it on. What is he saying?

716
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:29,360
  What? Are my words wrong? 

717
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:33,780
Captain Choi Il Sub, I'm the director of the fire department.

718
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:37,660
A person of high position does come out when I yell at my walkie-talkie.

719
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:43,280
 What is it? 
 - Director, even if I get a disciplinary punishment, I want to say everything when it still has battery left.

720
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,030
 When are you going to give us water? 

721
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:50,570
I got it. I will send it. Just wait a little. I said to just wait a little.

722
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:53,040
Just wait a little, I'll send it!

723
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,240
Even if you can't give us water to drink, you need to give us water to put fires out.

724
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:59,060
Even if you don't give us food, you need to give us gas to put in a vehicle for us to be a rescue team and firefighters.

725
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:03,530
If we wait because you tell us to, we can't put out fires, people are dying. We need to do something, too.

726
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:05,730
  I said to wait a bit! 

727
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:08,730
You come out here and see if it's a situation in which you can wait!

728
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:12,340
The houses are collapsing because of the fire and people are dying! People!

729
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:18,550
My-my team. Us firemen, without equipment....

730
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:21,420
Us firemen, without equipment,

731
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:23,170
they can't even drink or eat,

732
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:27,080
and we're using our bare hands to dig cement! Our bare hands!

733
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:31,060
Th-these firemen! D-don't you think they're worried about their family, too?!

734
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:34,200
Is it not possible? Aish!!

735
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,630
Is it not possible? We're still firefighters.

736
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:42,260
Who does it if we don't? So you need to let us do something at least!

737
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:48,960
What are you doing in that top position? Please let us do something, please!

738
00:55:52,930 --> 00:56:02,280


739
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:37,720
Excuse me! Excuse me, is anyone here?

740
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,660
Excuse me!

741
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:46,550
Excuse me!

742
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:49,140
Is there nobody here?

743
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:51,480
Yes?

744
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:54,630
Yes, can I get platelet and plasma as much as I can?

745
00:57:54,630 --> 00:58:00,140
Who are you? 
- Ah, I'm from Mirae Hospital.  My name is Lee Hae Sung.

746
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:02,400
There's no more blood in the hospital. Could I take some?

747
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,540
How did you come here when bridges collapsed and the streets are a mess?

748
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:08,920
Ah, what should I give you?

749
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:15,010
Platelet, frozen plasma, blood coagulants, and immunoglobulin.

750
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:19,720
It seems you got hurt. Are you sure you don't need to get treatment?
 -Ah, no.

751
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:24,600
The patient is in danger so I have to quickly get to the hospital.

752
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:32,220
Other staff? It seems no one is here. Are you here by yourself?

753
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:36,010
They all left. Since there isn't enough blood,

754
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:41,130
they automatically go to big nearby hospitals first. Since they can't get in contact with hospitals, they just go without any plans.

755
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:45,750
I mean, in this emergency situation...

756
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:48,250
if telephones don't work...

757
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:52,600
does it make sense that the hospitals, blood banks, and firefighters can't keep in contact with each other?

758
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,520
Exactly.

759
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:59,270
Are you gonna be okay? 
- Yes, yes.

760
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:02,960
You're amazing. You came all the way here yourself.

761
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,730
I have to sell my body since lives are important.

762
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:09,120
When there's blood supply available, please send some to Mirae Hospital.

763
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:13,010
You can only keep the subtances in the box

764
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:18,160
for 5 to 12 hours.
 - I need to go quickly no matter what.

765
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:37,320
 Doctor Lee. 

766
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:42,820
 Please save me. Doctor Lee. Here. 

767
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:48,360
 Save me. Please. Here, here. 

768
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:05,000
  How can you just leave us here, Doctor Lee?! 

769
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,410
 Take us out of here.  We can't survive as it's suffocating us. 

770
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:14,100
 Here, here!! Please save me! 

771
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:18,530
 How could you leave us so that you could live, Doctor Lee? 

772
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:25,380
  You abandoned us. You abandoned us because you wanted to live by yourself! 

773
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:30,580
No...

774
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:33,950
I'll rescue you.

775
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,450
Seriously!

776
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:03,680
  The government ordered Mirae Hospital to be the base for the firefighters. 

777
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,460
 Other support groups of the government are going to come also. 

778
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:09,660
 Accept using the hospital as a base and receive help from the government.
