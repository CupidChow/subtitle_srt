1
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,660
 Why are you, the leader, going into Yeouido? 

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,830
 Since I am the Captain, that's why I am going in, you punk. 

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,000
 If we initiate the collection pump by hand the water flow will be so strong that 

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,460
 from the direction the rescue workers are coming from 

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,910
 there will be a reverse current shift. They say that they may not be able to come out. 

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,960
  I'll go and bring him out,  don't worry and just hold the rope tight. 

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,250
 When you're done preparing, just pull on the rope three times.  

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,410
  We will pull when we get the signal immediately. 

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,620
 How can this be? 

10
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,770
  Our Woo Sung won't die. 

11
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,410
  He promised me, that until Mom wakes up...  

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,080
 - Woo Sung 
 - He won't get hurt. 

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,060
  
You must pay attention to whether there is blood flow.

14
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,140
Hello, this is the ER from Mirae Hospital.

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,720
That's right, the ER from Mirae Hospital.

16
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,010
Wha- what is this? Did the phone just ring, is that why I picked it up?

17
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,360
Yeah, yes. I heard it, that's why you picked it up.

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,190
The phone is wor- working, huh?

19
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,370
Hello, this is the ER from Mirae Hospital. Patient Park Mi Sun?

20
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:09,660
Ah, you'll have to come to the hospital personally.

21
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,320
The computer is not working so how could I look up the data base?!

22
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,580
The computers are working again, Doctor.

23
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,220
Ah really? The computers are working.

24
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,340
Yes, I'm busy. Yes.

25
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,230
The phone's working.

26
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,970
Hello, Grandmother?

27
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,160
Jung Won!

28
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,590
I'm at the hospital, of course. Grandmother, are you hurt anywhere?

29
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,550
Yes, Mom, Mom! Right now...

30
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:40,240
Oh, I came out of Hangang Mirae Hospital right before it was about to collapse. And now, I'm at Mirae Hospital.

31
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,950
They didn't let me go. Doctors and nurses... they all said that they can't do it without me.

32
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:50,440
I got it.  No, Mom, I'm in the wrong.

33
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,980
I couldn't even hold a funeral for father.

34
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,630
It seems things are falling back in their places slowly.

35
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,580
Right, Chief?

36
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:06,700
It seems like the electricity and communication systems have been restored in Seoul.

37
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,230
Because of Yeouido's pipe utility conduit...

38
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,630
 No, the call has been disconnected. 

39
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,460
Since the hospital has been lit up again, it seems like Mirae Hospital again.

40
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,170
CT, MRI.

41
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,100
Since the conditions of the roads aren't great,

42
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,560
of course, it won't be easy but I think they will be repaired shortly.

43
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,020
- Around when? 
- I thinking about next week.

44
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,010
Tell them to quicken the process.

45
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,090
And also, don't accept trauma patients.

46
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,810
From now on, accept appointments based on our specialty in cancer and the spine.

47
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,070
Yes, if we don't accept appointments based on our specialties, it would be our loss.

48
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,790
Of course, of course.

49
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,330
Our thoracic department, it's difficult to diagnose lung cancer and esophageal cancer without a CT.

50
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,950
Oh, oh, oh! That's the pathology and OB/GYN Chief.

51
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,360
Now, they have returned back to the hospital?

52
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,480
We suffered and endured so much with not even 1/10 of our staff. And now, they return?

53
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,420
It seems like they came back after watching the news.

54
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,960
You know that Samcheonpo Mirae Hospital will open shortly?

55
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,250
Since the Chief of Thoracic Surgery and those two are so outstandingly skilled,

56
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:14,200
I'm thinking of giving them the opportunity to advise in the regional medical development of Samcheonpo.

57
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,110
Ch- Chairman.

58
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:22,660
I'm going to have a meeting to have Dr. Lee Hae Sung's doctor's license stripped from him.

59
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,760
Will you help me?

60
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,920
  Firefighter Lee Woo Sung 

61
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:47,460


62
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:34,250
The sacrifice of one young firefighter

63
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:39,660
has protected the wealth and life of the citizens of South Korea.

64
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:45,120
The fact that he reignited the dying flame of this nation's advancement,

65
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,400
we all must never forget.

66
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,520
The debt we carry due to his sacrifice,

67
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,420
not the Seoul that he has last seen,

68
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:02,960
 but to create a more energetic and beautiful Seoul, 

69
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,490
 we need to make an effort to do so. 

70
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,490
In sacred memory, Firefighter Lee Woo Sung...

71
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,650
Thank you.

72
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,980
And I am sorry.

73
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,360
 Rest in peace. 

74
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,820
After Doctor Lee lost his brother, there's no words to describe his grieving.

75
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,460
The whole hospital has become a mourning house.

76
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,520
There was no way that you could have stopped Firefighter Lee Woo Sung?

77
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,560
I didn't know.

78
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,310
Even if I did know about it, there was nothing to be done because he volunteered.

79
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,470
In any case, it turned out unfortunate.

80
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,850
Let me request something from you.

81
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:08,230
Is there a way to help Doctor Lee Hae Sung?

82
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:12,050
The hospital director is up in arms saying that he'll strip his doctor's license from him.

83
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,590
His license? Why?

84
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:18,950
The reason was because of a reckless medical treatment, but he just messed with the Hospital Director's pride.

85
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,360
So, he beat his head against a wall. Is that it?

86
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,980
It's a bit similar.

87
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:31,900
The reason that Mirae Hospital was able to become a good base of disaster was because of him.

88
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,240
Alright, I understand.

89
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,640
Where is Doctor Lee Hae Sung right now? Can you bring him?

90
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,540
Thank you, Eun Sol for even preparing flowers.

91
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,220
I received this from Woo Sung.

92
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,010
What's that?

93
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:57,450
Ah! It's a love letter, a handwritten letter.

94
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,670
The concert that he had planned to go to was cancelled because of the earthquake.

95
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,610
And if it happened again, he said me to come with him.

96
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,840
Perhaps it's Kim Jong Seo?

97
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,300
You know.

98
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:14,220
Woo Sung told me that he met him while he was working part-time.

99
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:19,730
He probably unexpectedly met him by chance, but he liked it very much.

100
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,780
I couldn't even answer that I would go with him.

101
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,100
If they do it again, I should go.

102
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,700
By yourself?

103
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,590
No.

104
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,160
With Woo Sung.

105
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,800
Thank you.

106
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,080
Can I interrupt?

107
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,200
Ja Hyuk said that he has something to say.

108
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,660
Are you saying forgiveness?

109
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,920
I am in great fault.

110
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:11,840
No, I couldn't protect Woo Sung. I'm at great fault.

111
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,560
I found out later that there was something wrong with the Yeouido pipe utility conduit drainage pump layout

112
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,870
and that's why I couldn't intervene before to stop him.

113
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:24,910
I went inside first knowing that the work was quite dangerous.

114
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:28,420
And Woo Sung later came to save me after hearing about the problem.

115
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,420
There was nothing that we could have done. In a situation where we needed to remove the water immediately,

116
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,500
the nation's economy...

117
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,630
Wait a minute, wait.

118
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,370
Our Woo Sung,

119
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,140
he didn't die in vain, right?

120
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,340
It is true that he rescued a nation that was put in danger.

121
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,400
It was because I, as a Chief, didn't do well.

122
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,680
He saved me and he sacrificed on our behalf.

123
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,230
I am a sinner.

124
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,380
No, Chief.

125
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,980
Rather than thinking about who is responsible,

126
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:12,820
if my Woo Sung made the right choice,

127
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,300
that is enough for me.

128
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,300
I am sorry.

129
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,260
The bus is leaving, everyone's waiting.

130
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,400
Really.

131
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,110
Thank you for coming.

132
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,630
You must have disliked seeing me, since you hate me.

133
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:48,430
Well, I hate you a bit, but it's not like I hate Woo Sung.

134
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,950
You resented me a lot because of your father's surgery, right?

135
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:59,670
With my medical knowledge, of course, my father who has a spleen rupture was priority.

136
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:04,240
I wondered how an aortic aneurysm patient could be priority...

137
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,890
I'm sorry. Truly.

138
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:11,780
But right now, I don't resent you and I understand.

139
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,130
You didn't even see the ultrasound.

140
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:19,190
But from instinct, you already knew that the aorta would rupture.

141
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,040
Thank you.

142
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:27,030
For understanding me, who doesn't even know myself.

143
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:32,270
What are you two doing? The ER has gone wild. We need to get going.

144
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,530
Yes.

145
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:52,940
If you look at it with your eyes, you can confuse it with the rocks, so it'll be harder to catch.

146
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,770
With only the sensation on your finger tips.

147
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,260
Wow! I can even catch sea cucumbers.

148
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,730
Aigoo!

149
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,000
I also caught one.

150
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,360
Wow! You caught a really big one.

151
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,270
Eat it. It's fresh.

152
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,640
Yes.

153
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:31,170
Why? Is it slippery? Uh? Let's see.

154
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,950
Eat it. I washed my hands, so don't complain.

155
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,010
What are you doing? My arms are hurting.

156
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,800
Yes... well...

157
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,730
I don't want to eat it. I'm full now.

158
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:04,410
Perhaps... can you not see?

159
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:14,540
It's all my fault... for passing along this wicked disease.

160
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,470
After all that suffering, you became a doctor.

161
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,800
Trying to send you away from this small environment,

162
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,550
until my hands became like a hard shell,

163
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,950
you were my hope and my life worth living.

164
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,730
Mother, please...

165
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:38,750
I know your struggles and I know how many tears you cried while living life.

166
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,690
So, I know that you are also worried about my future.

167
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,340
But what can I do?

168
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,830
Everything doesn't go my way.

169
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,590
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Woo Jin.

170
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,820
It's all my fault.

171
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:01,340
No, Mom, I'm okay. I'll become fine.

172
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:06,140
Where are you going? Where are you doing, Woo Jin?

173
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,940
I am going outside for fresh air.

174
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,350
Pardon me.

175
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,900
- Who is it? 
- Hello, I came to find Dr. Han Woo Jin.

176
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:12,260


177
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,570
You seem so relaxed.

178
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:26,290
I am relaxed. It's so relaxing that I'm becoming suffocated.

179
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:33,480
You are worried because of your eyes, right? Because everyone might find out...

180
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,770
They will find out one day.

181
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,450
There's nothing else to lose.

182
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,840
But you have gained something.

183
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,790
What is it?

184
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,120
Me.

185
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,050
No matter how much you push me away, I won't let go of you.

186
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:04,180
It's neither sympathy nor pity.

187
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:09,050
I don't know how bad it will become. I don't know what will happen.

188
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:16,530
No matter what happens to you, I will embrace it if it's a wave that we have to endure together.

189
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,420
If we can do it together.

190
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,280
Ji Na.

191
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,330
It's great. It's warm.

192
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,290
That means that the breeze has become colder.

193
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,500
And that means to me that I need you.

194
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,080
  Surgery specialist, Lee Hae Sung. 

195
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,540
Are you going to wear your gown again?

196
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,450
Yes, I should.

197
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:48,400
After sending your brother away, your heart should probably still be grieving.

198
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:55,270
Woo Sung, too, would want me to return back to my original state.

199
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:58,620
Can you easily forget that?

200
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,920
I won't easily forget it.

201
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:05,150
I won't even try to forget it either.

202
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:10,560
Just... I need to bear it in my heart and live on.

203
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,760
If I remember it, I will think about it.

204
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,250
When I'm sad, I will cry.

205
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,290
We all live like that.

206
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:31,410
Yeah. See you later. I need to go to the ICU.

207
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,440
Yes, I will be out soon.

208
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:45,950
Blood pressure 110/70. Heart rate is being maintained around 90-100.

209
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:49,570
The hemovac is coming out well with serous fluid.
  

210
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,480
The urine is also coming out well.

211
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,030
Yes. We just need to monitor the I/O and give fluids as needed.
  

212
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,870
Soon, you can probably go down to the regular unit.

213
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,600
I think that way, too.

214
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,250
What about Busan? Are you still going to go?

215
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,030
Ah, that...

216
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,160
Chief!

217
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,280
Yes.

218
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,460
They hung an official report.

219
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,560
What kind of report?

220
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:18,850
It seems like they are going to proceed with revoking Dr. Lee's license since the pathologist and OB/GYN Chief have returned.

221
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,930
The Hospital Director has waited quite a long time.

222
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:41,530
I guess my license wasn't just a piece of paper, since they need to go through this process.

223
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,050
I think we need to set up some kind of measure.

224
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:48,250
You are busy. You don't need to do that. Let's just face it head on.

225
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,080
This time it was because of the disaster, so let him off the hook.

226
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,570
Otherwise, change the law so that it is advantageous for our side.

227
00:18:54,570 --> 00:19:01,300
That's right. Okay. I'll trust you, Lawyer So.

228
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,580
- Did we post the notice?
 - Yes, and we also notified the other chiefs.

229
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,810
You've gotten faster at getting results.

230
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,890
Hello, Hospital Director.

231
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:15,920
I saw the notice well. No matter what happens, I'll follow those hospital words.

232
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:20,020
I have something to do the emergency room so I'll go up first.

233
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,780
Please revoke the qualifications committee.

234
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,030
Do I have a reason to do that?

235
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:31,010
Dr. Lee's decompressive craniotomy, it was a procedure done to save a dying patient. As a fellow doctor,

236
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:33,520
the fact that we are contemplating the revoking of his doctor's license,

237
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,510
I am embarrassed.

238
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,370
Asking about the opinion of many colleague doctors and

239
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:43,080
the Department of Welfare, why is that embarrassing?

240
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,770
More than anyone, passionate in the face of disaster,

241
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:49,080
he is a doctor that protects the lives of patient even to the point of exploiting his own body.

242
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,460
He is the most important person even now that this hospital has become a base for disaster.

243
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,900
The revoking of his license makes no sense.

244
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,530
Even as the same doctor, it's overstepping your authority.

245
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:02,360
Chief Kang,  does Doctor Lee Hae Sung...

246
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,830
not go out for DMAT and perform irrational and reckless treatment?

247
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,110
Does he not perform surgery at an animal hospital?

248
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:14,400
I'm even in a position to have to personally be suing Dr. Lee Hae Sung...

249
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,160
You all know.

250
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:22,080
It's correct to strip the license of Dr. Lee Hae Sung who ridicules normal medical treatment.

251
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,330
A money seeking Mirae Hospital, he is someone that allowed it to actually operate like a hospital.

252
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,030
Enough, enough. That's enough.

253
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,420
That's enough from you, too.

254
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:36,600
Director, why don't you call the privileges suspension board together. I'll happily accept it.

255
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,060
Oh, really?

256
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,410
I also want to verify if I did things correctly.

257
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,890
That's a good idea.

258
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:49,400
If saving a life is a sin, then all the doctors of this world should take off their gown.

259
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,340
All day, the incidents haven't stopped.

260
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,070
Lee Hae Sung's brother. License Suspension.

261
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,370
I'm getting tired of it, really.

262
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,600
What do we do about the privileges meeting?

263
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,870
The pathology and OB/GYN Chiefs are all on Director's side, so it will 100% pass.

264
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:20,260
I can't even blame it on the quorum again...

265
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,490
We need to block it. Saying that there was nothing wrong with Lee Hae Sung's treatment.

266
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,860
I will testify.

267
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,280
They won't even accept you as a witness.

268
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,100
Just because you are on the same side, they'll say that you're biased.

269
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,610
Then, who else is there?

270
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,810
Someone whose voice might be heard during the meeting.

271
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:41,860
While hiding the fact that he had PTSD, Dr. Lee Hae Sung went out on the scene.

272
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:48,410
With trembling hands, he performed decompressive craniotomy on patient Yoo Young Tak, right?

273
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:53,350
For sure, that has happened before,

274
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:56,270
but he took medication and he got better.

275
00:21:56,270 --> 00:22:01,070
And when he performed on patient Yoo Young Tak, there was no problem.

276
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:05,800
Ah, really? Did you plan it out to say that?

277
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:12,010
This is the chart that psychologist Eun So Yool documented.

278
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:17,240
If you look here, there is a certain diagnosis of PTSD.

279
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,390
It is also noted that a considerable recovery time will be needed.

280
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:24,490
It is written in the printed material that I handed out.

281
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,310
Not even a neurosurgeon,

282
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:30,140
but a general surgeon performs decompressive craniotomy.

283
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:36,670
I, as a neurosurgeon, would never, never allow this irrational procedure!

284
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:40,690
I will say it again. That patient had a subdural hemorrhage. If it wasn't for that procedure, he would have died!

285
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,190
And also, he is now alive.

286
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,810
Yes, he is alive.

287
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:47,310
As a hemiplegia patient with language deficits.

288
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,730
You...

289
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:53,830
say that you're going to file a medical lawsuit against Dr. Lee.  I have no way to dissuade you, but

290
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:58,560
not even a suspension do we have the right to strip away a doctor's medical license.

291
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,210
That's why I'm saying that we should recommend it to the Ministry of Health and Welfare.

292
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:05,010
Whether this senseless treatment is allowed...

293
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,530
Can I say one thing?

294
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,840
Look at this!

295
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,750
There is no reflection of his actions!

296
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:16,410
He's not reflecting, so he'll just keep doing his own thing and do it again!

297
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:29,250
From this on, suing...

298
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:38,610
- Ah, you... 
- Why does Lee Hae Sung have to take off his gown?

299
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:44,420
Professor Han, I thought you quit without handing in a letter of resignation.

300
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,540
It seems that I was wrong.

301
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:52,510
A few years ago in Australia, there was a doctor that performed the same procedure that Lee Hae Sung had.

302
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:57,770
That doctor also used an industrial drill to drill a hole into the skull of a subdural hemorrhage patient.

303
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,970
He performed decompressive craniotomy.

304
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:07,350
And within a 2 hour mile radius by plane, the patient was transported to a hospital where neurosurgery was possible.

305
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:13,120
That doctor became a star doctor because he was able to accomplish an impossible miracle.

306
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,180
The report was included in these medical magazines and even the newspaper.

307
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:26,500
Why has a heroic act in Australia become a terrible deed when Lee Hae Sung performs it?

308
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:31,470
Then that day, Lee Hae Sung's treatment was perfect.

309
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,470
Is that what you are trying to say?

310
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,940
Yes.

311
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,830
It was perfect so much so that no one could have done it better.

312
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:39,870
Was it really the case?

313
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:45,910
It seems like the Chief Doctors here don't know about Professor Han's condition.

314
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:50,650
Right now, Professor Han cannot see.

315
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:55,730
So that day, whether the treatment was perfect or not...

316
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:59,290
I wasn't able to see it properly, so the authenticity of that statement has decreased.

317
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,050
Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy.

318
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:07,050
That was my diagnosis. And suddenly in recent days, I was not able to see well.

319
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:11,330
And I left because I thought that I would cause a great ordeal to the hospital.

320
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:14,850
However, that day, my skills were normal.

321
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:17,850
They were normal... Professor Han,

322
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:19,970
what number do you see this as?

323
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,650
Leave it alone, Hospital Director.

324
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,630
Look at this.

325
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:28,500
How Lee Hae Sung's treatment was perfect.

326
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,870
How can he tell?

327
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:36,390
We are all busy people. Well, do you have something to say, Professor Han?

328
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,590
It's fine.

329
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:42,010
Then, vote after listening to this person's words.

330
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:45,940
Ah, what now?! I told you that we are all busy.

331
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,020
Now, come inside.

332
00:25:54,280 --> 00:26:01,220


333
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:11,320
Lee Hae Sung, leave him alone! He's the doctor that saved me.

334
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,720
The person concerned says to leave Lee Hae Sung alone.

335
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,320
He doesn't want any punishment for him.

336
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:24,580
For now, let's have a seat.

337
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:34,280
Ah. My respected Chief Doctors of Mirae Hospital,

338
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:39,300
Chairman Yoo Young Tak that I respect,

339
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:45,440
due to an accident last time, his cognitive skills have been severely affected.

340
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,020
He is not able to have a normal cognitive condition.

341
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,450
Hospital Director, that...

342
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:54,540
Enough, Nurse Park! Until when will you hide the truth?

343
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,410
Wh-What did you say?

344
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:00,020
- Professor Han! 
- Park Gun!

345
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,730
By bringing the unwell Chairman,

346
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,160
what are you trying to do?

347
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,730
Hyungnim, I'm very sorry.

348
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,230
Hospital Director, this is not it!

349
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:10,180
What are you doing?! What are you doing by bringing him here?

350
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,760
Send him out!

351
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,280
- Chief Park, proceed with the voting. 
- Yes.

352
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,120
It's chaos!  It's chaos!

353
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,000
Right now, he is yelling that Lee Hae Sung's license should be revoked. It's chaotic.

354
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,810
What happened? Did they announce the results?

355
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,490
No, they didn't announce it yet.

356
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:30,210
But Professor Han Woo Jin and Chairman Yoo Young Tak barged into the meeting.

357
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:33,270
Han Woo Jin? Why did Professor Han, a person who left the house come?

358
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,810
Be quiet! She's talking.

359
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:37,950
I'm also talking.

360
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,080
So, what happened?

361
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,530
- Then by a show of hands, we'll vote. 
 - Director!

362
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:47,690
Now! Everyone that supports the revoking of Lee Hae Sung's license, please raise your hand.

363
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:50,390
Yes. Everyone, express your opinions freely.

364
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,410
Express your opinions freely.

365
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:54,120
Hospital Director, this isn't right! You shouldn't be doing this!

366
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,910
Don't be swayed and raise your hands.

367
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:59,280
Now, raise your hands.

368
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,560
Chief Park, count it. A total of...

369
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,270
11 people have raised their hands.

370
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:07,570
Then... support 11, oppose 9 people.

371
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:12,860
I announce that the request for Lee Hae Sung's license suspension has been passed.

372
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,390
You who went out for DMAT and didn't stop Lee Hae Sung...

373
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:31,360
Even you! I thought to revoke your license as well.

374
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,530
It would be bothersome for you who can't see anyways, so I left it alone.

375
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:38,010
What? Are you saying that I should be thankful?

376
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,430
Let's leave it at old affection.

377
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:43,780
Leaving my boat and hopping over to Lee Hae Sung's boat,

378
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:48,650
it is because of the guilt that you have about your medical malpractice that you made?

379
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,510
Medical malpractice?

380
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:58,990
You are the one who said to hide everything when I wanted to reveal the truth.

381
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:01,900
Even to the point of shutting other people's mouth.

382
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,730
  Hyung, perform surgery on my mother. 

383
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:09,710
  Yes, I will do my best. 

384
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:15,390
  During my mother's surgery, nothing happened, right? 

385
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,890
  You can't trust me? 

386
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:22,310
Because I need to protect the hospital. Fighting and bickering between doctors...

387
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:26,460
That leaves a deadly scar on the hospital's reputation. I need to block it.

388
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:32,290
You told me to just act like I'm finding the cause of hemorrhage during Patient Yoo Young Tak's surgery.

389
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:37,050
Since we are not in a condition to perform neurosurgery in this hospital, you said that it's pointless in even saving him.

390
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:43,610
I don't know the exact reason, but did you perhaps not want Chairman Yoo Young Tak to live?

391
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,170
Your attempt to destroy and step on Lee Hae Sung,

392
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:53,270
he came back saving Chairman Yoo. Is it because he performed a surgery where he can live?

393
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,310
Are you really asking because you don't know?

394
00:29:56,010 --> 00:30:00,400
Even if Lee Hae Sung was right, there are the hospital director's orders and hospital rules.

395
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,300
But Lee Hae Sung broke that. He messed with my pride.

396
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,640
I didn't receive your resignation letter yet.

397
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,490
I am turning down your resignation. You are fired!

398
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,300
Aren't you being too much?

399
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,280
Though he has hemiplegia with language deficits, he is a perfectly normal person.

400
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,840
What do you mean by decreased cognitive abilities?

401
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,600
How can you do this to me?

402
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:39,210
You all gang up on me while bringing your already unwell uncle? I am your father!

403
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:43,400
I'm sorry, Hospital Director. I didn't know that you were my father.

404
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,340
What?!

405
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:49,960
It was the utmost we could do for Lee Hae Sung who was like a cornered rat.

406
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,700
Do you think that you guys can block me?

407
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:58,610
Don't even dream about it. This hospital... the one I raised! It's my hospital.

408
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:59,770
You know?!

409
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:02,040
But it's so strange,

410
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:07,320
they're the chiefs that you sat there in those seats and control but there were nine votes against.

411
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,470
Are you in danger?

412
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,780
You should return back now.

413
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:21,240
I'm telling you this because you seem lost after straying away from the road of a doctor.

414
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,370
You rude-

415
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:33,310


416
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:42,860
Chairman, I'm sorry for making you come this long way when you are unwell.

417
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,440
Have strength.

418
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,390
Uncle, you have strength, too.

419
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:52,850
Uncle, you are just and wise person as usual.

420
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:58,640
The Director won't get his way. We will all fight on your side until the end.

421
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:04,890
Yes. Even though the Hospital Director tries to submit the approval, it will never pass through.

422
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:07,920
We faced an earthquake that was nonsense.

423
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,950
But we can't only perform treatment that makes sense.

424
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:14,440
Ji Na, escort him well.

425
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,180
Help me a little.

426
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,010
Excuse me.

427
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:30,100
Hae Sung, let's talk for a moment.

428
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,570
What is it?

429
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,950
Ah, why are you acting like this making me scared?

430
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:51,150
The accident with your mother...

431
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:54,260
That's enough. Hyung, that's enough about that talk.

432
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,440
No, we need to do it, Hae Sung.

433
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,340
I said please let's stop.

434
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,440
The accident that occurred that day,

435
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:07,050
I didn't even know that your mother had a cardiac arrest. And because I recklessly urged to perform the surgery...

436
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:12,180
Enough. It's not like I didn't question that.

437
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:18,790
But you said that it wasn't, so it's not.

438
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:28,310
If it wasn't for you, my mother would have died riding an ambulance all day.

439
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:33,940
For letting you be guilty because I forced the surgery on you,

440
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,770
I was apologetic in my own way.

441
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:41,940
And as a result, we both slowly grew apart.

442
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,280
That day, if I just hadn't caused that accident,

443
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:50,730
my mother and father wouldn't have turned out that way.

444
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,170
It's not something to blame you for.

445
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,500
Hyung,

446
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:02,430
let's overcome it now.

447
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:06,350
You and I went through enough.

448
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:09,460
It would have been great if I had been truthful earlier.

449
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:15,880
It's my fault. If I hadn't been so full of greed...

450
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:21,140
I... am regretful for the times that have passed.

451
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:26,170
If it wasn't for that, you and I would have been able to understand each other and get along.

452
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:32,940
Go inside first. I'm going to go after seeing my mother first.

453
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,060
What are you doing?

454
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,480
The bag that my mother had sent had a scarf, too.

455
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,630
It seems that it matches your mother well, too, right?

456
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:53,600
It will probably match with me, too. Thank you.

457
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,150
- You were here. 
- Yes, hello.

458
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:04,480
Will your mother be okay here?

459
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,980
The days are getting colder.

460
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,280
I was thinking of moving her to another hospital anyways.

461
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,710
Can you help me?

462
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,050
Have you made up your mind?

463
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,600
Yes.

464
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:22,140
The roads have been restored and there are hospitals that have reopened it's doors.

465
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,800
But later if we start moving, it'll be busy. So if you want to move her, you should do it now.

466
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,550
Ah, then I will quickly go and pack her things.

467
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:31,980
I will wait by the emergency department.

468
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,160
Ki Woong, over here.

469
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,560
Romeo, Juliet.

470
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,830
I will take you soon, too.

471
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:47,750
First of all, I will escort mother.

472
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:52,060
After that, I will really take you guys with me. Just wait a little.

473
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:14,490
That, please.

474
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,240
- This? 
- No.

475
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,540
The towel on top of the chair.

476
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:25,660
I think you need to clean that.

477
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,210
Are you really going to leave?

478
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:39,630
It's hard for me to endure it much longer.

479
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:43,670
I am a bomb and I'm reckless.

480
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:47,810
And on top of that, they can't even acknowledge that I am a doctor.

481
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,780
When are you leaving... to Busan?

482
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:05,430
When the ambulance car is available.

483
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,520
My father also wants to quickly leave.

484
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,970
Yes, you should quickly leave.

485
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,100
Now, it's the end.

486
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,560
The DMAT team.

487
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:34,280
I don't think I can greet your father.

488
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:44,840
I don't have time. The ambulance car is waiting for me.

489
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,970
Jung Ddol Mi!

490
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:09,720
Doctor, I'm sorry. Because of me, I didn't know that the Director would come out like that.

491
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:14,450
No. You worked hard, Sister.

492
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:18,160
Eternally, my sister.

493
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:23,430
Your bravery and sacrifice, thank you for that.

494
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:26,600
Brother, I am so sorry...

495
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:31,300
Go to a hospital that has a good internal medicine for the heart. Since you are always worried about your mother's arrhythmias.

496
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:36,760
Friend... because of me, a psychologist became a surgery room assistant...

497
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,190
Well, thank you for also maintaining my PTSD.

498
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:44,390
Because of you, it was worthwhile. It felt like I became a real doctor.

499
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:52,420
Aigoo, our carpenter.

500
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,970
Don't come back to Seoul again. You only went through trouble, what is that?

501
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:59,790
Why are you doing that... like I'm never going to see you again?

502
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:01,830
I'm going. Stay well.

503
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:04,350
Eun So Yool, I am trusting you to take good care of my Romeo and Juliet.

504
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:09,850
And tell Chief Kang, Woo Jin Hyung and Nurse Park that I will contact them separately.

505
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,730
I'm going.

506
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,440
He didn't even ask for my phone number...

507
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,680
Is he not going to see me again?

508
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,460
 

509
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,730
Chief Kang, if it's not important, then later...

510
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:55,150
Hello, Hospital Director!

511
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,040
Ah, what are you doing here?

512
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,600
Oh, come inside Minister.

513
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,040
Aigoo, aigoo, Minister!

514
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,560
- What brings you here...
- You're working hard.

515
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,380
Please go inside.

516
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,050
What do you want to say...?

517
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:17,490
You're not even a public hospital but a special hospital. Thank you for taking on the big responsibility

518
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:22,450
after the disaster and becoming a fine example of DMAT leadership.

519
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:26,810
On top of that, you saved my life.

520
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:34,850
So for future emergency medical treatments in the hospital, the government will provide 500 million won in funding.

521
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,860
500 million won?

522
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,540
500 million won?

523
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:46,760
So, we want to commend Dr. Lee Hae Sung and Han Woo Jin, who lead the DMAT team.

524
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,170
That...

525
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:51,460
500 million won. Thank you so much.

526
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,540
But it might be hard to commend Han Woo Jin and Lee Hae Sung.

527
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,690
No, why?

528
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:58,270
That..

529
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:04,680
Since there was a problem with the DMAT team that you praised, Professor Han Woo Jin was fired.

530
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:10,750
And to the Ministry of Health, a proposal for Dr. Lee Hae Sung's license suspension

531
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,250
was submitted by the hospital.

532
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,190
Chief Kang.

533
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:16,180
What kind of talk is this, Hospital Director?

534
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,100
What do you mean by firing and license suspension?

535
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:23,570
Ah, um... With the excuse of being in an emergency situation, they performed senseless treatment on the scene.

536
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:26,480
-That's enough.
 - The problem was revealed.

537
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,820
I will meet those two personally and hear their story.

538
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:37,290
Yes, I am Han Woo Jin.

539
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:40,490
Chief Kang?

540
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:43,350
Right now?

541
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:45,230
What?

542
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:48,720
What do you mean by come back to the hospital? Why?

543
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,380
Tell me once again.

544
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:05,920
The one who saved you was not me, but a doctor named Lee Hae Sung.

545
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,860
The Hospital Director said that it was definitely you.

546
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:17,060
 That...I couldn't recognize the Minister who was brought to the emergency room covered in blood 

547
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:20,660
 With the excuse that there was no urologist, I sent you to another hospital. 

548
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,820
 Transfer the patient with the kidney rupture. 

549
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:28,960
If something went wrong, with the excuse of having no hospitals that performs surgery, you may have died on the road.

550
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:36,120
But in Hangang Mirae Hospital that did not have either an operating room or an ICU,

551
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,580
Lee Hae Sung performed the surgery

552
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:43,120
without even knowing who you were.

553
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,580
This is totally different from what the Hospital Director said.

554
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:52,320
And Lee Hae Sung brought you out of Hangang Mirae Hospital that collapsed due to the earthquake.

555
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,620
And in a bed, he rolled you all the way to Mirae Hospital.

556
00:42:55,620 --> 00:43:02,000
If that's the case... the statement that he performed the surgery at Hangang Mirae Hospital to exclude the reporters...

557
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,880
it was all a lie.

558
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,560
Yes.

559
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,230
If he's going to come, saying that he will come.

560
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:19,490
If he's going to present an award, saying that he's going to give an award. You should have whispered it to me in advance. What is this?

561
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:25,430
The two doctors that the government was going to commend was fired and proposed to revoke his license,

562
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:28,450
will we become more than a pitiful hospital like that?

563
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:34,890
I know... I didn't know that things went this far. How you fire your hospital doctors

564
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:36,750
- and try to propose a license suspension? 
 - Even Chief Kang is the same.

565
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:37,770
What about Chief Kang?

566
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:43,230
Ah, listen. She's not a 3 year old child that goes around telling everyone around her.

567
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:47,120
I'm sorry. I...

568
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:53,170
found out about the identity of your girlfriend.

569
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:54,990
He used that.

570
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:59,890
  Hospital Director, you sent the Minister to Hangang Mirae on purpose. 

571
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:03,490
We wanted to cover up our mistake like that.

572
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:11,790
When you found out about the whole truth, worried that the planned support fund wouldn't come,

573
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:14,970
I'm sorry.

574
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:17,590
So...

575
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:21,990
If it wasn't for Dr. Lee Hae Sung, I could have died?

576
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:24,610
Yes, that's correct.

577
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:31,890
And to say that this kind of doctor is reckless, the hospital had proposed to revoke his license.

578
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:37,380
I'll tell you again, but Dr. Lee Hae Sung was exceptional.

579
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,520
I understand well.

580
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,150
For a patient that was suspected to have subdural hemorrhage,

581
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:47,890
seeing that he saved the patient by performing decompressive craniotomy, I said that's it.

582
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:50,590
We need to activate DMAT.

583
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:55,150
That's why the Ministry of Health and Welfare decided to make a commendation.

584
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:58,390
If you are saying dismissal and license suspension,

585
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:00,390
what will become of the Ministry of Health and Welfare?

586
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:03,080
Minister, there have been a lot of problems.

587
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:06,050
The aftereffects of the patients were severe. And without any choice...

588
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:10,050
If they were doctors that were afraid of the aftereffects and stayed still,

589
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:13,250
then Chairman Yoo and I would no longer be alive in this world.

590
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:18,860
In Korea, there was an earthquake that no one even imagined.

591
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:23,160
In this state, that kind of doctor... should you be grateful and happy?

592
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,180
Let's make a deal.

593
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,290
What?

594
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:32,210
Accept the two doctors,

595
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:36,760
along with the 500 million won.

596
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:40,350
And lets forget about the license suspension request as well.

597
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:45,010
I'm sorry. This is a situation that has been decided on within our staff.

598
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:47,530
Then Ministry of Health and Welfare will turn our backs.

599
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:50,770
And Mirae Hospital will become a hospital that dismissed those doctors.

600
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:55,220
I am very disappointed. The President even appointed you Minister of the Ministry of Health and Welfare.

601
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,310
U-uh, me?

602
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:59,240
With what method I should resolve this...

603
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,640
Without any reason....

604
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:06,590
- If your personality is revealed, then I will be put in a tough situation... 
 - Minister, what do you mean by personality...?

605
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:07,970
It's fine, it's fine.

606
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:09,590
Um, Minister,

607
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:13,950
I'll do as you say.

608
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:16,710
- Are you serious? 
 - Yes.

609
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:17,550
What?

610
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:19,610
Override the suspension.

611
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:22,590
I understand.

612
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:33,860


613
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,350
It's your present.

614
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:54,810
I want to meet the doctor, Lee Hae Sung, that saved me. But since he's not here, it's a shame.

615
00:46:54,810 --> 00:47:01,070
If Lee Hae Sung or Professor Han were not doctors, then there would be no doctors in Korea. I have high hopes for you, Prof. Han.

616
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:02,750
You flatter me.

617
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:05,950
Ah... Chief Kang, just a moment.

618
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:08,470
Yes.

619
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:13,330
About the secret I revealed... please don't tell anyone.

620
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,830
Only then can you get the 500 million won in aid.

621
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:17,570
Yes, I will keep that in mind.

622
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:18,900
- Let's go, Politician Goo. 
 - Yes.

623
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:22,270
There's no end to it. In order to be a Minister, I need to be a young man like Politician Goo.

624
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:24,590
My stamina is dropping, my stamina is dropping.

625
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:28,350
Bye. I'll escort him around.

626
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:41,850
Wow, we survived! We survived!

627
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:45,880
Your 3rd generation chaebol and powerful boyfriend's gift is quite incredible.

628
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,860
Ah.. seriously.

629
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:53,190
When I requested, I didn't expect much. But with the support of 500 million won...

630
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:56,760
Even though the Hospital submits a proposal, it's the end of it when the Ministry of Health and Welfare declines.

631
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,190
I really don't understand why the Hospital Director would make a decision like that.

632
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:05,670
He probably wanted to leave a scratch on Doctor Lee Hae Sung's pride. "You're not a doctor, you're nothing".

633
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:10,250
Feelings of hopelessness strangles one's neck with an unseen hand.

634
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:27,190
Kang Joo Ran.

635
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:29,240
Han Woo Jin.

636
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,200
Lee Hae Sung.

637
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:54,100
Hey, is that for real? Support fund of 500 million won plus Professor Han Woo Jin and Dr. Lee Hae Sung are safe?

638
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:58,640
Didn't it turn out well? When we really suffered without being able to eat and sleep,

639
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,010
we worked really hard.

640
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:03,350
It's worth it.

641
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:05,270
Worth it? What's worth it?

642
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:08,620
Because the government is recognizing that we worked hard.

643
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:10,860
Ah, I'm getting so stressed.

644
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:16,170
Doctor Lee Hae Sung holds grudges for so long. He'll chase me around and harass me.

645
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:19,110
Ey, he's not that type of person. Right?

646
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:23,390
Dr. Do, if you don't know, don't say anything. If someone endured it, I endured it.

647
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:28,710
I endured all of that, but Prof. Han is the problem.

648
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:30,890
What about Prof. Han?

649
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:35,940
My hands are quite exquisite.

650
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:40,160
After Prof. Han left, the position for robot surgery was my position.

651
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,170
But if he comes back again?

652
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:45,170
You're really over exaggerating.

653
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:55,790
-Chief.
-Oh my!

654
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:57,180
Oh, you scared me.

655
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:58,110
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

656
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:01,970
No... you didn't leave before?

657
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:03,010
You left earlier.

658
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:06,460
No, I didn't go. I sent the Minister first and I quickly prepared this.

659
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:08,660
How is it? Do you like it?

660
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:12,360
Are we celebrating our victory?

661
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:20,130
Giving us a support fund for 500 million won and saving Han Woo Jin and Lee Hae Sung... I should be treating you.

662
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:21,230
Thank you, Ja Hyuk.

663
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:22,930
It's nothing. Here.

664
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:25,410
We will use that money wisely.

665
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:28,060
I'll try to create an innovative emergency system.

666
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:29,980
Okay.

667
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:32,710
For Korea's new emergency system!

668
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:35,190
Cheers!

669
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:42,820
Ah, it's so electrifying. Wow, I think this is the first time with alcohol after the earthquake.

670
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:50,320
Truthfully, when you said that there were a lot of problems with our nation's emergency care, I didn't know what you meant.

671
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:53,070
But after facing this earthquake, I realized it for sure.

672
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:59,400
No. Fire Department, hospital and the blood bank... The only way they can contact each other is by phone. Does that make sense?

673
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,750
Oh..!

674
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:05,090
And it's a surprising discovery that the hospital only had a 4 day supply of disaster necessities.

675
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:12,590
The hospital became paralyzed because 119 wasn't helping the patients. They were just dropping them off at hospitals near them.

676
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:14,400
There weren't just one or two cases like this.

677
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,880
As expected, you're meant to lead our future.

678
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,670
You are like the Special Minister. You are the best.

679
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:23,080
Don't just say it with words.

680
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,750
Express it passionately with your body.

681
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,180
This is a hospital.

682
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,990
We're married.

683
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:33,930
I didn't receive a proposal yet... officially.

684
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:49,800
I prepared this before the earthquake, but I wondered about when I should do a proposal.

685
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:53,580
But I think the time is now.

686
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:57,260
Ja Hyuk...

687
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:59,240
Let's get married.

688
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,410
To you, a good husband.

689
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:07,300
And to Dong Ha, I will become a good father.

690
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,640
Aren't you going to respond?

691
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:16,820
If I say it right away, it seems like I've waited for it.

692
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:19,360
I will wait exactly 30 seconds.

693
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:28,570
Oh my!

694
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:33,050
Ch-chief, they want you to come because there's a meeting about the event tomorrow.

695
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:34,070
I understand.

696
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:36,700
I think I came in at the wrong time.

697
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:39,450
I'm sorry. Goodbye.

698
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:42,830
 

699
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,790
Since it's a shame if the commended people are not affiliated with our hospital,

700
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:13,220
I've decided to accept both of you.

701
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:18,440
But Professor Han Woo Jin, you can never hold a scalpel as you have vision problems.

702
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:22,860
Your words are valid. I am planning to focus on research and guiding future doctors.

703
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,200
Dr. Lee Hae Sung.

704
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,420
Yes.

705
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:28,300
Somehow, you are getting by this time.

706
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:32,920
I will definitely take away your scalpel.

707
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:33,890
Hospital Director...

708
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:39,080
Mirae Hospital is a hospital that has been raised with the treatment model that I had planned.

709
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,310
The correct diagnosis and the best treatment.

710
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:47,570
That is the motto of this hospital, but you are always standing on the opposite side.

711
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:50,340
You just hate every part of me.

712
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:55,350
I hate that you're tall, too.

713
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:04,210
Due to a 6.6 earthquake that first developed in our nation,

714
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:07,210
when Seoul was in its darkest times,

715
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:12,450
despite Mirae Hospital being a private hospital, they led the way for emergency treatment

716
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:16,590
and saved the lives of countless Seoul citizens.

717
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:23,250
To encourage their efforts and ask for their continual support in emergency situations,

718
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:25,590
the government will provide a support fund to the hospital.

719
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:32,930
And we have designated time to commend those doctors that have lead the way for emergency treatment.

720
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:37,410
Firstly, the Hospital Director Park Gun.

721
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:40,610
Director.

722
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:45,940
Special Award: 
Despite extremely difficult situations,

723
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:49,700
they showed an excellent model on how to save many lives in a disaster such as this earthquate.

724
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,730
South Korea is giving this award as a thanks,

725
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:55,410
Minister Suk...

726
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:04,230
Chief Kang, turn off your phone.

727
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:10,200
Ah, I'm really sorry.

728
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:14,420
Yes, I'm so out of my mind from receiving this award.

729
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:15,870
It's okay, I'll wait.

730
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:17,750
Thank you.

731
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:21,550
Lawyer Seo, later I'll-

732
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:27,010
What are you saying? I'm fired as a Chairman?

733
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:31,650
Who is firing me?!

734
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,380
I'm going there right now, so wait!!

735
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:38,980
I told you to wait!!

736
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:43,910
What do you mean I'm fired in this situation?

737
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:46,960
What nonsense is this?!

738
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,320
Go inside.

739
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:52,550
April? Oh my god, I'm going crazy.

740
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:55,830
I'll go there right now so wait there!

741
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:58,190
Keep stalling!

742
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:01,300
I've heard all about you.

743
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:05,130
Thank you for saving me.

744
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:07,410
I really wanted to meet you once.

745
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:12,820
Ah, so you're the Minister I performed surgery on in the Hangang Mirae Hospital?

746
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:16,770
Yes. This is a secret between us two.

747
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:18,010
Yes.

748
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:22,520
Thats why they didn't tell me because you were the VIP...

749
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:27,710
In the minister position, I wasn't able to help

750
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:32,170
and I almost died.

751
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:34,260
Who would I resent?

752
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:36,290
It's all my fault.

753
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:37,850
I've a favor to ask.

754
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:42,690
As we continue treatment, the patient can only survive if there is no structural deficit.

755
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,990
Yes. I'll do my best.

756
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:50,870
Yes, that is true we must strengthen our construction.

757
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:55,500
Since this earthquake happened on the weekend,

758
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:58,840
it is a relief kids did not go to school that day, but

759
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:02,140
buildings without the proper support all collapsed.

760
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:08,620
Right now, it is still vacation for the students but soon they will have to return to school. There are still many problems to solve.

761
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:13,820
Citizens are asking why government help did not come any sooner. Why did they have to endure for so long?

762
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:17,000
Yes. I think it's possible that they could have many complaints.

763
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:23,250
But despite any country and nation, before a government can help the citizens after a disaster,

764
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:25,030
at the very least, 72 hours are needed.

765
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:31,160
In that aspect, our nation was lucky we had

766
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,970
a staff who were trained for these situations.

767
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:34,300
Okay.

768
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:35,990
Thank you for the interview.

769
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:37,540
- Yes. You worked hard.
- You worked hard.

770
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:39,490
Oh, my leg.

771
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:40,500
Ah.

772
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,870
I need to go to the restroom.

773
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:45,630
Is it the top story at 9?

774
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:46,740
As a small special.

775
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:50,770
The disaster relief conference should have gone out as the 9 o'clock top story.

776
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:53,090
If that was the case, I would have

777
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:57,500
been able to be seen as the second Lee Soon Shin.

778
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,270
My leg, my leg.

779
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:05,410
During this earthquake, there were rumors that Yeonggwang District's firefighters lacked putting out fires compared to other districts.

780
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:09,230
Well, there are those aspects.

781
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:10,170
Pardon?

782
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:15,090
This is off the record between us. Promise?

783
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:16,370
Yes.

784
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:24,350
Lets think about it, Yeonggwang district rebuilding is a Seoul project.

785
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:28,390
This project was started then it was halted to a stop.

786
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:38,450
That's what I'm saying. Does it make sense that he fired me, Noona?

787
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:40,590
You're his wife!

788
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:45,950
And who's the one that raised the hospital all the way here? They dare to fire me?!

789
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:48,340
They're saying something that will cause a social uproar.

790
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:52,140
I got it. I'll go there so don't stamp anything and just wait.

791
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:56,380
So what I mean is to drag some time out nicely and wait.

792
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:58,840
I said I'll go and take care of it!

793
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:06,400
As expected, you didn't just say that you would change the emergency system.

794
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,740
You have a great plan.

795
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:13,720
Based on the situation, it is divided accordingly.

796
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:16,330
This is a good idea.

797
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:21,940
Ah, thank you. It's already being used in a few hospitals in Japan but we need to work on it a bit more

798
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:24,950
and adapt it to our nation's situation.

799
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:29,010
Because we can't repeat the faults made by Japan.

800
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:31,730
- Congressman Goo.
- Yes?
- You have an incredible lover.

801
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:33,190
You have a right to be proud of her.

802
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:35,710
Yes, but she sometimes upsets me.

803
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:38,950
- Congressman Goo, the President is looking for me so I have to go.
- Yes, you should go.

804
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:41,180
- Let's go.
- Chief Kang, work hard.

805
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:42,450
 Go in. 

806
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:44,290
I still haven't heard your answer.

807
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:47,110
You will hear it. Don't expect too much.

808
00:59:50,750 --> 01:00:00,690


809
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:12,900
 

810
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,190
Minister?

811
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:18,150
Yes!!

812
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:20,280
I don't need something as trivial as Mirae Hospital.

813
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,350
Goodbye! Goodbye!

814
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:17,680
  When the day we dreamed come 

815
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:23,650
  Like a miracle, when the day comes  

816
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:28,550
  The whole world will be bright again 

817
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:31,130
 The day we sincerely looked for  

818
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:33,890
 Are you coming back to your senses? Who am I? 

819
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:38,290
 Will you really be okay? It's him dying. 

820
01:01:38,290 --> 01:01:42,470
  Isn't our hospital policy to provide the best treatment after obtaining the correct diagnosis? 

821
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:43,890
 But it's urgent! 

822
01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:45,950
  If we do as we please, this will cause a problem.  

823
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:47,370
 If we don't do the surgery now, he'll die. 

824
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,270
 Let's move him to a surgery room immediately. 

825
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:53,970
 Save...my dad. I'm begging you. 

826
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:55,490
 The patient 

827
01:01:55,490 --> 01:01:57,750
 doesn't like me doing the surgery. He's the one who kicked me out for doing a reckless surgery. 

828
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,950
  I cancel my words saying that your license was just a piece of paper. 

829
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:03,730
  I made you cry a lot. I'm really bad. Right? 

830
01:02:03,730 --> 01:02:05,330
 An ambulance came from Busan. 

831
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:07,170
 But where did Doctor Lee Hae Sung go? 

832
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:09,440
 I don't know his number. 

833
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:16,860
