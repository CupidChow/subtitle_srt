1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,950
 Release patient in Room 502. 

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,860
 Are you telling my mom to die! 

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:10,430
 That's why!!  Kneel before me... 

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,830
 and beg. 

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,530
 You were like that last time, too. Why do you keep on saying that you can't do surgery? 

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,900
 I have an eye disease. 

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:24,000
 I can't see well. I knew it was going to come someday, but I didn't expect it to be so soon. 

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,780
 What are you saying? National bankruptcy? 

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,900
 A Yeoido pipeline has collapsed and is filled with water. 

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,160
 In the worst case scenario, there may be sacrifices. 

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,240
 How can I tell my kids to go in and die, who will go? 

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,670
 Then are you saying it's okay for this country to fall into ruin? 

13
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,890
 Was being a firefighter just a job you did to earn money? 

14
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,300
 Episode 17 
  - Did you have no honor? 

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,650
 Does this make sense to you?! 

16
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,370
 Yes, Yes. I don't. Did you give me 

17
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,320
 this to show your pride and make us worthless? 

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,670
My only crime is that I didn't wash, didn't eat, didn't sleep, and only rescued people!

19
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,180
We have only work to do our best to save people and for your order of not putting fires out!

20
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,520
Those who have families and children, tell them to go die?!

21
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,120
Would those words come so easy to you?!

22
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,630
Then what do you want to do? Huh?

23
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,090
In the maze like the Yeoido pipeline,

24
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:20,350
should I send someone who doesn't know what he is doing and make him suffer?!

25
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,440
Do you think saying this to you is easy?

26
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,420
I'm saying that we should save this country with the least amount of sacrifice!

27
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm giving you the opportunity to save our people and the nation!

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,870
Aigoo, thank you.

29
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:36,000
Thank you so much  for giving me that chance. I'm so thankful that I'm tearing up.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,990
I'm so thankful to the bones that words won't come out.

31
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,810
Chief Choi.

32
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,180
I...

33
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,520
I'm quick at putting out fires.

34
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,200
I'm not good at using people, so

35
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,510
please give me some more time.

36
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,770
Until when?

37
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,570
Until tomorrow.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,500
Okay. I'll wait.

39
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:32,040


40
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,950
The patient's vitals are good.

41
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,920
The urine is coming out very well as well!

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,070
It was too chaotic at the animal hospital but

43
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,810
this patient looks familiar. Give me the chart.

44
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:11,720
- His name is...

45
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,200
Kim Pan Seong. Kim Pan Seong.

46
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,940
 I looked into it, and there seems not to be a need for that. 

47
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,600
 Do you trust the internet more than me? 

48
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,180
 No, it's not like that-- 

49
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,490
 I will assume you do not want the treatment and conclude our discussion. 

50
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,990
 Our conversation is recorded in here. 

51
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,730
 No, Professor. 

52
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:40,250
You saved a patient that I abandoned.

53
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,730
What does that mean...?

54
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:47,940
He was in the primary stages of liver cancer and he did not want to follow my treatment guidelines so I refused him.

55
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,120
Is that true, Professor?

56
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,700
I did.

57
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:58,320
I live to save patients. That's a real doctor.

58
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,700
Hae Sung, thank you for saving this patient.

59
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,370
It was the patient's fate.

60
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,580
It's a life that even survived the earthquake.

61
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:12,110
He lived in such a difficult situation, how can you try to abandon him so easily?

62
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:16,410
Leave this patient to me and

63
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,270
everyone, you may leave now.

64
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,220
In Busan, I was known to be a pretty good doctor as well.

65
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,670
Doctor. Someone came from Busan.

66
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,520
Busan?

67
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,490
Dad!!

68
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,440
Ddol Mi!

69
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,480
Dad!!

70
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,880
Ah, it's really my dad!

71
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,940
Of course, I am your dad.

72
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,250
Daebak... how did you get here?

73
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,890
Daughter is working so hard.

74
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,400
As a father, do you think I would be able to let go?

75
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,920
I brought your clothes, too. After coming back to Busan, you only took a shower and left without even getting clothes.

76
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,480
Your mom is worried.

77
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,300
How long are you planning to stay? You brought everything.

78
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,840
Well, it'll take about a month for Seoul to find it again. One month or may be 2 months?

79
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,330
I'm planning on doing good things while I'm here.

80
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,620
What are you going to do if the company goes out of business?

81
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,020
It's enough that I raised that much money. It's enough for us to live.

82
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,530
Dad. Greet him. This is Doctor Lee Hae Sung.

83
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,810
Hello, I'm Lee Hae Sung.

84
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,970
I'm Ddol Mi's father, Jung Won Saeng.

85
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:35,820
Ah, you are quite tall. If I want to get a good look at your face, my neck will crack.

86
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,160
Ah, I'm sorry...

87
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,270
Don't say anything.

88
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,300
No, I'll just slightly go inside your mouth.

89
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,200
It got ripped a lot. Looks like we need to have 1 to 2 stitches.

90
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,120
Stay here. I'll get it.

91
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,290
Such a pompous ass. You idiot.

92
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,550
Tada!

93
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,800
What is this?

94
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,440
Makgeoli!

95
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,840
I brought it directly from Busan!

96
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,080
Wow, my dad is amazing. People would really love it.

97
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,100
I have one box of fishcake, too. I did well, right?

98
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,130
Dad, are you saying that is something to ask about?

99
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,060
Really? Us, too?

100
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:31,180
Yes, although there is only makgeoli and fishcake, let's have a nice drink.

101
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,630
Makgeoli? Boss, don't grasp the situation, and let's just have a drink.

102
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,750
I don't want to drink any makgeoli right now.

103
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,950
He's acting so polished again by himself.

104
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:44,180
You need to at least feed your babies.

105
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,980
Alright, let's do that. A machine functions with gas anyways.

106
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,460
- Thank you. 
- Ah, it's nothing.

107
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:57,730
Excuse me, perhaps... are the nurses also coming?

108
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:03,250
Don't move it. Okay...

109
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,320
Okay.

110
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,690
-The Busan doctor's father? 
-Yes.

111
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:12,030
He brought a fork crane and a bulldozer to do some service.

112
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:17,100
He even brought makgeoli and everyone is having a drink.

113
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,190
Well, they're doing it by themselves. There's nothing bad to that.

114
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,880
Ah... I, too...really like makgeoli...

115
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,640
I like it, too.

116
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,630
Yes. The alcohol you drink is important, but who you drink it with is more important.

117
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:38,840
After this earthquake is cleaned up, we'll need to clean up our hospital as well.

118
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:44,980
Yes, who are you planning on sending to Gaehuanal Samchung hospital?

119
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,200
Who else, the orthopedics.

120
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,550
Give me some. So rude to your sunbae 
 ♫  Tonight's ♫ 

121
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:36,070
Ah, no. Hold on. 
 ♫  stars, if you think about them ♫ 

122
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:45,380
Hey, hey Let me go 
 ♫  My old love seem to be coming back ♫ 

123
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,300
Stop drinking.

124
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,660
I'm going in because I feel sick.

125
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:23,050
Oh, no, it's fine.

126
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:25,680
It's okay. Your nose is red. Wear this.

127
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:39,620
What is this?

128
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,150
Oh my!

129
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,370
If you can't drink, you should've said something. Why are you drinking everything that was given?

130
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,050
Hold on.

131
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,830
Why?

132
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,200
Are you okay?

133
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,010
What are you doing in the hallways? There are many eyes here.

134
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:03,070
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. For you to see me like this.

135
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,950
What? Tell me everything.

136
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,010
Tell me everything, I will hear you out.

137
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,040
Motorbike.

138
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,700
Motorbike? What about the motorbike?

139
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,740
Don't ride on another man's motorbike.

140
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,320
No matter what, even if it is Teacher Lee Hae Sung.

141
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:32,430
And... I wish that you don't ride other man's car, as well.

142
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,700
Pour me some.

143
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,970
Stop it now.

144
00:10:54,970 --> 00:11:01,800
Who will give us this much makgeoli again and when?

145
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:07,000
But...why are you so stubborn these days?

146
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,960
It's because of Seo Yeon, right? Because you are concerned about her?

147
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,900
Receive this one drink.

148
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,000
Alright.

149
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,700
Work hard, okay?

150
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,770
Thank you.

151
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,110
Excuse me.

152
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,420
Pardon? Do you need anything?

153
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,160
No, it's not that. By any chance, do you know Kim Jong Seo?

154
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,580
Kim Jong Seo?

155
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,000
What part is he in? Is he a nurse?

156
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,410
No, singer Kim Jong Seo.

157
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:47,920
Beautiful Restriction. He's a rock legend.

158
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,310
Of course, I know him. I like him a lot.

159
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,930
When I used to work at Hongdae awhile ago, I got to know him.

160
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,190
Oh, really?

161
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:59,690
At times, there are concerts in Hongdae, and he keeps telling me to come.

162
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:03,570
He gave me 2 tickets because I work hard as a firefighter.

163
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,530
So?

164
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:13,070
But during the concert day, there was an earthquake.

165
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,900
- You probably couldn't go.
- Yes.

166
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,260
It must have been a pity for you. You look like a big fan.

167
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,400
I have to go in now.

168
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,620
Oh, alright.

169
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,350
You can't be drinking, right?

170
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,340
I think Prof. Han...

171
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,880
It seems like you are lying so you don't have to perform any surgeries.

172
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,950
What are you saying?

173
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,300
I'm so glad I won't be seeing your face.

174
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,040
Is it true?

175
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,990
I can't believe it either.

176
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:14,450
Not being able to see as time passes, I wish this was a lie, too.

177
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:20,530
When I went to the surgery center, you were the one who started teaching me the tie.

178
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,090
I always worked my best to become like hyung.

179
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:33,170
Now, I'm working hard for my mom; although, I did lose my job.

180
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,260
Hae Sung.

181
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:41,550
It's all in the past now. Let's just give it up.

182
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,170
I...

183
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,190
would like it if you didn't get sick.

184
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,040
We looked at the ultrasound and CT scans

185
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,870
and did patient conferences together, too.

186
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,010
Where are you going?

187
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,730
To the ICU patient.

188
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,360
 - Like this.
- Woah, you're really the god of stitching. 

189
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,860
 How can you make the spacing and the angles so accurately? 

190
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,760
 When will I be able to do it like you? 

191
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,290
  I'll teach you all of the surgery procedures and methods I know. 

192
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,870
 Really? Why? 

193
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,830
 Because I'm so thankful you came under a person who has a lot of strings. Lets go! 

194
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:41,830
 I'm going to catch up to you one day! 

195
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:50,690


196
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:59,970
 Like back then, those hard times, 

197
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:09,870
  I wish that we could do surgeries together and continue living like we are now. 

198
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:14,170
 Do we need to change, too, if the world changes? 

199
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,070
 If a building collapses because of an earthquake, 

200
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,110
 do our feelings collapse as well? 

201
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,320
Teacher.

202
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,570
Can you recognize me?

203
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,410
Yes. It's been a long time. I've seen you at Busan, right?

204
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:43,210
That time, our Dol Mi got so touched by teacher that...

205
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:46,190
she wanted to become doctor.

206
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,790
- You must be very proud of her. 
 - Of course.

207
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:52,060
She is the first to become a doctor in our family.

208
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,190
- Well my uncle...
- That's enough

209
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,980
Get rid of your hands.

210
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,740
Here, take a drink.

211
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,650
- I'll bring some food. 
- Oh, okay.

212
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,700
Here.

213
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,600
Here, here. Give me a drink as well.

214
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,860
Dad! Where did you put the squid?

215
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,840
That is in my bag.

216
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,930
Look for the squid! If you look closely, it's there.

217
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,800
 Where's the bag? 

218
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,100
Teacher Han, the makgeoli.

219
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,870
Oh my, it spilled.

220
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,180
Father, what are you doing not being careful?

221
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:34,340
Teacher, I'm sorry. I was looking away for a moment.

222
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,100
Professor Han,  do you have nyctalopia (night blindness)?

223
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,230
I'm sorry. Please excuse me.

224
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,510
Oh, yes.

225
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,330
- Aigoo...
- Father...

226
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,100
Doc...

227
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,710
 Aigoo... that... 

228
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:57,800
Dad, you should have held the cup well. What did you do that he spilled all the drink?

229
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,590
Making him embarrassed.

230
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,740
No...

231
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,640
I was just holding the cup.

232
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,130
Should the one holding the makgeoli put in the cup properly?

233
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,220
Who? Han Woo Jin?

234
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,300
Yes, Han Woo Jin...

235
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,500
At some time and place, I ...

236
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,240
Hurry up and go straight to the point.

237
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,270
It's definite that there is a problem with Han Woo Jin's eyes.

238
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:31,110
Eyes? These eyes?

239
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:37,590
Just like a blind person with his eyes open. Truthfully, last time, the reason why he said that he couldn't perform the decompressive craniotomy,

240
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,770
I suspected it's because of his eyes.

241
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,330
Don't tell me your suspicions, tell me the facts.

242
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,050
Fact. Makgeoli.

243
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,210
What's with the makgeoli?

244
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:47,000
He wasn't able to pour makgeoli properly.

245
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,420
Hey, Doctor Yoon. You need to ask the right questions to get to the top.

246
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:56,460
With this unclear information, how are you planning to take Han Woo Jin's place? Don't you think so, too?

247
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:01,680
That's right. Next time, I will bring you something more definite, a fact.

248
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,060
I don't need any dogs who can't hunt, they can't even be held as pets.

249
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:09,080
Go 'bite' something more definite. More definite!

250
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,030
Hunting dog?

251
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:22,390
His expressions make me offended. How can he say I'm a 'dog'?

252
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,350
How barbaric.

253
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,900
i was hopeful that this day wouldn't come...

254
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:35,390
Each day...I wish that it's tomorrow, the day after tomorrow.

255
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:40,080
The next year, and the next, and the next after that.

256
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:46,250
So every day was precious to me.

257
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:52,350
I wanted to finish, then leave. I went crazy to do as many surgeries and presentations as I could.

258
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,980
But all of a sudden like this...

259
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,720
Woo Jin.

260
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,890
That's why I'm going crazy.

261
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,360
Why me out of all people? What did I do wrong?

262
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,770
Why do I need to collapse like this in vain?

263
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:19,580
My mom who lived alone lonely with blind eyes.

264
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,410
I wanted her to stop her suffering.

265
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:29,570
I can become your eyes.

266
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:35,210
- Why would  you?
- Because I like you.

267
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,240
Because I love you.

268
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,990
This is plenty enough.

269
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,690
Woo Jin.

270
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,470
To Hae Sung,

271
00:20:54,420 --> 00:21:00,460
because of me you knew everything, but lived silently.

272
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,110
And the director is your father.

273
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,850
Although you are not the one who did it,

274
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,610
you take all the responsibility.

275
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,090
You know my feelings, so why are you like this?

276
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:26,920


277
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,850
During the time I can see you,

278
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,920
I want to keep it as long as I can.

279
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:45,200
You who appear in my memory,

280
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,060
you will be the same always.

281
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,300
Your eyes that look at me.

282
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,240
Your tears.

283
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:59,130
They are still pretty.

284
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,450
 In the maze like the Yeouido pipeline, 

285
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:24,800
 should I send someone who doesn't know what he is doing and make him suffer? 

286
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,810
 Do you think it's easy for me to talk to you about this? 

287
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,860
 I'm saying to save the nation with the least sacrificial victims. 

288
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,410
 For the nation and for the people. I'm giving you the chance to sacrifice. 

289
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:17,280
You must wake up.

290
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:23,590
So you can protect Hae Sung.

291
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:27,190
The person who can protect Lee Hae Sung,

292
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,200
is only you, Chairman.

293
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,710
Wait a minute. Oh, Prof. Han.

294
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:16,040
You must be late because of the makgeoli party. It reeks, right?

295
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:22,510
Secretary Park, don't we need to stop by the 11th floor quickly?

296
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,840
Professor Han, press the 11 floor for me.

297
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:32,230
- Pardon? 
 - I'm requesting you to press 11.

298
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,800
Yes.

299
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,180
I'll get off first.

300
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,930
Press 3rd floor.

301
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,480
But what about 12-

302
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,600
I said to press 3rd floor.

303
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,180
- 3rd floor.
 - Yes, I will press 3rd floor.

304
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:18,120
Prof. Han, look at you...

305
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,770
 

306
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:45,950
Why are you leaving so quickly? You didn't even get to sleep properly in the lobby.

307
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:50,860
Seeing so many people sleeping in the lobby, I felt so sorry looking at them.

308
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,050
Right?

309
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:57,690
Oh, Dad. Did you pack water and food well?

310
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:03,850
Oh, well. Don't worry about your dad! Is the sun coming out now?

311
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,400
I need to start going.

312
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,430
Alright. Be careful and go safely, Dad.

313
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:13,000
I love you.

314
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,080
You are sweet.

315
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:28,080
It seems he has nerve damage.

316
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:34,720
We need to wait for him to regain consciousness but in these cases, a disability to speak is certain

317
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,260
and his motor skills will be somewhat degraded.

318
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,350
As long as we find a different hospital and transport him...

319
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:46,610
Doctor Kang, you know an impaired brain can no longer be repaired.

320
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:50,170
So CEO Lee asked you to look for a hospital so earnestly.

321
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:54,880
I don't know the reason, but the radio became broken.

322
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,870
I'm sorry, CEO Lee.

323
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:02,980
Why did you go home? You should have just let Ji Hoon go.

324
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:07,620
What's so pretty about the kid that left before his parents,

325
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,410
that you wanted to see him off well?

326
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:15,840
My brother-in-law, in this cutting edge hospital,

327
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,470
he even has a brain surgeon as a brother and what is this?

328
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,440
How outrageous.

329
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:27,570
But I will take revenge for my brother-in-law.

330
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:31,660
In his situation, did the brain damage occur

331
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,700
from the earthquake that had

332
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,600
taken place at the site of the house?

333
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,930
I will certainly file a claims lawsuit.

334
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:46,030
This is because as I watched my brother-in-law

335
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,980
and also as a health professional,

336
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,190
it is something I must do.

337
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,120
As you stand in line for treatment,

338
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,740
if the patient is not present, the guardian must be present.

339
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,110
Each person receives one sheet.

340
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:17,160
And also, you must sign this paper to

341
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,160
receive any treatment.

342
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:24,740
Director! Director!

343
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,450
The firefighters just called

344
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,690
to bring patients right now.

345
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:33,990
Saying that since we are a public emergency hospital, we need to take the patients.

346
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:36,110
We don't have enough patient's rooms, what should we do?

347
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:40,950
And right now, there are hospitals being closed down.

348
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,020
Is that so?

349
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:45,210
Since we are a public emergency hospital, we should comply.

350
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:50,360
Section Chief Park, how many people in a vegetative state do we have in the hospital right now?

351
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,200
There are a total of 3.

352
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,510
If we make them leave forcefully, there will be problems.

353
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,650
File a form to the hospital commissions.

354
00:30:58,650 --> 00:30:59,890
Director.

355
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,160
Do you have a solution?

356
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,680
They sent us patients since we are a public emergency hospital.

357
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,750
We can't be selective to our patients

358
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:10,150
and cannot be careless to them either.

359
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:13,940
We must focus on the patients we can heal.

360
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,840
- But-
 - Director.

361
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,570
Please give us time until we look for a different hospital.

362
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:23,960
Time?

363
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:46,040
It's the best feeling when you trap the mouse.

364
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,430
I'm sorry that I keep asking you for favors.

365
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:55,460
I couldn't keep my mother in the hospital.

366
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,400
Different hospital...

367
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,200
Since the radio is broken, there's no method to transport my mother to another hospital.

368
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,790
I'm sorry, but it's no use if you ask me a favor.

369
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,200
Excuse me?

370
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,570
Ki Woong. Ki Woong!

371
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:11,920
Search a hospital for Teacher Lee.

372
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,010
Not Seoul, but Suwon or Incheon.

373
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,310
Me?

374
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,680
Well, you have better connections than I do.

375
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,350
It's because it's not a task that can be done in one or two days, you punk!

376
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,730
If possible, could you possible find out for me?

377
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,160
That... you should do it, too.

378
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,050
Stop making excuses.

379
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,990
You have to become a head firefighter one day, too.

380
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:40,660
You take responsibility and resolve it definitely, got it?

381
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,400
- Got it?
 - Yes.

382
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,800
Thank goodness I made it in time!

383
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,130
So Yeon opened her eyes and we are changing her room right now.

384
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,860
Is that so?

385
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,980
That's good, I can see my daughter then.

386
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:58,190
Please make sure to not cry in front of the kid.

387
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:03,450
And also don't smile too much as if this is nothing.

388
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:06,420
Don't emphasize "you can do it!," "you must win this fight."

389
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,390
Just so she can fight for herself.

390
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:11,940
You need to take care of her. Do you understand?

391
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,530
I understand.

392
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,980
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.

393
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,460
Mom.

394
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,340
Dad.

395
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:36,450
That's right, So Yeon. Mom's here.

396
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,460
What's the date?

397
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,100
I'm not sure. What date is it today?

398
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:45,170
I don't know either.

399
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:48,460
After the earthquake, we didn't see the time passing.

400
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,520
Did I sleep for a long time?

401
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,580
So Yeon, you slept a lot.

402
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,710
You were hurt a lot.

403
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:59,170
Wow.

404
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:02,920
My daughter...Dad is so thankful for overcoming that pain.

405
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,850
One and only dad's daughter,

406
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:10,070
I'm so thankful that

407
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:12,130
I won't say anything even if you get zero on a test.

408
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:14,930
Even if you go to dance practice, I won't say anything.

409
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:16,940
Dance practice?

410
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:30,770
Now, I won't have dance practice late at night so

411
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:33,490
don't worry, Dad.

412
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:35,180
So Yeon.

413
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:40,260
Yeonggwang's firefighter leader's daughter, Choi So Yeon.

414
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:45,200
You need to be brave like dad.

415
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,930
No matter what happens.

416
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,400
I request you, okay?

417
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,920
Okay.

418
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,990
I will be brave.

419
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:58,000
What's wrong if I don't have one leg?

420
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,110
I can just get an artificial leg

421
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:02,060
The doctor said.

422
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,380
That's right.

423
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:08,870
Wow. At times, Dad thinks our So Yeon is so pretty

424
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:11,200
that I wondered whether you are my daughter.

425
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,190
But you are my daughter.

426
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:15,600
You are Choi Il Sub's daughter.

427
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,640
Dad needs to go,

428
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,070
so stay well.

429
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,510
Why are you like this?

430
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:28,330
Like someone who is moving far away.

431
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:31,260
Of course, it's far away.

432
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,080
Just try going out there.

433
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,170
It's 1 hour with a car.

434
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:38,930
I don't even want to go. It's so dangerous.

435
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,590
I request you to take care of So Yeon well.

436
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:45,040
You, too, don't starve yourself because you are on a diet.

437
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,400
Why is this person like this really?

438
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,940
Doctor, I request you this patient as well.

439
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:56,700
Yes, I'm not going to give up on this patient easily after saving this patient.

440
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:01,580
He is probably the only patient who has had a surgery at an animal hospital.

441
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,920
You are very strong, mentally.

442
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,640
I'm envious.

443
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,830
Then, what am I supposed to do?

444
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,900
If I cry then,

445
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,030
my mom and dad...

446
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,700
their feelings will be hurt.

447
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,330
I wanted to show you my firefighter uniform.

448
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,310
I told you to open your eyes a bit.

449
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,930
Open your eyes later and look at it.

450
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:52,820
You will know how splendid mom's second son grew up like.

451
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:57,830
And I treated older brother really badly.

452
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,940
Later, help him forgive me.

453
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,370
That's your specialty.

454
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,340
Mom.

455
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:10,600
You have to open your eyes, okay?

456
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,100
Got it?

457
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,440
Alright, you can lower your hands.

458
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,890
There was a unanimous approval.

459
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:36,360
The removal of patients in comas have been decided.

460
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:39,060
With this, we will conclude our meeting.

461
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:42,790
Teacher, would you be able to get out?

462
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,080
You must be sad because of your mother.

463
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,520
It should be like that.

464
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,030
I don't know what to do either.

465
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,610
We should wait for the result.

466
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:56,890
Last time, other doctors helped us, too.

467
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:58,950
We should wait this time, too-

468
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,750
Go ahead...

469
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,970
You seemed to be waiting because you are curious of the result.

470
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:12,080
Unfortunately,

471
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,020
please get ready to leave.

472
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,920
Couldn't you help us with a warm heart?

473
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,430
It's something I can't do with my power.

474
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,370
This is decided by the hospital commissions.

475
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:24,460
Aren't we the same family working in the same hospital?

476
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,090
Let's go.

477
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,110
What do I...

478
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:31,560
What do I need to do?

479
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,380
Teacher Lee Hae Sung,

480
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:37,480
you should have kneeled when I said so.

481
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,850
Director! You shouldn't take this emotionally, don't you think?

482
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:42,680
Stop it!

483
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:51,770
I don't want to be in a hospital where they want to kick my mother out.

484
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:53,380
So, let's hurry up and get out.

485
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:59,910
Well, the two brothers should discuss and decide what to do next.

486
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,990
Will you be alright?

487
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,380
No, I didn't even get to tell him.

488
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:27,820
No, that's not it. The weather is getting cold now.

489
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:31,580
Oh. We need to hurry and move to a different place.

490
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:40,260
Mom dressed us, fed us, and put us to sleep.

491
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:46,130
But we can't even have a proper place for her to lie on.

492
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:49,420
Hurry up and earn money and place her in a good place.

493
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:53,890
Yeah, I'm sorry.

494
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:57,170
But mom should understand us.

495
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,920
Hey, Lee Woo Sung,

496
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,950
you've grown up. You grew up a lot.

497
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:05,210
I said don't do that kind of thing.

498
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:07,250
You know I hate you saying that the most.

499
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,950
Okay. I'm sorry.

500
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:12,110
Hurry and dye her hair. I don't like white hair.

501
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:16,190
I wish my mother is always pretty and young.

502
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,420
This rascal really grew up a lot.

503
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,070
Ah, seriously...do you want to die?!

504
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,900
Woo Sung, you punk!

505
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,970
What are you doing to your hyung?

506
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:28,320
He's just joking.

507
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,560
Teacher Lee, I heard. What should we do now?

508
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,230
Mother is moving here?

509
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:36,190
I'm sorry. No matter how I much I think about it, only this solution...

510
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,100
No, no...you did well.

511
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,070
We need to bring her alive.

512
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:43,050
Since this is not even inside the hospital...

513
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:45,880
Of course, this is the headquarters for firefighters,

514
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,110
it's safe.

515
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:49,000
That's what I'm saying.

516
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,570
So the director of the hospital won't be able to say anything about it.

517
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:55,000
Doctor Lee, me and Joo Ran will go around and watch your mother.

518
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,270
Don't worry.

519
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:57,440
Alright. Thanks.

520
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,690
What are you saying? Teacher Lee said it.

521
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,400
That friend's mother is my mother.

522
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,310
My mom will endure it well.

523
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,960
Just be careful of her arrythmia.

524
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,470
Chief, thank you so much for your understanding.

525
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:11,780
Aigoo, it's nothing.

526
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,110
Is she just anyone?

527
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:16,800
She is the mother of the doctor who saved my daughter's life and my minion's mother.

528
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,330
People who are alive right now are not even significant lives.

529
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:23,510
Aigoo, I'm tired of the earthquake. I'm sick and tired of it.

530
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:26,810
Captain, everything is ready. We can go now.

531
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:28,290
Oh, okay.

532
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:30,520
- DMAT Team will be leaving, too, right?
- Yes, we should.

533
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,650
Woo Sung, let's go.

534
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,460
I will go after visiting the hospital.

535
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,980
Okay.

536
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,020
- Excuse me. 
- Yes?

537
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,400
Have you seen Nurse Yeon So Hee?

538
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,570
Yes, she's in our team, but she left with the DMAT Team.

539
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:08,890
This please...

540
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:10,700
What is this?

541
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,070
I will be thankful if you just deliver this to her.

542
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,800
Yes, I got it.

543
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,590
- Hey there. 
 - Yes, I will give it to her.

544
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:21,660
No, it will be nice if you just put it in your pocket and deliver it to her.

545
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,400
Is there money inside here?

546
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,810
What is it?

547
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:28,020
It's something important.

548
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:34,810
Prof. Han, DMAT Team is leaving.

549
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,750
Professor Han, are you asleep?

550
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:05,670
 I'm tired of it. 

551
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:07,760
  I want to rest. 

552
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,030
 Even if you say I'm a fugitive, even if you say I'm a loser, 

553
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:13,750
 even if you say I'm irresponsible, it's all fine. 

554
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:16,630
 I'm sorry to everyone. 

555
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:17,780
 Han Woo Jin. 

556
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,460
What happened exactly?

557
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,150
Professor Han is not the person to do this.

558
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:24,040
What do you mean he isn't? He confessed all himself.

559
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,600
Fugitive, loser, and irresponsible. It is all written here.

560
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,710
Give it to me.

561
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:30,380
Do you think he is like you?

562
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:33,680
Do you think people don't want to work like you and run off like a coward?!

563
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,900
When I left, that was because they said the hospital was closing down.

564
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,720
- It was a emergency situation.
 - You are so loud. Stop it. I don't even want to hear it.

565
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,520
So, what's going to happen to the DMAT Team?

566
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,180
What does the firefighter chief say?

567
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,370
He must be waiting as I told him we will go.

568
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:49,470
Leave as we can't go because Prof. Han isn't here.

569
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:51,420
Work hard in each field we are all assigned to. Okay?

570
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,090
Hold on, then-

571
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:56,680
I think I need to be the leader. Because Mirae Hospital has name-value,

572
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,880
I don't think it's right to give the head position to an outsider.

573
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,760
Yeah. You will be great if you are the leader.

574
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,840
As an outsider, I'll work hard to help as much as I can.

575
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,970
Director Kang,

576
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:09,800
I request you to take care of my mother well.

577
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,490
Yeah, don't worry about that.

578
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:17,050
Hey, Woo Sung. Walk, don't run.

579
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:19,000
Do well.

580
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,150
Thank you! You worked hard.

581
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,390
- You got everything, right?
 - Yes.

582
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:52,380
Lee Hae Sung's  mom went to those tents?

583
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:53,590
Yes.

584
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:56,380
Aye, we should clear that from there, too.

585
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:59,600
But you need to be satisfied for at least kicking them out right?

586
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,460
I saw reporters, too.

587
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,110
Before any weird news come out,

588
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:06,760
make sure to emphasize it was decided by the hospital commissions.

589
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,100
Yes.

590
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:11,370
But I heard that they are not able to see Professor Han.

591
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:12,900
Really?

592
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,640
He really is a quick one.

593
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,730
Because he thought that I would make him take responsibility, he escaped.

594
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:34,050
I never imagined that Professor Han would disappear like this.

595
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,240
He must be gone so Doctor Lee can be safe.

596
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,320
Why?

597
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,470
Since he was not able to see properly and

598
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:46,650
allowed Doctor Lee to stand as an assist.

599
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:49,670
The director of the hospital was going to make him take responsibility.

600
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:55,230
What do you need to eat to be evil like the director of the hospital exactly?

601
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:00,570
Hey, be careful around here!

602
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:03,570
There is a water lane below these rocks.

603
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:04,410
Yes, yes.

604
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:06,300
Lets show Ddol Mi our strength!

605
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,610
Yes, I understand.

606
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,960
Aigoo, why is this like this?

607
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:31,720
Yes, I understand.

608
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,240
We have arrived.

609
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,790
Hey, Woo Sung, tell me what happened?

610
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:36,030
I memorized it.

611
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:37,500
You need to write it down!

612
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,120
Repeat it for me!
- Yeonggwang-do, Yeonggwang

613
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:43,520
#189, an injury from a fork crane,

614
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,450
needs emergency treatment.

615
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,130
I know, hurry up and get in.

616
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:52,410
Let's go!

617
00:46:56,390 --> 00:47:00,200
If it is left like this, Mega Construction can go bankrupt.

618
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:04,890
The Yeouido pipeline needs to be solved today.

619
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:07,820
You're too much. Be careful what you say.

620
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:11,530
Not only the savings from the company but also used loans.

621
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:13,360
If we cannot pay back the funding...

622
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,790
Then what?

623
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,600
Excuse me?

624
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:20,290
They live by their morals.

625
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:22,720
Whoever it is, someone will stand up to do it.

626
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,030
How long do we have?

627
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:28,370
They have set the deadline as tonight.

628
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:34,670
Rather than who, the problem will be when will they step up.

629
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:38,340
Where is Yeonggwang-do's Captain Choi?

630
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:48,140
Dad!!

631
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,790
We can't all go down so you guys bring the equipment.

632
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:52,720
Chief, chief. Where is my dad?

633
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,140
Yes, yes. Calm down a bit.

634
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,810
He is over there. You guide her.

635
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:58,010
Please follow me.

636
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:00,180
Hey, be careful! The ground is still a bit shaky 
 - Okay!

637
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,020
It's a mountain here, isn't it?

638
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,830
Please help us. Come here, please.

639
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:06,020
Sorry, I can't go

640
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:10,540
They're bringing the workers who got hurt right now.

641
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,180
Patients will come, so you need to treat them.

642
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:16,620
A leader decides whom to treat or not.

643
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,580
I am the leader.

644
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,060
Dad, how did you become like this?

645
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:29,250
Dol Mi, it's not your fault.

646
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:30,530
I know.

647
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:34,350
The floor broke down due to the earthquake.

648
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,020
I'll take care of you.

649
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,200
Calm down and wait over there.

650
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,560
Stay out here.

651
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:55,240
Heartbeat is 117 and the blood pressure is 50/120.

652
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,130
His breathing is fine.

653
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:00,340
I'm fine.

654
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:03,400
Is your arm or leg in pain?

655
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:05,670
I don't think anything is broken.

656
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:08,050
Nurse Park, look inside the bag here.

657
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:12,400
Monitor.

658
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:21,160
Something is ripped open...

659
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,710
Where do you think it ripped?

660
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:24,750
Is it the spleen?

661
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:30,010
No.. Dad...

662
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:32,100
I'm okay.

663
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:36,020
I'm your dad, nothing will happen.

664
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:39,730
Let's first move him to the hospital. Woo Sung!

665
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:41,170
I got it.

666
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:44,530
Vitals?

667
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:46,960
Blood pressure is 180/102, heartbeat is 130.

668
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,100
He has a high blood pressure but he looks fine.

669
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:50,850
Where does it hurt the most?

670
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:52,750
My stomach hurts.

671
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:54,330
Ah, here?

672
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:57,340
Here? Yes?

673
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:58,880
You're not going to use the ultrasound?

674
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,920
There's no blood, everything seems fine.

675
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,160
But it hurts?

676
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,450
It feels like it's going to rip.

677
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:10,850
Dad, don't worry. We're going to the hospital.

678
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:14,140
- I will fix you.
 - Of course, you will.

679
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:16,000
My daughter is a doctor.

680
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,620
I won't worry.

681
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:20,870
- There must be a heart inside the stomach, huh? 
- Nurse Park.

682
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:23,120
Why is the heartbeat so strong?

683
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,770
Doctor! Doctor! My dad--

684
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:26,910
Don't worry. He'll come soon.

685
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:27,930
Move.

686
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:29,720
This is my patient; I'm in the middle of treating him!

687
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,030
Shut up.

688
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:33,050
I'll look at your stomach.

689
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:35,760
- Does it hurt? 
- Yes.

690
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:41,260
Have you ever heard that you had an aneurysm?

691
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:43,150
What is that?

692
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:45,310
With his age, do you think he could have one?

693
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:47,550
What I feel with my hands is very large.

694
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:49,470
Let's go to the hospital immediately.

695
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:04,860
Dad...does it hurt a lot?

696
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:08,420
No. I'm okay.

697
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,720
Because of me, you came to Seoul and got hurt.

698
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,760
It's all because of me.

699
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,720
Ddol Mi, don't say that.

700
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:22,530
In my whole life, I had participated in a lot of volunteering.

701
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:26,230
Seoul became chaotic because of the earthquake.

702
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:29,980
I'm sorry, I should've come earlier.

703
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:37,120
What about your waist? Does your waist hurt as well?

704
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,180
It feels like it's going to rip.

705
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:43,580
It's not going to yet, but the aorta is going to burst.

706
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:46,170
- The aorta? 
- Yes, and its pretty big.

707
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:48,930
It's larger than 2 cm.

708
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:50,750
It can be even felt by just using your hands.

709
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:55,380
The patient is in critical condition.

710
00:51:56,450 --> 00:52:00,650
The blood pressure is rising 150/100,  heartbeat is 120.

711
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,970
The blood pressure isn't good.

712
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:06,350
If this bursts...

713
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,590
Since we are not sure, lets limit this area.

714
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:16,160
Hyeong Woo,  Yeong Saek, Chang Hee, come here with your notes.

715
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,470
I understand.

716
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:18,960
Let's go.

717
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,540
Chief.

718
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,380
Yes.

719
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:42,170
Captain Choi, you know the Roman Forum, right?

720
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:44,810
Yes?

721
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:47,690
Have you never been to Rome? Rome?

722
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:49,400
I've never been there.

723
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,850
Ah, yes.

724
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:55,640
Well, if you go to the Roman Forum there are landmarks there called the aquaducts.

725
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,150
From the Palatine to the Colosseum,

726
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:03,050
aquaducts stretch under all the buildings.

727
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:05,720
For 1000 years,

728
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:09,280
it was the center of politics, economy, and culture of Rome.

729
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,240
For 1000 years.

730
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,400
I'm saying for 1000 years.

731
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:15,550
And?

732
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:20,450
Taejongi Construction has been in Korea for more than 600 years, but

733
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:22,510
to us, we are like the Romans.

734
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:26,160
We must show our children 1000 years of Korea's glory.

735
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,080
Who will do it? Who can do it?

736
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:36,270
Destruction is an opportunity for new buildings.

737
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:38,490
I've done construction before, so I know.

738
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,910
Captain Choi,

739
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:45,830
for 1000 years of Korea,

740
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:48,140
you need to make a decision.

741
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:50,120
There's no time.

742
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,890
Rome didn't become like that in one day.

743
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:55,450
Ah, that Rome, Rome, Rome!

744
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,450
1, 2, 3.

745
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:13,730
My father...

746
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:15,960
That's your father?

747
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,450
It's okay, don't worry. There's a surgery room, he can get surgery right away.

748
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:21,010
Do both patients need surgery?

749
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:24,100
This patient has an aneurysm and it's going to burst in any second.

750
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:27,320
Is that so? Intervention is not working, what should we do?

751
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,360
Doctor Lee, you are going to have to take care of one of the patients and do the surgery.

752
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:35,110
All the other surgeons are in surgery right now.

753
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,830
Who is it?

754
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,220
Is it Woo Jin?

755
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,940
Yeah, Mom. It's me.

756
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:20,360
Woo Jin! Woo Jin!

757
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,860
Ah, Woo Jin! Aigoo.

758
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:25,990
Aigoo. Are you okay?

759
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:28,320
I heard that there was an earthquake in Seoul,

760
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:32,480
I wanted to go see my son because I was worried, but I couldn't because of my eyes.

761
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,740
So I came. I came to show you that I'm well.

762
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:38,430
Aigoo. Our doctor.

763
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:40,900
Aigoo, you got thin. You got skinny.

764
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:44,030
You haven't eaten, right? Let's go in.

765
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,860
Crew members!

766
00:55:54,860 --> 00:56:00,970
The nation won't ever forget the workers' sacrifice.

767
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,210
Firefighters! Fighting!

768
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:10,350
Have you gone crazy?

769
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:13,460
Why are you going into the Yeouido pipeline?

770
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:14,860
Then, what?

771
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:17,020
Who else knows the structure better than I do.

772
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:20,180
Because of the earthquake, I heard that place is filled with water. How are you planning to get in?

773
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:23,930
Don't you know how dangerous the base pump is?

774
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:26,140
I will go there instead.

775
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:28,160
- Hey. 
 - I'll go. 
 - Hey.

776
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:32,450
The only one who knows how to fix this, you, you and me. Amongst you guys, I am the most experienced.

777
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:33,930
The captain goes first.

778
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:35,850
If something goes wrong, you could die!

779
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,660
Ah, you--

780
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,600
Was it once or twice that we were on the verge of death?

781
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,000
What are you talking about, Woo Sung?

782
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,890
Tell me in detail.

783
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:46,290
Chief, this really isn't it!

784
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:47,690
Shut up!!

785
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:51,040
There's no time, so get the building map prepared.

786
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,870
The inside has lots of curves so I don't need a hose.

787
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:56,300
Make sure to prepare the wet suits.

788
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:58,240
- Got it? 
 - No way.

789
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,270
You know!

790
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:02,760
I'm doing it, yes?

791
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,110
What about So Yeon?

792
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:08,400
What about your 15 year old daughter?

793
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,800
What is happening exactly, Sunbae?

794
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,480
It's alright, don't worry. I can go in.

795
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,450
If Chief goes in, I won't stay still.

796
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:21,620
I won't go to your funeral.

797
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:23,930
I definitely can't go!

798
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,540
Vitals should be okay, right?

799
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:59,790
Don't worry. I will stay here.

800
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:07,480
Hello.

801
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,450
I'm sure the preparations are done...

802
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:11,840
Yes.

803
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,180
Dr. Jung.

804
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:16,930
Patient's family shouldn't participate in the surgery.

805
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,090
Doctor Lee, that is the position for the directing surgeon.

806
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:21,630
You need to stand next to me.

807
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:24,340
I am the directing surgeon for this surgery.

808
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:25,810
Yes?

809
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:27,730
Where's Doctor Lee?

810
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:35,150
Doctor! Why are you here?

811
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:37,390
Aren't you doing my dad's surgery?

812
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:41,360
Because of me, he came all the way to the hospital and got hurt.

813
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:43,700
Doesn't the Doctor need to do the surgery?

814
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:46,080
Let's go quickly. What are you doing?

815
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:48,490
Jung Ddol Mi,

816
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,830
I can't do his surgery.

817
00:58:51,830 --> 00:58:54,570
Huh? Why?

818
00:58:57,590 --> 00:59:05,420


819
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:20,360
 This is the center of Korea's monetary funds. 

820
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:22,020
 Financial institutions need to live for Seoul to live. 

821
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:24,910
 If you go in, you can't last more than 30 minutes. 

822
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:27,610
 I'm going. I said I'm going! As a chief, I'm going! 

823
00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:30,510
 I can't leave my father to a person who performs surgery with his mouth. 

824
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:32,120
 Doctor, please do it instead. 

825
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,900
 That sounds to me like you are asking me to commit murder. 

826
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:37,890
 I want to go to Busan after my father comes out of ICU. 

827
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:39,350
 Why are you treating me like I'm invisible? 

828
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:40,760
 Because you are that kind of existence to me. 

829
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:41,740
 Jung Dol Mi! 

830
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:45,490
 I don't think I will forget that you pushed back my father. 

831
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:50,110
 If the hand pump initiated the waves will be strong, 

832
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:52,730
 it will be hard to push against the current. 

833
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:54,330
 Let's just go. 

834
00:59:54,330 --> 00:59:56,150
 If we turn that, it's suicide. 

835
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:58,480
 They said the water must go out, it will work. 

836
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,170
 It will work!
