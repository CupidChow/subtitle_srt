1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,520
 Here, there's a person here! 

2
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,160
 I...want to live. 

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,070
 Get your head straight. I'll definitely save you. I promise. 

4
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:23,360
 If you couldn't save him, you could have just told us. 

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,720
  You are a butcher! 

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,520
 Not even a person, a butcher. 

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,680
 They're going to be at a relative's... At a relative's. 

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,340
 What do we do about our daughter? 

9
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,690
 Please protect Dong Ha. 

10
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,990
 Chief, there's somebody who saw Dong Ha at the Citizens' Hospital. 

11
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,660
 After it was shut down, he was moved to Incheon Hospital. 

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,990
 Episode 12 

13
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,760
Excuse me...

14
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,520
Son Dong Ha. 7 years old. I came because they said he was here.

15
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,200
He's my son.

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,840
Just a moment.

17
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,360
-He's a male, right?
-Yes.

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,190
Follow me.

19
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:23,760


20
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,040
Is he your son?

21
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,390
Yes.

22
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,050
Dong Ha.

23
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,250
Dong Ha, mom is here.

24
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,540
 We took a CT but there was no bleeding inside his head, 

25
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,120
 so we're just wrapping up his wound and are waiting for him to regain consciousness. 

26
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,840
Dong Ha, mom is here.

27
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,460
Why are you like this?

28
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,850
Open your eyes. Huh?

29
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,550
Dong Ha, open your eyes. Mom is here.

30
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,120
-Open your eyes, mom is here.
-Joo Ran, did you find Dong Ha?

31
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,600
Dong Ha...

32
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,130
Dong Ha!

33
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,550
Why is h-h-e lying down? Dong Ha.

34
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,990
Dong Ha...

35
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:23,240
I need to check out the k-kid's condition in detail,

36
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,980
so either get the ER Head or the Director. Are they not in?

37
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,630
Hey, find them.

38
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,530
I'm a congressman, no- I'm a chief ambassador.

39
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,630
Joo Ran, drink this.

40
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,190
Thank you.

41
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:14,660
You should have asked me first to confirm if Dong Ha was here.

42
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,780
Anyway, someone else ordered it.

43
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,670
How can I find a person who doesn't even know what Dong Ha looks like?

44
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,000
I, too,

45
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,710
had so much work to do and lost my mind.

46
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,850
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

47
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,820
You also must have heard the Director's words before.

48
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,660
There were no visible problems in the CT scan, so let's not worry too much.

49
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,900
Time will resolve it.

50
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,210
- Joo Ran. 
 -Yes?

51
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,240
I saw a response from Dong Ha. His eyeballs moved.

52
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,300
- Dong Ha. Dong Ha. Dong Ha. 
 - Dong Ha?

53
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,970
Dong Ha?

54
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,780
Mom.

55
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,160
Can you recognize Mom?

56
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,970
Dong Ha.

57
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,710
Thank you.

58
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,350
Dong Ha, you're going to live.

59
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:14,240
Dong Ha, I'm here, too. Our Dong Ha, you're strong.

60
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,540
What about Lee Hae Sung's surgery?

61
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,850
Did he die?

62
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,650
That's why I told him not to do it...

63
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,800
Where is Lee Hae Sung right now?

64
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,410
Doctor's room.

65
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:08,810
 It would have been good...if I was born healthy. 

66
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,530
 I'm sorry, Dad. 

67
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,660
 Doctor, 

68
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:21,180
 please donate my eyes. 

69
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,550
 Even if it's like that, 

70
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,790
 I want to live and see. 

71
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,340
Lee Hae Sung.

72
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,900
 Lee Hae Sung. 

73
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,080
 I already know you're in there. 

74
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,620
Lee Hae Sung!

75
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,820
Ji Won.

76
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,130
Go safely.

77
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,820
I'm sorry...

78
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,150
that we couldn't save you.

79
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,800
Even if he is my son, I can't see him because it's too terrible.

80
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,060
How could he do that to someone's body...?

81
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,630
Bad bastard...

82
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:06,160
I always have a reason when I fire people.

83
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,990
It's because brother-in-law said that Lee Hae Sung has the talent and all.

84
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,660
He's a bomb who has firecrackers stuffed inside him.

85
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,880
It makes no sense to reconsider it.

86
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,860
Don't ever let a human like that ever step foot into this hospital.

87
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,760
Reinstatement? With whose permission?

88
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,740
Aunt, you saw Ji Won alive because of Doctor Lee.

89
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,190
Don't be like that.

90
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,130
Look at my child.

91
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,320
I'm afraid he'll come out like that in my dreams.

92
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,230
Aunt,

93
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,790
if Ji Won...

94
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:41,140
had met a doctor who easily gave up on life,

95
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,000
then would he have left less painfully?

96
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,100
What?

97
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,110
A kid with a muscle disease, he won't even live long anyway.

98
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,250
"He's been buried for too long, just give up"

99
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,910
When they were all like that,

100
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,080
Doctor Lee Hae Sung jumped in by himself.

101
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,710
Ji Won couldn't live,

102
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:07,890
but it's a time where you should thank Doctor Lee, not a time for you to curse and resent him.

103
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,050
Can you say that after looking at that wound?

104
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,020
This happened because he tried to save him.

105
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,360
He's not a person! He's the devil.

106
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,810
Your cousin just died.

107
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,590
What do you mean thanking a doctor who couldn't even save someone?

108
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,700
It's all...because of me.

109
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,850
It's because of me he caught the disease, too.

110
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,380
-Brother-in-law.
-Uncle.

111
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,360
-Uncle.
-Park Ji Na!

112
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,350
You stop interfering in this situation.

113
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,700
This is my life.

114
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,880
You've done enough rebelling!

115
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,870
I won't ever just pass by this surgery.

116
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,760
Medical treatment outside one's skills... that's murder.

117
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,400
You don't have the right to say that.

118
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,990
Both you and the Director,

119
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,930
what is your relation?

120
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,150
The person you didn't want me to become like,

121
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:29,650
is your father?

122
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,280
It's something that doesn't matter.

123
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,570
Tell me.

124
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,570
I thought something was there whenever you avoided talking about your father.

125
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,800
Did you see your father in me?

126
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,530
Is that why you left me?

127
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,210
Even when my father was distressed,

128
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,870
because Mom became depressed,

129
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,550
he was her husband while being a doctor.

130
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,620
He was embarrassed when Mom tried to commit suicide,

131
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,750
and fearing he had brought on her depression,

132
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,160
the truth behind her suicide might be known,

133
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,670
because his reputation was in jeopardy, because there may be rumors,

134
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,050
he quietly abandoned Mom, who was in such pain.

135
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,900
And then me, too.

136
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,500
You?

137
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,380
You also abandoned your junior,

138
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,620
wondering if your mistake might be revealed,

139
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,590
wondering if the reputation that you've built up might come tumbling down.

140
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:52,270
Disguising yourself and lying.

141
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,870
Ji Na,

142
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,350
I won't say that it's not true.

143
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,440
But I am not the Director.

144
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,920
I...

145
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,780
know what choice ambitious men choose.

146
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,830
I don't want to be abandoned again.

147
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:18,100
Once was enough for an experience like that.

148
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,740
 Look at it. 

149
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,300
 This is your daughter. 

150
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,240
 Our So Yeon... 

151
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,040
 became like this. 

152
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,260
Captain Choi.

153
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,700
He hasn't been up here in a while.

154
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,480
For someone that already knows that his mother has arrhythmias...

155
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,880
This is the first time that I've seen him so defeated as well.

156
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,780
I heard that surgeons experience this many times.

157
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:50,050
I thought he was strong.

158
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,680
It was his first table death.

159
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,450
I talked to the doctor here for a bit.

160
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:22,670
Besides So Yeon's hurt leg,

161
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,400
they say she has a serious illness.

162
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,180
Yes?

163
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,580
They say Takayasu arteritis commonly affects females.
 

164
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,680
The heart's arteries become smaller,

165
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,450
and the aorta becomes inflamed.

166
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,690
She can just get surgery.

167
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:46,410
Right now, her aortic complications are pretty serious.

168
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,630
She also has sepsis.
 

169
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,370
It's already a difficult surgery.

170
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:57,130
There are no doctors in this hospital who said they would do surgery.

171
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,440
T-Then...

172
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,860
Are they just waiting for her to die?

173
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,780
No way...

174
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:08,080
Well that's happening right now. Nobody's doing anything.

175
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,540
I...

176
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,550
I thought she followed her mother to a relative,

177
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,490
so I didn't even worry.

178
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,090
If I had heard that she came to Seoul to see a concert,

179
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,340
if I knew she was still in Seoul,

180
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,620
I would have saved citizens and saved my daughter,

181
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,440
and she wouldn't have had to get her leg amputated.

182
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,320
But I can't do this and I can't do that.

183
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,750
What can I do now? Huh?

184
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,740
Please help me.

185
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,090
I can't send her like this. Please help me.

186
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,800
Even if Dr. Lee Hae Sung was here, he would have done it...

187
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,350
Is Lee Hae Sung here?

188
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,450
He's not at Mirae Hospital.

189
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:57,280
- He went somewhere- 
 -Yes, there...

190
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,420
He said he had to do a surgery on President Lee's husband's son,

191
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,330
so he was reinstated and the surgery room was reopened.

192
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,370
Lee Hae Sung is there.

193
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,890
- Really? 
 -Yes.

194
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:12,860
He's really there! Doctor Lee Hae Sung won't just stare and do nothing, right?

195
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,270
Romeo. Juliet.

196
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,960
Did you die?

197
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,490
I ran out of food.

198
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,470
I can't even save you guys, how can I save humans...

199
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,650
I'll send you guys off, too.

200
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,210
Doctor. Doctor Lee!

201
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,300
Seriously, why are you like this?

202
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,220
Doctor!

203
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:21,000
What are you doing to the bugs right now?

204
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,290
I can't even save bugs.

205
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,250
They're about to die because of me, so I'm sending them off. Because of me.

206
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,830
Why is that your fault?

207
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,990
You tried to save them.

208
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,340
If I tried, I should have saved them.

209
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,020
They died.

210
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,970
If you save everyone,

211
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:44,130
you'd be God not a doctor.

212
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,930
Up to now,

213
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,260
I was wrong.

214
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,310
Without the ability to even save people,

215
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:01,410
stubbornly, for selfish desires,

216
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,230
I wanted to perform surgeries for my personal satisfaction.

217
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,740
Wearing a gown and pretending to be a doctor, without knowing my own capabilities,

218
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,350
it was already hard enough for him.

219
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,970
It's right for me to leave.

220
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,350
There were a lot of hard things made by me.

221
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,370
Because of me...

222
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,410
Because of me...

223
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:33,520
If I sutured just a little better,

224
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,140
Ji Won would have survived, right?

225
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,360
If I...

226
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,960
suctioned just a little bit better,

227
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,370
that kid would be probably be in the recovering room.

228
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,800
Why is that your fault?

229
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,650
So why is it your fault?

230
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,910
Shut up.

231
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,140
You don't need to know.

232
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,600
Why do you create these situations to bother yourself?

233
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,290
Get out.

234
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,030
You're going to say bad things.

235
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,270
Can't you say them next time?

236
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,110
Doctor Lee is having a hard time right now.

237
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,850
It was a situation where no one could save him.

238
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,260
Why did he do the surgery?

239
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,930
I felt really good when we saved a person.

240
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,020
There is nothing worse than what I feel right now.

241
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,990
You learned a big thing after coming to Seoul.

242
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,000
With my kind of stomach,

243
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,740
general surgeons or thoracic surgeons who have to see patients live and die,

244
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,340
I don't think that I could do it.

245
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,610
I want to die.

246
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:03,250
I think I kind of understand why you

247
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,410
don't do emergency surgeries.  If the circumstances aren't favorable,

248
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:09,140
why you say we shouldn't do the surgery,

249
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,130
I think I now understand a little.

250
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,040
I was sorry, Doctor.

251
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,140
Perhaps, after passing the bomb over to Lee Hae Sung,

252
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:25,230
I might have been the doctor... who enjoyed the peace that followed.

253
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:31,180
Since I can decide one's life under the bounds of my predictions;

254
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:35,890
perhaps, you can say that I tried to come close to God's role.

255
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:41,470
Hae Sung and I....

256
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,150
There might be no better match.

257
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,710
Let me just confirm something, Nurse Park Ji Na.

258
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,620
The deceased patient Yoo Ji Won...

259
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:06,580
The ruptured artery, I heard you were convincing everyone to let you do it.

260
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:15,580
Yes. Because the intern said he couldn't do it,

261
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,040
I said I would do it with some guidance.

262
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,280
There are other things you can be guided through!

263
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,360
Are your mistaking yourself for a doctor after following a few doctors around?

264
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,140
Why? Did I say something wrong?

265
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,930
Just follow me out.

266
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:32,790
Park Ji Na, our conversation isn't over. See you later.

267
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,630
Why are you like this?

268
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,100
Hey, why? Why are you like this?

269
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,540
Be gentle.

270
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,650
They say she's the Hospital Director's daughter.

271
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,550
Really?

272
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,970
Why are you telling me that now?

273
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:50,300
The entire hospital knows.

274
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:57,050
Dae Gil, what do I do now?

275
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,350
Ji Na,

276
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,840
don't misunderstand.

277
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,410
I...was just worried that you might

278
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:14,780
not be able to be a nurse anymore.

279
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:18,830
I was just telling you that I wanted to converse with you about it a little more.

280
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:23,810
Doctor Lee Hae Sung is the problem. There are things to order an intern to do but giving a ridiculous order like that...

281
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,710
It's fine.

282
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,780
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

283
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,120
I want to continue conversing but-

284
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,650
-This is all because of DMAT.
-Yes, DMAT. It's because of DMAT.

285
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,510
I'm not going out on DMAT ever again.

286
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:37,370
If I go out there, I feel like my medical license is going to get taken away before I even get to become a doctor.

287
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:40,520
That ruptured artery, I took care of it. I did.

288
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,160
If we left him alone, he would have died at that spot. It's good enough that we saved him and brought him all the way to the hospital.

289
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,270
What's the problem now?

290
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,400
Do you guys really have nothing to do?

291
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,440
The people who ran away after going into the surgery theater as assistants are only talking.

292
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,550
What?

293
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:58,220
Hey, Busan Doctor. You started chasing someone so did your fear evaporate or something?

294
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,270
What did you say?

295
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:03,760
My stomach really hurt! You don't even know anything.

296
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,550
Don't just talk based on results.

297
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:09,610
For us, there's a set limitation to one's influence and capabilities.

298
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:13,680
That surgery was not something an orthopedic surgeon could have done.

299
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,970
A problem was bound to happen if it was done.

300
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:18,270
Then, did the DMAT just go out to pronounce death?

301
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:21,740
I'm saying that it makes no sense to even be appointed for DMAT.

302
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,480
Anyway, Doctor Lee Hae Sung is the problem.

303
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,330
He was at the site.

304
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:29,150
Why did he let a orthopedic resident do it?

305
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:32,530
How do we know he didn't die from the ruptured artery?

306
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,610
What are you saying?

307
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:43,990
Who provided the treatment on Yoo Ji Won's neck?

308
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,710
I did it.

309
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:49,510
I'm aware that you're only a resident.

310
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,410
I'm a doctor who has a medical license.

311
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,940
There's no problem.

312
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,270
There isn't a problem and a problem.

313
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:59,290
What did Doctor Lee Hae Sung do at that scene?

314
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,980
He hurt his hand a bit.

315
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,370
Hurt his hand a bit?

316
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:10,760
So with his injured hand, he did the surgery?

317
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,240
Well, something is very weird.

318
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,330
Something is really weird.

319
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,900
-Doctor Jung.
-Yes?

320
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,670
I am a doctor and also a part of the bereaved family.

321
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:30,360
If I pose a problem, I can do that, right?

322
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,230
Leave Doctor Lee Hae Sung alone.

323
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,050
He's already having a hard time and suffering.

324
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:46,100
With what qualifications do you-

325
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:49,950
You're only a nurse yet you touched the scalpel?!

326
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,890
After hanging around Lee Hae Sung,

327
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,530
did you want to imitate a doctor that much?

328
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,760
I purposefully pulled you out of Lee Hae Sung's surgery.

329
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,390
But you walked inside with your own feet and scrubbed in?

330
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,870
Stop acting.

331
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,750
I would rather you reprimand me on why I saved uncle.

332
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,120
What?!

333
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:13,320
The Mirae Medical Group that you adoringly raised up, you want it to become yours, right?

334
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,860
Until Dr. Lee Hae Sung came back with Uncle-in-law and Ji Won,

335
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,500
you probably thought about sitting on top of the throne as the main character.

336
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,360
Don't make assumptions and speak as you please!

337
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,790
Why do you dislike Dr. Lee Hae Sung so much?

338
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,960
Because he's a bomb in the hospital?

339
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,410
It's because there's a crime you and Doctor Han Woo Jin committed.

340
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:31,590
You don't want Dr. Lee Hae Sung to know the truth!

341
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,240
If you're staying near Lee Hae Sung more because of that reason,

342
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,170
I will destroy Lee Hae Sung even more.

343
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:42,000
So I will make you watch how I destroy Lee Hae Sung.

344
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,140
You're really-

345
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,600
And!

346
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:49,330
Away with Lee Hae Sung too! You both provoked me too much.

347
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,950
I'm not finished talking yet!

348
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:55,110
Lee Hae Sung and you... provoked me too much!

349
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,390
What do you know?

350
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,010
People are watching. Ah, seriously. Please.

351
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,900
That's why I'm going somewhere where they're not watching, you jerk!

352
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,200
Really, why are you doing this?

353
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,420
Hey! If you wanted to leave DMAT, then you can just leave quietly.

354
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,920
Why were you talking about what Park Ji Na was doing?

355
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,170
Because of you, Doctor Lee got hit by a fireball for no reason!

356
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,800
Ah, seriously!

357
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,250
Who are you to hit me? Hey, Orthopedic!

358
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:49,320
"You"? You're only an intern.

359
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,650
Ah, okay. Hit, hit, hit, try hitting me. Do whatever you want.

360
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,740
-You're going to die, seriously.
-Kill me.

361
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,940
Getting dragged out into DMAT and getting covered in crap, so why?

362
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,210
Why would I go out?

363
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:01,580
I need to become a plastic surgeon. Why are you interfering with my future?

364
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,720
And truthfully, are you really someone great?

365
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,970
I'm asking if you are.

366
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:09,280
You are just a hired troop, a hired troop. And I am Mirae Hospital's representative.

367
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,290
Then you should know that you're in a position to receive instructions from me, as a representative.

368
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,070
Did I say something wrong right now?

369
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:16,580
No...ah, seriously.

370
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,850
-What I'm saying-
-Did I say something wrong? Why can't you talk?

371
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:21,680
-Tell me.
-I'm about to tell you, you idiot!

372
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,750
I know what you're saying,

373
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,480
but let me ask you for a favor.

374
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,860
Favor! Are you going to listen?

375
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,900
What is it?

376
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:39,200
Dr. Lee is really depressed.

377
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:45,030
A person like that can't even get up. You can't be stepping on him like you step on barley.

378
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:49,810
You can worry about your future while looking at the situation around you.

379
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:55,160
Your intention was the same, you wanted to save that child.

380
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,450
Ah, did anyone not want to save him?

381
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,860
...yo.  (formal tone) 

382
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:04,090
Ah, I really don't want to go out on DMAT. Seriously.

383
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:08,970
Ah, that, that, that. When will he mature?

384
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:28,040


385
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,300
Ah, that scared me!

386
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,980
Let's listen to it together.

387
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,850
It scared me!

388
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:56,120
I did knock okay; you didn't hear it.

389
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,400
Ah, it's nice.

390
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,090
It seems like there's an earthquake inside the car.

391
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:04,380
Yes?

392
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,840
It seems like an earthquake!

393
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,760
Aren't you really going to do DMAT? I heard you don't want to.

394
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,860
Rumor really travels fast.

395
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:22,550
Just now, I liked the Doctor Ahn Dae Gil that was in the surgery room.

396
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,970
What do you like?

397
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:27,840
The determination that you have to save the child you rescued from the DMAT;

398
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,110
with some kind of passionate gaze.

399
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,940
I liked that kind of thing.

400
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,190
It's a waste.

401
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:40,330
Because I know what it's like to survive at the scene, I wanted to do whatever I could to save them.

402
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:45,860
When I saved my friend, Min Cheol and when I saved someone at the airport,

403
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,830
it was true that my heart was overwhelmed with emotions.

404
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,620
But...

405
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,870
But?

406
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,770
But I've never seen it in the textbook or done it before;

407
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,880
of course, I was scared.

408
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,870
Not everyone can be Doctor Lee Hae Sung.

409
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:08,530
There's something that you're better at than Lee Hae Sung.

410
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:13,270
Doctor Ahn says 'It's hard' when it's hard. You know how to say things honestly.

411
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,550
Lee Hae Sung isn't like that.

412
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:19,450
He lies to himself, saying that it's okay...

413
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:21,740
But that's really bad.

414
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,770
Well, my personality isn't like that.

415
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:28,740
That's right! Doctor Ahn, you're doing well now.

416
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,710
And in the future, just say everything honestly like you are now.

417
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,690
You're cool.

418
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,950
Do you want to listen to a song I like?

419
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,550
Should we?

420
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,340
Tada!
♫  We always end the day together ♫ 

421
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,930
I'm going to let it go~

422
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:18,760
There is a song, coffee, and bonfire.

423
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:22,920
Drinking coffee outside is quite great... right?

424
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:29,740
Moreover, it seems that the part-time waitress is quite useful.

425
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:36,470
You're becoming boring, you know. 
♫  Will become cozy comfort for the end of your tiring day too ♫ 

426
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:39,290
Customer, my hand is kind of hurting. 
♫  I want to naturally  ♫ 

427
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,870
My hand is falling off. 
 ♫  sync my breathing with yours ♫ 

428
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,830
Please drink it.

429
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,850
Are you not going to drink it?

430
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,030
When you're depressed,

431
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:08,080
just sleeping is the best.

432
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:14,730
I'll give the bugs food and I'll take care of the whole ICU.

433
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:21,060
So Doctor, just forget everything and sleep.

434
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,440
Okay?

435
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,570
Okay?

436
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,860
Ah, Doctor.

437
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,740
It's okay,

438
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,750
Lee Hae Sung.

439
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,570
Have strength.

440
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,360
Why do you want to see me...

441
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,140
A disaster such as an earthquake;

442
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:38,810
in order to even overcome it a little bit, a team that I launched... D-DMAT.

443
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:43,770
I hope that the Mirae Hospital's DMAT would operate without any harm.

444
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,150
Yeah, that must be true.

445
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,200
If there's a problem, I should block it and make changes.

446
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,920
Yes. Of course.

447
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:57,070
Then today, even though Doctor Lee Hae Sung was there, why the orthopedic 3rd year resident...

448
00:35:57,070 --> 00:36:00,040
Why there would be such a mistake,

449
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,710
you have to tell me truthfully.

450
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,370
That...

451
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,590
Do you like chocolate?

452
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,250
This chocolate...

453
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:27,030
Black chocolate is good for the heart.

454
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,630
These emergency rations are hard to obtain.

455
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,300
Where would you get these from?

456
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,840
Here, have one.

457
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,640
- Professor Kim Hyun Sook. 
 - Yes?

458
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,820
Yes?

459
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,160
I'm not a professor.

460
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:57,120
Professor Kim Hyun Sook... Hangang Mirae has collapsed.

461
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,240
Iis there another hospital for you to go to?

462
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:07,600
This home health nursing team...

463
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,660
We need a competent nurse like you.

464
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:14,300
It's the part that all the nurses desire to be part of, but...

465
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:18,250
I can't just give it to anyone.

466
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:22,780
From what I see, Nurse Kim is quite suitable for the role.

467
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,860
Teacher Lee...

468
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,890
Teacher Lee?

469
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:38,370
- Which Teacher Lee? 
 The tall one.

470
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:40,250
- Teacher Lee Hae Sung? 
 - Yes, Lee Hae Sung.

471
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,250
What about him?

472
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,820
He got a little weird all of a sudden.

473
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,060
Why did you do that at the scene today?

474
00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:00,580
Your hand was shaking and your breathing was weird. Everything was strange.

475
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:10,150
PTSD.
 

476
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:12,290
Really?

477
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,430
As soon as I encountered a buried patient on site,

478
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:20,700
the image of the buried person from Hangang Mirae that I couldn't save became overlapped...

479
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,220
Let's stop.

480
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,710
Let's treat it.

481
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,940
Would it get better?

482
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,170
I'm not a quack.

483
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:34,800
If it doesn't get better, are you going to continue being a doctor like that?

484
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,220
Can you be a doctor?

485
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,210
It would be better to blame it on the disease...

486
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,580
Won't it be better to quit as a doctor?

487
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,180
What?

488
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:51,760
I only wear a doctor's gown. Whenever I see a patient, I insanely jump up and down,

489
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:56,350
using all kinds of methods to save the patient.

490
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,630
I want to rest. Leave.

491
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,890
He did surgery with PTSD.

492
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,900
You've been caught by me, Lee Hae Sung.

493
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,440
Caught!

494
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,610
This isn't a joke.

495
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:49,140
Isn't it that the side rail of this stretcher isn't locked in place?

496
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,060
Yes, I'll hold it.

497
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,090
I'm turning the stretcher. Clockwise.
 - Yes.

498
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,990
Don't run.

499
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:04,120
Chief Kang! How is Dong Ha?

500
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,910
He hurt his head, but the CT is fine.

501
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:08,220
Chief Choi's daughter is a problem though.

502
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,840
Let's move her to Bed 5.

503
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,360
Come to Bed 1.

504
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,940
One, two, three.

505
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,400
Hey, connect this.

506
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,480
Thank you.

507
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,160
It's nothing.

508
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,430
Chief, is Dong Ha okay?

509
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:23,260
Where is Lee Hae Sung?

510
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,600
About that...

511
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,780
Mom,

512
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:34,670
do you think I did well?

513
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:38,000
The patient...

514
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:43,560
Letting him where he needs to go,

515
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:46,520
would it have been better for both of us?

516
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:55,280
Answer me, Mom.

517
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:00,710
Rather than just sleeping,

518
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,750
following Dad would have been better.

519
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,330
We've been looking for you. Look over a patient, Lee Hae Sung.

520
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:22,520
Dr. Lee Hae Sung, it's my daughter.

521
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,360
I beg you.

522
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:30,060
Seeing that you guys are looking for me, no one else must want to handle this patient.

523
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:34,510
They amputated her leg. She has Takayasu Arteritis. She also has sepsis.

524
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,070
I don't look after patients anymore.

525
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:41,820
Dr. Lee, I'm asking you to save my daughter. Please?

526
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:45,850
Dr. Lee, why are you like this?

527
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:50,480
The boy we saved from the swimming pool, you tried everything to save him.

528
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,670
But why aren't you doing the same for my daughter?

529
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,230
Is it because I'm poor?

530
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:59,280
Are you discriminating against people now? Huh?

531
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,000
You told me to rescue everyone, that you'll save everyone.

532
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:06,770
Dr. Lee, please save my daughter.

533
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:09,000
You aren't this kind of person.

534
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,370
Dr. Lee,

535
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,910
please... save my daughter... Please.

536
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:19,610
Why are you doing this to me exactly?

537
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:22,870
Why are you coming to me and clinging on?

538
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:26,320
Even if I do a crazy surgery to save her,

539
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:29,310
she'll die.

540
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:31,950
She's going to die.

541
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,270
Sister,

542
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:55,570
this is to fire Dr. Lee Hae Sung.

543
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:58,790
This is the pink slip stating that you will fire him.

544
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,760
And this one,

545
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,510
concerning the suspension of Lee Hae Sung's medical license,

546
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:09,100
This is saying that you wish to refer this matter to the committee board.

547
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,530
Just like how my son went so wrongly,

548
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:19,200
that doctor must suffer.

549
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,190
We'll see the results.

550
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,050
Thank you, Noona.

551
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,080
It's finished, Professor.

552
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,790
Did the preliminary checkup go well?

553
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:31,970
If it's like this, will the CT work properly?

554
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,680
How is it?

555
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:25,180
Can't you look at her one more time, Chief?

556
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:28,970
Even if I examine her again, it's the same.

557
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:32,920
First, enough to handle the massive hemorrhage,

558
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,750
and on top of that, there's not even enough blood in the hospital right now.

559
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:39,790
Blood...? I can supply that.

560
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,500
Patient's blood vessel situation is too much of a bad condition.

561
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,780
Sepsis is bad, too.

562
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,800
There is too low of a survival rate. I am sorry.

563
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,510
Just think of her as your sister,

564
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:59,890
your family,

565
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,710
and look at her one more time.

566
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,310
Please.

567
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,540
Please help save her.

568
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:15,500
Even if it were my sister,

569
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,820
what can't be done, can't be done.

570
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:19,840
I'm sorry.

571
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:37,280
What do we do?

572
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:41,850
What are we going to do?

573
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,580
You know,

574
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:15,090
I wanted to keep you in this world a little longer.

575
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,060
I wanted to fulfill your small dream.

576
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:29,540
I'm sorry.

577
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:38,060
That I couldn't save you.

578
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,920
A person like me...

579
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:02,680
doesn't deserve to be a doctor.

580
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:14,250
Why are you here?

581
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:16,870
Where do you think this is that you can just come in here like that?

582
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:19,400
I'm sorry.

583
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,620
I don't want to hear that kind of stuff.

584
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,790
I don't want to see your face.

585
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:27,790
Get out. Get out. Get out.

586
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:29,770
Get out!

587
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,350
Get out...

588
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,390
Ji Won...

589
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,000
Ji Won...

590
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:55,650
Ji Won!

591
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:58,990
What is mom going to do?

592
00:50:57,270 --> 00:51:01,530
While hiding, it was waiting for the rat to disappear.

593
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:06,610
Would have one second, two seconds, three seconds passed just like that?

594
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:08,730
- In the end, the rat-
- Dong Ha!

595
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,330
Oh, Director.

596
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:15,110
Dong Ha.

597
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:18,640
Do you know how incredible your mom truly is?

598
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,060
Even after she lost you, she didn't give up

599
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:24,440
and stayed to protect the hospital's patients.

600
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,030
How incredible of a doctor is she?

601
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:28,640
Are you sleeping?

602
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:31,670
I'm sorry.

603
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:37,940
If you had just let us known, finding him might have been easier.

604
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:40,410
Instead, there may have been some things lost as well.

605
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:46,050
Thanks to you, Dong Ha seems like he's going to be fine.

606
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:47,490
Relax yourself.

607
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:52,160
Since a neurosurgeon specialist says that, I am relieved.

608
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:56,110
Also, about the DMAT team,

609
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:59,070
let's go to your room to talk about it.

610
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:08,760
A problem arose on the first day DMAT went out.

611
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:16,090
Nurse Park Jin Ha insisted that she will do something nurses cannot do, and the Busan orthopedics resident...

612
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:22,440
tried clipping the ruptured carotid.

613
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:28,030
The biggest problem is Doctor Lee Hae Sung.

614
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:54,020
 I want to live. I'm really scared. 

615
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,970
I think it's certain he has PTSD.

616
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:11,030
He was not in a state to provide treatment. On top of that, he went into my nephew's surgery room.

617
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:12,930
I think that he made him die.

618
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:14,320
Director, that can't be.

619
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:20,310
We will know when we do the autopsy... Based on the actions of the orthopedic resident,

620
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:22,720
I do think that there's going to be a problem.

621
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:26,760
Yes.

622
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,020
Um...Director, you're on the news.

623
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:33,500
Ah, is that so? Let's see the news. Sit.

624
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:43,530
 From public to private health care, you had launched the first DMAT in Mirae Hospital... What is the reason for that? 

625
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:47,310
 After the earthquake, 72 hours is a golden time. 

626
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:53,450
 So what I am saying, during that time, patients who are rescued at the site and properly treated, their recovery rate is high, 

627
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:57,850
  but after that golden time has passed, nothing is guaranteed. 

628
00:53:57,850 --> 00:54:03,220
 Although our medical team is small, but it's the most effective way to protect citizen's lives. 

629
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:10,520
 So we had made a conclusion to personally step out although it is a dangerous site. 

630
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:14,760
 That is also the duty of a doctor. 

631
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:22,350
With the interview out like this, it's not like we cannot undo DMAT.

632
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:28,720
I can't trust Lee Hae Sung and Jung Dol Mi...

633
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:36,350
Doctor Han Woo Jin.

634
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:37,700
Yes?

635
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:41,350
You be in charge of DMAT team, how about it?

636
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:48,540
If you give Doctor Lee Hae Sung time, he'll be okay in no time.

637
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:53,930
When golden time passes, it's meaningless and useless.

638
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:57,520
I'll do it. Just leave it to me.

639
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:20,610
It's all over.

640
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:28,760
Now, it's all over.

641
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:48,370
Attention, everyone. I think the rumor has already spread.

642
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:53,000
Yes, you're right. All of the people gathered here will start going out as the DMAT team starting from tomorrow.

643
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,040
-By everyone here, you mean me, too?
-Yeah.

644
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,330
We're not going to get rid of DMAT but we're going to increase it? That makes no sense.

645
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:02,870
Where did Doctor Lee go? What about Jung Ddol Mi?

646
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:05,370
They're nowhere to be found.

647
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:11,610
I will quickly get to the point. I have been appointed general leader of Mirae Hospital's DMAT. Beginning with Doctor Yoo here,

648
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:17,560
this is a period where medical staff are slowly returning. So, we are planning to gradually expand DMAT.

649
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:22,610
Combining outside staff and Mirae Hospital staff, we will operate with a total of 2 teams.

650
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:29,570
I'll tell you the rules again. The procedure is more important than the result.

651
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:35,340
Of course, that includes performing procedures outside license parameters. Challenging procedures are also never allowed.

652
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:39,740
Everything that happens to DMAT is under my control.

653
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:43,020
Keep that in mind, and now go back to what you were doing.

654
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:55,680


655
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:16,590
Don't go, Doctor.

656
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:25,180
If you go, that means you're quitting being a doctor.

657
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:32,900
Doctor, if you aren't going to be a doctor, then who will?

658
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:35,980
Someone will.

659
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,080
I went to where Ji Won was lying and asked him.

660
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:47,100
"Do you hate Doctor Lee?"

661
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,420
"Do you hate him because he couldn't save you?"

662
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,480
Ji Won,

663
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:02,030
said he was thankful because

664
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:05,070
you held his hand when he was scared.

665
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:09,470
Ji Won,

666
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:16,660
even though it would be no use to do the surgery because he has a muscle disease,

667
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:20,420
said he was thankful that

668
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:22,740
you didn't just say it.

669
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:27,470
Ji Won,

670
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:41,080
when the heart is cooling down,

671
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:47,740
when he was holding your hand,

672
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:53,940
he said it was warm and said "Thank you."

673
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:59,330
Stop saying lies.

674
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:01,750
Ji Won,

675
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:13,050
said he was so thankful for

676
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:19,280
your words telling him to live and see with his own eyes.

677
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:22,620
So that's why he said he endured up to now, Doctor!

678
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:33,420
So don't go.

679
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:37,890
They're not lies. Ji Won

680
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:41,740
really said that to me.

681
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:45,670
If you leave like this,

682
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:52,120
will Ji Won close his eyes in peace?

683
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:57,570
So don't leave, Doctor. Please...

684
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:04,700
Please.

685
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:10,400
Please, Doctor.

686
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:13,430
Don't go.

687
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,860
Don't go, Doctor.

688
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:28,710
 ♫ Life's one breath♫ 

689
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:37,370
 ♫ Even though that's all that's within me♫ 

690
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:43,280
 ♫ Between the gap of a divided world ♫ 

691
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:50,980
 ♫ More than anything, I will be more magnificent ♫ 

692
01:00:55,940 --> 01:01:05,650


693
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:10,460
 ♫ The whole world will shine again ♫ 

694
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:16,730
 ♫ The day in which I desperately waited for ♫ 

695
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:20,200
 If you're not going to do anything for my daughter, don't worry about that and just leave. 

696
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:25,940
 You said to just rescue them because you would definitely save them. In front of me, you acted all arrogant, nice, you acted like you were a brother! 

697
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:29,980
 Save her!  Do whatever you've to do to save her! 

698
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:33,840
 Someone went to Busan and returned to this battlefield like place because of me. 

699
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:37,450
 If I just crumble like this, what will I become to that woman? 

700
01:01:37,450 --> 01:01:41,950
 I think President Lee's husband is reported missing due to the landslide. 

701
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:44,640
 All inviolable rules can be made when you get permission from me. 

702
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:48,510
  With a desire to save, reckless and unreasonable procedures are forbidden. 

703
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:50,780
 He's in danger. We have to save him no matter what. 

704
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:52,510
 You came out to follow my orders. 

705
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:54,370
  You never even drilled a hole inside someone's head. 

706
01:01:54,370 --> 01:01:56,990
 But he'll die if we just leave him like this. I made a promise with Ji Won. 

707
01:01:56,990 --> 01:02:00,630
 I will definitely save his father who got hurt because of him. 

708
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:07,960
 ♫ Love will make us shine ♫
