1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,740
 The helicopter is coming? 

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,460
 If we cannot move Seok Jung Woo because of the patient you saved, 

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,310
 I will not be able to forgive you. 

4
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,860
 If that friend dies, then you have just committed murder. 

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,070
 Murder? What about you, who put the patient in more danger by doing the surgery? 

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,370
 Aren't you the murderer? 

7
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,780
 At Gimpo Airport, they say a last emergency airplane is leaving. 

8
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,070
 One, two, three! 

9
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:25,110
 Why are you suffering so much after coming to Seoul? You can't eat and you can't sleep. 

10
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:30,900
 If only one of you gives up your seat, then we can save that patient. 

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,390
 You worked hard all this time. Go well. 

12
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,820
 Then, are you telling me to go by my-myself? 

13
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,040
 Seoul is our house, Busan is Ddol Mi's house. 

14
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,910
 I entrust you with the patient until you get to Busan. I'm going. 

15
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:54,510
 Doctor! Doctor Lee Hae Sung! Wait, wait! 

16
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,010
 Ah, Doctor! Wait a minute! 

17
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:06,060
 Doctor! Doctor, wait a minute! 

18
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,920
 Doctor! 

19
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,830
 Doctor! Wai— 

20
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,060
 Episode 10  
 Ah, we are finally free!

21
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,070
Doctor Jung Ddol Mi suffered a lot after being trapped here.

22
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,680
Get off so we can go.

23
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,940
Oh, there's big trouble. Doctor!

24
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,380
Doctor Jung Ddol Mi got on after taking my radio.

25
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,800
Ah, I should have got it back from her.

26
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,290
There's nothing we can do. Aren't you coming, Doctor Lee?

27
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,260
Yeah. I'm going.

28
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,260
Go well... Jung Ddol Mi.

29
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,730
Doctor! Doctor Lee!

30
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,490
 You cannot use the radio. 

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:30,010


32
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:44,360
♫  Do you know, from when it was     ♫

33
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,930
Go well...

34
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,430
♫   That your smile lets a tired me rest      ♫

35
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:53,070
Lee Hae Sung. 
♫   That your smile lets a tired me rest      ♫

36
00:02:53,070 --> 00:03:00,220
♫   Even though I make up my mind, even though I try to hide my closed heart   ♫

37
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:06,820
♫   One day, you'll come be with me     ♫

38
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:14,810
♫    Thank you, you're the only one who will save me     ♫

39
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:21,060
♫   Even if it hurts like the world is collapsing     ♫

40
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:29,390
♫     Thank you, even if the sky makes it hard for us again   ♫

41
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:43,630
♫   You're the only one who will be by my side    ♫

42
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:47,060
♫    Ooh, yeah     ♫

43
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,040
What are you doing?

44
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,610
We ran out of alcohol.

45
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,130
We sent the rest to the operating room to use and we are just trying to get by here.

46
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,850
Even though we can boil steel tools,

47
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:18,280
we need to sanitize the tube and plastic with this.

48
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,710
That's obvious, too. Everything is running out.

49
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,870
I thought everything would be fine if the electricity came back.

50
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,790
Wow, did you already use this much?

51
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,240
This won't be able to endure for long.

52
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,660
What are you talking about? There's the fuel that the people brought. What do you mean this won't be able to endure for long?

53
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:46,570
Is it the same to operate a boat and to run a hospital? It's totally different.

54
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,320
So why did you take the elevator all the way up to the rooftop?

55
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,780
- Even if the Director said to do that, you shouldn't—
 - Ah, that!

56
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,260
Even Department Head Kang said to turn so they can come down from the rooftop.

57
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,510
- Seriously...
 - Section chief,

58
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,020
I am the Emergency Measures Chief here.

59
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,890
Right now, you have to listen to my words, my orders.

60
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,600
It's not just the electricity that's missing in this hospital:

61
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,700
water, oxygen, linen and food.  Ah, there are so many things that are missing.

62
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,380
Just give up and close the hospital.

63
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,690
Supervisor! Excuse me!

64
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,000
Also, I'm sorry but a problem has arisen with the fuel tanker.

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,500
What problem is it now?

66
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,770
We just need to cross the Han River bridge, but it is partially damaged. So, we need to turn back and go.

67
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,350
And with the other nearest bridge,

68
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:36,110
the safety is uncertain, so they had to turn back.

69
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,250
No, is it possible to even cross the river?

70
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,490
Not all of the Han River bridge has been damaged. Perhaps when the National Defense mobilizes their carriers

71
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,080
and immediately dispatch their tanks;

72
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,260
that way, we can still carry out the plan.

73
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,680
Director, I'm requesting of you.

74
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,130
The hospital has to get running first so the citizens can live.

75
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,460
Anyway, lives are our first priority.

76
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,470
Of course.

77
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,740
Congressmen, Madame is looking for you.

78
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,980
Kang Joo Ran's side called—

79
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,940
I'm going.

80
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,880
The congressman is here. Speak now.

81
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,220
 Is the fuel going to come? 

82
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,520
  What about the supplies? What about the medications? 

83
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,340
 Yes. Now all that's left is to cross the Han River. 

84
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:20,220
We are looking for a way to cross the Han River.

85
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,040
 Yes, we're in the process of searching for a bridge. 

86
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:27,190
We're all out of disinfectant, so we're sanitizing them by boiling them in water.

87
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:30,980
According to law, drugs and medications are under pharmaceuticals' control.

88
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:34,070
If the pharmaceuticals doesn't provide us any, the hospital doesn't have any other solution.

89
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:39,570
I know, that's why I've already sent out the necessary government documents.

90
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:44,090
Why are there so many deaths? Why doesn't the hospital have any supplies? Why have the medical staff run away?

91
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:49,200
If you just argue like that to find out whose fault is, it'll be over if you just punish them.

92
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,830
 Team Leader Kang. 

93
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,460
But it's not like that for us.

94
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,780
It won't end there.

95
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,090
If a patient I can save dies

96
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:03,590
in front of my eyes,

97
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,410
I have to live resenting myself.

98
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:10,090
Yes, I'm sorry. Just a bit—

99
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,360
 It feels like hell every day. 

100
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:19,900
Even if I see hallucinations of Dong Ha countless times a day, it can't be anyone else but me...

101
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:25,890
If it's not me, many more patients will die...

102
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,790
That's what I think and I'm barely enduring.

103
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:33,590
If you tell me to take responsibility, I will. If you tell me to go to jail, I will.

104
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:37,380
So please help us, so no more people will die.

105
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,670
I promise you.

106
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:45,730
I will definitely show you. I will protect them, so please endure for just a bit longer.

107
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,050
"I'm sorry. I apologize."

108
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:08,070
"If you just wait a bit, we'll be right there. We'll go

109
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,680
and rescue everyone."

110
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,620
Aish. It's tiring to tell lies now.

111
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,060
We should tell them the truth. Isn't that right?

112
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:25,960
No, we have to give hope to the citizens until the end.

113
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,150
It's to this extent?

114
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,710
The disinfectant will come soon.

115
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:37,880
That "soon" word. We only believed that and dragged the hospital all the way up to here.

116
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,970
We're going to drag it further. We're going to endure more.

117
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,980
Do we have to use the sanitizing technique of the Medieval Times?

118
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,880
If you use tools that haven't been sanitized, it's a 100% chance of infection.

119
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,540
In this scenario where their immune function is rock bottom, if they get an infection, it's death.

120
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,860
Stop it. Does anyone not know that?

121
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,900
Do we just leave the patients like that?

122
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,090
Telling the patients to look for another hospital is also a method.

123
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,830
If we keep enduring, the patients will think the hospital is fine.

124
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,860
Have a meeting with the hospital director.

125
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,170
I can't do surgery like this. No—

126
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:12,060
I won't do it. Let's go.

127
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,780
Did you receive report from the Section Chief?

128
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:22,030
I heard that there isn't enough fuel in the generator.

129
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,670
Then... it's a pity, but we have no other choice than to close the hospital.

130
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,990
We can endure.

131
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,680
I received the promise that support will arrive soon.

132
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,840
Team Leader,

133
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,370
there are times when giving up is the best method.

134
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,260
Right now is one of those times.

135
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:40,420
The best? Are you saying that giving up on the patients is the best right now?

136
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,100
I'm telling you not to be so strong willed.

137
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,560
The fact that you brought us here, can you truly say that there wasn't any competitive spirit or greed?

138
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,780
I can. It's for the patients.

139
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,510
You are saying that exposing them to infection is for the patients?

140
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,130
Look at the reality.

141
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:59,140
We got here by doing as much as we could—no, we did until we couldn't any more.

142
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,640
It's no longer for the patients any more. It's the doctor's personal desire.

143
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,670
Ah, Professor Han, don't lecture Team Leader Kang too much.

144
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,620
Because of Team Leader Kang, we were able to keep Minister Seok alive and transfer him.

145
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,890
Team Leader Kang, we did what we could. The government aid is late.

146
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:21,590
No one can blame you or Mirae Hospital.

147
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:25,520
As Director of Emergency Measures, you have done really well.

148
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,890
As a representative of Mirae Hospital, I will relay my thanks.

149
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:35,600
In the line of not having much loss, we had made good use of the disaster.

150
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,740
Make use you say?

151
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:45,680
Now, let's get started on your last mission as a director of emergency measures.

152
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,940
What? Close down?

153
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,460
I heard what the doctors were saying in the emergency room.

154
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,270
What about that fuel? They said it was coming. Is it not coming?

155
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:58,290
- I don't know.
 - If they close down the hospital, they aren't even going to give it to us.

156
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,960
Disaster struck so we'll have to see.

157
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,280
I knew it would be like this.

158
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,120
They're saying they don't care after taking our fuel. Do they know how we got that fuel?

159
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,080
I knew it from the moment when they ran the elevator and took a patient out.

160
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,150
Hey!

161
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,510
- Ahjussi!
 - It's all because of you.

162
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,510
If you hadn't told us to give it up, we would have left then!

163
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,010
Nothing is confirmed yet.

164
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,600
Just watch what happens if something happens to my mom. Watch what happens if the hospital closes its doors!

165
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,720
- Yes, yes, I'm sorr—
 - I won't leave you alone.

166
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,760
Ayo...

167
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,180
I said I won't leave you alone!

168
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,300
Hey, you drove a sports car well, but is this hard?

169
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,750
Don't talk to me. I don't want to get involved with you any more.

170
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,930
You're saying you have no business with me because Jung Min Cheol is alive and off?

171
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,270
About that... Thank you.

172
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,470
A doctor like me isn't bad.

173
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,100
You also felt it, the feeling of saving someone.

174
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,210
That hemothorax patient before will never be able to forget you.

175
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,410
What is that?

176
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,390
Why is that car standing still?

177
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,740
This is...

178
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,920
Mirae Hosptial's Emergency Measures Chairman Kang Joo Ran.

179
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,450
 Due to an unpredicted earthquake, our hospital is going through difficulty. 

180
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:23,520
 Because of our lacking, we can no longer use the hospital. 

181
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,880
 Starting from today, I have decided to close down the hospital. 

182
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,110
What?

183
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:34,260
 I'm really sorry and I'm sorry again. 

184
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,820
Hey, this is all because of you!

185
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:52,350


186
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,870
Hey!

187
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:36,260
Please stop! What's the matter? Why are you like this?

188
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:39,190
Are you asking because you don't know? They're going to close the hospital!

189
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:44,070
Give us back our fuel. If it wasn't for you, we would have escaped earlier. Understand?

190
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:55,750
  As the government aid has been delayed... 

191
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,360
No way...This isn't it.

192
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,250
I'm sorry...

193
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,670
What are you doing?

194
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:10,060
What are you doing, Team Leader?

195
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,770
The supplies and the fuel truck are here.

196
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,010
What?

197
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,210
As we were coming back, we met with the fallen telephone pole.

198
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:21,870
The intern and I helped to open the roads and we came together.

199
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,280
It's too late.

200
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,280
The Hospital Director isn't trying to close down the hospital because of supplies and fuel.

201
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,650
It's not over until it's over.

202
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,740
This is the Emergency Room Doctor, Lee Hae Sung.

203
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,610
The hospital is not going to close down.

204
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:47,470
- Lee Hae Sung.
-   The oil and supplies sent from the government have arrived. 

205
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:52,290
For those who find walking difficult, it's okay if you remain at the hospital.

206
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:56,520
We will try our best until the very last person.

207
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,720
This is...

208
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:11,410
where doctors are, Mirae Hospital.

209
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,280
You're not going to close down?

210
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,800
With whose permission?

211
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,450
It's a decision I made! This Park Gun!

212
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,550
Weren't you trying to close down the hospital because of the lack of fuel and supplies?

213
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,490
They just recently arrived with me.

214
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,180
It's a one-time thing, you person. It's a one-time thing.

215
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:35,360
We can't even guarantee that we will get more aid. If you start giving fuel for the boat,

216
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,070
then how long can we endure with that?

217
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,920
In the end, it's just going to repeat!

218
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,040
Because of the news that support has arrived, more patients will gather.

219
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,610
Even now, it's an overflowing situation. If you say that through broadcast,

220
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,290
do you not know how that situation is going to turn out?

221
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:53,750
Isn't it a hospital if there are doctors and patients?

222
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,620
It's also a hospital if we can treat them properly.

223
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,510
In the supplied goods, will they have everything that we need?

224
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,960
If the people congregate here, what are you going to do about their meals?

225
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,600
Then are you only going to live for today?

226
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,860
I have to live today so tomorrow exists.

227
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:18,740
You two may think it's only a hospital if we can provide the best care with no danger and burden, but not me.

228
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:23,120
Tell the patients. Then.

229
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:39,330
I thought his judgement was good, but that was just my misunderstanding.

230
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:42,530
What are you planning to do with the hospital?

231
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:45,640
The hospital... Well, I have to think a bit more on it.

232
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,910
But what I should do with Lee Hae Sung...

233
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,910
I know what I should do with him.

234
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,910
Romeo and Juliet, you were really hungry, right?

235
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,010
Eat a lot.

236
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,970
Aren't you guys curious?

237
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:16,870
Whether she went well, whether she arrived safely.

238
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,560
Whether she's eating plenty of food that her parents made her.

239
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:29,040
She probably washed up hundreds of times trying to get rid of that stinky, stinky, smell.

240
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,850
  Belongs to Jung Ddol Mi! I am going to chew it again. 
 P.S - I didn't brush my teeth for 3 days =) 

241
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,820
What is this?...

242
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,600
Ah, I didn't even know that. And to that mouth...

243
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,490
Jung Ddol Mi, come out. Jung Ddol Mi.

244
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,830
Ah, where are those people going?

245
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,760
Ah, you are working hard. I'm Goo Ja Hyuk.

246
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,370
Huh? Who?

247
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,040
He is the Congressman.

248
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,030
Where are the patients going after they leave the hospital?

249
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,910
I sent all the fuel and supplies.

250
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,970
Ah, they're people who'll ride the boat across the Han River and leave Seoul.

251
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:48,140
They revived the hospital after sacrificing the fuel for their boat.

252
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,490
Ah, is that so?

253
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,410
Aigoo, Congressman. What are you doing here?

254
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:55,410
Director, you're working hard.

255
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,590
What is it that you need to tell me?

256
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:02,270
Because I decided to close the hospital,

257
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:06,550
we cannot use the supplies.

258
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:09,090
You should transport those supplies to another hospital.

259
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,430
The supplies are here, but you're closing the hospital?

260
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:14,870
Truthfully, there is a limit to the physical capacity of our medical staff.

261
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:20,210
More importantly, we are not able to 100% trust in the aid of the government.

262
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:25,000
You might not know, but before the supplies arrived,

263
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,310
the hospital has endured many obstacles.

264
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,520
Director,

265
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:37,880
I heard from Team Leader Kang of all the obstacles that this hospital has encountered.

266
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,160
But if you maintain the use of this hospital,

267
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,720
from now on, we will set a priority to send water, medication and supplies to Mirae Hospital.

268
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,110
Since the roads are also being repaired now,

269
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:50,240
this type of thing won't happen again. I promise you.

270
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,710
Ah, that's not the only problem. I'm sorry.

271
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,740
Then, what exactly is the problem?

272
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,770
Should I...tell you this?

273
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:05,290
In terms of our limitations, we cannot guarantee our best treatment.

274
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:08,790
As a result of that, we cannot be free of responsibilities,

275
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,250
and lawsuits will result from that.

276
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,870
We also have our water pipe problem.

277
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:17,450
Precisely that point, I came just after finishing with a meeting with audience and ministers.

278
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,910
The government, with this national earthquake situation,

279
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:24,620
for the hospitals that provided disaster medical treatment not to have any economical deficits,

280
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,200
we will provide special funds.

281
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,870
We will tie that part,

282
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,020
especially Mirae Hospital,

283
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,240
The Minister himself is paying specific attention to you.

284
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,570
You don't have to worry about that.

285
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,860
But it seems that you have misunderstood.

286
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:43,220
I wasn't talking to you in perspective of the hospital's management problems.

287
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,360
Yes, lawsuit issues... We also will create a special law that will block everything.

288
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,340
Special law you say? Can I trust you on this?

289
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,120
Director.

290
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:01,290
If the government made all the doctors who partook in emergency medical care take responsibility,

291
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,830
then our Team Leader Kang Joo Ran will be hurt, too.

292
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:09,270
Even if I have to risk everything, I'll do my best and block it.

293
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,840
I'm sorry. I was really late, wasn't I?

294
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,270
I know that you did your best. Even to send it like this, I'm happy.

295
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:22,650
I'm also trying to look for Dong Ha.

296
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,430
I was busy, so it couldn't personally look for him.

297
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:29,620
But I made request of certain people and am looking for him, so don't worry too much.

298
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,760
It's the Director who wants to close down the hospital.

299
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,790
You must have given him a big offer seeing that he's not saying anything.

300
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,700
Congressman...

301
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:42,900
I have to do what the opponent wants, so I can gain what I want.

302
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,200
Ah, how is it that even after seeing you,

303
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,100
I feel tired instead of having a surge of energy?

304
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,880
Have you slept?

305
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,160
No, I don't know how many hours I've kept my eyes open. My mind is blank.

306
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,790
I'll give you an IV. Receive it and then go.

307
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:59,610
No, there's no time. Ah, yes. I should receive it while riding in the car.

308
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,510
Inside the car?

309
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,440
- Go in.
 - Yeah.

310
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,940
While we are going, if there's a little left, you can take an alcohol pad, apply pressure and take it out.

311
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,040
Mm, yeah. I got it.

312
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,810
- I'm going.
 - Be careful.

313
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,520
Let's go.

314
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,160
He leaves like lighting.

315
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,200
Even in our Congressman's busy times, he came to find his love.

316
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,180
His energy is overflowing. I'm jealous.

317
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,160
I told you to sleep more, so why did you come out?

318
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,900
I think I should quit drinking coffee... I can't get any sleep.

319
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,400
Look at more patients.

320
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,820
That's my fate, right?

321
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,050
I think you drink too much.

322
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:52,410
There's no time to sleep.

323
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:54,770
It seems that we are a little bit late, Director.

324
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,270
Did Congressman Goo leave already?

325
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,760
Yes, he just left.

326
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:05,340
Rather than spending some time with his girlfriend, I guess the Minister was in a rush.

327
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,420
- Director.
 - What, Team Leader Kang?

328
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:14,630
Since you received the supplies, you will keep the hospital open and not close it, right?

329
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:17,010
I think we should.

330
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:21,550
But in order to keep the hospital open, I have a condition.

331
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,470
Condition?

332
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,340
Doctor Lee Hae Sung.

333
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,920
Yes?

334
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,980
Please leave Mirae Hospital.

335
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,960
What?

336
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,120
You're also dismissed from Hangang Mirae Hospital as well. That's my condition.

337
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:47,020
Someone who denies their superior and mistakes themselves as the superior,

338
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,280
I can't let that person on my boat.

339
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,820
You have crossed the line...

340
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,920
by a lot.

341
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:11,270
Do I have to tell you again? You are no longer part of Mirae Hospital or its partner, Hangang Mirae. I told you to leave.

342
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,800
Why? What did I—

343
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,280
Doctor Lee is a more outstanding doctor in this disaster than anyone else!

344
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:23,320
Is it also an outstanding achievement that he barely solved the danger he created himself?

345
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:27,100
Is it not because the patient from Hangang Mirae hospital has left?

346
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,180
You don't need Doctor Lee because there are no patients Doctor Lee can take responsibility for.

347
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:35,300
Of course, that reason applies; although, it is not the only reason. I also know that you have resigned, Nurse Park.

348
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,440
This also isn't a matter in which a nurse should interfere.

349
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,400
Director!

350
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:44,730
Doctor Lee Hae Sung broke his promise and insisted on performing a risky surgery.

351
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:48,120
He'll be more arrogant since the fuel and the supplies have arrived.

352
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,240
Me—hospital's management,

353
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,980
clinic safety—I am the person who thinks about all those things.

354
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,600
Doctor Lee, you are dismissed. Take your mother, too.

355
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,400
Director, there is no hospital near here to take my mother to.

356
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:08,340
If you knew that, then you shouldn't have done that.

357
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,810
We need that room so we can assist more patients.

358
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,980
Director, this isn't it.

359
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:17,400
Chasing out a patient in front of your eyes so you can accept another patient doesn't make sense!

360
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,680
You were the one who kicked patients out so you could get more rooms.

361
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:26,020
We need to send out the patient with no hope. We can't leave her like that.

362
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,210
She is in a coma. She's not brain dead.

363
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,110
You know that there are many patients who woke up after many years.

364
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,910
She is an unstable patient who has arrhythmias.

365
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:38,820
If we send her out, we don't know what will happen to her outside!

366
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:42,410
If you don't like it, then would you also like to write a resignation letter?

367
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:52,020
But in a situation where we lack medical staff...

368
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,360
I...

369
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,220
will quit.

370
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:07,820
But taking my mother with me in this situation is impossible.

371
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:13,360
Until she recovers, if Mirae Hospital could care for my mother...

372
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,860
I beg of you.

373
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,530
That image—

374
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:25,320
That image is familiar. You should have done that earlier.

375
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:31,800
But Mirae Hospital does not trust you any more.

376
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,390
Take your mother and leave.

377
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:43,270


378
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,990
Cancel what you just said.

379
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,790
What are you doing?

380
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,900
I'm threatening you.

381
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,880
If you dismiss Doctor Lee like this and even kick his mother out,

382
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,820
I'm really not going to stay still.

383
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,450
If you can, then do it.

384
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:10,090
How many trials do you think I faced to get to where I am?

385
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:14,590
Even though you can't set it straight, take responsibility until the end. That's your duty!

386
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:19,410
Nurse, I can even abandon my daughter.

387
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:23,770
Ji Na, your method was wrong. You should have begged.

388
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:27,260
That method had a much higher chance of success.

389
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:34,600
Still, I had some apologetic feelings towards you this time.

390
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,200
Stop, it's enough.

391
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,350
The patient isn't leaving.

392
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,940
But according to the Director's orders—

393
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,970
She's the patient under my care.

394
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:56,430
I will take care of her and I will take responsibility.

395
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,430
Thank you, Professor Han.

396
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,540
I don't need your thanks.

397
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:13,750
Live well. Wherever you are, persistently.

398
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:16,140
I entrust you with my mother.

399
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:24,530
You know well that your mother is in a situation where we don't know what will happen, right?

400
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,160
Yes.

401
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,890
I'm really only going to care for her.

402
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:33,350
It's because I don't want the patient who used to be under my care go outside and get hurt.

403
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:40,260
It's obvious that she won't get better and I also can't guarantee that nothing will happen.

404
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,720
Is it okay for you to make such an arbitrary decision?

405
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,730
Instead,

406
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:49,440
don't come close to the hospital. No, don't even step in here.

407
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:56,250
Because then, the Director could personally find another hospital and move your mother.

408
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,490
Then there is nothing you can do.

409
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,580
I believe in you. I'm leaving.

410
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:18,160
You want to say I'm late for coming now, right?

411
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,570
Let's stop hearing your criticisms.

412
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,410
Thank you.

413
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,890
Because of Lee Hae Sung?

414
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,090
Don't say things like that to me.

415
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,930
Your words were right.

416
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:35,200
You are different from the Hospital Director.

417
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,760
It's a relief.

418
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,300
What are you looking at like that?

419
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,970
I feel affection towards the hospital that destroyed my youth.

420
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:59,930
What's so good about this hospital?

421
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,730
They're really cold.

422
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:06,440
They tell me to sue the hospital that used to give me my salary and then they tell me to resign overnight.

423
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:10,540
There are a lot of hospitals and there are few doctors like you.

424
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:14,020
Let's go somewhere together: medical center or health center.

425
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,240
I just got fired. We can do that slowly.

426
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,280
This.

427
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,840
What is it?

428
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,440
Him Chan and Dang Chan's father

429
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,550
said you looked out of it, so he couldn't even say goodbye.

430
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:35,790
 It's all thanks to you. 

431
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:40,600
 On every birthday of Him Chan and Dang Chan, I'll tell them about you. 

432
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,860
 Thank you so much. 

433
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,280
 It's about to explode. Move. 

434
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,650
Honey, let's go.

435
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:35,570
For things like these, I'll bid farewell.

436
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,050
I'm going.

437
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,830
Where are you going?

438
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,170
To Woo Sung.

439
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:45,180
I have to at least tell him to occasionally check up on mom.

440
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,750
How do you know where he is?

441
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:49,840
I called the fire station.

442
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,820
What are you doing?

443
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,170
I'm paying back the deed when you were with me while I turned in my resignation letter.

444
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,500
I'm also not a person from here any more.

445
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,040
I really can't stop you, seriously.

446
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:09,080
Let's go. Wherever we go, it should be better than here.

447
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,140
Hold on tight.

448
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,510
Kang, you didn't get on the boat? It already left.

449
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:33,920
Oh, yeah. I already told everyone the news with these nurses here.

450
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,860
- Why didn't you go?
 - Me?

451
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:39,620
I'm a person who gets uncomfortable in a comfortable environment,

452
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,880
so this hospital is perfect.

453
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,450
And he also has friends who save people's lives.

454
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:46,700
Of course, and we have Leader Choi and...

455
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:50,420
Wait... Why didn't you go?

456
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,190
Na Ri says she wants to help more.

457
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,660
Doctor Lee Hae Sung isn't here,

458
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:59,430
so I'm planning to just help some more people at the hospital.

459
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,540
What do you mean Doctor Lee Hae Sung isn't here any more?

460
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:05,000
You didn't know? Doctor Lee was fired.

461
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,610
The hospital was in chaos earlier.

462
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:07,980
Oh, what will we do?

463
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:12,530
I followed people down to the storage to rearrange the supplies.

464
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,670
Where is he now?

465
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:18,240
He left on a motorcycle with Nurse Park Jin Ha, earlier.

466
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,790
Yeah...ah... He l-left?

467
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,460
Oh, I see.

468
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,810
But... this... this brother, really.

469
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:31,380
Whoa. He really doesn't have any loyalty.

470
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,650
Ja! Wow!

471
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:50,230
Here. Come over here, here. Quickly, over here.

472
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,280
Ah, us?

473
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,850
 Yes. Please come over here. Quickly. 

474
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:57,800
It's chaotic.

475
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:27,390
What are you doing, Doctor Hae Sung?

476
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,720
Aren't you going?

477
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,830
 Ah, quickly! 

478
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:41,470
He was covered under the first floor basement.

479
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,030
Please take a look at him.

480
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:45,260
He was conscious until just recently and had no bleeding,

481
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,270
but he's suddenly like this.

482
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,660
Let me borrow a stethoscope.

483
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,140
- Hey. The stethoscope. The stethoscope.
- Yes.

484
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,090
- Here it is.
 - Yes.

485
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,110
It's not good.

486
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:07,720
- You said he was being crushed under?
 - Yes.

487
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,230
Give me the scissors.

488
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:36,310
If he became like this so suddenly, then  Crush Syndrome? 

489
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,960
I think you're right.

490
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,240
Give me all the fluids that you have. Quickly, as much as possible.

491
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,380
Yes. We'll give you all we have, but we don't have much.

492
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,530
We didn't get the additional supplies.

493
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:48,010
Then is there a first aid kit? What about other medical supplies?

494
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:51,250
They'll come soon, but their situation should also be the same as ours.

495
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:54,560
Do you have calcium gluconate?

496
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,990
We probably don't have it. It's not a medication that firefighters can handle.

497
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:01,860
We, too, know what Crush Syndrome is, but there's nothing we can do.

498
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,750
We can't just leave him under there when he's buried.

499
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:07,270
As the pressure was relieved, all the toxins inside the muscles are being released.

500
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:09,530
Gauze. Give me some gauze.

501
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,570
We can apply pressure here, right? So, that it will become less widespread.

502
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:17,980
You just have to do that.

503
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,080
Um, please move him like this.

504
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,050
To the nea-nearest hospital.

505
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,750
- What?
 - Quickly.
- Quickly, quickly.

506
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,590
 - Yes.
 - Ambulance! 

507
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,420
Yeon Seok, drive carefully!

508
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,970
We can't become patients, okay? Huh?

509
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:36,610
Ah! Since you are here, it seems like we are actually saving people.

510
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:39,440
Even if we rescue people, there should be something we can do.

511
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:45,060
Firefighter, if you find victims underneath collapsed buildings, don't take them out, but let them be.

512
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:49,050
How can we just leave them? Are you going to do something?

513
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:54,170
If the situation is dire, as soon as you get them out, constrict the nearest area that's been crushed.

514
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,620
Make it so the blood doesn't flow.

515
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,270
Ah, yes. I understand.

516
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,950
Thank you.

517
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,580
Nurse Park Ji Na,

518
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,150
you should remain here.

519
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:16,420
I'll go to the hospital and gather some tools and medicine.

520
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,460
Will it work at Mirae Hospital?

521
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,170
I have to try.

522
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,640
Should we go together?

523
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:27,290
I think I know what I should do after coming out of Mirae Hospital.

524
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:58,180
Excuse me, what does it mean that Lee Hae Sung came out of Mirae Hospital?

525
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:01,800
Ah. Doctor Lee was dismissed.

526
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,280
Did he cause an accident?

527
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,090
From the hospital's point of view, he's someone who always causes an accident.

528
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:11,940
He's not allowed to enter the hospital under the condition that Mirae Hospital will take care of your mother.

529
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,590
So he came to tell you to check up on her frequently.

530
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:20,240
Ah, he didn't come out when I told him to quit, but he's coming out after being fired.

531
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,810
You're angry, too.

532
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:25,020
Anyway, it's true that you're his younger brother.

533
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,740
Ah, don't say things like that.

534
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,130
I'm different from Lee Hae Sung.

535
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:40,020
You want me to give that huge amount of supplies to an individual doctor who got fired?

536
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:43,280
Where would I use that? I would use that in saving the patients.

537
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,440
I know! I know that, but that's a decision—

538
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,960
I can't do that.

539
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,360
Don't just say you can't!

540
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,320
Then what do you want me to do?

541
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,560
If we just continue like this, only corpses will make their way into Mirae Hospital.

542
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:00,080
The earthquake seen from the inside and the earthquake seen from the outside is different.

543
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:04,500
Would you be able to say that if you imagine your family being under a collapsed building?

544
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:10,210
If you can't do it, then just help me go to the supplies' storage.

545
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,430
What are you planning to do?

546
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:13,450
I'll just have to steal it and go. Just say you didn't know.

547
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:15,800
Lee Hae Sung, you— That's an illegal act!

548
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,860
Either way, I'm no different than a criminal in Mirae Hospital.

549
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:24,330
But that outside is different. The number of people dead will increase as time drags on.

550
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,450
I'm going now.

551
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:28,630
Just wait a minute.

552
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,960
Ah, I said I don't have time!

553
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,430
Get your head straight!

554
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:36,360
You at least need to follow the standard procedure. Do you want to quit being a doctor?

555
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:40,570
Can't you think that if you just barge in like this right now, you won't be able to guarantee what happens to your mother?

556
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:49,280
I will go get it as quickly as I can. Just wait here.

557
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,310
How long has it been since we've had this relaxation?

558
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:07,340
I was wondering if it was alright because its an antique.

559
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:11,130
It's drinkable. Drink.

560
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:12,390
Yes.

561
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:21,360
Are you upset that I canceled the order of closing down the hospital?

562
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,360
I think that you have a reason behind everything.

563
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:33,880
I also believe that you had a reason behind accepting Lee Hae Sung's mother,

564
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,440
not that you have just disobeyed me.

565
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,570
Without a medical team,

566
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:43,790
the fact that a doctor got kicked out with his comatose mother...

567
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:46,990
If it become known, it's an arrow that will fly back at us.

568
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:52,250
Lee Hae Sung is someone who dragged the patients into our hospital even after being chased out of Hangang Mirae.

569
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:57,950
It's better to keep his mother here with the condition that he never sets foot back into this hospital.

570
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,310
I thought that was a better decision.

571
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,760
Your words aren't wrong.

572
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:07,540
If you are swayed by approval and affected by guilt, you can't do big work.

573
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,380
Yes?

574
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,700
Oh, Team Leader Kang.

575
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,270
Welcome. Sit over here.

576
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:20,400
Would you like some coffee?

577
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,370
I'm fine. You seem happy.

578
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:29,640
Ah, that's right. But I hope what you say right now

579
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,540
won't break this mood.

580
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,090
Disaster Medical Assistance Team.

581
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:39,750
Let's start DMAT.

582
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:46,440
DMAT? Did I just hear correctly?

583
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:50,880
Yes, Disaster Medical Assistance Team (DMAT).

584
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,340
Ah... Why would you create another situation?

585
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,750
Our nation doesn't have a system of DMAT.

586
00:42:56,750 --> 00:43:00,860
It's not even like Japan, where the government funds it. Furthermore, there's no reason for a private facility to get involved.

587
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:07,380
That's why we should do it. Something the government doesn't even do, the nation's first private hospital does.

588
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:13,530
It's hard to find a title as good as this in this situation.

589
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,200
That's true.... Ah, no, no, no. It's too much of a stretch.

590
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,410
The burden is too big.

591
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:24,690
The supplies and medicine are plentiful. We can also receive more.

592
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:28,590
Now that we've already secured the funds and guarantee regarding liability issues,

593
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:32,670
the more emergency patients that we see, the more profitable it will be for the hospital.

594
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:37,270
Team Leader, there aren't even any medical staff that will endure danger to go out there.

595
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,400
Doctor Lee Hae Sung came to find me.

596
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,800
Team Leader Kang!

597
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,750
It seems that there are many people dying from Crush Syndrome.

598
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:49,670
After seeing that, he is asking for medical supplies and cooperation.

599
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:53,840
Look here, Team Leader Kang. Lee Hae Sung was just fired.

600
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:59,540
Is this your way of protecting Lee Hae Sung? Are you saying that we should reinstate him?

601
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,680
No, it's not that.

602
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,470
Then what is this right—

603
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:07,530
By any chance...

604
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:15,730
Making Doctor Lee Hae Sung save patients by providing medication and supplies and we will take credit for it.

605
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:19,320
To speak, yes.

606
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:24,710
Team Leader Kang, what is this?

607
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:29,370
From a sensitive girl, why did you suddenly turn into Zhuge Liang?

608
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:32,680
No. It's still something done with Mirae Hospital's name.

609
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:36,530
If an accident happens, it will be Mirae Hospital's responsibility.

610
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:42,210
But... will Doctor Lee Hae Sung be satisfied with this?

611
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:47,350
He's only saving the patients and all of the accomplishments are being taken by Mirae Hospital.

612
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:51,440
I didn't ask, but he will accept.

613
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:04,830
Crush Syndrome.

614
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:11,780
- Why did you come all the way here?
 - They wouldn't accept patients in the hospital because it closed down.

615
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:15,370
He's a Crush Syndrome patient. Quickly send him inside.

616
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:22,310
- Thank you.
 - Yes, yes.

617
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:27,010
- Is it medicine? 
 - Yes.

618
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:29,490
I added the supplies needed to help with Crush Syndrome first.

619
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:31,070
I think this won't be enough.

620
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:33,990
Even if you get more, you won't be able to carry them on your motorbike.

621
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:36,470
It's not as if there are only crush patients at the scene.

622
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:39,650
I got the medical supplies and the suture kits ready.

623
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:42,490
Then just pack everything into this ambulance and send it to us.

624
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,160
Aren't you going to ask what happened?

625
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,800
Is that important? What we're going to do now is more important.

626
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,810
Kim Hyun Sook!

627
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:51,310
What?

628
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:53,310
What are you doing? Why aren't you preparing?

629
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:57,780
Director, this is too dangerous.

630
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:01,790
If you want to reach the summit, I told you that you can't only take the safe path.

631
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:04,000
You also need to pass through the cliff path.

632
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,440
What happens if those medical staff go there and get hurt?

633
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,440
Among us?

634
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,140
Even if there is or not, they want me to put an intern, so let's just do it.

635
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:19,880
With the minimum cost, I can become a leader who paves the way for disaster treatment.

636
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:24,610
Then, other than the Director of Mirae Hospital, I can dream of bigger dreams.

637
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:27,450
What are you?

638
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:31,630
It's not only the place to earn $50 million,

639
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:37,660
I am thinking of going up a place where I can give $50 million.

640
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:47,280
The saying that goes "chaos brings opportunity," I am thinking about the dream that I thought I had lost.

641
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:55,630
Yes?

642
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:05,770
I just heard. Doctor Lee Hae Sung just went out as a DMAT team member.

643
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:07,660
Rumor travels fast.

644
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:11,420
Did I do well, Doctor Eun So Yool?

645
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:14,380
Of course. Believe that you did.

646
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,620
I just pushed my junior into danger

647
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:21,280
so I could make a deal with the Director.

648
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,330
I'm also thinking of going out.

649
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:26,900
Going out?

650
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:30,940
I feel like shelters would need psychiatrists more than this hospital.

651
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:34,820
It seems like there are many people who hear things and can't sleep.

652
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:38,220
Among the supplies that we received, there are ones that we use,

653
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,840
but a psychiatrist needs to personally be there to administer those meds.

654
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:45,040
Yes. The boat left, so the number of patients shrunk.

655
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,790
That will be a bigger help to the patients.

656
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:49,950
I'll leave now.

657
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,530
Doctor Eun.

658
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:54,250
Yes?

659
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:57,330
I know this is a hard request,

660
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:01,390
but I'll just say it.

661
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:03,790
What is it that you're like this?

662
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:08,850
While you're at the shelter, please look for Dong Ha.

663
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:11,010
What do you mean find Dong Ha?

664
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:14,360
Team Leader, did Dong Ha disappear?

665
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,770
But you're still here, without even expressing it?

666
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:22,370
I had no other choice.

667
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:28,250
Even if something happens to Dong Ha,

668
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:31,950
someone will be helping him,

669
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:35,470
just as I am helping someone.

670
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:38,330
I'm praying with that heart and enduring.

671
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:40,650
I will definitely find him. I'll find him and come back.

672
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:43,370
Dong Ha will definitely be safe.

673
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:47,350
He's safe somewhere, but he isn't coming here because he can't come here.

674
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:51,250
I'll take some pictures of Dong Ha.

675
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:02,800
 

676
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,330
 

677
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,280
Hello. I'm from Mirae Hospital.

678
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:03,580
Oh, hello. We've waited a lot for you.

679
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:06,080
First of all, people with insomnia, auditory hallucination...

680
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:10,620
Well, anyway, anyone who needs psychiatric help, please find them and send them to me.

681
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:12,310
Yes.

682
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:38,650
Oh, ah! What the heck?

683
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:41,540
Doctor Yoo Myung Hyun, what are you doing here?

684
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:45,370
Ah, Doctor. Doctor, you came to the shelter?

685
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:49,070
You should have came earlier. All of the good spots have been taken.

686
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:52,500
Fortunately, my family members were safe.

687
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,310
Where did they go? They were all here.

688
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:58,600
A person who's a doctor can sleep in this situation?

689
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,880
You're so nice.

690
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,020
- Well, people do say that I'm optimistic— 
- That's not what I mean!

691
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,320
Get up and help. I brought medicine with me.

692
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,180
Ah, you didn't come here to utilize the shelter...

693
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:09,430
Doctor Yoo Myung Hyun.

694
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:12,810
I don't want to. Even if I suffer,

695
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:16,350
I won't be able to hear praises. They only say what they think is a pity.

696
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:18,740
Being a doctor is easy here.

697
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:22,630
There are other doctors apart from me who can give painkillers and laxatives.

698
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:25,440
You're rotten, really rotten.

699
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,280
In Mirae Hospital, the supplies support has been opened.

700
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,120
It was opened?

701
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:37,160
Doctor Yoo Myung Hyun, you are playing hooky at this shelter while on an absence without leave.

702
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,760
I'm going to report it like that. I can, right?

703
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,800
I guess you have plenty of places to go even if you don't go to Mirae Hospital.

704
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,240
Ah, Doctor Eun! Why are you like this?

705
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,320
I was wrong.

706
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,160
 Citizens! 

707
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,660
 You're really suffering a lot. 

708
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:57,800
  I am Yeonggwang District's Congressman 

709
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:01,930
 and also special minister, Goo Ja Hyuk. 

710
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:06,090
I've just received news that the government provisions that is being delivered through the subway have met some delay.

711
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:11,890
For now, so you all can quench your thirst, I brought something to drink with my own two hands!

712
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:14,000
Starting now, I'll hand them out. Everyone, have strength!

713
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,980
- Thank you.
 - Thank you.

714
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:29,820
Aigoo, doctors from Mirae Hospital. You came out to volunteer.

715
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:34,200
Yes, that's right. I'm Yoo Myung Hyun. You must remember me. I'm a surgical fellow.

716
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,080
I came out to do volunteer work with Doctor Eun.

717
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,180
- It's an honor to meet you like this.
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

718
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,220
You're really working hard—

719
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,340
Work hard.

720
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:49,240
Is there still plenty of supplies left to use at the hospital after giving some out to the DMAT team?

721
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:53,460
Yes and before we run out, there will be more coming in.

722
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,210
Everything has been recorded?

723
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:57,910
Ah, Team Leader Kang,

724
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:00,910
also sent out the ultrasound equipment.

725
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:03,440
It's the emergency room's treasure but—

726
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,970
It's fine.

727
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:07,010
Whatever you give them, just record it well.

728
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:11,770
Even if they ask for something later, give them a lot of it, as long as it's not scarce at the hospital.

729
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:14,330
Ah, yes. But why so suddenly?

730
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:19,830
The government has already promised full support for rescue efforts.

731
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:22,690
DMAT is the most active way of rescue.

732
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:25,830
You are saying we can collect them all?

733
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:27,840
Take care of it well and store it.

734
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:32,740
Don't write it too truthfully. You can manipulate it to one side for the hospital's benefit.

735
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:35,480
I will try and do well without making it obvious.

736
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:38,640
But can we believe the government?

737
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:43,220
Even though we can't believe the government, that man...

738
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,320
can't we believe him?

739
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,190
You are working hard.

740
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:50,350
You've suffered a lot.

741
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:58,410
Citizens, you've worked hard.

742
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:06,950
The government, the people who are in big pain from the national earthquake,

743
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:12,290
in order to help our citizens, we are working night and day.

744
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:16,410
The pain that all of you have experienced,

745
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:22,750
the pain of losing your home, the pain of losing your family, I understand it well.

746
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:28,070
But in times like these, trust in the country and trust in the government.

747
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:33,210
If you endure it a little longer, Goo Ja Hyuk will promise you that!

748
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:39,510
I will sacrifice this life to help you!

749
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:46,890
Yes, it's almost done. Endure a little longer.

750
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:49,470
Doctor Jung Ddol Mi, hold this here.

751
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:52,290
 Here. Push his hair back, Jung Ddol Mi. 

752
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:57,720
I'm sorry, Nurse Park. Cut.

753
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,040
Ah, it's really a relief.

754
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:09,320
Huh? The entire basement collapsed,

755
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,280
but it's really a relief that there was an empty space in there.

756
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,880
Oh. Brother! Brother!

757
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:22,220
Aigoo, take the stuff, too.

758
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:24,010
Brother.

759
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:26,270
 Did you bring everything? 

760
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:29,130
 Unload the insulin first. 

761
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,630
Oh, you came too?

762
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:34,030
It just happened that way.

763
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:37,690
Wow, you are lucky. Not just anyone can come to this team.

764
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:41,130
I'm telling you this now. I'm here as Mirae Hospital's representative.

765
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:41,870
What?

766
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:45,150
I am not affiliated with Mirae Hospital any more so don't treat me like that.

767
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:50,530
This medicine, and the portable inside; of course, even the minor equipment are all possessions of Mirae Hospital.

768
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:52,600
I came here with an important duty to take care of it—

769
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,640
- I got it, I got it, I got it.
 - Ah, seriously.

770
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,320
- I got it, Representative An. 
 - Ah, don't do this.

771
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,200
Good job.

772
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:03,660
Congressman, about the medicine that you talked about...

773
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,280
As soon as I can obtain it, I will send it to you.

774
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:09,020
You still have medication that you brought from Mirae Hospital, right?

775
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:12,560
Yes. But the shortage is quicker than expected and there is a lack of nurses.

776
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:16,680
And the weather is also very hot. I also request something like refreshing, cold buckwheat noodles.

777
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,620
I'm busy, so I'll get going.

778
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:19,380
Congressman.

779
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:23,710
By any chance, have you heard any news about Dong Ha?

780
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:24,930
Have you heard?

781
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:27,670
Yes. I was asked, as a favor, to search for him.

782
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:31,210
You also visited other shelters, right? Is there anything you've heard?

783
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:34,370
No. I'm also in the process of looking for him.

784
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:39,350
But... why didn't you say anything about Dong Ha here?

785
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:48,180
I'm simply doing my work here. For Dong Ha, I am personally hiring someone to search for him.

786
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:51,820
I also treasure Dong Ha as much as my own child.

787
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:54,280
I will definitely find him.

788
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,820
Did the Team Leader lose Dong Ha?

789
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:14,170
I wonder how she stayed at the hospital with a mind like that.  I couldn't think of that.

790
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:19,910
Yeah. I also wonder how you can search for cold buckwheat noodles with a mind like that. I can't even think of that.

791
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:23,750
No, he has good connections so it was worth talking about. Doctor, I was wrong!

792
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:25,330
Huh?

793
00:57:26,330 --> 00:57:30,250
Look carefully.

794
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:38,400
Hey, avoid it quickly!

795
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,800
 Are you okay? 

796
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,340
 Hey, are you okay? 

797
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,960
You rascal, you.

798
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,170
- I'm fine.
 - You're fine?

799
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:20,970
Be careful, careful. C-Careful, you rascal!

800
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:35,930
Ji Won.

801
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:39,630
Ji Won!

802
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,440
Ji Won!

803
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:53,270


804
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,880
 Here! There are people here! 

805
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,360
 Doctor, get yourself together. Why are you suddenly like this? 

806
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:11,390
 No matter how I look at it, he looks like he is in a traumatic condition. 

807
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:18,930
 Don't let go of your hand, don't let go! 

808
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,410
 I will do it. 

809
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:22,090
 It's not something a nurse can do. 

810
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:23,600
 Then you can do it, you rascal! 

811
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:24,960
 Dae Gil, move your head. 

812
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,200
 What are you doing right now? 

813
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,970
 I...want to live. 

814
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:34,690
 Get yourself together. I'll definitely save you. I promise you. 

815
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:37,950
 I think it's best if you prepare your heart.
