1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,160
 Other support groups from the government are also coming. 

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,410
 Accept using the hospital as a base and receive help from the government. 

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,320
 Government support? Trusting that itself is a gamble! 

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,080
 Still, I want to believe in it. 
 - Believe what?! 

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,550
 Is this the first time the government lied to us? 

6
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,790
 Go rest. What are you, a machine? 

7
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:13,920
 I said that I'm okay. 

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,090
 I'm not okay, I'm not. 

9
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,030
 There was. 

10
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,060
  A boy wearing a green t-shirt at Yeonggwang Mart. 

11
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,660
 Episode 8 
He was in the Yeonggwang Mart parking lot,

12
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,090
is it there? Are you sure?

13
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,270
He was found under a car in the Yeonggwang Mart parking lot.

14
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,600
A green t-shirt, around 7 years old.

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,100
No, it won't be...

16
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,320
There's no way.

17
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,570
It won't be our Dong Ha...

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,600
I know it's hard, but you have to confirm if it is him or not. That's the only way we can move the corpse.

19
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,760
Should I help you?

20
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,750
No, I'll do it.

21
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,220
I have to look.

22
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,980
Are you okay?

23
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,120
Is it your son?

24
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,670
No, it's not...

25
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,050
It's not our Dong Ha.

26
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,650
That's a relief.

27
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,900
I will also look for him.

28
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,780
No, it's fine. I'm going to go look for our Dong Ha myself.

29
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:11,400
Chief.

30
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:18,390
After wandering around looking for hospitals, he died because he didn't get proper treatment.

31
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,170
Although I don't know if I can tell you this, because my own child is safe,

32
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,510
but aren't you the most important person here at Mirae Hospital?

33
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,030
I will look for him again.

34
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:42,550


35
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:48,250
♫  Do you know? I don't know since when  ♫

36
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:55,330
♫  but your smile put my tired self at ease  ♫

37
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:03,100
♫   Even if rain pours down. Even if it turns into a tear drop full of pain  ♫

38
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,930
  I'll go.  

39
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,060
  Do you know how to ride a motorcycle? 

40
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,550
  Is it any different from a bicycle? 

41
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,980
 Pull yourself together! Are you going to kill them again after saving their lives?! 

42
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,300
 Didn't you say to give up on the worst and minimum cases?! 

43
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,640
 Do you think I'm your servant? 

44
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,210
 It will just sting a bit. 

45
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,450
 Hmm. You're enduring it well, little child. 

46
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,700
  Jung Ddol Mi! Are you really leaving? 

47
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,510
  I thought you weren't able to eat anything yet, so I waited to eat together. 

48
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,650
 Oh my, a sweet bean jelly and a canned coffee? 

49
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,700
 He's more fit than I imagined. 

50
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,730
 What are you doing? 

51
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,950
  Hey! 

52
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,440
  Take responsibility. 

53
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,890
♫  Even if the past makes us suffer again,  ♫

54
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:14,000
♫   you're the only one who stays by might side  ♫

55
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,750
Are you okay? 
- Yeah.

56
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,400
I'm tired, but I can't fall asleep.

57
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,070
You still have Jung Min Cheol's surgery. Eat this and sleep.

58
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:43,110
What is it? 
- Doctor Eun So Yool gave it to me so I could give it to patients who can't fall asleep.

59
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:48,070
There are many patients like that. When they close their eyes, it seems like the ground is shaking.

60
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,570
Just 3 hours?

61
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:53,770
Yes.

62
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,830
  One, two, three! 

63
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,410
Professor, there's an emergency patient!

64
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,350
  Welcome. 

65
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,260
 

66
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,500
 Welcome. 

67
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,920
You have an arm fracture. I'll fix it, so that you can go to a refugee camp.

68
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,910
I said I think it's broken! Look at it more carefully.

69
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,520
Where do you keep telling me to go when I'm injured? I won't. I can't.

70
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,870
Give me a patient room!

71
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,670
Patient, your condition is almost as good as normal.

72
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:29,420
Even if it's for others, you have to get your treatment and go.

73
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,120
My arm is important, too. I don't care if others die or not.

74
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,580
If something goes wrong with my arm, are you going to take responsibility? Huh?

75
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,650
Treat me! Ah, seriously.

76
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,200
That's the emergency room. That's only for emergency patients.

77
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,920
Ah! My arm!

78
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,620
I'm sorry. I think your arm is broken.

79
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,660
X-ray! X-ray!

80
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,710
It'll sting.

81
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,610
Hang in there.

82
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,410
Here's your food.

83
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,890
Give it to the other professors, too. There are more patients than we had yesterday.

84
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,490
Is this all?

85
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,580
The patients were only able to get frozen udon.

86
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,900
Ah, seriously.

87
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,730
What is bothering you?

88
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,990
It's torn. I'll disinfect it for you.

89
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,380
Assistant, gauze.
 -Yes.

90
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,600
After I put on a dressing, there shouldn't be a problem.

91
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,130
I heard that you found him.

92
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:36,790
Ah, yes. I apologize for making you come.

93
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,260
Are you okay?

94
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,110
Yes. I believe that Dong Ha will be fine.

95
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:49,270
Yes. He will be fine. Um... I have something I want to tell you before I leave.

96
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,420
What is it?

97
00:09:52,710 --> 00:10:00,080
If we save people and bring them to Mirae Hospital, will you accept them?

98
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,690
I won't resent you. It's just...

99
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:10,710
I don't want to see them die, just because the hospital refuses to accept them after we risked our lives to save them.

100
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:15,650
Patient Jung Min Cheol was barely able to live, thanks to Doctor Lee Hae Sung.

101
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:25,160
I will accept them. And I will do my best.

102
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,530
I understand. Thank you. I will save lots and bring them.

103
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,900
Yes. Please work hard.

104
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,200
Thank you.

105
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,460
Now! Are the preparations done? Let's go quickly!

106
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,730
Leaving!

107
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,460
Let's go, let's go.

108
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,890
You've just made up your mind to go all out, huh?

109
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:11,280
This situation escalated this far. The rich minister even persuaded his fiancé.

110
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,170
Whenever I look at you, I just can't seem to find out what you're thinking.

111
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,440
I'm doing what I can.

112
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,720
If I knew this would happen, I would've shut down the hospital from the beginning.

113
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,010
Then the hospital's image would not have been able to recover.

114
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,490
Beyond that, we're about to lose something even bigger.

115
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:31,000
Wasn't it you who made the ultimate decision after listening to Congressman Goo Ja Hyuk's words?

116
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,080
As the director of disaster measures, I'll take responsibility if something happens.

117
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,620
It's just that I don't think it's solely my responsibility.

118
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,130
What does that mean?

119
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,190
The interview that you did yesterday.

120
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:49,770
The patients and refugees who saw the news are crowding in. There were over 100 just this morning.

121
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,190
Since it turned out this way,

122
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:59,190
we're going to withstand with all the supplies we have until the diesel and support groups come.

123
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,510
  Gun. 

124
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:08,500
Oh, Noona! Noona!

125
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,660
President Lee! 
 - Is something wrong?

126
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,690
I can't find your brother-in-law and Ji Won.

127
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:19,600
I can't find them anywhere!

128
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,150
Noona, get yourself together.

129
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:28,390
They said they were going to the swimming pool. What should I do? If something happens to your brother-in-law and Ji Won, what do we do?

130
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:32,600
What do we do if they died? 
 -What do you mean died? Nobody died.

131
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,260
Hey, did they not go to the hospital? Are they not there?

132
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,820
I'll find out if they came to our hospital so for now, go in.

133
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,670
Oh, what do I do? Our Ji Won...

134
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,660
Noona, just stay for a while.

135
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:57,410
Have you seen the list of the deceased patients at our hospital?

136
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,360
Yes. I wore eyeglasses and looked carefully, but they aren't here.

137
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,260
Then, what about on the list for the injured?

138
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,430
That list isn't ready yet...

139
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:10,640
I'll check the list of anonymous patients just in case and inform you when it's ready.

140
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,170
Okay, let's take care of other things later.

141
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,970
As soon as the list of deceased and injured patients are ready, hand them to me.

142
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,020
Yes, Director.

143
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,740
Ji Won?

144
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,100
Yoo Ji Won?

145
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,380
Ji Won!

146
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,640
Dad...

147
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,150
You're okay, right?

148
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:04,490
Don't give up. They'll come to save us.

149
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,400
Can you hear me? I'm Kang Joo Ran.

150
00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:00,340
Joo Ran, we have a problem.

151
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,230
What is it?

152
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,700
I think it's going to take longer for the fuel to come. It rolled over because the roads are rough.

153
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,140
What? Then what happens?

154
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,550
Another fuel tanker is on it's way.

155
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,340
Are you sure a fuel tanker is coming?!

156
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,270
It will come. Although it will be a bit late, it will definitely come!

157
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,990
If the hospital can not endure until then, it'll be over!

158
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:23,750
All the patients with respirators will die!

159
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,610
I'm going crazy, seriously.

160
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,470
For how long can the hospital endure?

161
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,830
I said I'm going to hold you responsible.

162
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:38,630
I clearly told you that your optimistic views might put the hospital even more into danger.

163
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,960
How much longer can the hospital endure?

164
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,730
Half a day. We only have the generator that works on diesel.

165
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:52,680
Half a day? And if the fuel tanker won't be here on time?

166
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:02,460
Minister Goo, you heard, right? Government support that doesn't happen on time,

167
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:10,030
and firmly believing in the government, will put those thousands of patients in danger.

168
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,560
I will make sure something like this won't  happen again.

169
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,430
Next time? We have to get past this for there to be a next time.

170
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,320
Yes.

171
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,980
What do we do? What do we do?

172
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,440
Do you have a plan?

173
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,090
Minister, call the fire department

174
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:31,480
and make sure to send anyone who is available to Mirae Hospital.

175
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,260
Also, call the government and give us a plan that could save the hospital.

176
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,070
Transferring patients is first, and thermal fuel is second.

177
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,620
Yes. Let's do that.

178
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,490
And Chief, go to the facilities management office.

179
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:49,660
See how much thermal fuel we have left. I'm certain it might be going to waste somewhere.

180
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:56,130
Ah, I'll go talk to the fire department, and I'll leave in my safety car.

181
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,700
I wanted to consult with you about Jung Min Cheol's second surgery.

182
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:30,310
I wasn't planning to eavesdrop.

183
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,170
From where to where did you hear?

184
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,000
It's all my responsibility.

185
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,350
It's not your fault, Sunbae.

186
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:45,130
You should go to the facilities management team. I'll go get a crowd of people and teach them ambu-bagging.

187
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:49,130
When I came here from Hangang Mirae Hospital, we used ambu, secured a supply of ambu,

188
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:53,700
and if we just teach the guardians and slightly wounded people, we can buy some time.

189
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,040
If there's no electricity, then we will have to do it with our strength.

190
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,710
Thanks, Hae Sung.

191
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,080
As you know, all of the machines in the hospital have broken down.

192
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:23,820
Because our staff don't have enough hands, we need your help.

193
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,500
First, follow me.

194
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,470
Everyone here has a family member who uses a respirator.

195
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:42,250
Because some patients don't have guardians, we also brought some volunteers.

196
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:47,500
So Doctor, you have to tell us the exact reason and the purpose of why we came here.

197
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,180
All of these guardians are feeling uneasy since they left the patient's side.

198
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,220
 Yeah, that's right.
 - I can't leave her side. 

199
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,710
In case the hospital's electricity will be cut,

200
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:03,960
the patients who can't breath on their own have no choice but to die.

201
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:14,570
Hey, hey, hey! Be quiet. The professor has not finished speaking.

202
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:22,280
If we had enough staff, we would not do this either. However, because we lack staff,

203
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:27,840
as a last resort, you will have to personally pump the Ambu.  

204
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,700
Seriously, why are you crying?

205
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,760
Our dad is so pitiful. What should I do?

206
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,950
It's our family's lives.

207
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:40,670
If we don't take responsibility in this chaos, who will? Just listen.

208
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:46,410
Uh, after learning it we're going to do it. We're going to save lives. Please begin.

209
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,100
Professor Jung Ddol Mi.

210
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,450
Yes. Guardians, please come to the front.

211
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,960
Yes, yes. Let's go, this way. Come this way. 
 - Please come to the front. 

212
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:01,030
First, connect the ambu in a tube that has an organ intubation. Then,

213
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:06,810
in case the heart is pumping well and only the breathing is not okay, you only have to pump once every  5 seconds.

214
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,550
At the speed of 100 to 120 pumps in a minute.

215
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:15,270
Oh, this is fast. 
 -Yes. The depth should be around 5 to 6 centimeters.

216
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,260
Ah, 5 to 6 centimeters. This much.

217
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,890
One time, every second.

218
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:31,460
You just do it like this. Because you do CPR...

219
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:42,630


220
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,190
Chief!

221
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,100
Chief. 
 -What?

222
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,530
There was a call from the government. The equipment is here.

223
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:06,490
Workers are coming to work on the roads from here to Mirae Hospital, and they said they're giving us equipment to rescue people.

224
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:10,990
Aigoo! Finally, we can work.

225
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,010
But...there's a bit of a problem. 
 -What is it?

226
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:17,560
I heard Minister Goo's call to the fire department HQ and...

227
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,600
What is it?

228
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,440
I'm sorry, but gas... I mean, can I get some diesel?

229
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,590
No, that's not possible. A fuel tanker that was behind us flipped over.
- What?

230
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:43,590
I'm saying I don't know how long this is going to last. I'm just cleaning up the roads first because they told me to.

231
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:47,640
Ah, I'm begging you. In order to move the patients in the hospital,

232
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,210
we need it. There's even an infant.

233
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:57,030
You're not in a good situation, but the roads have to open for the fuel tankers and fire trucks to go.

234
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,530
I'm sorry. Hurry up and move.

235
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,760
As you know, a terrible thing happened in Seoul.

236
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,480
We're going to see the most terrible scenes,

237
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,310
and this is going to be the worst experience that we have gone through so far.

238
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:18,180
We have to save people who are on the verge of death.

239
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,400
Save as many Seoul citizens as possible.

240
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,380
If we don't, then no one will.

241
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:28,320
The fuel tankers can't come, and we don't know when the other vehicles will run out of gas either.

242
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,960
Until then, we have to save at least one more person.

243
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,400
Understood? 
 -Yes!

244
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,070
Why is it like this?

245
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,740
The blood pressure has lowered, too.

246
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,830
An Dae Gil! 
 -Yes?

247
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,940
Is it a hemorrhage?

248
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,740
What are you doing not calling Lee Hae Sung? 
-Yes.

249
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,720
Doctor Lee, I think patient Jung Min Cheol is hemorrhaging. The hemovac...

250
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,080
  Hemovac: a type of drainage 

251
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:08,520
It seems like it's a hemorrhage. The vitals are also unstable.

252
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,500
 Are you going to do the surgery? 

253
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,730
 Doctor. 

254
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,800
I have to. What about the surgery room? 
 -They say there's one.

255
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,990
Let's move him to the surgery room immediately.

256
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:33,480
But if it's half a day, the hospital's electricity could be cut.

257
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:41,460
Half a day is not short. He could survive a half a day more and live to see another new year.

258
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,530
He could get 20 more years to live.

259
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:55,610


260
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:07,090
The organ that we did the damage control on before is fine like the viability.

261
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,290
There's an edema

262
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:12,030
The hemorrhage is not from this area.

263
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,480
Then, where is the hemorrhage...?

264
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,720
Let's remove the gauze and try to find the spot.

265
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,630
Anesthesiologist, please take hold of the vitals. 
 - Yes.

266
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:37,140
It was here. It seems like a mass arterial hemorrhage.

267
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,280
It seems like it's bleeding from the hepatic artery.

268
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,990
We'll try the finger maneuver. Vascular clamp.

269
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:51,300
It's a method where we temporarily clamp the portal triad.

270
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,640
Steroid...

271
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:59,800
An hour extension is possible and it's a surgery with clamping and aortic declamping in an interval.

272
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,090
Because you're doing well, did you study?

273
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:05,450
Because I want to save him.

274
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:09,630
Since we found the site of hemorrhage, let's not mess with it and do well.

275
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,570
Yes.

276
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,660
  Mirae Hospital, this is the fire defense headquarters. Answer. 

277
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:20,280
  Mirae Hospital, this is the fire defense headquarters. Answer. 

278
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,850
This is Mirae hospital.

279
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,170
What's your identity?

280
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:26,940
This is the Emergency Director Kang Joo Ran.

281
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:31,930
Because of the inclement weather, we can't send a helicopter for patient transfer.

282
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,200
What?

283
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,200
Then what about the diesel?

284
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,700
The fuel that the government was able to get is already gone.

285
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:45,010
Then what do you want us to do? What works?

286
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,180
We have a helicopter that has been sent to Yeouido Hospital.

287
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:51,660
As soon as the weather becomes better, we will quickly send that one over.

288
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:09,550
With finger fracture hepatectomy, it seems that the hemorrhage site is being maintained.

289
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:13,000
Although we do have to cut the part that has not been damaged,

290
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,660
this is the best method for locating the hemorrhage site.

291
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,650
Ligation complete.

292
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,880
Metzenbaum.

293
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,100
Stabilize the bed!

294
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,340
What happened? It's another earthquake, right?

295
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:42,180
Yes, it seems like it was the aftershock.

296
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,870
What about the damage?

297
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:47,130
All the EKGs are down.

298
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:50,590
It's a power outage again?

299
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:54,790
Surgery room. Quickly find out about Lee Hae Sung's surgery room.

300
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,840
Yes, Doctor.

301
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,600
Is the patient okay, anesthesiologist?

302
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,850
What about the patient? 
 -I think he's fine.

303
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:22,500
Doctor! Arm! Arm.

304
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:26,840
Circulation.

305
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,280
Doctor, this!

306
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,130
Anesthesiologist, how much blood do we have left?

307
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:42,950
We don't have much left. Most of it is used up so around 2 packs.

308
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:48,010
It's okay. I can save him. I can save him.

309
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:52,610
What do we do? Isn't your left arm hurt?

310
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:18,150
It's impossible to suture the blood vessel with one hand.

311
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,910
The blood pressure is dropping, please rush it.

312
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,730
What do we do, Doctor?

313
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,910
We only have 1 pack of blood left.

314
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,640
What should we do?

315
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,390
-An Dae Gil. 
 -Yes?

316
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,090
Go and get Professor Han.

317
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:32,140
What? Professor Han?

318
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:35,730
I don't think he'll come. He hates these types of surgeries.

319
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:38,000
I'll go.

320
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,360
If I go, I can probably bring him here.

321
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,800
What? He went to do the surgery at a time like this?

322
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,300
Park Ji Na, why did you get involved again?

323
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,720
Make a fuss about that later and help us for now!

324
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,620
Lee Hae Sung just hurt his left arm during the aftershock. I'm requesting you.

325
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,500
Are you like this because of Lee Hae Sung?

326
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,040
The patient is dying!

327
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,600
Director!

328
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,260
Where did he go?

329
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:58,510
Block over there!

330
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,980
What happened?!

331
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,940
Huh?!

332
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,940
What happened? What is this water?

333
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:11,210
Due to the earthquake earlier, the water pipe burst.

334
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,740
What about the generator?

335
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,090
The water leaked.

336
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:19,280
We need to sustain with the one on the 3rd floor basement.

337
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,240
The pipe on the 3rd floor also burst.

338
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,090
What about the generator? 
- Fortunately, it's not near the generator.

339
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:28,350
Since this water is flowing down, the damage is getting worse.

340
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,690
If this continues, the generator might be drowned as well.

341
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,980
Aish...

342
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:38,580
Then...is the hospital's electricity going to be cut off?

343
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,050
Tell me. Is the hospital's electricity going to be cut off?!

344
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:44,200
So, how long can we endure for?

345
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:50,260
In order to run the hospital with one generator in the basement, it will last us about one day.

346
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:55,690
If that gets flooded, too, there's no way for the hospital to have electricity.

347
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:00,970
Since it's getting worse faster than you expected, you might be a bit flustered.

348
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:04,320
It was a matter of time anyway.

349
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:11,130
Fire all of the facilities management members, and report them for not managing the facilities well.

350
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,230
What?

351
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:16,670
Why? Are you going to take the responsibility?

352
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:20,500
Ah, n-no.

353
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,920
Are you going to continue to stay here?

354
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,340
Ah, no. Thank you.

355
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:34,520
 Is this the end? 

356
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:45,120


357
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,610
Aigoo...

358
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:13,320
What are you doing? Are you on vacation? Go back to work.

359
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:19,530
We save them, they die. We save them, they're already dead. How many times has it been already?

360
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:24,850
Hyung, think that they're you're mother and girlfriend. Could you give up like this?

361
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:43,780
Ahjussi, why? Why did you stop this?

362
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,430
There's no fuel. 
 - When is the fuel coming?

363
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:49,270
How would we know that?

364
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,180
Chief!

365
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:59,200
It's from Mirae Hospital, 
 a pipe burst over there.

366
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,230
The basement is flooded with water from the water tank. If it keeps flooding, it's going to affect other areas.

367
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:08,710
If that happens, the electricity will be completely cut off. We have to scoop it out or something. Please come quickly.

368
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:11,430
  Ok, I got you. We will leave right away. 

369
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,100
Oh my god.

370
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:19,140
Ah right, Min Cheol. He's in surgery right now. I'll entrust you with the ICU. 
-Huh?

371
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,150
The surgery room is that way, that way.

372
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:28,600
If the electricity cuts off, what do I need to do first?

373
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,590
Can I just go home?

374
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,270
Hey, Woo Sung!
-Yes?

375
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:35,140
Get an airtight container from the car and put it in the pumper.

376
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:40,140
Okay. Also get the paper ready. Ki Woong, get into the pumper.

377
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,020
Ki Woong, you come follow me.

378
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,780
Everyone else, keep rescuing. 
 -Yes.

379
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,470
I'm sorry. If I knew how to do it...

380
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:09,480
It's not because of you. It's because of the aftershock and it's because of me.

381
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,960
In my greed of wanting to save the patient, I was the one who dragged you here who had no experience.

382
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:20,460
I'll be the one who gets discouraged and feel regret, so you just keep your head up.

383
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:26,520
Will Professor Han come? He disapproved of this since Min Cheol had his first surgery.

384
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,680
Doctor Han Woo Jin!

385
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,700
His hepatic artery has ripped. If you will help us...

386
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,400
Stop it.

387
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,650
The surgery was reckless, but the patient has no luck, too.

388
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:46,540
What do you mean?
 - A water tank just leaked earlier.

389
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:50,380
One of the emergency generators is broken and the other is getting filled with water.

390
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,200
The power is going to cut off soon.

391
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,270
No way.

392
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:56,470
If the generator doesn't get flooded, the hospital can last an hour with the fuel we have.

393
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:59,720
Chief Kang did say she called the rescue team.

394
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,730
When the rescue team comes, we can endure about an hour without the other generator breaking.

395
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:07,740
The surgery equipment and batteries will withhold 30 minutes, so we still have an hour and a half-

396
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:11,670
Wake up! Think logically.

397
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,830
Fine. Let's say you do save him.

398
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:19,110
After the surgery, checking his breathing to managing his vitals all need electricity.

399
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:23,340
There are people who went to get fuel. They will definitely survive and return somehow.

400
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:26,170
And if they don't? The patient will die.

401
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:31,680
And if they come back? I won't be able to save a patient I could have saved.

402
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,880
How are you going to do this reckless surgery in this situation?

403
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,720
The medical community will look down on you. How are you going to deal with that humiliation?

404
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,380
Humiliation?

405
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:48,630
Not doing anything when a patient is right in front of me. That's what humiliates me, Hyung!

406
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,480
Let's do what we can do now.

407
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,120
No matter what happens in 2 hours, let's do what we can do now.

408
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,120
We're doctors.

409
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:10,820
 Ah, this wretched hand! Why can't I do this? 

410
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,430
  Let me see. 

411
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,900
  Like this. 

412
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,290
  Woah. You're really the god of suturing. 

413
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:32,200
 How do you make the stitches so close to each other? When can I do it like you, Hyung? 

414
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,680
  I'll teach you all the surgery rules and techniques. 

415
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,310
  Really? Why? 

416
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:43,220
 Because I'm thankful that you look up to me. Let's go, it's the holiday season. 

417
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,500
  I'll one day definitely surpass you! 

418
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:54,910
It's exactly 1 hour and a half.

419
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,710
Thank you.

420
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:03,850
Instead, I'm only lending you my hands in this surgery room.

421
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:08,590
Since I don't want to hear that you couldn't save him because of me. Suture and tie.

422
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,730
Tie.

423
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,400
Let's begin.

424
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,840
Dr. Ddol Mi, do well with Prof. Han.

425
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,560
First, males, have the front of the hospital cleaned so that the fire truck can park.

426
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:24,000
And the rest, we need to get as much as diesel before the fuel tanker comes for the hospital to endure this.

427
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,410
What do we do? The people who went to get fuel didn't come back yet.

428
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:30,320
If we get as much diesel from the diesel car in the parking garage-

429
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,250
How long can we last with that? That's nonsense.

430
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:36,810
Then what should we do? Should we not do anything and just play?

431
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:40,120
Since the water flooded the mortuary room, evacuating everybody in the lobby,

432
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,880
Should we just make a shrine for the dead?!

433
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,210
Professor... T-that's not it, it's just you're saying something impossible-

434
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:48,930
It's impossible because you're not doing anything!

435
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:53,970
If you don't want to do it, then don't. I won't ever give up. I'll do everything I can!

436
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:03,490
What was bound to come has finally come.

437
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:04,950
Will we be fine?

438
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:08,670
Of course, we won't be. Let's go for now. We have to help with something.

439
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,740
Let's survey the situation a little more and-

440
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:16,730
I heard the electricity is going to be cut soon. If that's the case, then we shouldn't be like this.

441
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:20,710
My husband won't be able to live without electricity!

442
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:24,100
 What are we going to do?
- I don't know! 

443
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:29,270
What will happen to us? What will happen to us? 
 -You need to have a plan!

444
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,150
Stop it!

445
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:44,620
I know your uneasy heart very well.

446
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:51,160
There was a massive earthquake in Seoul. You all know very well that harassing the medical team won't achieve anything!

447
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:57,060
I know! My husband is about to die...

448
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:02,400
We need to do something. What do we do?

449
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,410
Using the power right now is impossible.

450
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:12,580
I asked a request to the fire department for help, but I got a reply saying it might take a while.

451
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:17,490
In order to buy some time, some of our medics went out to get diesel.

452
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:24,870
Guardians of critical patients, you all learned ambu, right?

453
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:30,450
In the case that something happens, I hope you will prepare yourselves.

454
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:38,490
What to do...what do I do? What do I do...what do I do?

455
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,760
This car has gasoline, we need to get diesel.

456
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,170
Diesel?

457
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:29,760
Fuel... Fuel... Fuel... here...

458
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,810
Are you okay?
Fuel... it hurts.  Fuel... it hurts.

459
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:46,490
More water is leaking.

460
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:48,050
What about the generator?

461
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:52,600
What are you doing? The fire truck is going to come.

462
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,050
This is the Director's orders.

463
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:56,840
I'm the manager of the hospital right now. Get rid of this.

464
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,370
You're just a temporary director.

465
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:02,840
The Director is the one holding our paychecks. The electricity is going to be cut off anyway-

466
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,110
Not yet! The electricity still works and fuel will come now!

467
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:10,810
So when is that coming? Don't do this, please.

468
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:28,360
What are you doing? Remove these quickly.

469
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,940
Uh-uh, ev-everyone put them back where these were.

470
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:36,060
Remove these quickly. Remove these. Move out the way, it's dangerous. Remove them!

471
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,810
Hello, hello. Where is it?

472
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:43,060
The pipes all leaked on the second and third basement levels, so the flooding on the second level went to the third level.

473
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,910
The electricity production room is only a few levels lower, so it will start flooding in that room.

474
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:49,850
Okay, I understand. Hey, she said it's on the third basement level. Get the  pumper.

475
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:50,900
Yes.

476
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,680
Ki Woong, you go inside and get everything set up. Woo Sung!

477
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,390
Yes.
- You go help him.

478
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:58,070
I got it. 
-This way, the basement is this way.

479
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,660
He says it's that way. 
-Yes.

480
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,800
No matter how hard we try to take the water out, if we don't  get it all out, all of our hard work will go waste.

481
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,190
Yes.

482
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:25,000
 Woah, they're really fast. None of the stitches are opening up. 

483
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,730
 Something like this is really possible. 

484
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:31,390
 Since there are two experts doing it, the impossible surgery 

485
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:33,340
 is possible. 

486
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,210
Do you not feel well somewhere?

487
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:49,390
Are you ok?

488
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:51,060
It's because of the sweat.
-Take care of that!

489
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,860
Yes.

490
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,900
Let's rush it.

491
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:03,580
Thanks to you, I think the surgery will end on time.

492
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:07,820
Even if we were not in this situation, this would be an exciting surgery.

493
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,020
Do you find surgery fun?

494
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:15,480
I'm saving a patient. It makes my heart hot.

495
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:23,020
The feeling that I'm the one gifting the person I'm saving their happiness and memories.

496
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,540
Are you okay?

497
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,460
I'm not sure.

498
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:32,520
To me, I always had to be cautious with patients.

499
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,680
Woo Sung! Woo Sung, over there.

500
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,180
Yes.

501
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,560
Did you connect these?

502
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,740
Yes, don't look at it!

503
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:27,280
We lowered the pipe. Turn the dial.

504
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,360
Be careful, okay?

505
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:41,240
The leaking area is too big, we might not be able to do it with just this.

506
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,760
Well, we can only bet on this.

507
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,840
There's a lot of water, do you think this will be possible?

508
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:50,380
Yes, this is possible. We have everything we need. Woo Sung!

509
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,900
Yes.

510
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,240
Woo Sung, be careful, okay?

511
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,900
Yes!

512
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,500
Captain Yoon, is it working?

513
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:14,920
Oh, it's sucking it in so refreshingly. How much has it filled up?

514
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,820
It's going to take a while. Work hard.

515
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:20,680
Ki Woong, give me a towel!

516
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,580
Team Leader! We brought the fuel.

517
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:26,900
Here.

518
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,520
Is that all?

519
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:33,060
Because everything closed their car doors, it's not easy to open them and get diesel.

520
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:36,040
Leave the empty buckets here so we can get water.

521
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:39,500
Pour the diesel in after we are done taking care of the third basement level.

522
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:43,320
Whose fault is all of this that you're telling me to do this and that?

523
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,900
Excuse me?

524
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:49,960
What did you just say?
 - It's because we shared the diesel with you fire fighters.

525
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:55,180
That's why we medics are going through this trouble. Do you think I went to med school to do this, huh?

526
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:59,840
Yes, I got it. I got it so please just do what I told you to do.

527
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,940
I don't want to. You can go and pour it yourself.

528
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:09,980
Hey, you old man. Hey! Hey, you rascal.

529
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:13,160
Do you think I worked as a firefighter for 20 years to hear informal talk from a new doctor? Huh?

530
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:16,680
What do you mean "new doctor"? You old man, I've also aged enough-

531
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,300
Stop it, Doctor Yoo.

532
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,740
Ah, it's because I've been holding it in all this time. Am I little child?

533
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:23,560
Hey, do you want to die?

534
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,300
W-what? 
-Hey.

535
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:30,900
But aren't they planning to take out the water in the hospital with the buckets we brought? I think that's what they're planning to do.

536
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,300
Ah, that's true but-

537
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:35,500
Stop whining and go pour it quickly.

538
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,400
I understand. I'll go

539
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:46,820
and pour the fuel away cleanly. Then I'll present the empty bucket in front of the firefighters.

540
00:47:55,060 --> 00:48:01,000
 Hey, why are you like this? Hold onto it tightly. 

541
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,460
I heard the fire fighters are taking the water out for us.

542
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:07,260
Yes. Team Leader Kang made such a big fuss that I couldn't block the entry.

543
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:11,120
And both the medical team and patients

544
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,200
are gathering fuel from the cars parked in the garage to use it.

545
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,080
Ah, seriously.

546
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:19,340
This is the deceased patients list.

547
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,860
Is this all?

548
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:24,260
Yes. All of the people who have died in the hospital are all in here.

549
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:34,100
Um...the firefighter truck is here.

550
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,420
They won't be able to do much.

551
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,820
I see you want the hospital doors to be closed.

552
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:43,600
Noona, the hospital will become in danger if we worry unnecessarily.

553
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:48,680
Still, what are you going to do if your brother-in-law and Ji Won come injured?

554
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:53,200
There's a hospital for the nation, so we can just send them there.

555
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:58,620
You're saying to send them to get treatment among people they don't know instead of your own hospital?

556
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:03,020
Even if I am sitting on the position of the Vice-President, this hospital is your brother-in-law's

557
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,640
and it was set up for Ji Won.

558
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:10,140
This won't do. I'll meet with the firefighter team

559
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:13,040
and request them to search the swimming pool.

560
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,700
Noona, just stay here.

561
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:21,740
I already told them but I'll tell them once again. Don't worry.

562
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:30,940
I wish the other fire fighters would come and get water. A lot water isn't getting filled.

563
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:33,080
What will happen to our hospital's electricity?

564
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,400
The other generator is working still, so don't worry too much. I think we get all the water out, too.

565
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,700
Yes, thank you.

566
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,840
Ah yea.  Don't worry.

567
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,020
Hey, hold on.

568
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:45,060
 Hold it still! 

569
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:36,780
If we shut down the hospital in the first place, the patients would have been able to be transferred to other hospitals

570
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:40,200
and would not have loss their precious lives.

571
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:43,460
They did not lose their lives yet.

572
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:47,020
Why? Of course, it should be "yet".

573
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:53,400
But don't forget that all of this is your responsibility, since you are the one in charge.

574
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:57,200
Are you saying we lost the patients because of me?

575
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:03,660
You being greedy to be a hero made the patients stay at the hospital and killed them. That's a fact.

576
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:08,420
Please think of this as a patient transfer process and corpse clean up.

577
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:14,460
This might be your day of work, Chief Kang.

578
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:17,280
Let me ask a favor.

579
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:34,000
Gun is working that hard.

580
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,540
They will definitely return alive.

581
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,300
D..ad...

582
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,210
Dad...

583
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:18,670
Yes, Ji Won?

584
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:23,000
The rescuers, they will be here soon.

585
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,840
You're okay, right? Don't give up.

586
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:30,090
I'm thirsty, Dad.

587
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:32,090
Just wait a little.

588
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,460
This...

589
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:51,960
Hold that, squeeze it, and drink.

590
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,210
Dad...

591
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:58,300
Even if it's dirty, you have to drink in order to live.

592
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:02,630
Living comes first. You have to endure it.

593
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:07,670
Dad...will definitely bring you out.

594
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:12,090
Dad...I keep getting sleepy.

595
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:14,340
You can't sleep.

596
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:19,590
Wake up. We have to get out. We can get out.

597
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:25,800
Ji Won, please. Squeeze that and quench your thirst.

598
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:37,920
Yes, you're doing well, my son. You're doing really well.

599
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:48,090
Oh, I'm sorry!

600
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:51,920
Hey! Did something happen?

601
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,960
The patient in the ICU is conscious now, so I was going to go check.

602
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:00,550
Why would he regain consciousness? Did you give him the medication?

603
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:02,750
Uh, Professor Han...

604
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:03,670
Professor Han?

605
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:08,800
Yes, but he went into surgery. There was no order to wake him up or not... so to go verify it.

606
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,210
What kind of surgery?

607
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:13,920
I heard it's patient Jung Min Cheol's surgery.

608
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,630
Ah, this friend really. He doesn't understand words.

609
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,170
You...

610
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:23,670
Do Gun Hyuk, you are a doctor, right?

611
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:25,920
Yes, Director.  I'm Do Gun Hyuk.

612
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,300
I'll ask a favor from you.

613
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:00,510
Minister, are you feeling better?

614
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:01,840
This place...

615
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,670
You remember the accident, right?

616
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:07,210
Yes...accident.

617
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:14,550
It might be sudden but there is something you must know since the situation is quite urgent.

618
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:18,630
An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.5 has occurred in Seoul.

619
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:19,420
What did you say?

620
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:22,820
It's a huge earthquake, enough for the city to be paralyzed.

621
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:30,800
Truthfully, our Mirae Hospital, as well, should be closed down, but since you are also here...

622
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:34,050
Earthquake in Seoul?

623
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:39,210
We did our best but your injury was severe that

624
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:42,150
we had to take out one of your kidneys.

625
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Okay...

626
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:51,920
But...by any chance, with me...

627
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,970
You have to speak loudly.

628
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:58,000
The lady I was with...

629
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,450
Ah, Kim Yu Na?

630
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:05,460


631
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,210
Dr. Do, I'll do it.

632
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:13,340
Go out. You worked hard.

633
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:17,050
Teacher. Teacher.

634
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:23,500
I know the relationship between you two.

635
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:28,960
For that reason, we did your surgery at Hanggang Mirae Hospital and not here

636
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,260
secretly.

637
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:33,250
Hangang Mirae?

638
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:37,550
The hospital is not in good condition, but

639
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:44,130
if we proceeded with both of you here, it would have been easy for your relationship to be revealed to the world.

640
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:47,380
At the scene of the accident, there were reporters.

641
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,460
I'll get straight to the point.

642
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:57,050
Mirae Hospital is shutting down soon. The electricity is going to be cut off.

643
00:56:57,050 --> 00:57:01,130
We'll transfer you safely as soon as we can.

644
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:08,710
But you have to match words with us so we can get past this danger.

645
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:15,250
At the time of the earthquake, you got hurt because you got crushed under the rubble of a building.

646
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,250
Of course, you were alone, right?

647
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:24,630
Yes. When the earthquake happened, I was alone.

648
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:32,000
Yes, while you were alone... Also, you have never been in  Mirae Hospital.

649
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:37,130
Even in our medical records, you're listed as an anonymous  so the minister of the government won't know.

650
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:41,420
If you disguise yourself... I'm sorry. Nobody will know.

651
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:46,260
After the earthquake, there are strong gusts of wind in Seoul.

652
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:52,750
 Currently, the meteorological administration is checking to see if the typhoon in Japan will hit us. 

653
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:58,880
 We're in a situation where rescuing people is not easy. 

654
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:05,300
Why do events like these keep happening?

655
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:08,380
 Next news. Because of the earthquake... 

656
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:11,500
What is it? Where are you going?

657
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:17,000
Uh, I don't think I have a reason to stay at the hospital any longer.

658
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,420
What?

659
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,880
What are you saying...

660
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:24,340
What can I do at a hospital whose electricity is cut?

661
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:28,550
Because water is also not coming out, I also hate a hospital whose smell makes my head hurt.

662
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:33,750
I heard the weather was no joke either. I'm really worried about home. I'll just go.

663
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:39,380
You're just going? A doctor is just going when there are plenty of patients laying around here?

664
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:45,250
Ah, patients are patients. I don't even know if my family members became patients, too.

665
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:49,550
I heard that the hospital is shutting down soon, too. There's no reason for me to stay.

666
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:53,130
I'll come back when the hospital is restored to its original state.

667
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:57,870
Yoo Myung Hyun. Hey, Yoo Myung Hyun!

668
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:02,800
What? The helicopter can't fly?

669
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:08,210
The gusts of wind are too strong that it's hard for the helicopter to fly.

670
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:14,960
Director, Minister, Mirae Hospital called, and they're looking for you.

671
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,260
What?

672
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:22,300
You can speak.

673
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,420
It's the Minister in charge speaking.

674
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:26,880
This is Mirae Hospital's Emergency Director Kang Joo Ran.

675
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,090
Oh, Joo Ran.

676
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:31,210
Please speak.

677
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:35,340
The patients are in danger. The hospital can not endure with just one generator.

678
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:38,920
  When will the diesel arrive? What about the helicopter? 

679
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:42,300
The oil will arrive as soon as the roads are cleared.

680
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:44,170
  Then what about the helicopter? 

681
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,630
The helicopter...

682
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,710
It's almost the end. Let's just endure a little bit more.

683
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:57,210
We did this highly-difficult surgery with an orthopedics resident and interns?

684
00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:59,710
You're either reckless or stupid.

685
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,880
The orthopedics resident wants to hide right now.

686
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:06,170
The one intern wants to hide, too.

687
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:08,130
Why? You guys did great.

688
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:10,420
What do you mean doing well.

689
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:16,510
Don't let your reckless methods influence them when they still have a bright future ahead.

690
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:19,170
I won't take that seriously.

691
01:00:19,170 --> 01:00:20,800
Let's finish this up.

692
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:50,710
The electricity has gone out.

693
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:52,960
The internal batteries will last for 30 minutes.

694
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,460
Monitor. The monitor isn't working.

695
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:58,300
I think it was working because of the internal battery.

696
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:00,420
Hurry. Let's finish this quickly.

697
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:03,670
We can't even know the vitals or the heartbeat. You want to do surgery like this?

698
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:06,140
Even when this machine wasn't around, doctors were doctors.

699
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:09,590
There were doctors who saved people back then, too. Why can't we do the same?

700
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:12,210
That was a time where they did it even if the patient died.

701
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:15,250
It's 30 minutes. 
 -They didn't even expect that they would save everyone, they didn't believe it or anticipate it like we are doing now.

702
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:19,130
Exactly 30 minutes! Doing the best we can.

703
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:25,700
Even if you declare him dead after you leave this room,  it's not too late.

704
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:30,710


705
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:54,420
  If we shut down the hospital, just like the Director said... 

706
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:56,340
 Fuel! We have fuel! 

707
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:58,750
 Please put the fuel into the emergency generator. 

708
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:01,210
  Don't think of anything useless. You have to steel your heart so you can live. 

709
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:07,710
 The helicopter is coming. If we can't transfer Minister Seok because of the patient you saved, I won't forgive you.  

710
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:11,380
  If that friend dies, then you have just committed murder. 

711
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:15,750
 Murder? Since you're the one who put him in more danger with your reckless behavior,  

712
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:18,090
 aren't you the murderer?
