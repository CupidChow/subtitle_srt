1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:05,120
 They say it's an earthquake...in Seoul. 

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,600
 Dong Ha, hold on tight! 

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,440
 Dong Ha! 

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,920
  You are alive, right? 

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,140
 You have to be alive. 

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,260
 A person is in there! 

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,370
 You think you're the only ones with family members? If we don't do it, who will? 

8
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,620
 You need to make it so we can do it.  

9
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,350
 There is nothing we can do. 

10
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,680
 Move him to another hospital. 

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,230
 If the hospital is like this, what kind of hope are we supposed to have and rescue the people? 

12
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,760
 Just stick to rescuing! We'll decide whether we let him live or die. 

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,490
 Jung Ddol Mi, let's do the surgery. 

14
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,030
  I told you there's no blood and no time. 

15
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,470
 If there is even a 1% chance of saving them, 

16
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:46,960
 I'm going to do everything. 

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,790
 Will the fuel arrive?  What about the medical  supplies and the needed things? 

18
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,580
  Other support groups from the government are also coming. 

19
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,870
  Accept using this hospital as a base and receive help from the government. 

20
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,820
 -  Governmental aid? Trusting that itself, is a gamble. 
 - But I still want to trust them! 

21
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,030
  What are you trusting in? Is it the first time that we've been tricked by the government? 

22
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,690
 I think the fuel vehicle will be late. 

23
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,590
 How long can we endure? 

24
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,920
 Half a day. 

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,610
  To the side where the hospital doesn't have much loss, 

26
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,760
  you were able to make great use of the disaster. Close down the hospital. 

27
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,380
 The fuel and supplies sent from the government arrived. 

28
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,650
 We aren't closing down the hospital. 

29
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,500
 Lee Hae Sung. 

30
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,610
 This is where doctors are, Mirae Hospital. 

31
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,000
 You have crossed the lineâ€”by a lot. 

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,310
 Doctor Lee, you're fired. 

33
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:31,810
  The earthquake seen from the outside and the earthquake seen from the inside are different. The death count will rise the more time we drag. 

34
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,160
  Disaster Medical Assistance Team (DMAT). 

35
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,050
 Let's start DMAT. 

36
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,900
  Let me borrow a stethoscope. 

37
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,580
 Episode 11 
 - Look carefully, carefully.

38
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,240
Are you okay?

39
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,740
- I'm okay. I'm okay. 
- What's over here?

40
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,380
Ji Won. Ji Won.

41
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,670
Ji Won.

42
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,350
You can't give up.

43
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,910
Pull yourself together.

44
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,700
 Look carefully, carefully. 

45
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,260
Save me!

46
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,790
 - We don't know if there are people, so don't just.... 
- Here!

47
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,150
There's a person here!

48
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,480
 Colleagues, there's no one else here. 

49
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,960
 Our team will come back. 

50
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,570
No. No. Here...

51
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:27,380
Here... Here!

52
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,530
- Are you certain?
 - Yes. We checked everything.

53
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,370
We searched through every nook and cranny, but the building is a bit dangerous.

54
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,780
 Hey, Park Yi Seung, are you okay? 

55
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,740
- Yes, I just got scratched a bit.
 - There's no more patients, right?

56
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,940
- No, there aren't.
 - We want to pack up and go somewhere else.

57
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,310
- It would be really good if you could come with us, Doctor Lee.
 - Sure, I'll come.

58
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,660
But the tent...

59
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,410
- Ah, yes. We'll help. Woo Sung. Woo Sung!
 -  Yes? 

60
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:55,180
 - Help them with cleaning up the tent.  
- Yes.

61
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,870
 Hurry, hurry. 

62
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,570
 I'll go along. Cha Geun, let's get things going. 

63
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,140
 Okay, I got it. 

64
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,990
- You're really working hard.
 - Ah, it's nothing.

65
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,500
- You really don't know how durable I feel because you're here, Doctor Lee. 
- It's nothing.

66
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,280
Even though Woo Sung may give you a cold stare, please stay here.

67
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,990
- Yes. 
- Thank you.

68
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,480
- You received the address of where the next location is, right?
 - Yes.

69
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,740
It's near a shopping mall and they say we should go to the parking area.

70
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,510
Okay. Quickly load up the supplies and then let's move out.

71
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,320
- Have a break while we're moving. Clear out! 
- Clear out.

72
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,290
- Sir.
 - What?

73
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,700
- It doesn't seem like we can't clear out yet. 
 - Why?

74
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,830
- Did something happen? 
- Near the substation, there's a fire, so they are trying to extinguish it.

75
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,930
They need more water.

76
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,400
 Pull the water pipe more, the water pipe. 

77
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,370
 Hyung, don't go over there. I saw a hole. 

78
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,440
 Yeah, I saw it. Over there. 

79
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:08,320


80
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,300
Here!

81
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,900
There's a person here!

82
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,080
Ji Won, people came. We're saved.

83
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,910
Ji Won! Yoo Ji Won.

84
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,520
Answer me. You can't sleep, Ji Won.

85
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,700
Yoo Ji Won.

86
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,100
Here!

87
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,450
- Did you hear that?
 - I heard it. There's a person down there.

88
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,210
Are you alive?

89
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,120
Here! Here!

90
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,930
Here! There's a person here!

91
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,990
Over here! There's someone here!

92
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,810
There's someone here!

93
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,210
An Dae Gil, you go up first and receive.

94
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,910
Doctor, you can't keep telling me to do this and that.

95
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,860
- My arms are going to fall off.
 - Hurry up and go up.

96
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,500
- What is it? 
- I'm going.

97
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,980
- I think you'll have to come for a minute.
 - What is it?

98
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,320
They found a buried person and he's alive.

99
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,180
Hey, grab your bag!

100
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,620
Careful, careful. Slowly. These rocks...

101
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,740
Ah, there would have been big trouble if we had just cleared out before.

102
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,560
The elder is under something and we can't confirm anything about the child. I think he's unconscious.

103
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,700
I think we'll have to go down to know. What will you do? Will you be okay?

104
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,180
 Here! Here! 

105
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,690
Save my child!

106
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,460
Save him! Here!

107
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,260
Here, here, save me.

108
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:51,500
 Save us! Save us! 

109
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,430
Why are you like that?

110
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,050
It's nothing. I'm fine.

111
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,040
You can't take the victim out like this.  I'll go down there.

112
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,670
 Geeze. 

113
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,180
Receive it well.

114
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,900
Just wait a bit.

115
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,020
Please save my child.

116
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,960
He has a muscle disease.

117
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,430
Huh? Muscle disease?

118
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,690
Another doctor is looking at him now.

119
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,890
Just wait a minute.

120
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,830
Doctor, here's the first-aid kit.

121
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,580
Why are you like that?

122
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,750
I'm fine. Check this child's vitals.

123
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,340
Yes.

124
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,350
How is it? Are they okay?

125
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:27,920
The vitals aren't good. Blood pressure is 90/60 and his pulse is over 100.

126
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,860
- His dad said he had a muscle disease.
 - Yes. Since he was under for so long,

127
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,170
he'll have Crush Syndrome.

128
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:39,070
Give him 1 liter of normal saline and add 1 liter per hour.

129
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,100
Yes.

130
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:46,540
Why are you like that? Are you not feeling good somewhere?

131
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,900
No.

132
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,820
I'm fine. What about the vitals on him?

133
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:56,460
It's okay, but he has symptoms of dehydration. It doesn't seem like the pressure was too great.

134
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,080
- Okay, I'll look at him.
 - Doctor,

135
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,730
shouldn't you rest a bit?

136
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,690
I have to endure it.

137
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,360
Um...

138
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,200
You're... from Mirae Hospital...

139
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,490
Huh? Do you know me?

140
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:27,190
I... It's me. Because of my diabetes last time...

141
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:31,310
 Yes, please endure it for a bit. You'll be okay soon. 

142
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:35,370
 Thank you, young Doctor. 

143
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:38,110
A-ah, yes. I remember, yes.

144
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:43,130
I beg of you... Save my child first.

145
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:47,780
I'm sorry, but we can't take him out this minute.

146
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,750
Why?

147
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,010
It'll be hard because of Crush Syndrome.

148
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,850
If we quickly release him, the toxins in the pressured area

149
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,110
will spread throughout the body all at once.

150
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:03,350
Unless he completes all his fluids, please wait a bit more.

151
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:07,650
The child is first.

152
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:14,150
Hey, I'll go out.  I'll entrust you to monitor the two victims.

153
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:17,860
Where are you going? Save my child.

154
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,510
Should we go down to rescue them right now?

155
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:30,890
Not yet. The man is okay,

156
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:34,980
but the child has Crush Syndrome and he's usually a patient.

157
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,290
- Just a minute.
 - Yes, yes. Be careful.

158
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,700
- Doctor Lee, where are you going?
 - Oh!

159
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,720
Be careful!

160
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,770
We don't have...  Benzodiazepine... Lorazepam...

161
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,300
We don't have any and earlier the hospital didn't seem to have any either.

162
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,700
Why do you need a sedative?

163
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,880
I don't know either!

164
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,200
Brother is being weird. I've never seen him like that.

165
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,690
In any case, it seems like it's post traumatic stress disorder.

166
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:03,900


167
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,630
 What are you doing just sitting here? 

168
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:37,740
A patient is dying inside there, so what are you doing sitting out here?

169
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:43,130
Get your head straight, your head! Are you going to come out all the way to the scene and kill a patient?

170
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,840
I asked what you're doing sitting here like a retard!

171
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,940
Yes.

172
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,960
The patient has gained consciousness.

173
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,280
I'll go in.

174
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,040
Let's just endure for a bit. You'll be fine soon.

175
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,690
- Oh, you're that doctor.
- Hm?

176
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,470
The fortune teller doctor.

177
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:27,360
 Hey, kiddo. You don't look like the age where you would lose your path. 

178
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,880
 I'm not lost, I'm just looking for something. 

179
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,510
 What are you looking for? 

180
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:36,090
  Where do I have to go for an organ donation? 

181
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,210
 What? 

182
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,770
 I have a muscle disease so I won't be able to live long. 

183
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:45,960
 So they say that later, only my eyes will move. 

184
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:51,130
 So when I die, I want to give my eyes to someone else. 

185
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,980
 I told my mom and only got scolded. 

186
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:58,080
 So that's why I'm trying to do it in secrecy, so where do I have to go? 

187
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,710
 You deserve to be scolded. 

188
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:04,690
 Those types of things are supposed to be done later, way later, 

189
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:07,750
 when you really die. 

190
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,060
 Let me see. I'll take a look. 

191
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,610
 You'll live really long. I'm really good at guessing things like this. 

192
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,530
 You talk like a fortune teller. 

193
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:27,690
  My uncle said that those things aren't good. 

194
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:33,160
 With those bright eyes, you have to see happy things, fun things, and when you grow up, 

195
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,670
 you have to see a lot of pretty women. Mm? 

196
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,810
See, my words are right.

197
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:51,130
You even endured a big accident like this and survived.

198
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:54,440
I said I'm really good at guessing things like that.

199
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,950
But... I'm really sleepy

200
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:04,320
and I'm in pain. It's hard.

201
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,660
- Ahjussi...
- Hm?

202
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,720
Now... isn't it time for me to die?

203
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,470
It's a secret to my dad.

204
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,090
Now...

205
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,590
I said you'll live really long.

206
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:47,500
Ahjussi, are you scared?

207
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,320
Your hands are trembling...

208
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,190
No. I'm fine.

209
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:58,960
A coward who's trying to act tough.

210
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:04,000
I...want to hold your hand,

211
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,460
but I can't move. Please hold my hand.

212
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,700
It's okay.

213
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,290
It's going to be okay.

214
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:45,410
Doctor Lee! If it's hard for you, do you want to switch with Doctor An Dae Gil?

215
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:49,760
No. I'll stay.

216
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,530
Ahjussi...

217
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:01,770
Save my dad first. Hm?

218
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:07,400
Yes. I'll save you, too. I'll definitely save you.

219
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,520
Don't worry.

220
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,880
What is troubling you?

221
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,470
My child is suddenly not talking.

222
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,480
Since when?

223
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,510
Since after he saw his dad die.

224
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,860
 Why are you like that? Stop it! 

225
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,260
It's okay. What is it?

226
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,190
Why are you like that? What's his name?

227
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,600
 Seung Ho. Shin Seung Ho. 

228
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,950
Seung Ho, what is it? Do you have something to say to me?

229
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,680
 Place where lost: Yeonggwang Mart parking lot. 

230
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,850
Yes, I put this up. Why?

231
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,320
You saw him?

232
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,010
Where were you before you came here?

233
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,500
Be careful in going down. Be careful.

234
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,640
- Yes. 
- Yes.

235
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,520
Yes, yes.

236
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,770
Hey, Woo Sung.

237
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:23,910
Put him down and come back up.

238
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,600
Yes, I'll go up.

239
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,840
One, two, three!

240
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,920
That's good.

241
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,870
Uncle!

242
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,350
It's Ji Na.

243
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,210
Auntie was looking for you everywhere!

244
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:44,060
Then is the boy inside... Ji Won?

245
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:48,600
Ji Won is inside.

246
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,060
Doctor Lee Hae Sung helped him.

247
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,400
I promised I would save him no matter what.

248
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:00,390
Another ambulance is going to come in ten minutes. We can move both of you.

249
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,160
But it seems like there aren't any hospitals in the vicinity.

250
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,890
Aside from closed hospitals, where is the closest hospital?

251
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,410
That's Mirae Hospital.

252
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:10,300
Because they also have supply support...

253
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,320
Will you be okay even if you go to Mirae Hospital?

254
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,000
We have to trust them.

255
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,960
The second rescue victim is coming!

256
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,430
 Lift him up gently, gently. 

257
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,420
Doctor, the second victim is coming.

258
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,100
 Lift him gently. 

259
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,100
Grab onto the stretcher tightly!

260
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,420
Oh my, why is it like this?

261
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,850
Oh my, I really hate this!

262
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,650
Hold on, hold on!

263
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,500
Endure!

264
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,190
Grab onto it!

265
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,770
Grab on tight!

266
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,420
Grab onto it!

267
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:15,650
Hey, don't let go! Don'tâ€” Don't let go!

268
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:43,080
Ji Won. Ji Won!

269
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,860
 So, he doesn't shake. 

270
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,690
Ah Dae Gil, auscultate.

271
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,670
Vitals?

272
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,550
Blood pressure 80/50.

273
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:23,430
A broken glass... The carotid artery is blocked.

274
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:35,590
Why are you like that? Are you okay?

275
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,770
Hyun Sook, how is my uncle doing?

276
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:40,000
 Please prepare another IV bag. 

277
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,270
Doctor, look here.

278
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:45,670
I think he has internal bleeding in his stomach. What do we do?

279
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,530
  The carotid artery has ruptured. 

280
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,940
 The internal bleeding is too big. 

281
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,560
 We have to send him to the hospital like this. 

282
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,310
The blood pressure is 60.

283
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:03,420
If we send him to the hospital like this, he'll die before we even reach the hospital.

284
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:08,160
Doctor, pull yourself together. Why are you suddenly like this?

285
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,000
He won't even last ten minutes.

286
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:15,540
Take hold of the blood vessel.

287
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,560
Let's block the hemorrhage and send him.

288
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,670
Guide me. I'll do it.

289
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,350
No, no.

290
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,750
You're not in a state where you can do it. Doctor An and I will do itâ€”

291
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,470
Ah, why are you being like this? I can't do it.

292
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,660
We can just tell the ambulance to take him to a large hospital.

293
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,110
He'll die on the way there!

294
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:38,240
Doctor Lee, pull yourself together. Huh?

295
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,310
If you really can't do it, Ji Won will die.

296
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,410
Doctor An, I'll sterilize it. Find the ruptured blood vessel.

297
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,510
Are you crazy? I'm an intern. I can't do this.

298
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,450
Then I'll do it.

299
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,960
No, Nurse Park. Don't do it.

300
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,940
It's not something you should do. It's not something a nurse can do.

301
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,500
Then you do it, Lee Hae Sung!

302
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,970
I said I'll do it.

303
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,290
Put down the scalpel first.

304
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,300
What are you doing right now?

305
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,990
A patient is dying, so nowâ€”

306
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:16,020
You need to quickly do something.

307
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,660
Doctor Lee isn't in a condition to do a surgery. Doctor An Dae Gilâ€”

308
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,360
It doesn't make a difference whether he's here or not.

309
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,310
Doctor Lee, give the orders.

310
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,050
Doctor!

311
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:29,170
Find the ruptured carotid artery and block the hemorrhage.

312
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,210
When it's like this, aren't we supposed to transport him?

313
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,980
It won't do because his blood pressure dropped. He'll die on the way.

314
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,990
We have to do it right away.

315
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:39,110
Anyway, it's always something whenever I come to Seoul.

316
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:44,200
An Dae Gil, what are you doing? Stand in and assist.

317
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,740
Y-yes.

318
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,330
 What do we have to do first, Doctor Lee? 

319
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:55,320
 First of all with the scalpel, make long cuts to the parts above and below the bleeding area. 

320
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,750
 Scalpel. 

321
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,130
You are doing well.

322
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,090
Now use metzenbaum scissors to cut along the inside.

323
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,060
Metzenbaum Scissor.

324
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,220
With the gauze, softly...

325
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,900
Gauze.

326
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:36,700
Now carefully clean the shard wound.

327
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:43,900
In the deep areas,

328
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,550
you can feel something like a tube, right?

329
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,440
That's the carotid artery.

330
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,310
Now, the ruptured area of the carotid artery...

331
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,630
Find it with your fingers.

332
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:00,480
I found it.

333
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,330
Retractor.

334
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,510
An Dae Gil, open the hole wide.

335
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:11,710
Yes. Securely, correctly.

336
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:15,550
You are doing well.

337
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:20,380
Vascular clamp.

338
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,940
We don't have that, but we do have a Kelly.

339
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,920
Then, that'll have to do.

340
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,210
Oh... Doctor Oh, how was the dress?

341
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,560
Team Leader, Dong Ha...

342
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,700
I heard news about Dong Ha.

343
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,110
 There's someone who saw him at the citizens' hospital. 

344
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:54,440
 After the hospital closed down, they said he went to In Joo Dae Hospital. 

345
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,670
 I need to go with him, huh? 

346
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:09,020
Elder, you are also a patient. You have reduced bone mass along with symptoms of dehydration.

347
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:14,120
Ah, when Ji Won is like that...

348
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,450
I'll definitely take him there safely.

349
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:17,680
Let's meet at the hospital.

350
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,760
Uncle, come and ride another car with me. Ji Won will be fine.

351
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,110
I entrust you with him. Work hard.

352
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,950
Yes, I understand.

353
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,250
Jung Ddol Mi, get in this car.

354
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,760
Ji Na.

355
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:43,590
That Doctor from before, is he okay?

356
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,450
Yes. He's a good doctor.

357
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:48,010
I think that he trembled before because of PTSD.

358
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:51,820
It's called post traumatic stress disorder. After facing events like wars or accidents,

359
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,830
it's a condition where they continue to experience distress.

360
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:58,630
There were a lot of things that happened. He's just experiencing some confusion.

361
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,610
Don't worry, Uncle.

362
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,080
He'll definitely save Ji Won.

363
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,800
She's right. His skills are definite.

364
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,270
You're not in your right mind.

365
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,130
How did you come?

366
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:21,960
Doctor, I accomplished this big thing.

367
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,870
Shouldn't a praise and a thank you come first?

368
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,400
Thanks and you did well.

369
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,140
So, tell me now. How did you come?

370
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:33,410
I got off at the Busan Airport and they said the medical supplies were going up to Seoul.

371
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:38,190
After transferring over patient Jung Min Cheol's care, I immediately took the flight and came back up.

372
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,530
I just went home and quickly showered.

373
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,700
You're crazy.

374
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,590
You're not in your right mind.

375
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:52,390
Everyone is going crazy because they can't get out of Seoul, so why would you come here again?

376
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:56,200
I'm in my right mind. I'm going to try and live like a doctor.

377
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,530
Didn't you already recognize

378
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,950
that my medical license is not just a piece of paper?

379
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,850
It isn't over yet.

380
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:06,350
The surgery is left and we have to care for him, too.

381
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,710
That's why it's a problem

382
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,590
if you continue like that.

383
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,140
What is?

384
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:16,350
You have PTSD, right?

385
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:23,860
Promise me that you'll go to Doctor Eun So Yool as soon as we get there.

386
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,840
I got it.

387
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,800
Ahjussi...

388
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,820
Are you conscious?

389
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,980
It hurts.

390
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,970
I know. You'll be okay soon.

391
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,840
Just endure it for a bit.

392
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,750
I want to live.

393
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,600
Get your head straight.

394
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,390
I'll definitely save you. I'll promise you.

395
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:53,090
I'm really scared.

396
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:56,280
I want to live.

397
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:00,410
I'm... really scared.

398
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:04,100
Please hold my hand.

399
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,490
Yeah.

400
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:10,490
You're okay. Don't talk now.

401
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,350
Ah, I said you can't.

402
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:24,540
There are no doctors to do the surgery. Go to another hospital.

403
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,910
 We're almost there and we have doctors with us. 

404
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,780
What is it?

405
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,870
- Be careful, Uncle.
- Oh, oh, oh, Elder.

406
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,920
Ji Won, we're almost there.

407
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,350
Ji Won, this is the hospital.

408
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,780
 Now you're saved, Ji Won. 

409
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:52,700
 Pull yourself together! Are you going to quit being a doctor? 

410
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:56,280
 Don't come near the hospital. No, don't even step foot into the hospital. 

411
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,410
 When that happens, 

412
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:02,600
 the hospital director may personally find another hospital and move your mother. 

413
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,780
 Take your mother and leave. 

414
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,460
What are you doing?

415
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:18,620
Go inside quickly and perform the surgery on my Ji Won.

416
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,990
I can't enter Mirae Hospital.

417
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,930
What do you mean?

418
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,730
I was fired.

419
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:28,540
Another surgeon will come out soon.

420
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,020
They can't accept us.

421
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,270
There's no doctor to do the surgery and they're saying it doesn't match with the hospital's policies.

422
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,420
They are telling us to go to Sunjin Hospital. What should we do?

423
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:39,060
That's too far. There's a doctor here!

424
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,870
Even the Hospital Director got involved and refused.

425
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:44,420
The Hospital Director? Did you get into contact with the Hospital Director?

426
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,310
Give it to me.

427
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,280
 Brother-in-law, are you there? 

428
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,180
 Can you hear my words? 

429
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,210
 Hurry up and pick up the walkie-talkie! 

430
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,740
This is the Hospital Director, Park Gun.

431
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:00,900
 If there are no doctors, I'll rehire Doctor Lee Hae Sung. 

432
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,030
Open the surgery room and allow Ji Won to undergo surgery quickly!

433
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,450
What are you doing? I said to open the surgery room!

434
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:13,450
Hyungnim... is it really you?

435
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:17,150
I'm going into surgery right now, so open the door!

436
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:20,430
Here, let's escort him in.

437
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,330
Yes.

438
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:33,890
I heard that this hospital's president and his son came in an ambulance.

439
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:38,210
Ah...they were going to return alive like this yet they made me so worried.

440
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:42,060
Gun, does Ji Won need to have surgery? Is he in really bad condition?

441
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,930
Ah, what do I do? My Ji Won...

442
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:48,410
I know...

443
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:51,200
I think we'll have to do the surgery.

444
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,600
Where is Team Leader Kang? Why can't I see her?

445
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,210
She needs to resolve some of this!

446
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,080
That...

447
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,360
- But who will perform the surgery? 
 - Lee Hae Sung.

448
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,690
It seems he followed them here all the way from the rescue scene.

449
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,310
Doctor Lee?

450
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,000
Prepare for the surgery.

451
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,950
- S-scrub...
- Scrub nurse?

452
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:13,570
Tell Nurse Kim Myung Jae. He's a veteran.

453
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:16,250
Huh? Butâ€”

454
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,920
Hurry up.

455
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,370
Yes.

456
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:26,120
I'm going...

457
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,690
It's okay, Mom is going.

458
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,930
Doctor Do Yun Hoo and Doctor Yoo Myung Hyun!

459
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,220
Doctor Yoo Myung  Hyun!

460
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:43,740
Yes?

461
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,420
They asked us to open the surgery room so go into assist right now.

462
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,640
- Me?
- Me?
- Both of you.

463
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,180
Who else is there that is as experienced as you two?

464
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,890
Hurry up and get ready.

465
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:09,640
Because I wanted to look inside the ocean...

466
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,400
If I just hadn't said that I wanted to swim,

467
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,780
then my dad wouldn't have gotten hurt.

468
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:20,450
I'm not in much pain.

469
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:23,170
Don't worry, Ji Won.

470
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:26,880
If I was born healthy,

471
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,590
it would have been good.

472
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,600
I'm sorry, Dad.

473
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,410
Stop talking. You'll be in more pain.

474
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:37,650
Space and

475
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:40,640
inside the ocean,

476
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,990
I really wanted to see them.

477
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:47,630
Doctor,

478
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:53,140
you have to donate my eyes.

479
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:58,640
Even if I have to live like that... I want to see.

480
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,940
What are you talking about? I'm definitely going to save you,

481
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,690
so stop saying things like that.

482
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:06,370
The sea?

483
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:10,280
Once you come out of this surgery room, I'll show you the Busan sea as much as you want.

484
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,110
I promise you.

485
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:30,450
Ji Won. Ji Won, how did this happen?

486
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,030
What do I do about my Ji Won?

487
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,440
How's his condition?

488
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,670
When I looked at the ultrasound, there's a bleeding of the carotid artery and there's definitely something ruptured.

489
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,880
His vitals are also not good.

490
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,300
Doctor Yoo Myung Hyun and Doctor Do Yun Ho will assist.

491
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,920
 Only you need to go in. 

492
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,670
 Doctor, I beg of you. 

493
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:51,570
To us, he is our one and only son.

494
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:54,380
I'll do my best.

495
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,740
Of course, you'll try your best,

496
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,940
but you have to save our Ji Won.

497
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,010
Yes.

498
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:03,150
Please save him. You have to. Huh?

499
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:11,200
Ji Won. Ji Won! You have to survive and come out, Ji Won!

500
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,690
Ji Won! Ji Won...

501
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,980
If something happens during this surgery, isn't our fellow position going out the window?

502
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,080
Doctor Lee Hae Sung has already been marked by the Hospital Director.

503
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,530
The Hospital Director likes me a lot?

504
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:31,550
Aigoo... If that fire jumps onto me, I really won't have the heart to do the surgery.

505
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,540
It's the same with me.

506
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,890
X-ray!

507
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,240
Yes.

508
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,390
Here.

509
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:45,440
I see a lot of free air and it seems like his mediastinum has widened.

510
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,360
What about the vitals?

511
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,050
I raised his blood pressure, but as you know,

512
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:51,370
it's not looking good.

513
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,300
Finish preparing for the surgery quickly.

514
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,630
Doctor Yoo, tell the cardiothoracic surgeon to come quickly.

515
00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:00,750
Uh Doctor... Before you contact the thoracic surgeon,

516
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,230
I think it'll be good if you change your assist.

517
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:06,290
- Why?
- I keep having diarrhea.

518
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,480
- The situation really isn't good.
- What?

519
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,070
If you use me as your assistant,

520
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:14,870
I am telling you that because I feel as there will be disruptions during surgery.

521
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,200
It's because I really don't feel good.

522
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,620
Oh, my stomach hurts. My stomach hurts too much. Move aside.

523
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,200
Hey. Hey! Hey, where are you going?

524
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,630
Doctor, where are you going?

525
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:24,920
Doctor, if Doctor Yoo isn't here, then it won't make a difference whether I'm here or not.

526
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,950
I'm sorry.

527
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:29,150
Hey, where are you going? Hey, don't go!

528
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:32,660
Doctor, the vitals are shaking. If this continues, he'll go into shock.

529
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,350
Hold him tight. I'll be back in five minutes.

530
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,580
I was shocked because a person who went to Busan returned with a patient.

531
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,780
When I arrived at the airport,

532
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:44,280
there was like a mountain full of medicine.

533
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,260
And they loaded the Seoul flight with that.

534
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,510
I took the plane and came right back.

535
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:51,230
Aigoo, even after suffering that much in Seoul?

536
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,560
Well, suffering is suffering, but it was good.

537
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,950
Jung Ddol Mi! Let's do the surgery.

538
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,880
What are you talking about? You already went into surgery.

539
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,770
They ran away. Doctor Yoo and Do, those bad jerks.

540
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:04,780
That's just like Yoo Myung Hyun. Is he saying he doesn't want a VIP patient?

541
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,230
- Jung Ddol Mi, get ready quickly.
- Yes.

542
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:09,890
Hey, An Dae Gil! What are you doing? You have to come in too.

543
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:10,930
Me, too?

544
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:14,030
What are you doing? Why aren't you running? Quickly!

545
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:18,170
Sister! Tell the thoracic surgeon to quickly come to our surgery room.

546
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,310
It's urgent!

547
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,810
Yes, the thoracic surgeon?

548
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,110
What are you, Lee Hae Sung?

549
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:33,360
I told you not to come even near the hospital.

550
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,070
If the Hospital Director finds out, I can't guarantee anything with your mother.

551
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,300
Someone higher than the Hospital Director told me to come back into this hospital.

552
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,090
- What?
- The president's son's condition isn't good.

553
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:44,110
The surgery is urgent.

554
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:53,440
Nurse Park, where does this bed go?

555
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,900
Oh, number 8.

556
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:59,670
There's no room in the ICU... to be coming here?

557
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,180
Yeah, it's full.

558
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,670
What happened to Lee Hae Sung?

559
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,610
You are like his teammate, why didn't you go in with him?

560
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,470
It just happened like that.

561
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:09,300
Nurse, the whole thoracic team is in surgery. What should I do?

562
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,090
Go and tell Lee Hae Sung right away.

563
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:16,400
The surgery that Lee Hae Sung went into is a situation where they need a thoracic surgeon as well?

564
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,770
I don't know much about that either...

565
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:21,510
He's a patient with a muscle disease.

566
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:26,080
Nurse Park, take care of the ICU patient just for a minute.

567
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,080
What about the patient's vitals?

568
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,180
BP 70/40. HR 120.

569
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,700
His breathing isn't looking good.

570
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:37,720
Doctor Lee, all of the thoracic doctors are in surgery. What should I do?

571
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,000
Ah, that can't be...

572
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,800
Telling them that the patient's mediastinum has widened.

573
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,030
Find the surgery room and request of the thoracic surgeon to send anyone over.

574
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,180
Yes.

575
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:54,990
Even though you might have already seen the X-ray, his chest and abdomen are all bad.

576
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:59,030
The bleeding of the carotid artery is urgent, but it is already clamped.

577
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:02,690
But since his blood pressure continues to fall, we're going to fix the bleeding inside his stomach first.

578
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:05,730
After that, we will suture up his carotid artery.

579
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:10,190
When the thoracic surgeon arrives, we'll tell him to look at the chest area.

580
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,890
Scalpel.

581
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,450
Stop.

582
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,920
What are you doing?

583
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:22,500
The abdomen has free air. Let's say that you do solve that,

584
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,360
the problem is the mediastinum.

585
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,880
The widened area can lead to injuries of the heart.

586
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,040
Could a patient with a muscle disease endure this surgery?

587
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,390
- Scalpel.
- Stop.

588
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:32,990
- Scalpel.
- It's a surgery even healthy people find difficult to endure!

589
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:34,970
Scalpel!

590
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,740
I said I'll take responsibility, I will. Why aren't you giving it to me?

591
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:50,950
Nurse Kim, switch places with me.

592
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,890
Why would you?

593
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,710
Because I'm on Lee Hae Sung's team.

594
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,570
What?

595
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:04,540
People who aren't needed here, please leave. Each minute is precious.

596
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,340
Scalpel.

597
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:23,350
I'm sorry, Professor.

598
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:35,540


599
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:49,540
Is it going well?

600
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:54,490
Our Ji Won can live, right?

601
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:57,800
You can just look at the results later.

602
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,850
When you say look at the results, are you saying it's hard to tell?

603
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:06,850
Or are you saying to give up because it's hard?

604
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:10,530
Professor Han, say what you think.

605
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:15,310
It's the latter.

606
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:21,340
What do we do about our Ji Won?

607
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:26,440
Truthfully, it's a miracle that he even came to the hospital alive in that condition.

608
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,910
I think it's best that you should prepare your hearts.

609
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:35,950
It would have been good if we could have made him comfortable on his way.

610
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:38,620
Ji Won is suffering a lot.

611
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,300
What do we do about our Ji Won?

612
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,550
Our Ji Won...

613
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:52,610
Doctor Lee Hae Sung will save him.

614
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:53,700
Doctor Lee will...

615
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,650
Hyungnim, I already told you before.

616
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,940
Lee Hae Sung is a doctor whose recklessness has no end.

617
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:01,280
Doctor Lee Hae Sung will save him.

618
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,020
He will definitely save him.

619
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,960
The thoracic surgeon, why isn't he coming? You said that he will come as soon as he's finished.

620
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:15,820
The spleen has been removed well. What should we do about the ruptured intestines? What about the broken glass?

621
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,960
What do you mean what should we do? We need to stitch it up carefully.

622
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,900
An Dae Gil, wash this area here. So, I could try to find the ruptured vessel.

623
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,370
In addition, we will remove the broken glass. Let's connect the blood vessel.

624
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,090
Yes.

625
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:36,940
The reason that we can't get a hold of the blood vessel, isn't it because of the heart?

626
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:39,940
Doctor Lee, the EKG is weird.

627
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:44,570
It seems like cardiac tamponade.

628
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:45,800
Tamponade?
 

629
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,980
His blood pressure was already low when he came in.

630
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:50,940
He has tachycardia and his heart wave changes are also very severe.

631
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,480
Doctor Han said that the mediastinum was widened before.

632
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,670
That there could be injuries to the heart.

633
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:58,190
You got a hold of the abdominal bleeding, but the blood pressure is still dropping.

634
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:00,850
We even gave him everything, epinephrine and norepinephrine, but there are no changes at all.

635
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:04,040
And it's probably not coronary artery disease at this age.

636
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,640
The systolic pressure dropped down to 50.

637
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,600
Doctor An, run over and call over the thoracic surgeon.

638
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,480
Use the suction!

639
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,770
- Wait.
- The blood pressure is continuing to fall.

640
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:16,490
I'm going to give him another dose of epinephrine.

641
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:18,650
Do I go or not?

642
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:24,780
We can just open it right now.

643
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:28,350
Isn't it better to wait for the thoracic surgeon? If something happens...

644
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:30,610
He'll die while waiting.

645
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:32,290
Have you ever done this surgery before?

646
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:34,850
I did it once when I was an intern. I'll be able to do it.

647
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:39,380
No. I have to do it,

648
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:42,180
because I'm the only one to him now.

649
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:50,220
Listen carefully, we are going to extend the abdominal section to the xiphoid process.

650
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,560
If we open up the diaphragm, we will be right below the pericardium.

651
00:44:53,560 --> 00:45:01,080
If you carefully open the pericardium, you can take out some blood that is blocking the heart from pumping.

652
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,820
A surgeon doing work of a thoracic doctor... is impossible.

653
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:09,720
Scalpel.

654
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:12,990
   Yeonggwang, Yeonggwang. Pick up. 

655
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:16,770
  This is the government. Pick up, Yeonggwang, Yeonggwang. 

656
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:19,540
Yes, please speak.

657
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:23,480
 This is the government. I wish to speak to  Chief Choi Il Sub. 

658
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,580
Yes, I understand.

659
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:31,340
Chief!  You have a call from the government.

660
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:34,380
Why is the government searching for me?

661
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:37,260
I don't really know.

662
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:40,610
Yes, I Yeonggwang District Firefighter Chief Choi Il Sub.

663
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:45,170
 This is the government. Your wife has just come to us. 

664
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:47,780
My wife should be at my relative's house.

665
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:52,040
 What do I do about our daughter? What do we do with our daughter? 

666
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,720
Honey.

667
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:01,560
It seems like cardiac tamponade was correct. The drainage has decreased a lot.

668
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:05,460
But if it occurred due to bleeding and not bodily fluids,

669
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,420
doesn't it also mean that there's a rupture in the heart?

670
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:11,600
I'm giving both transfusions and fluids, but the blood pressure is not being stabilized.

671
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,900
It'll rise a bit and then fall again.

672
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,150
It does seem like a rupture.

673
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:18,740
How long can it last?

674
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:21,330
Thirty minutes at the most.

675
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:27,270
- Let's open it.
- Open what?

676
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:28,500
His chest.

677
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,690
Doctor.

678
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:33,740
Doctor Lee, this isn't it. Stop.

679
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:37,130
Hyun Sook, go and see if the thoracic surgery has ended.  Tell them to come here no matter what.

680
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:38,270
Yes.

681
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:42,170
 Oh, his blood pressure is falling even more. This won't do. 

682
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:45,380
I'm going crazy...

683
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:55,350
It can't fall anymore.

684
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:58,310
Ddol Mi, disinfect his chest right now. Hurry up.

685
00:46:58,310 --> 00:46:59,910
Doctor, you can't.

686
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:03,070
If you open up his chest, really... This isn't our specialty.

687
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:06,770
We need to at least prepare, so that when the thoracic surgeon comes, he can proceed!

688
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,880
Clear this up.

689
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,020
Disinfectant.

690
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:42,840
They can't come. They are going crazy that the aorta has ruptured during surgery.

691
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:57,450
Ok, scalpel then.

692
00:47:57,450 --> 00:47:59,310
No. It's too dangerous.

693
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:01,890
Doctor Lee, it's a surgery you've never even tried. Just leave it alone.

694
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:05,530
If I haven't ever done it before, do I just watch the child go with my eyes wide open?

695
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:07,770
We need to open him first and see which part is ruptured,

696
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:11,030
so we can block it with our hands or stitch it up to save the child!

697
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:14,330
Let's just give up. You're pushing it too far.

698
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:16,930
I won't give up. I promised him

699
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:19,310
that I would show him the ocean and even space.

700
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:23,970
Doctor Lee, I want to tell you to save my younger brother, but this isn't it.

701
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:26,250
Everyone that wants to leave, leave. I'm going to do it by myself if you won't help me.

702
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:27,950
Scalpel.

703
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:40,980
Saw.

704
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:42,700
Take care of the protective eye wear.

705
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:21,260
It's an arrest. I'll give epinephrine.

706
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:24,380
Put in as much fluids as we have. Retractor.

707
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,880
This isn't working.  I can't see.

708
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,370
You hold it open so I can do a cardiac massage.

709
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:36,680
Yes, I'm holding onto it.

710
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:52,000
Please...

711
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,490
Please...

712
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:02,180
Please...

713
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,600
Please...

714
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,670
Please...

715
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:23,620
Please...

716
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,440
Excuse me.

717
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,260
Song Dong Ha. Seven years old. I came because they said he was here.

718
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:34,940
He's my son.

719
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:37,250
Just a moment.

720
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:38,300
It's a male, right?

721
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,790
- Yes.
- Follow me.

722
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:07,320
Dong Ha.

723
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:10,990
Dong Ha, Mom is here.

724
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:16,190
Dong Ha, open your eyes. Mom is here.

725
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,560
I'm sorry. Just a moment.

726
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:45,480
It's the first time that I felt so regretful of being a doctor.

727
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,120
Me too.

728
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:51,790
When we're like this, how would Doctor Lee feel?

729
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,760
Let's go out.

730
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,710
If we're going to get hit, it's better to get hit early.

731
00:55:57,710 --> 00:55:59,370
Let's go.

732
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:12,650
What happened? Is it a table death?

733
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:22,980
I was so happy because you came alive...

734
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:26,960
You went in there and came out like this.

735
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,130
Ji Won. Ji Won, it's Mom.

736
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:33,870
Ji Won. Ji Won. You're just sleeping, right? Right?

737
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:36,780
Ji Won. Ji Won. Let's go home.

738
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:39,520
Ji Won. Ji Won!

739
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,670
Exactly what surgery did you do?

740
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:46,310
The spleen and the small intestine was torn, so we were performing the surgery...

741
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:50,300
We later found out that the myocardium had ruptured, so there was an arrest.

742
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,590
We blocked the cardiac hemorrhage.

743
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:55,280
Because we were doing a cardiac massage...

744
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,130
Not a thoracic doctor, but Lee Hae Sung did that?

745
00:56:57,130 --> 00:57:00,180
It was an urgent situation. The thoracic doctors couldn't even come.

746
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:02,460
What about Doctor Yoo and Doctor Do?

747
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:06,150
Are you saying that because it was obvious they were going to oppose a surgery like this, he chased them all out and did the surgery by himself?

748
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:08,690
- That's not it.
- What do you mean it's not?

749
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:10,420
How is this going to be explained logically?

750
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:12,570
Why the resident and the interns...

751
00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:15,600
It's common sense that a surgery fellow has more surgical experience.

752
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,020
Lee Hae Sung, he's unmanageable...

753
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:20,790
Out of control!

754
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:22,510
Lee Hae Sung.

755
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:35,760
- Aunt, don't do this.
- If it was hard to save him, you could have just said so!

756
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,280
Instead...instead, it would have been nice if he held my hand one more time

757
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,640
and saw my face before he left.

758
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,670
What is this?

759
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:47,880
He lived his entire life in pain

760
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:51,460
and he couldn't even leave in peace.

761
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:55,430
Did you really want to disfigure his body that much?!

762
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:58,230
Are you...  Are you human?

763
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:00,540
Are you a doctor?

764
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:06,390
You are a butcher! A human killing butcher!

765
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:09,650
 What do we do about our Ji Won? 

766
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:12,600
 What do I do about our Ji Won? 

767
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:18,810
Noona.

768
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:22,910
Noona... Help me move her.

769
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,400
Nothing ever works if you hand Lee Hae Sung a scalpel.

770
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:31,860
This... Even though Lee Hae Sung is not a thoracic doctor,

771
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:34,080
this is an unreasonable surgery, where he tried to imitate them.

772
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,200
That's a misunderstanding, Director.

773
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:39,400
Misunderstanding? Misunderstanding?

774
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,970
Then, he probably overestimated his ability.

775
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:44,170
As a result, my nephew...

776
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:47,740
He wasn't even able to thrive.

777
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:50,500
In this deplorable procedure...

778
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:02,180
What happened?

779
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:04,110
Are you human?

780
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:05,480
Are you human?

781
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,580
- Where's So Yeon?
- While saving other people,

782
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:09,520
you ignored your own child. Is that  a dad?

783
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,680
Where is So Yeon?

784
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:35,380
 She's over there. 

785
00:59:46,690 --> 00:59:48,520
 I had to be able to contact you 

786
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,120
 so I could tell you to look for our child. 

787
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,930
 From Ansan to here, 

788
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:56,640
 I walked around and tried to look for her. 

789
01:00:15,930 --> 01:00:18,880
 Look. Look. 

790
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,480
 This is your child. 

791
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:26,420
 Our So Yeon became like this. 

792
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:39,460


793
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:56,310
 â™« In the collapsed world â™« 

794
01:00:56,310 --> 01:01:02,830
 â™« It's left out all by itself â™« 

795
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:11,120
  This surgery, I'm not going to just let it slide. 

796
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,790
  Medical treatment outside one's ability... That's murder. 

797
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:16,690
 Were you waiting for someone to die like this? It's like that right now. 

798
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:18,000
 You're not doing anything. 

799
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,780
 Survival rate is too low. I am sorry. 

800
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:22,520
 Doctor Lee, please save my daughter. 

801
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:26,910
 Even if I do the surgery crazily in hopes of saving her, she'll die. 

802
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:28,920
 I said she'll die. 

803
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:33,340
 He did surgery while he was suffering from PTSD? You're caught by me, Lee Hae Sung. 

804
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:38,880
  This is saying that you wish to submit a request for Lee Hae Sung's medical license removal. 

805
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:42,570
 I'm sorry. 

806
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:45,120
  I did wrong. 

807
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:49,590
 It's right that a person like me shouldn't be a doctor. 

808
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:53,210
