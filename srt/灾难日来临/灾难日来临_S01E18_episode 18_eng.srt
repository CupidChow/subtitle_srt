1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,410
 The nation will not forget the workers' sacrifice. 

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,460
 What are you going into the Yeouido pipeline? 

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,880
 In these situations, the Captain is the one that goes- 

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,950
 You said you can die if something goes wrong! 

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,760
 You need to be brave like dad. No matter what, so stay well. 

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,100
 Later when you open your eyes, look at mother's 2nd son, okay? 

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,070
 I was bad to my brother. Later on, can you help me fix it? 

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,990
 Dad! 

9
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,890
 My daughter is working so hard. 

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,260
 As a father, do you think I can be playing around? 

11
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,000
 Dad, how did you become like this? 

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,800
 It's my fault that you're hurt. 

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,770
 I'll be doing the surgery. 

14
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,990
 What are you doing here? Aren't you going to do surgery on my dad? 

15
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,030
 Jung Dol Mi, I can't perform surgery on your father. 

16
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,740
  
- Doctor Yoo Myung Hyun will do the surgery.

17
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,960
Doctor Lee, he only has an aneurysm which hasn't burst yet.

18
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,440
The size is big and if it seems like it will rupture,

19
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,400
if you raise and lower the blood pressure, we can earn some time.

20
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:00,240
My father...somewhere in his stomach it's bursting. You saw it, too.

21
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,140
I know, but

22
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,100
- this patient's will rupture soon-
 - No, but to a patient who didn't rupture yet-

23
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,990
If the aneurysm burst at the site, the patient wouldn't have even survived the car ride.

24
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:13,420
If you don't do surgery to my father right now, he will die, Doctor!

25
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,540
I can't trust teacher Yoo Myung Hyun. Teacher, please do it instead.

26
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,760
Jung Dol Mi.

27
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,260
I don't mind if you tell me I am cold-hearted or whatever,

28
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,410
but I can't leave my father to a person who performs surgery with his mouth.

29
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,980
Please, you do it instead, please.

30
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,610
If this patient's ruptures, there is no one to save him. I need to perform surgery before that.

31
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:38,110
It didn't rupture yet, and it might not rupture.

32
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,000
Trusting the word 'might'...

33
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,020
Jung Dol Mi, that...is the same as telling me to commit murder.

34
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,990
I can't. No matter how Yoo Myung Hyun performs surgery with his mouth,

35
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,110
he has the skills to be able to fix such a problem.

36
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,130
A doctor needs to experience many different cases to grow and learn.

37
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,070
Case?

38
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:09,390
Is my dad only a case to you, Doctor?

39
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,550
Jung Dol Mi!

40
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,210
You really can't do it?

41
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:22,190


42
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,990
Chief, think about it one more time.

43
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,020
Ow, seriously!

44
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,150
The Yeouido pipeline is like a maze with many curves.

45
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:51,280
Since the entrance has so many twists and turns, we have to go in from the back entrance.

46
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,040
But with your body build, one tank cannot even last you 30 minutes.

47
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,740
With one tank, it's plenty of time.

48
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,630
10 minutes arriving, 10 minutes leaving, 10 minutes to work on it.

49
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,490
if I go quickly and press a button, thats the end.

50
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:07,030
Theres no electricity! What switch are you going to be pressing?!

51
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,040
You've that...

52
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,870
That makes no sense.

53
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,060
When was the last time you punched that guy, so why now?

54
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,710
Hey, they said this is the center of Korea's monetary funds.

55
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,600
The pipeline needs to live for Seoul to live.

56
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,680
But why must it be "us"?

57
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,950
We are not even saving anyone who is dying right now.

58
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,250
Did you not see the patients dying when the electricity got cut?

59
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,500
Still, I think this is too dangerous. Think about it one more time, Chief.

60
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,060
No more! End of discussion

61
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,010
Just help assist at the entrance. Okay?

62
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,250
If it has to be "us," then I'll go.

63
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:45,030
I said I'll go. As a chief, I'll go!!

64
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,890
It's dangerous! How can I, the captain, send you guys?

65
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,680
Cha Yeon.

66
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,440
- Cha Yeon!!
- Yes?

67
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,310
Bring me some ham, so I can eat before I go in.

68
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,120
Yes.

69
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,160
There is no bleeding in the other organs, only the spleen is ripped.

70
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,820
Doctor Jung, it would be best to seal it, right?

71
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,360
You are the leading surgeon.

72
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,370
I'm asking you as a guardian.

73
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:20,750
If i seal it up, it is going to be the best, but...

74
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,510
isn't it better to stitch it up rather than extract it? That's just my opinion.

75
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,300
How can I decide? You decide it.

76
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,270
Okay, I will do a perfect seal.

77
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,750
Dr. Jung, look at me. Park Ji Na...

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,970
Oh!

79
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,730
Doctor! The spleen is ripped!

80
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:54,680
Oh, it's okay! The flesh is so tender, it rips easily.

81
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,180
It's not a big deal. Let's focus now.

82
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,660
Go ahead and tie it.

83
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,220
With a new heart, I can do well.

84
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,270
- Oh! 
- It ripped again!

85
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,860
Oh my, do it properly! I'm going to go crazy!

86
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,710
Do it properly!

87
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,450
Oh goodness, why is it ripping so easily?!

88
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,470
You dad's spleen is a bit weak.

89
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,130
BP isn't good.

90
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,630
It keeps dropping.

91
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,410
Scalpel.

92
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,570
You're awesome, doctor.

93
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:45,000
It's right before it burst, it may burst anytime now.

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,610
This is why the entire body is helpful.

95
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:52,610
The blood vessels are a mess,

96
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,040
There was no proper treatment.

97
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,700
Scalpel.

98
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,280
Tubing.

99
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,570
Its on the inner side.

100
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,030
Gastrointestinal section.

101
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,310
Yes.

102
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,770
It went in well.

103
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,990
Lets do the clamping.

104
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,870
Alright, it's working.

105
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,130
The clamp is in place but the artery keeps ripping downwards.

106
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,550
What? Do the suction properly.

107
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,350
No matter how well I try to do it, it's not working well.

108
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,560
We may have to extract it.

109
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,320
Hurry and remove it, I just want to save my father.

110
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,130
Right?

111
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,690
Park Ji Na, you think that, too?

112
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:59,710
Everyone has the same thoughts as me, so I'll do it then.

113
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,010
Ji Na, scalpel.

114
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,960
I'm good with cutting.

115
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,500
Why is it not working, it's not working well.

116
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,900
Oh my goodness!!

117
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,310
Doctor!!

118
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,190
Are you okay, doctor?

119
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,520
Get up already!

120
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,500
Come here quickly!!

121
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,350
Nurse Park, please bring Doctor Lee.

122
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,710
Get up quickly.

123
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,890
It's so hard!

124
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,730
My dad is going to die...

125
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:39,590
This is not normal! He is going through the 2nd stage of a stroke! Oh my!!

126
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,130
Doctor Yoo!!

127
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:45,060
It's ripping before we can grab it.

128
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,580
I got it.

129
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,760
Clamp.

130
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,150
Dr. Lee, come to other room.

131
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,370
Doctor You was extracting the spleen but ripped it more.

132
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,480
It's ripped open.

133
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,630
Quickly, or Dr. Ddol Mi's dad will pass away.

134
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,330
I can't as it popped here, too.

135
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,870
Dr. Lee.

136
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,990
The BP is dropping drastically 60/40.

137
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,810
The heartbeat is 133. You have to figure it out by yourselves.

138
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,730
Go back quickly as I can't go.

139
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:30,180
I can't let you go like this Dad.

140
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,260
How did it go?

141
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,370
- He said he can't come.
- Why?

142
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,150
It's a blood battle there since the aneurysm burst.

143
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:42,650
What should I do? Dr. Yoo come to your senses please?

144
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:47,320
I can't, I can't! I am not normal right now!

145
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,880
Only if Prof. Han was here.

146
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,680
Do something as the blood pressure is dropping.

147
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,610
Take the clamp off.

148
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,760
I did.

149
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,130
Anesthesiologist, how is the patient?

150
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:07,180
The blood pressure is rising and the heart beat is raising to the normal beat.

151
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,780
Please hold on a bit more longer, please.

152
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,250
Call someone else! Anyone from the surgery department.

153
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,930
Dr. Jung, you're holding the main artery, right?

154
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,860
Then Doctor An, clamp that artery with this.

155
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,100
- Yes? 
- We have to block the blood flow to save the patient.

156
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,740
I have never done this before, what if I touch it wrong?

157
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,630
What are you doing? Hurry up and try to clamp it.

158
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,080
What are you doing? My father will die.

159
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,740
- That's it.
- Really?

160
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,650
It worked really? Give me a clamp.

161
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,590
Clamp it.

162
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,370
It worked, right?

163
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,530
The blood pressure is rising, I guess the ruptured part was blocked.

164
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,770
We've earned some time.

165
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,740
Chief?

166
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,500
Doctor Lee sent someone saying this room needs help.

167
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,700
Chief, please save my father. At this rate, he will die.

168
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,830
He made it this way and even ripped an artery.

169
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,240
It won't be a large problem.

170
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,100
Lets do the extracting of the spleen first then we can control the blood loss from the artery.

171
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,670
Chief!

172
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,240
Hey!

173
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,900
Chief Choi! I'm here!

174
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,380
Fighting!!

175
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,870
Is the valve around here?

176
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,960
It isn't for sure.

177
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,170
Chief, he's here.

178
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:54,600
He didn't even have to come but he came running!

179
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,790
Aigoo. Chief Choi.

180
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,050
Am I going to die?

181
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:04,500
No, its just you're doing something big for the nation.

182
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,180
I came to encourage you.

183
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,430
I've prepared a huge gift, too.

184
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,720
He has prepared an extra gold envelope for you.

185
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,650
Does our captain seem to be going to risk his life for a measly gold envelope?

186
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,580
Hey!

187
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,210
I'm sorry.

188
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:28,900
But in these situations, it seems that when the higher people come it doesn't do us any help. It only gets in the way.

189
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,740
Hm.. Right. It must be.

190
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,510
Oh... I'll go that way.

191
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,190
Firefighters, fighting!!

192
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:48,250
Although there was some bleeding, as long as we care for him well, there shouldn't be a problem.

193
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,310
Thank you.

194
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:54,660
Did you worry a lot? Since I am not a gastrointestinal doctor?

195
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,940
I have done some emergency surgeries before and have some hours under my belt.

196
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,970
Go wash your face, the tears on your face made it a mess.

197
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:09,690
No, its alright. My dad almost died, I can't just go by myself

198
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:18,060
Thank you, Dr. An. I'm thankful for earlier and now, too.

199
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:23,420
If it wasn't for you, my father would've passed away.

200
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,820
Ah.. well...

201
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,950
I thought he would pass away, I was so scared.

202
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:38,100
A person almost died.

203
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:43,030
I'm not going to let this go with Doctor Lee.

204
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,890
Why are you looking at me like that?

205
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:58,150
Do you know how startled I was when I thought the patient was going to die?

206
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:04,250
Even though this is the life for an gastrointestinal doctor, not everyone can do this.

207
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:10,530
Seriously, you showed us that not everyone can do it Doctor Yoo.

208
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,640
How's Dr. Jung Ddol Mi's father?

209
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,490
Thankfully the spleen was extracted and the bleeding was controlled.

210
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,700
It's such a relief.

211
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,610
How startled would she have been? She went into her father's surgery and saw what she shouldn't have seen.

212
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,770
What about Yoo Myung Hyun?

213
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:29,000
He asked to have an IV.

214
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,730
Aye.. just let it be.

215
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,570
He must be sorry, too.

216
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:38,980
An gastrointestinal doctor just saw some blood and he loses his mind and can't control himself!

217
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,980
How immature!

218
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,350
What can you do, you have to lower you expectations. Not everyone can be like Doctor Lee.

219
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:49,620
If only he could be a half of him, no only half of half of half of him!

220
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,720
I wanted to do well, too!

221
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:12,590
Please have some urine come out, please.

222
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,220
Is your father, okay?

223
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:55,210
That... I think he's doing okay.

224
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:00,640
Doctor Lee, how should we maintain this patient's blood pressure?

225
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,840
According to the patient's family, he has maintained a high blood pressure.

226
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:18,090
Since the body is use to that, only then will the urine come out.

227
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,510
I'm okay, I'm okay.

228
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,820
You've high fever.

229
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,490
It's okay, I just relaxed all of a sudden after being so alert.

230
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,900
You did a surgery even when you had 39 Degree Celsius fever?

231
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:55,930
Do I let the patient die just because I don't feel good?

232
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:59,530
All the doctors in this hospital are not available;

233
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:03,800
only our doctors are overworking so we are all so tired!

234
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,150
No wonder you fainted!

235
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:11,430
All hospitals are lacking surgeons, what hospital can afford to lose their surgeons?

236
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,570
You must rest for sure.

237
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,680
What about my mom?

238
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,620
Oh, Dr. Eun went.

239
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,900
I'm so thankful. Really.

240
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,110
Nurse Park, give him some sedatives and make him sleep.

241
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,770
Yes.

242
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,360
You must sleep.

243
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,930
Ok.

244
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,480
What about Dr. Jung Ddol Mi?

245
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,500
Wasn't she in the ICU with her father?

246
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,790
- No, she went out.
- Oh.

247
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,510
Hey, Yoo Myung Hyun. Did you apologize to Dr. Jung Ddol Mi?

248
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,050
What? Why would I?

249
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:49,450
What do you mean "why"?! You ripped open an artery and caused a mess!

250
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:53,360
Doctor Jung almost saw her own father go through table death.

251
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,470
You didn't apologize?

252
00:16:54,470 --> 00:17:00,040
Doctor, mistakes like that happen when doing surgery, and if I apologize for each time, then

253
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,910
I can't do surgery.

254
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,420
Ok, let's say you made a mistake.

255
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,040
You still should have taken care of the aftermath.

256
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,000
I heard you sat on the ground and was shaking!

257
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,640
Shaking? How was I shaking?

258
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,180
You know me, just because I became the DMET chief, someone may have spread a rumor.

259
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,120
It isn't true. It's all lies.

260
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,760
Then what is it? Tell me the truth.

261
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,000
The truth is... the Jung patient has a very specific body type.

262
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,750
Patient Jung's artery and spleen are all weird. Some are tough, some are very tender.

263
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:40,570
If I can do what I wish, I just want to open him up and show you again.

264
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,560
Forget it. Sleep Dr. Lee.

265
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,280
You're here. I was looking for you.

266
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,380
What about your father?

267
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,500
He is recovering.

268
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:18,050
Dr. Lee was looking for you.

269
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,950
Why is he looking for me?

270
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,390
He must've something he wanted to say.

271
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:26,790
I don't know what he wants to say,

272
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:32,410
but I don't want to hear it and I don't see a reason, too.

273
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:35,360
I know you're felling bad,

274
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,320
But... Doctor Lee's judgement was not incorrect.

275
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,140
Yes.

276
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,750
Still how can a person do that?

277
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:57,140
When he went into the surgery, please remember only the surgeon Doctor Lee.

278
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:01,760
I know. I know, but

279
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,540
I can't accept it.

280
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,970
 

281
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,040
To Busan?

282
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,260
Yes.

283
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:07,300
Just as father is out from ICU,

284
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,570
I want to go to Busan.

285
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:13,240
I know it's hard but could I ask for help to transfer my dad to a different hospital?

286
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,040
I request you.

287
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,380
Dr. Jung.

288
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,840
If I stayed this much, I did as much as I can.

289
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,010
I want to go back now.

290
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:33,980
You can't trust our professionals here, huh?

291
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,950
I'm sorry.

292
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:41,680
For disappointing you and making you feel so conflicted.

293
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:46,670
I know you've gone through too much until now, Dr Jung,

294
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,570
but

295
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,780
we want to help till your father is in perfect condition.

296
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,360
It's our job as a health professionals.

297
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,530
And the ending needs to be good to conclude this well, too.

298
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,160
Isn't it?

299
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,760
I know what you're trying to say,

300
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:05,310
but I want to go back.

301
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,230
I request you, please.

302
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,780
Jung Ddol Mi.

303
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,810
Jung Ddol Mi, look at me.

304
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,530
Jung Ddol Mi!

305
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,260
Jung Ddol Mi.

306
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:41,510
Hey, Jung Ddol Mi.

307
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,160
Hey,

308
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,680
I'm calling you.

309
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,520
Why are you treating me like I'm invisible?

310
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,070
Am I that kind of person to you?

311
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,920
Jung Ddol Mi!!

312
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:57,460
I know you can never give up on a patient.

313
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,280
But isn't my father a patient, too?

314
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,340
If you had done the surgery, would my dad have almost died?

315
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,760
He's alive though.

316
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,980
It's not about that.

317
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,400
He has a daughter who is a doctor,

318
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,320
but I couldn't do anything for him.

319
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:21,560
It's a relief he is past the critical stage but if he was not able to,

320
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,850
what would I do?

321
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,950
I don't care if you say I'm far from being a real doctor.

322
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,460
If you want to scold me, go head.

323
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,250
When I did the surgery for that patient, I had no choice to...

324
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,470
I know you had no choice!!

325
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,250
I said I know that,

326
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,960
but...

327
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,370
I don't think I will forget that

328
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,760
you pushed back my father.

329
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,670
Is that all I am to you?

330
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,170
Hyungnim, go and

331
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:15,260
focus on your recovery!

332
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,900
Forget all the hospital related business.

333
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,850
I will make sure to take care of everything.

334
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,030
He couldn't, at his own hospital,

335
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:28,030
get proper surgery.

336
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,840
How pitiful.

337
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:34,720
Aunt, why is he being discharged?

338
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,480
It's difficult for his body to handle the transfer.

339
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,420
In Gapyeong, there is a place he can stay.

340
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,040
Since it's too late to do the surgery anyways,

341
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:47,600
I think it would be before for him to go through the recovery treatments at a nursing center.

342
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,550
The doctor there is the head of the neurology department.

343
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,810
We should have helped him recover.

344
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,940
I'm sorry, President Lee.

345
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,020
I'm sure he will recover, I'm sure.

346
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,870
Yes, thank you, Ji Na.

347
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:07,180
I don't know if it's because of the after shock or because of the lousy Doctor Lee.

348
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,940
Since the head doctor said he will take care of him,

349
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:13,500
at least with that, I hope this will help me get my revenge.

350
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,590
That Dr. Lee Hae Sung...

351
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,500
Sister, don't worry about anything.

352
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,850
Just go.

353
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:24,320
Secretary Chong, please take her inside.

354
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,440
You know the way, right?

355
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,780
How long?

356
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,660
Isn't it time for him to come out?

357
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,690
There's about 10 minutes left.

358
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:03,440
Shouldn't we have the rescue team standby?

359
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,400
Who will save us? We have to save ourselves.

360
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,250
There's plenty of oxygen tanks, right?

361
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,570
There is enough but let me double check on them.

362
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:13,890
Oh man, I should have just gone in with him. This is so frustrating!

363
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:17,110
Woo Sung, bring a water bottle on your way back.

364
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,650
 I got you. 

365
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,310
Excuse me!!

366
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,950
Did someone go into the pipeline yet?

367
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:32,310
Not "yet," we are finishing it up.

368
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,840
Man, we're late.

369
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,230
The firefighter station should give us the information quickly.

370
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,510
Is it true? Where did you hear that?

371
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:48,110
I just head for the pump technician.

372
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:53,860
So you're saying, if the pump is initiated by hand, the current is so strong...

373
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:57,320
It will cause a strong current against the exit.

374
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,550
Since the current is hard to push against, they may not make it.

375
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:03,610
Are you saying they may not or they cannot come out?!

376
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,780
Ah, I'm about to go crazy.

377
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:10,030
If we call the rescue team, the pipeline will collapse.

378
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:13,220
If that happens, this is the end.

379
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,960
Still...

380
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,920
This has a person's life on the line, how can we just let him stay there?

381
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,980
Honestly, it's too late to leave.

382
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,260
It's more a burden to pull them out.

383
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,010
Well, at times,

384
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,660
there may be sacrifices needed for a bigger cause.

385
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,640
Right?

386
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,320
Yes.

387
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,050
We need to focus.

388
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:53,440
South Korea's economy is buried in the basement of the pipeline.

389
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,710
The base pump, who knows about this?

390
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:00,680
Me, the technician and you.

391
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:05,160
The three of us need to take this to our grave. Do you understand?

392
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,460
Yes.

393
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,710
The rescue team, have the rescue team on stand by and when the water begins to come out, send them out immediately.

394
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:15,080
- Did you understand?
- Yes.

395
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,890
Hey, Secretary Kang get me some water

396
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,380
Yes.

397
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,490
- Are you going in again?
- Yes.

398
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,780
Could you place this on your helmet and film what you will do?

399
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,580
This will be good news for the discouraged citizens who are going through this disaster.

400
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:43,540
I don't know how to use it but I only have to film, right?

401
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,610
Don't worry about the camera. Just do what are you supposed to do usually.

402
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:49,010
Place it on the helmet tightly, so it doesn't fall off.

403
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,620
You didn't bring the water?

404
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,280
What is this? Camera?

405
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,960
Why are you bringing the rope?

406
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,070
I have to go in there! Captain may not be able to come out.

407
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,070
What? Why?

408
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,440
What are you saying all of a sudden?

409
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,810
When the pump opens, the current may be so strong he may not be able to come out.

410
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:08,250
I wil escort him out, so secure this rope and

411
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,090
when you hear the base pump opening, pull with all your energy. You can do that, right?

412
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,560
Give me the rope, I'll go in.

413
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,730
Hyungnim!!

414
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,590
Didn't you hear the Chief?

415
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,700
Don't make me a lazy superior who uses his lower people.

416
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,300
If you go in, who will direct us?

417
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,550
Since captain is not here, you should at least direct us on what to do.

418
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:28,690
Also, I am much better at diving than you are.

419
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,090
Are you going to be okay?

420
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:36,520
I'll go and bring him out, so just hold the rope tight.

421
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,550
I don't know the situation inside, so

422
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,580
I can't just pull.

423
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,090
If there is a problem, you could get hit by the residue in the water.

424
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:47,960
When you're done with the preparation, pull on the rope three times.

425
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,520
When we get the signal, we will pull right away.

426
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,640
I'll be back.

427
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,610
Woo Sung, 1,2,3. 3 Times.

428
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:08,930


429
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,930
Don't... Don't turn the pump.

430
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,500
I'm almost done.

431
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,870
You can't turn it. If you turn it, we can't get out.

432
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,550
What are you saying?

433
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:15,270
If you turn that, the base pump will release the water and the current will be so strong, that we won't be able to leave.

434
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,920
Are you serious?

435
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,060
I am serious!

436
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,490
If we kick really hard, we can get out.

437
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:25,060
I said you can't, Chief.

438
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:28,420
We can, we can! We will!

439
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:32,170
Even if we wait for the water to escape, the oxygen will run out.

440
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:35,420
We will be stuck here and we won't be able to leave.

441
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,410
Let's just go, Chief.

442
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:41,360
Turning the base pump is suicide!

443
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,120
I said we've to get out, Chief!!

444
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,850
But still...

445
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:50,200
Still we have to turn it, what do we do?

446
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:54,070
With this in the water, we can't hold on much longer.

447
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,800
The pipes will explode soon.

448
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,890
Then the building will collapse; before this collapses,

449
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,630
we have to take out the water.

450
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:06,290
That way the country can survive, or else the country will go bankrupt.

451
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:09,790
We don't have time!

452
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,310
Chief, I knew you'd be like this.

453
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,940
Wait a minute.

454
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,270
Yes.

455
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,490
Will anyone even recognize this hard work?!

456
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,060
What do we do, this is our work.

457
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,130
When we go out, you've to treat me properly.

458
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:37,120
Not like a cheap stew with soju, but

459
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,370
tTuna, ribs, buy us all of these things!

460
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:27,720
The base pump opened, there was a sound.

461
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:32,050
When the signal comes, we have to pull. Don't let it go.

462
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:34,470
Yes.

463
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:28,380
Woo Sung said to dye your hair.

464
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,190
He said he doesn't like your white hair.

465
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:34,330
He already has white hairs of his own.

466
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:37,710
Now a days, when I tease him saying that "he has grown up,"

467
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,900
he is dying from annoyance.

468
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:43,990
You know, since he was young he had a trauma about his height.

469
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:47,220
I...

470
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,960
I'm getting better with Woo Sung.

471
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,750
So, you don't have to worry.

472
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,710
Let's put it on.

473
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:03,460
Wait a minute.

474
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,020
Theres two minutes left.

475
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,690
Bring the oxygen tank, I'm going in.

476
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:04,030
Woo Sung took the last one.

477
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,210
You didn't recharge them?!

478
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:08,190
The recharger broke.

479
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,870
I'm about to go crazy.

480
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,290
Did they release the pump?

481
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,080
Yes.

482
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,530
As you know, the streets are not the best...

483
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:19,180
I'm sorry, but can you go out.

484
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:22,220
Yes, I got you. It seems like we're in their way, open the door.

485
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,830
If there's anything you need, let me know!

486
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:56,520
The signal came.

487
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,100
Pull!!

488
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,270
They must have gotten stuck on something, pull harder!

489
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:07,360
They must be stuck!

490
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:42,970
Pull harder! Harder!!

491
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,250
Just a bit more, pull harder!

492
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:03,130
It's coming, coming.

493
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:07,330
I see it.

494
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,290
Hold it.

495
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,400
Chief!! Come to your senses.

496
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,690
I don't see Woo Sung.

497
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:26,910
- Woo Sung!! 
- Chief!!

498
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,830
Woo Sung!!

499
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:32,070
Hey, Lee Woo Sung!!

500
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:58,500
Who is it?

501
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,720
Chief Choi!!

502
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,950
Chief Choi, what happened?

503
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:05,400
- The water is coming out 
- Not only that he's alive!

504
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,070
Hey, Chief Choi!

505
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,980
Hey, Chief Choi! Chief Choi!

506
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:13,210
Please, stop it!!

507
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,530
Hey! Where is Woo Sung? Call 911!

508
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,000
Yes.

509
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,530
His heart is okay.

510
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,630
He's breathing!

511
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:25,350
He's breathing!

512
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:29,470
Chief. Chief.

513
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:33,100
Chief, chief, chief.

514
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,690
Hey, he's alive! He lived!

515
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,810
Chief Choi. Wow.

516
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:41,180
Our Chief Choi,

517
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,950
he is not a person! He is a hero!

518
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:46,390
He saved South Korea's economy!

519
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:49,610
Chief Choi! Chief Choi rescued us!

520
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:51,780
Where is Woo Sung?

521
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,660
Woo Sung?

522
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,080
He didn't come out?
-I mean,

523
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,610
someone else went in beside you?

524
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,940
You can't right now, Chief.

525
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,140
I've to go in and get Woo Sung.

526
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,920
I said bring the oxygen tank.

527
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:08,560
Get it together, Chief!

528
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,020
Woo Sung...

529
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:18,070
They are all not recharged, Chief!

530
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:21,260
- What did you say?! 
 - These all don't have oxygen and

531
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,740
the water current in there is too strong!

532
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,300
Hey, you!

533
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,680
Your little brother is dying; what are you doing here?

534
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,910
I'm sorry.

535
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:36,340
Come to your senses, please!!

536
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,790
I'm going to kill whoever is trying to block me! You got it?!

537
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:42,940
Please!! Please!! Hyung!!

538
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:46,100
Hey!! Stop it, please!!

539
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:53,060
Die! Die!

540
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,240
Woo Sung is in there!

541
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,250
He can be alive! He's in there!

542
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,260
- Chief!
- Woo Sung!!

543
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:08,240
Woo Sung!!

544
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:14,590
I sincerely apologize.

545
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:18,380
The nation will never forget

546
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,620
the firefighter's sacrifice.

547
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:33,060
Prime Minister!

548
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,380
 Look here!! 

549
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,760
Hold on...

550
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:44,050
- You knew it, right?
- I'm sorry.

551
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:46,560
You said you won't forget the sacrifices.

552
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,680
Right? You said you won't forget the sacrifices.

553
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,690
- So you knew it, right?
- Sorry.

554
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:56,610
What are you going to do about us?

555
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:58,510
What are you going to do about us?

556
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:01,420
Save him! Save Woo Sung!

557
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:05,730
You have a lot of money and connections! So save him!

558
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:09,360
You guys, you think just because you order us around,

559
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,090
we need to go and die?!

560
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:15,660
Are we not humans? He came to save me!

561
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:18,760
We didn't know the situation and went it!

562
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:22,040
Why are you so cruel to us?!

563
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,300
Save him please!

564
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,160
Hey, Let me go! Hey!

565
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,280
I'm sorry for hitting you...

566
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,990
Please, just give an order and

567
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:33,760
just rescue him.

568
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,850
Give us the resources!

569
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:38,440
-I'm sorry.

570
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,370
Don't say you're just sorry...

571
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,230
We're human!

572
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:47,580
We're human and we've to live.

573
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:01,350
Let's see... You look okay.

574
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:04,990
After 5 minutes, I'll wash your hair for you.

575
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:06,720
There nothing uncomfortable, right?

576
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:21,350
Why didn't you tell me that someone other than Chief Choi went in?

577
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,920
I'm hearing it for the first time, too.

578
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,880
Why didn't the rescue team come out?

579
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,360
I canceled it because Captain Choi came out without harm.

580
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:36,410
After the water comes out, send out the electrical team and all the other teams needed.

581
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:39,610
Yes, we will carry it out flawlessly.

582
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:41,130
Secretary Song,

583
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,530
there is another white shirt in the car, right?

584
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:45,350
Yes.

585
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,750
I'll do it.

586
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:11,170
Hey, it doesn't matter who does it.

587
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,410
You father's condition has improved a lot.

588
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:20,300
Chief Kang does surgery really well.

589
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:24,050
When she came out of the surgery department, they begged her to stay

590
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:26,010
saying that she was a genius.

591
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:30,310
Even through that, she came to the emergency... You didn't know that did you?

592
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:37,210
Jung Ddol Mi, don't be mad anymore.

593
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:43,670
I'll take care of him until he's all better.

594
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:47,190
So, don't take a sick patient to Busan.

595
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:50,830
When he is recovered, he can finish his volunteer service and

596
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:53,310
you can also show him around Seoul.

597
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:57,060
Hey, Jung Ddol Mi. Seriously.

598
00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:02,480
Dr. Lee. You should go out and see.

599
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,190
Why? Is it a patient?

600
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:06,340
Not a patient, but

601
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:09,310
I think you should go and see for yourself quickly.

602
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:20,940
Lee Hae Sung!

603
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,570
Where are you going to go? Just wait.

604
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:25,820
There will be some kind of communication!

605
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:27,300
You aren't in a good condition.

606
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,290
They said it was Woo Sung.

607
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:31,780
Woo Sung is dead.

608
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,230
Do you believe it?

609
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:35,780
You believe that and tell me to stay still?

610
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,210
Bad person.

611
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:41,070
I told him that he can't get hurt until mom gets better.

612
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,140
I said he has to be fine till then.

613
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:45,980
Let go!

614
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:16,730
Captain Choi is fine.  He is back out into the scene.

615
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,310
It isn't true, right?

616
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:29,190
My younger brother, Woo Sung.

617
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:32,590
It isn't true, right?

618
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:34,550
I'm so sorry.

619
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,350
It's true?

620
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:44,310
How did it happen? All of a sudden?

621
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:47,650
The pipeline was filled with Han River water so

622
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:49,230
while going in...

623
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,840
If you wait here for a bit,

624
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:56,220
the water is almost gone...

625
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,840
They went to look for Woo Sung.

626
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,190
No.

627
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:03,660
Woo Sung... Our Woo Sung won't die.

628
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:07,840
He promised me. Until mom is all better,

629
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,080
he won't get hurt.

630
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:13,730
Where is our Woo Sung?

631
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:16,100
Where is he I asked?!!

632
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:18,710
- Woo Sung!!
- No, Doctor.

633
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:22,640
- No, Doctor.
- Woo Sung!!
- You've to wait here.

634
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,070
Please.

635
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,480
That...

636
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,260
I...

637
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:35,150
I might be able to help.

638
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:38,210
You don't know but he might be breathing.

639
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:43,280
Please, Doctor, stay here until they come out.

640
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:47,740
Woo Sung said, when he remembered,

641
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:50,300
he said it was so cold so it was really hard.

642
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:55,570
He wanted to go to Seoul so bad.

643
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,490
Thats why he said he wasn't cold and

644
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:01,480
that's why he liked it.

645
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,610
Our Woo Sung...

646
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:05,650
 I'm so sorry. 

647
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:07,200
 I'm really sorry. 

648
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,040
Hey, forget about being sorry.

649
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,080
I.. I'm a doctor.

650
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:16,840
I... might be able to help.

651
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,090
Bring me our Woo Sung, quickly!!

652
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:21,030
Our Woo Sung!!

653
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,420
Are you okay?

654
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:01,350
Dr. Lee, will he be okay?

655
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:07,960
I said a lot of harsh words to him.

656
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:15,240
That he was saving a patient he has never met before.

657
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,110
That he didn't even do surgery on my father.

658
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:25,420
I blamed him for my father almost dying on the operation table.

659
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,720
I said I hated him.

660
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,990
But if his brother becomes like that...

661
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:41,770
He will understand.

662
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:48,360
I feel so bad.

663
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:52,330
I'm sorry, what should I do?

664
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:57,430
How can this happen?

665
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:01,450
Rather than the corpse, the money comes first.

666
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:05,800
How can the government be so quick in that aspect?

667
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:11,520
Doctor Lee must be suffering.

668
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,490
Chief Kang, console him.

669
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:17,100
Yes.

670
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,950
The body isn't out yet.

671
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:25,190
I believe it's right to carry out the funeral at the hospital.

672
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:26,700
Why?

673
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:29,080
Excuse me?

674
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:32,600
Doctor Lee is not even an employee here

675
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,670
and there are more than a thousand funerals out there.

676
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:39,310
You know the hospital can't do anything to help him right now.

677
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:42,550
But he is a firefighter who died in action.

678
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:46,400
Doctor Lee is a companion who has been with us through this disaster.

679
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:49,980
Isn't it our job as a friend and citizen

680
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:53,650
to show some sympathy in that respect?

681
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:58,770
I'm sure the firefighter headquarters will provide the location for the funeral.

682
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:02,330
If we volunteer as the location and all the firefighters come here,

683
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:07,340
wouldn't it be a problem with the capacity of the hospital despite all the patients and guardians here?

684
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:09,990
Let's just give him some money.

685
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:11,950
Chief Kang.

686
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,310
 This rascal really grew up a lot. 

687
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:25,080
 Ah, seriously...do you want to die?! 

688
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:30,940
 Shouldn't we tell her how well we lived while she was sleeping?    

689
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:34,130
 I'll worry about other people, so 

690
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:37,490
 can't you just think about our mother? 

691
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,910
Woo Sung,

692
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:05,810
it's hyung.

693
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:16,690
Woo Sung.

694
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:23,110
 Woo Sung, 

695
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,770
 it's hyung. 

696
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:33,040
Woo Sung.

697
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,830
Woo Sung!!

698
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:56,090
 Woo Sung.... 

699
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:02,780
 Open your eyes, huh? 

700
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:05,240
Really? Is the electricity on in Yeoiido?

701
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,140
Yes, after we work on it a bit more,

702
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,580
the entire nation may be able

703
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:12,220
to have electricity. That means the banks will be open?

704
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:14,140
That is correct!

705
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,480
Everyone. Seoul, no, Korea has been saved from dying.

706
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:23,610
Good job! South Korea's economy survived from a critical fall.

707
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:30,520
Good job everyone! Good job!

708
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:47,700
Father!

709
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,580
Are you awake?

710
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:51,550
Do you know where you are?

711
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:56,940
I...

712
00:56:57,570 --> 00:56:59,240
I got hurt, right?

713
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:02,580
Yeah, you almost died!

714
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:05,410
Do you know how scared I was?

715
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:11,420
Your father won't die that easily.

716
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:14,770
Even if I caught a deadly disease,

717
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:17,350
I survived, right?

718
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:23,430
But where is long legs?

719
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:24,500
Huh?

720
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,420
Long legs!

721
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:28,530
That tall Doctor.

722
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:31,470
I don't see him.

723
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,610
Why?

724
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:37,540
Did he go somewhere?

725
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:40,870
I don't think I can see his face

726
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:42,400
because I'm sorry.

727
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:47,220
Ddol Mi, why?

728
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,290
Why are you like this?

729
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:56,790
I want to just die.

730
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,020
Excuse me.

731
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:33,850
Did you not know there would be a strong current when the base pump was opened?

732
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:36,090
No one told you that?

733
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,120
Thank you.

734
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:48,130
Until I die,

735
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:52,370
I won't be able to look at a Yeouido lamp post properly.

736
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,300
It's cold, right?

737
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:22,950
I'll make you not cold.

738
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:31,430
  ♫ The night that has fallen today ♫ 

739
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:39,200
 ♫ Just from that day's load ♫ 

740
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:46,220
 ♫ Tears are dropping ♫ 

741
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:55,090
 ♫ In the place love as stopped, I will be there ♫ 

742
00:59:55,090 --> 01:00:01,500
 ♫ I will not give up and trust you ♫ 

743
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:08,210
 ♫ In the darkness, you will shine brighter ♫ 

744
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:13,830
 ♫ When the day we dream come ♫ 

745
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:19,820
 ♫ Like a miracle, when that day becomes ♫ 

746
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:24,990
 ♫ The entire world will shine ♫ 

747
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:33,500


748
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:36,820
 Still, because of the pipeline 

749
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:39,710
 Seoul was able to re-establish all electricity. 

750
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:42,930
 If Woo Sung had made the right choice, that is enough for us. 

751
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,880
 Doctor Lee may have his license revoked. 

752
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,080
 Due to unauthorized actions, Doctor Lee's license revoking... 

753
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,080
 Doctor Han, you're here? 

754
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:52,130
 Lee Hae Sung, leave him alone. He saved me. 

755
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:55,120
 Due to the last accident, he is not in a stable mind. 

756
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,490
 Chairman, this isn't right!! 

757
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:58,920
 Doctor Han, you went over to Doctor Lee's boat. 

758
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:01,370
 You will have to live with the guilt of revoking Doctor Lee's license. 

759
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:04,990
 You are the one who tried to stop me when I tried to expose everything. 

760
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:07,690
 The "for" votes are 11 and the "against" votes are 7. 

761
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:13,010
 By this, I announce Doctor Lee's license has be revoked.
