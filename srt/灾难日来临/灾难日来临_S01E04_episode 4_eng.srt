1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,790
 License number 1353985, I'm a bomb squad member. 

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,770
 With aortic hemorrhage, mortality rate is 90%. 

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,020
 The survival rate is 10%. 

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,570
 Now it's 9%, because you wasted time. 

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:18,130
 Did you say the patient is a bomb? To me, the bomb is you, Dr. Lee Hae Sung. 

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,840
 A person's life may be in danger. 

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,370
 Can you really blame me for wanting to focus on patients that I can give better treatment to? 

8
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:32,200
 Come to the OR (operating room) no matter what. We have to definitely return this patient to his relatives embrace. 

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,480
 So, the patient Lee Hae-sung operated on..
- Do you know who the patient you sent away is? Minister Seok Jung Won! 

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:43,260
 It's over!  The robot center, the emergency medical center, everything is over! 

11
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,130
 What kind of large rainbow is that? 

12
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,770
 I'm telling you that it may collapse today! 

13
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,750
 The patients must be returning to the hospital. 

14
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,780
 Doctor Lee! 

15
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,140
 Stop! 

16
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,600
 You can't!! 

17
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,940
 Come out quickly! 

18
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,120
 Aish!! 

19
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,000
 You can't! 

20
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,870
 Dr. Lee... 

21
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:56,360

22
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,830
Are you okay there?

23
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,120
You're alive, right?

24
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,200
You have to be alive!

25
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,170
Anyone there? Do you hear me?

26
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,020
I saw you!  I see you!  Just a moment!

27
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,070
I'll hurry and save you.

28
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,130
Just a moment.

29
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,150
There's a person under there. Please come and lift this.

30
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,290
Let's do this together.

31
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,700
Okay, one, two!!

32
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,630
Three!!

33
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,600
Stop!

34
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,770
Dig into the ground here for me.

35
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,180
Into concrete with bare hands?

36
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,360
We... We have to do something!

37
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,400
I'm telling you, I saw it. There is a person under there.

38
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,060
A person who was with us until just a little while ago.

39
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,380
I know, but it's impossible with just our strength— 
- Under here!

40
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,650
There is a person, I'm telling you.

41
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,580
A person who was living until just a little while ago.

42
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,090
Wake up!

43
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:11,410
Is a patient who might be dead when retrieved, important?

44
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,890
What if my Seong Mi and the twins die while retrieving this person?

45
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,220
Dr. Lee, the mother's condition is really bad!

46
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:25,500
Please help me. We have to get him out together.

47
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,710
Quickly!

48
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:30,170
Pull yourself together!

49
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:39,360
The twins and the other patients, are you going to kill them all again after barely bringing them back to life?

50
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,470
Didn't you say to give up the worst and minimum cases!

51
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,410
Even if the heart hurts,

52
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,520
there is nothing we can do.

53
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:59,560
My babies, haven't seen their mother's face yet.

54
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,510
I'm begging you.

55
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:56,630
 

56
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,440
Save him, please save him!

57
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,150
Save him, please save him!

58
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,550
I don't know, mister.  
- Ok, ok.

59
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,850
My baby is in there.

60
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,490
I'm begging you—  
 - Ok, we'll rescue him.

61
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,490
Ki Woong! 
 -  Yes, sir.

62
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,120
You two go help Ki Woong.

63
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,080
Mister, mister, please—

64
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,000
Do you have a grandson in there? Grandson?

65
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,500
I'm begging you—
  - Don't worry, we'll rescue him.

66
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,740
Stay away, it's dangerous.

67
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:46,070
What?
 - The main door is down and out.

68
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,720
Come out, come out.

69
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,520
Woo Sung, come here by the entrance.

70
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,530
Aigoo.

71
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,330
Hey, Ki Woong, is it ok?

72
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,250
Ok, we found him!

73
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,670
They found him!

74
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:13,070
My baby!  My baby!

75
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,840
Aigoo, my baby!

76
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,350
Is that him?

77
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,900
Oh you're alive, Sarang (Love)! My baby!

78
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,870
Sarang, my baby!

79
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,820
Sarang!  Sarang!

80
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,310
Aigoo, thank you! Thank you.

81
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:31,920
Are you okay, my Sarang!

82
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,830
The name is really pretty, "My Sarang (Love.)"

83
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,980
I'm going to go crazy.

84
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,100
When is the heavy equipment coming? The roads have to be cleared for us to get going.

85
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,030
How are we going to rescue anyone without equipment, over.

86
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,910
 The heavy equipment is being sent to the subway first. 

87
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,740
 If it's really urgent, then contact them... 
- The lines are down.

88
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,490
How am I supposed to contact them? If city hall had a transceiver, I would've contacted them long ago!

89
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,570
 That's just how it is, over. 
- Alright, alright.

90
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,760
The patients. What are we going to do with patients? We're near Hangang Mirae Hospital right now, should we bring them there?

91
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,030
 I heard it collapsed. 

92
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,700
What? Hangang Mirae collapsed? 
 - Yes. 

93
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,220
 Move them to Hanseo University Hospital or Mirae Hospital, over. 

94
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,060
This UHF has not much battery left. The fire station was destroyed, I have no place to charge.

95
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,750
Tell me where to charge, I need to charge.

96
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,390
Please stay in the area where you're able to use electricity. And keep the communication line open, over.

97
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:40,840
Hey, are you kidding me right now? Everywhere—

98
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,400
Hello? Headquarters? Hello?

99
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,260
Damn it!

100
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:04,130

101
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,660
One, two three!

102
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,990
Try it one more time.

103
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,760
Wait.

104
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:23,170
Baby son, now we're going.

105
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,120
Be strong.

106
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,120
Is there enough fuel?

107
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,660
Wait. Was the fuel gauge right?

108
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,800
Why?
- The needle is on two.

109
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,880
With this much, I don't know how far we will reach as I'm not a sailor.

110
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,980
So you're saying that, it might stop in the middle?

111
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,120
I'm not sure...

112
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:02,710
Let's just go as far as we can.

113
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,660
Please drink this.

114
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,990
You have to eat, too, even if you're not hungry.

115
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,540
Thank you, Doctor.

116
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,100
You're welcome.

117
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,820
I'm more thankful that you let us help you with the baby.

118
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,620
Well, I'm not giving this because you're good.

119
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,060
What are you looking at?

120
00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:00,180
This... This is Seoul?

121
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:06,080
I can't believe my own eyes! Why did this happen...?

122
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:12,790
We need to convene a committee to take the appropriate measures for national safety, Mr. President.

123
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:16,810
Use whatever method to contact Congressman Goo Ja Hyuk.

124
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,010
Yes, sir.

125
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,630
Jung Ddol Mi.

126
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:58,360
The hot packs have gotten so cold, I couldn't tell whether it really was hot packs or cold packs.

127
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,280
Seems we can use this method as well.

128
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,680
Since we can now use the electricity of this boat.

129
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,340
You guys, must live.

130
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,160
Ah, if we can just go out of Seoul in this.

131
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,040
Can't we go to Incheon or somewhere else?

132
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,790
Can't we?

133
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,210
How far can we go?

134
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:25,270
Huh? Tell me the truth.

135
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:32,180
Soon, we have to get off.

136
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,390
Until when do we have to wait!

137
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,830
Oh, why can't I sleep?

138
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:49,530
Sir, this way! This way!

139
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:55,240
Oh, our hospital is not a hospital that gives birth...

140
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,360
I don't have a doctor specializing in obstetrics and gynecology .

141
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,190
You should go to the University Hospital of Obstetrics and Gynecology nearby.

142
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:05,690
Does that make sense? There are 3000 cases of robotic surgery achieved , CT, MRI,

143
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:10,700
and you guys have been bragging about the high-tech facilities, and now you can't even give birth?

144
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:16,160
It's because we're specialized in other parts.

145
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,780
My stomach hurts! They'll soon come out!

146
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:23,250
Aigoo, no. Even if the contractions come with one minute intervals, the baby won't come out that fast.

147
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,220
I'll have to move fast.

148
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,120
Doctor!

149
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,000
Do you think we didn't try? The bridge broke, so we can't go!

150
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,120
So what? We've never given birth, and there's no blood left in the hospital!

151
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,270
Would you do this if it was your wife?

152
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,930
Who told your kid to be like that in this timing? It's  fate, and why are you messing with me?
-Are you even a doctor?

153
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,700
A guy like you needs to die in my hands! 
- What are you saying?

154
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,060
I don't even know what happened to my house and my wife...

155
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,300
You're dead!

156
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,670
Let go!

157
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,790
CT, MRI, all the sensitive things are not working.

158
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:02,230
It's a relief that this ultrasound works at least.

159
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:05,550
I don't see any active bleeding though.

160
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:09,270
There's not much fluid collection behind the liver either, right? Vitals?

161
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:13,070
Vitals look good. The spleen is okay, the kidney as well.

162
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,830
Let's do an ultrasound follow up. It can heal by itself.

163
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:18,420
Yes, I'll observe the ultrasound.

164
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,190
Oh, Doctor!

165
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,380
How many times has it been?

166
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:33,010
Didn't you see how I've already arranged it alphabetically!

167
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,270
I'm sorry.

168
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:40,900
I'll take care of this one, so go to the linen room and bring me clean sheets and blankets.

169
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,370
We're running out of them.

170
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,280
Isn't that the housekeepers...

171
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,770
We're all busy!

172
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,420
Yes.

173
00:21:56,630 --> 00:22:00,190
What's the matter with the charts? There's no need to yell about it...

174
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,000
Her personality...

175
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,250
Am I a housekeeper?

176
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:07,450
Why does an intern have to do all the work?

177
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:10,060
Oh, really. Aigoo.

178
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,630
Ah.

179
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:17,100
You shouldn't build the stress up.

180
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,750
Oh..

181
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,760
Thanks.

182
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:30,040
For your psychological health, you should release it all. Well, I came here with a similar purpose.

183
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,800
Doctor, you were also asked to bring some blankets?

184
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,090
Wow, really funny.

185
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:38,220
No, I came to get the dressing.

186
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,470
It's the same.

187
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:46,440
I'm thankful for being told to do so. I don't have much to do as a psychiatrist, anyway.

188
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,630
Then you should go home. Aren't you worried?

189
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:54,900
Of course, I am. I'm worried about my mom.

190
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,230
It's Amsadong, and how long will it take on foot?

191
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:01,430
Amsadong? It's far.

192
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:05,030
Right? It's better not to go?

193
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:09,770
If she'd know I'd be walking a dangerous route, my mother would be very concerned.

194
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:15,270
The hospital must be better. At least, water and electricity works here.

195
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,800
Should I help you?

196
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,650
Yes.

197
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,560
 Help me, please! 

198
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,300
 Help me! Over here, here! 

199
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,980
 Help me! Please! Here, here! 

200
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,670
Doctor!

201
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,820
Are you okay?

202
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,680
What a sight of the Han River.

203
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:16,270
The Han River I know is when the National Anthem plays, kites are flying by the bank,

204
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,870
people doing fireworks like that.

205
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:24,080
But this....is just like the broken Han River bridge in the Korean War.

206
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,530
Forget this Han River.

207
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:29,470
I'm not sure if I could.

208
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,790
But...

209
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:36,810
Can we take all these people to Hanseo University Hospital?

210
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,410
Impossible.

211
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,850
Then?

212
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,290
We're going to Mirae Hospital.

213
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,420
It seems though that hospital doesn't have incubators either.

214
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:50,630
They're seismic designed and have power generators, too. So they should have electricity back up by now.

215
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:53,070
Then, we can make it worth somehow.

216
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:57,380
I heard they have the best equipment there..

217
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:03,730
For now, we don't have any choice but go to the nearest hospital.

218
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,260
Dr. Lee! Look here!

219
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,060
I think the twin's mom isn't doing well.

220
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:30,270
It's shock from venous hemorrhage, add more drips.

221
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,610
None...

222
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,580
We've run out of them?

223
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,150
What do we actually have then?!!

224
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,180
What do you want me to do?

225
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,380
Aish!!

226
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,880
Do what?

227
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,980
What do you want me to do?

228
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,730
You left us with nothing, huh?

229
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:31,750
These people, do you want to see them die in the street?

230
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,690
Right?!!

231
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,830
Dr. Lee,

232
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,820
you said you believed in me.

233
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:14,010
That's why you continued working back in Hangang Mirae Hospital, right?

234
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,980
I've been going on this road, trusting you.

235
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,680
We all do.

236
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,460
Don't be shaken.

237
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,830
I want to continue believing you.

238
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:00,040
Minister of Public Safety and Security, please speak up.

239
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,620
Isn't disaster mitigation your job?

240
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:06,460
Um, we never expected a calamity to this degree.

241
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:09,850
Ah, we'll gradually give you a written report.

242
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,650
Minister of Land and Infrastructure, what do you think?

243
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,680
Oh yes, that...

244
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,800
Based on law, even seismic designs are 
only able to withstand magnitude 4.

245
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,730
This magnitude 6.5 also far exceeded our expectations.

246
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:27,990
Right now, relief operations for the victims is more important than building structure.

247
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,490
That's why the Ministry of Health and Welfare should step in and...

248
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,670
Our minister is not here right now.

249
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:34,950
That's why we think the Minister of Public Safety should take...

250
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,630
Please!!

251
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,740
Please! Stop tossing the responsibility to each other!

252
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,270
Don't you have a manual for this?

253
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,760
Why are you all always so lost every time an incident happens?

254
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,080
Why does it keep repeating?

255
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,660
The country will be ruined if I just wait for you all to show me the way.

256
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,620
We will open a hotline.

257
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,540
Bring him inside.

258
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:11,270
Goo Ja Hyuk is just newly elected though... How great..

259
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,690
He doesn't even have much experien—

260
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:16,480
Four public hearings on earthquake related matters, 14 policy proposals,

261
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,820
8 legislative proposals.

262
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:22,010
Isn't he the closest to being an expert among you all?

263
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,260
To those who are actually experts, I apologize.

264
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:29,270
From now on, I specially appoint Goo Ja Hyuk as the chief in charge.

265
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:36,530
Now, let's all listen to what Special Chief Goo Ja Hyuk has to say.

266
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:47,630
I will now issue my first order as special chief.

267
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:53,440
The subject is related to mobilization of all medical personnel in Yeonggwang District.

268
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,080
Ah, another headache comes.

269
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,030
I'm sorry, but

270
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,710
we can't accept any patients.

271
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:49,550
Go to the emergency room and wait for the doctor.

272
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:52,610
Time is precious for these patients, Chief.

273
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,040
Aigoo, please go through the emergency room.

274
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,580
It's the hospital's policy.

275
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:06,310
Why is the hospital being closed down?

276
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,710
That... We don't have staff.

277
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:12,230
We don't have available rooms anymore, too. How are we supposed to open?

278
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,970
But still, how can the hospital...

279
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:17,220
The director is inside, right?

280
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,640
What? He came alone?

281
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,780
No, he brought along so many people.

282
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:28,230
Manager Park, listen carefully.

283
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:32,340
That man on the bed,

284
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,150
we will receive that patient only.

285
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,500
Yes.

286
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,550
Take that patient,

287
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,560
then block the hospital again.

288
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:47,740

289
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:08,840
 Director, I heard you aren't receiving any patients? 

290
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,230
How can we receive patients if the hospital isn't functioning?

291
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:16,180
I'll receive that man.

292
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:19,010
Then are you saying other patients should die on the street?

293
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,460
Go find another hospital!

294
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,190
We can't accept any more patients.

295
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,220
Hangang Mirae Hospital has been destroyed.

296
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,160
Do you think there are many hospitals in Seoul that remained intact?

297
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,280
Let the public hospitals take care of it.

298
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,300
We're a private hospital.

299
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,430
There is no reason why we should.

300
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,790
Director,

301
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,790
the hospital, we should open it.

302
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,780
Are you okay?

303
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:50,700
It's an earthquake of magnitude 6.5,

304
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:55,010
the hospital must be open.

305
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:58,750
Chief Kang, let's talk somewhere else first.

306
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,190
That patient, transfer him to a ICU quickly.

307
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:04,990
Manager Jung, don't let any of the people here move even one step.

308
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,380
Yes.

309
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,860
Quickly, move!

310
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,380
An earthquake of magnitude 6.5 just hit Seoul.

311
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,360
It's big enough to paralyze the country.

312
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,370
It's a disaster.

313
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:24,390
The buildings that remained intact

314
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:29,460
are even less than those that collapsed.

315
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:37,240
Then it's all the more reason we can't open.

316
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,930
Mirae Hospital can't do anything against a disaster of national level.

317
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:48,300
The hospital's reputation already hit rock bottom since the news of rejecting a patient came out.

318
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,290
If you reject patients from the disaster this time, too,

319
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:55,580
the media will only throw more provocative headlines about how we ignored the victims of the disaster.

320
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:59,010
So?

321
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:02,680
For now, the patients walked themselves here. But soon, rescue teams will start bringing in the critical patients.

322
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,570
In order to respond then, the hospital rooms must be vacated.

323
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,530
What do you mean by that?

324
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:10,890
Just to accept patients we aren't even sure would survive,

325
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:13,870
you'll send off our existing patients out in the streets?

326
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:15,830
How will you ensure their safety?

327
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:19,490
We only have to send off those who are just waiting for tests, and those who are scheduled for discharge.

328
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,210
If that's not enough, cancer patients

329
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,240
and those in internal medicine department will be discharged.

330
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,400
Ah, it doesn't even make sense so, stop it already!

331
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,470
We have to judge the situation rationally!

332
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:32,360
Please stop.

333
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,830
Is this a time to have specious talks?

334
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:37,710
Let's talk about the reality.

335
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,080
CT, MRI aren't working.

336
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,500
Our staff here now aren't even 10% of our usual number.

337
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,630
We don't even have blood in stock since it's the weekend.

338
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:48,340
We don't even have anything, how will we provide the best treatment?

339
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,550
The patients in and outside of our hospital,

340
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:53,230
they'll just be put in even more danger.

341
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,840
We can't handle them.

342
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:02,350
If we close it down now, the Mirae Hospital that we built so far will be ruined.

343
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,150
Was it built from the emergency room?

344
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:09,150
It's the cancer center and spine center that made Mirae Hospital the way it is now.

345
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,440
If we discharge those patients now, they won't just leave the matter alone.

346
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:17,370
Existing patients' complaints and lawsuits, also, those trauma patients' lawsuits.

347
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:19,460
These will cause problems to the hospital's survival.

348
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:23,120
Wait a second, wait a second, wait.

349
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,240
Director, we should close the hospital.

350
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,360
We should keep it open.

351
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,720
Let's do it cautiously.

352
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,120
Excuse me? Excuse me?

353
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,730
Just a little so that the media will have nothing to say.

354
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:08,710
I don't care about who you are, mister.

355
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:11,790
You must live.

356
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,320
The patient who held the ambu for you,

357
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,900
you must not forget him.

358
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,010
Even if it's just on his behalf,

359
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,500
you must live on.

360
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,810
Please sign and return it.

361
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:39,800
Due to this being a limited emergency first aid in a situation of disaster.

362
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,720
No matter what result this brings to the patient,

363
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,530
Mirae will not be held liable in any way.

364
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:49,400
Without the agreement of the patient or guardian to these terms,

365
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,520
the hospital has the right to refuse providing treatment.

366
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,050
Read it carefully then just sign at the bottom.

367
00:36:56,050 --> 00:37:00,520
Chief Kang and Professor Han should also comply with it.

368
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,930
Without principles, the system will fall. Then the hospital will also collapse.

369
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:07,140
Okay.

370
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:11,110
Unconscious patients who came alone on stretchers

371
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,980
will die.

372
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,860
They won't even get to see any doctor.

373
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:19,550
Even if there's a law for emergency treatments,

374
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:23,720
when lawsuits come along, the hospital will have no way out so they're avoiding it.

375
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:48,550
Ah, Doctor Lee Hae Sung.

376
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:52,040
Doctor Lee Hae Sung don't need to sign.

377
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:57,320
Everyone here don't need to sign.

378
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:02,130
Mirae Hospital can't accept you all.

379
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,780
This doctor isn't from Mirae Hospital.

380
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:12,590
Whether the treatment Dr. Lee gave everyone is in accordance with Mirae Hospital's standards and policies,

381
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,980
we have no way of confirming it.

382
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:18,000
To ask Mirae Hospital to take responsibility,

383
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,750
when we don't even know the procedure he gave you,

384
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:23,590
the risk is too big.

385
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:28,450
Didn't even give any praise for saving these patients despite the risky road...

386
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,180
It's ridiculous.

387
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:34,820
Also, providing rooms for people in a coma,

388
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,960
it's difficult.

389
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,070
Also, two premature infants when we don't even have incubators!

390
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:45,260
Moreover, delivered by a doctor who's neither an obstetrician nor a gynecologist,

391
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,800
we're unable to bear the responsibility.

392
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,960
Director, it's an emergency. First, we should check-

393
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,750
You have plenty of energy to have been able to come here from Hangang Mirae, right?

394
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,340
Don't waste any time. Take them to a different hospital.

395
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,830
Help me, sir! It's been hard getting here.

396
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:05,410
She's a mother of twins who hasn't even been able to have seawood soup, we can't just let her die like this, please doctor!

397
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:08,000
There are many other hospitals you can go to save her.

398
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,330
I'll do anything you ask for!

399
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,880
Please!

400
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,330
Here, here.

401
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:14,960
Sir! You shouldn't be like this.

402
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,150
We've waited 7 years to have our babies. We've used all our strength just to get here!

403
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:20,870
Just until we regain our strength, please allow us to stay!

404
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,140
Let go!

405
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,470
We can't go! We have to stay!

406
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:27,980
I said stop!

407
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,780
Move faster!

408
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,920
Please proceed with utmost safety.

409
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,180
Please proceed with utmost safety!

410
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,900
Yes, yes.

411
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,740
Woo Sung, it'll collapse! Dodge!

412
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,520
Hey!

413
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:36,390
Come to your senses. What's wrong?

414
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:40,160
My mom...

415
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:44,130
I think my mom may have died.

416
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:45,910
What?

417
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,930
What are you doing right now?

418
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,470
Everyone here

419
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:16,820
trusted me and followed me here.

420
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:19,300
The mother already had hemorrhagic shock.

421
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:23,250
It was also hard to regulate the premature twin's body temperature.

422
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,860
If you don't take them in, they will all die.

423
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:31,670
Please just allow me to take care of my patients.

424
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:38,240
I will never go against your will anymore, so please..

425
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,480
It's not my will, it's this hospital's policy.

426
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:48,020
Director, there are too many lives that would not be protected.

427
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,170
If the patients are thrown out,

428
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:55,750
we don't have hope to live.

429
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:03,940
We don't have enough staff in the ER.

430
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:08,560
At Mirae Hospital, there is not a doctor that has as much clinical experience as Lee Hae Sung.

431
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,320
It will be a big source of strength.

432
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,240
It might also be an obstacle.

433
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,220
I'll take the responsibility.

434
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:18,870
He said it himself, too, he won't go against your will.

435
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:27,850
Too many people are watching.

436
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:31,580
If news goes out that we abandoned a mother with her newborns, it'll be a critical hit to us.

437
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:35,470
Might as well let Dr. Lee shoulder the responsibility in managing the patient.

438
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,390
I think this is the best possible way.

439
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:43,660
Since Chief Kang is requesting like this...

440
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:46,350
Let's take care of the mother.

441
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,810
Thank you! Thank you!

442
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:54,670
Ah, guardian and Dr. Lee, come see me for a bit.

443
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:57,450
General affairs chief, bring them along.

444
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:02,280
Ah, as you can see here,

445
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:06,720
the content is for any complications, impairment, or even death

446
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,330
that may occur to the mother and infants,

447
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:13,320
Mirae Hospital won't be held responsible.

448
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,190
Ok.

449
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:20,210
We don't have an incubator, or a chief of obstetrics.

450
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:23,180
We cannot do anything.

451
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,670
Yes. Let's do that. OK.

452
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:26,780
Manager Park.

453
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:28,450
Yes, Director.

454
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:30,300
Sign here please.

455
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,370
This is for you doctor.

456
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,980
It's a contract.

457
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:42,820
You will be responsible for anything that may occur to the patients you brought in,

458
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:48,090
not Mirae Hospital.

459
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,760
Dr. Lee,

460
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:04,160
the promise you made earlier,

461
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,190
please remember it.

462
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:24,400
It wasn't like you to get down on your knees like that.

463
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,900
I don't know what it means to be "like me." I just want to be like a doctor.

464
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,310
What?

465
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,950
As a doctor who can't do anything, if kneeling down can save them, it will feel less embarrassing for me.

466
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:43,150
To treat a patient like a bomb, turning them away or giving up on them,

467
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:45,060
is the only embarrassment for me.

468
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,910
So arrogant.

469
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:56,120
Are you getting mad because you know you were wrong?

470
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:59,740
I won't even bother with you.

471
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:03,640
I, too, made my decision based on what is best for my patients.

472
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,940
Stop already?

473
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,400
You worked hard, Dr. Lee.

474
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:15,590
I think you are the one who worked hard, Chief Kang.

475
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:22,410
You said repeating tragedy is pitiful. Weren't you researching something? Were you just saying it?

476
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:24,880
Are you venting your anger on me?

477
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,750
Well, I just want to see if hard times really do create heroes.

478
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:41,550
Wait for the Director. We have to have the meeting to talk about measures.

479
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,910
Dr. Lee. Dr. Lee Hae Sung!

480
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:51,040
Yes. Park Ji Na. Why?

481
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,350
Your mother, do you not worry about her?

482
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,840
Oh yeah, Mom.

483
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,890
Since both the hospital rooms and emergency room are full,

484
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:24,250
we will take care of her well, so let us take over. Cheer up.

485
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,520
Let me see your back. You must be hiding your wings somewhere.

486
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,310
Ah, stop with the lip service.

487
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:46,860
 Father! 

488
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,790
 Father! 

489
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:04,760
 Hae Sung! 

490
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:12,760
 Mom! 
- Hae Sung! 

491
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:15,380
 Mom! 

492
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:18,650
 Hae Sung! Hae Sung! 

493
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:23,830
 Hae Sung, it's me, your hyung. 
- Hyung, you do the surgery for my mom. You are the only one. 

494
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:32,070
 Yes, I'll try my best. No matter what, I'll try to save your mother. 

495
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:36,860
 Hae Sung, come to your senses! 

496
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:48,150
 Why isn't she waking up? 

497
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:54,060
 She will. 
 - It's been more than a month since the surgery. 

498
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:57,840
 Malpractice. Right? 

499
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:03,370
 You must reveal why mom is like this. Father- 

500
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:08,800
 There was no choice since the scene was like that when he died, but Mom... 

501
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,640
 reveal why she became like this at the hospital. 

502
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,330
 Hyung. 

503
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,550
 Oh, why? 

504
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:22,850
 I'm sorry that I made you suffer. 

505
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:26,630
 I'm the one who is sorry. 

506
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:30,980
 Mother, it would have been nice if she had recovered completely. 

507
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:34,030
 But... 

508
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:37,350
 I've something I want to ask you really badly. 

509
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:42,810
 Not as a surgeon or a guardian, but as a doctor to a doctor. 

510
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:45,830
 Ok. 

511
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:48,160
 While Mom was in the surgery room, 

512
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:51,170
 nothing went wrong, right? 

513
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:54,480
 What do you want me to tell you? 

514
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,570
 The truth. 

515
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,830
 Just as it is. 

516
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:02,470
 Without leaving anything out, the truth. 

517
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,500
 You heard the conference. 

518
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:09,210
 Do you not believe me? 

519
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:17,270
 No. I believe you. 

520
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,710
 If you say no then, it's a no. 

521
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:27,930
 I understand your feelings. I'm sorry. 

522
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:31,540
 Get some rest.Your face doesn't look good. 

523
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:52,220
Mom, stay here for a bit.

524
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:54,390
I'll go and save people.

525
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:08,900
Director, there's nothing to worry about.

526
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,700
We have to close it now.

527
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:15,180
How did the general affairs chief even manage the supplies for disaster relief?

528
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:18,580
No, at the last meeting Director said let's reduce the budget so...

529
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:21,450
Let's talk about countermeasures! Countermeasures!

530
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:26,220
As for measures, I think we should listen to the Emergency Room Director.

531
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:29,070
You have countermeasures, right?

532
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:32,490
No, you  should  have it.

533
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:42,690
My countermeasure is that we should more actively accept patients. 
- More actively?

534
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:46,110
If we accept more trauma patients than we have now,  the hospital will just be paralyzed faster.

535
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:50,110
If government support does not arrive, the hospital will stop working, anyway.

536
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:55,790
Until then, if we do everything that we can, Mirae Hospital will be recognized as an active hospital.

537
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:57,710
As for the issue of machine failure and blood shortage,

538
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:01,930
if we say the government support was late and there was nothing we could do.

539
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:04,150
The responsibility becomes the government's.

540
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:06,500
I'm talking about the problem of the patients.

541
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:09,100
Our existing patients who trusted and are hospitalized at Mirae Hospital.

542
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:12,920
Whether it's cancer or a spine disorder, you don't die in two days.

543
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:17,320
Despite the fact that everything was lacking in a dangerous situation, we did everything we could.

544
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:21,700
This is becoming calamity's hero.

545
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,930
Hero...

546
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:28,400
Two days...

547
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,720
Chief Kang, are you confident?

548
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:35,140
Not just confidence, will you be responsible?

549
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:36,760
Yes. I will be.

550
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,470
Chief Kang. 
 - But in return-

551
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:41,430
Responsibility is not something you speak of lightly.

552
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:43,480
In return?

553
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,850
Give me command of the hospital.

554
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:11,780
Sorry sir, you had to sign because of us...

555
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:15,480
Because I'm sorry and grateful, I don't know what to say.

556
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,300
Listen to me carefully.

557
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:21,350
You have to hurry and find some fuel. Fuel for the ship.

558
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:23,190
Fuel?

559
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:25,400
The twins...

560
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,080
have to go to where there is an incubator.

561
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:31,130
I understand.

562
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:43,330
I'll go out to find fuel.

563
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,860
Will you be okay?

564
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:50,020
It may be dangerous.

565
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:09,930
Hey, what are you doing? You're not going in?

566
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:11,660
Sister.

567
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:18,150
I'm unfamiliar with the hospital, too. If I stay here, I thought I'd be a hindrance, so

568
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:20,790
I thought to say farewell before I leave.

569
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:26,100
Me, too. I worry about my family so, I'm going...

570
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,570
I'm going, too.

571
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:31,480
You say that looking at how things are here?

572
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,220
Throw things aside and leave?

573
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:36,650
That's being a traitor.

574
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:38,530
Traitor.

575
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,160
 Mirae Hospital, 

576
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:47,890
 I'm the Earthquake Measure Committee's Chief, Kang Joo Ran. 

577
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:52,380
 From now on, Mirae is going into an emergency state. 

578
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:56,020
Starting now,

579
00:53:56,020 --> 00:54:02,470
 power will be shut down in all areas except for operating rooms, emergency rooms, and ICU. 

580
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:11,570
 The elevator will run only to the operating rooms. 

581
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:20,810
 This is to conserve the remaining electricity and prolong the life support system of critical patients. 

582
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:25,290
Ah, now we're in the primal ages.

583
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:27,210
Think of it as exercising.

584
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:29,590
Are you always this positive?

585
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:34,790
If not then? Spend your life with complaints? You're too young for that, Doctor An.

586
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:37,240
You are young, too.

587
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:48,260
Also, treatment for cancer and other internal disease patients who are able to walk will be discontinued immediately.

588
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:51,780
We will proceed to discharge.

589
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,170
In this chaos,

590
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:01,800
where are you asking us to go?

591
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,190
I can't. I won't go!

592
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:06,730
I'm a cancer patient! Cancer!

593
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:09,300
If the cancer spreads, will you take responsibility?

594
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:12,010
Cancer will not in one morning.

595
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:16,250
In order to save the more urgent patients, all doctors and nurses will have to focus on the critical patients.

596
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:19,170
If you can at least walk, leaving Seoul is

597
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:22,570
for grandfather here; and you too, it will be a much better choice.

598
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:26,410
Did you think I wouldn't know that you're lying just to drive me out?

599
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:28,380
I can't go out!

600
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:31,910
You guys don't have parents? Eh?

601
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:35,530
Professor Han, wait a second!

602
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:38,490
What are you doing without the permission of the doctors in charge?

603
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:41,700
Following Kang Joo Ran, the Emergency Measures Committee Head's commands. 
 - Does that make sense?

604
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,240
Does it make sense?

605
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,830
Because something that doesn't even make sense already happened in Seoul.

606
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:50,010
 Are you telling us to leave? I won't leave even if I die. 

607
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:52,730
 I'm sorry, Elder, but you've to go. 

608
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:56,440
Let go of me. 
- We've to help each other in these situations.

609
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,870
Who is going to help me?

610
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:03,420
Is chasing us out onto the streets helping?

611
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,040
I'll never leave!

612
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:10,200
No, I'm not leaving! 
- The hospital isn't taking responsibility? What is this?!

613
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:15,150
He's still unconscious! If you remove my husband's respirator, he will die!

614
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:18,600
You have to leave! 
- He's a critical patient! You have to do something! This can't be!

615
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:22,670
What are we supposed to do about the patients who can't move?!

616
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:25,970
What are we supposed to do?

617
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:31,840
Electricity has been cut off for all areas except the operating room, emergency room and ICU.

618
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,790
Patients with internal illness are being forced to discharge.

619
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:39,650
We made the decision to save those critical patients who can't even move!

620
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:41,630
Aish!!

621
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:46,180
We aren't saying we won't take responsibility!

622
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:48,970
We're saying that we won't give up until the end!

623
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:51,030
We doctors...

624
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:53,880
are promising we will save all the patients we can.

625
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:57,240
What should we do?

626
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:02,570
We will do our best.

627
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:04,720
Please trust us.

628
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,940
Sir.

629
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:17,460
Do you mean it?

630
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:19,400
Eh?

631
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:24,920
The promise that you won't give up, was it true?

632
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:28,930
I'm also a guardian.

633
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:33,080
So, I understand them well.

634
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:38,160
The guardians need a doctor telling them they won't give up.

635
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,560
The hospital situation is the worst.

636
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:46,120
There's not much treatment we can provide.

637
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:49,250
If you jump in recklessly,

638
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:52,270
your life as a doctor may even be in danger.

639
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:57,250
Are you worrying about me?

640
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:59,810
It's a warning.

641
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:02,350
Don't trust the patients too much.

642
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,800
Their eager hearts?

643
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:10,640
In just one breath, it can turn into rebuke. You know it well, too.

644
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:14,190
Professor Han.

645
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:17,090
I don't like it, but since it has already become like this,

646
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:21,610
I can at least have some expectations for you as a surgeon, right?

647
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:23,960
I'll do what I'm supposed to do.

648
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:31,120
I'm also looking forward to the emergency disaster countermeasure Chief Kang is in charge with.

649
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:41,380
What? You can't?

650
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:44,500
We can only look up the chart when the server is on.

651
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,580
Just reference these.

652
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:50,810
Oh, thanks.

653
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:58,280
Oh Mi Ja?

654
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,670
Yes?

655
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:08,220
Song Yoo Gun?
 - Lee Seon Taek?

656
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:11,290
Lee Mi Jeong?

657
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:12,940
 Lee Yoo Mi!
-Yes. 

658
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:16,500
This is Lee Seon Taek's. He had liver resection.

659
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:21,500
If the guardian just takes care of him, there won't be any issues.

660
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,540
We apologize once again.

661
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:08,470
I wish that everyone can return to their

662
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:11,360
families arms safely.

663
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:14,570
To a safer shelter.

664
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:17,630
Please be careful.

665
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:20,850
The hospital isn't throwing you out but

666
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:27,570
the hospital...

667
01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:33,290
This is the best we can do in the face of an earthquake.

668
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:36,870
Please understand us.

669
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:40,240
Please take care.

670
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:43,490
The hospital has to normalize.

671
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:48,940
We hope to be able to treat everyone again.

672
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:54,210
I hope that we will definitely

673
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:57,810
see each other again.

674
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:36,810


675
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:43,520
 We have to give up patients who need a lot of blood transfusions. 

676
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:47,560
 Aren't we in the middle of deliberating whether we can save the knees or not?
- Should we use a saw? 

677
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,950
 Hey! How can you just throw up here! 

678
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:52,020
 Step away from the building! 

679
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:55,400
 Do you think we came here just to watch you stand? You have to do something! Anything! 

680
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,050
 There's nothing we can do, please move him to another hospital. 

681
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:02,100
 If the hospital's like this, what kind of hope can we bring to rescue others? 
- Go on and rescue others! 

682
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:04,120
 We will decide whether to save or not! 

683
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,980
 Jung Ddol Mi, let's do surgery. 

684
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:10,750
 We don't have blood nor time! What do you even want to show to dead patients? 

685
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:15,220
 The power will go out soon. Your patient is about to die, anyway.
