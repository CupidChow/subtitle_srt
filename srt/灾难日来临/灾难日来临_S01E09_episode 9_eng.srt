1
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,180
 The fuel tanker might be late. 

2
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,040
 How long can we endure? 

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,040
 Half a day. 

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,910
 Patient Jung Eun Cheol seems to have a hemorrhage. 

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,470
 He went to do the surgery at a time like this? 

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,910
 Due to the recent aftershock, the pipe has burst. 

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,130
 One of the emergency generators is broken and the other one is filling up with water. 

8
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,370
 If the generator shuts down... 

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,200
 Episode 9 
 Hurry. Let's finish this quickly.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,520
We won't even know the vitals or the heartbeat. You want to do surgery like this?

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,960
Even when machines like these didn't exist, doctors were still doctors.

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,190
There were still doctors who saved people back then, too.

13
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,350
Why can't we?

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,020
That was a time where they did it even if the patient died.

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,090
- It's 30 minutes.
- They didn't even expect that they would save everyone. They didn't believe or anticipate it like we're doing now.

16
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:56,110
Exactly 30 minutes! The best we can do.

17
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,920
Even if you declare him dead,

18
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,450
after you leave this room, it's still not too late.

19
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:13,000
Fine. Since I promised, I'll lend you my hands until the end.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,600
It's a given I'll do my best.

21
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:22,960
But Lee Hae Sung, just remember how much you pushed it with this surgery.

22
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,640
And don't repeat it ever again.

23
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,960
Both of you watch carefully.

24
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,340
There will be no such thing...because the patient will live.

25
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,540
Circulation. See if you can get a monitor from another surgery room.

26
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,360
Anesthesiologist, at least try to manually keep the pulse and blood pressure stable.

27
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,640
Let's finish the surgery.

28
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,450
Yes.

29
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,240
Soon, the battery will run out.

30
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,530
For those patients who are using ventilators, switch it to ambu bags.

31
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,270
Check the charge on the defibrillators.

32
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,570
Excuse me, you two.

33
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,700
- Come here for  a minute.
- Yes, yes.

34
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,720
- You learned how to squeeze the ambu before, right?
- Yes.

35
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,740
Take care of these 2 people.

36
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:17,930
Now, 1,2,3,4, squeeze.

37
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,770
Yes, okay. You just have to do that.

38
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,290
He's okay, right? Nothing is wrong, right?

39
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:32,100
Yes. He is recovering and has even regained his health.

40
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,050
He regained consciousness?

41
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,630
Yes. The Director also stopped by.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,900
I see. It's different because it's the ICU. It's fast.

43
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,270
It's all thanks to Doctor Lee Hae Sung.

44
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,930
If he hadn't taught the guardian...

45
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,520
From now on, it's really the fight against time.

46
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,000
Fighting.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,660
Cut.

48
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,730
Let's move him to the ICU now.

49
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,660
You worked hard.

50
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,250
Doctor Han! Are you okay?

51
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,490
Why are you like that since before?

52
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,740
Oh, I'm just a little dizzy.

53
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:52,110
It seems like it's because of a lack of sleep. So, go rest.

54
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,340
I think I should.

55
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:07,410


56
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,280
  Diagnosis 

57
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,300
  Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy 

58
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,030
 It has been confirmed that it was passed down through your mother's genes. 

59
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,650
  Without pain, after a loss of vision in one eye, 

60
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,970
  the other side will gradually lose vision as well. 

61
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:48,750
 When you'll lose your sight...I'm not really sure about that. 

62
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,180
Doctor! What do I do?

63
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,520
My twins' body is cold. They're about to become cold.

64
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,190
The pulse is fine.

65
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:15,050
But  I think it's because it just got a little cold.

66
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,480
Th-then, what do I do? What am I supposed to do?

67
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,250
What are you planning to do?

68
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,080
Baby. Alright, alright.

69
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,490
Close it up.

70
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,500
Cover them.

71
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:39,010
Oh, it's okay.

72
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,170
- They really are going to be warmed up.
- Right?

73
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,030
Then, me too.

74
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,450
- Children's mother, help us a bit.
- Yes.

75
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,550
Aigoo.

76
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,290
Um, you can stay alone, right?

77
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,360
They need some hands in the emergency room so we need to go.

78
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,440
Thank you for taking care of my children even to this extent.

79
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,980
I also want to go and help.

80
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,260
Do you...want to do that?

81
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,160
Would you like to do that?

82
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,960
Everyone, use more strength. Check the blood pressure.

83
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,990
Blood pressure is 80/40.

84
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,120
His vital signs are abnormal. Please hurry over.

85
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,300
Please give me an epinephrine here.

86
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,560
How much is left?

87
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,850
There's not much left.

88
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,190
Bring over everything left.

89
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,950
- Here, over here!
- Yes.

90
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,550
- You don't have defibrillators? 
 - It should be somewhere.

91
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,770
Go check the equipment room.

92
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:52,060
Hyun Sook, go to the ICU and ask any doctor to come down.

93
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,940
- Will there be defibrillators in the equipment room?
 - Yes.

94
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,900
Should I go as well? Come and help us.

95
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,240
Brother, brother! CPR in the emergency room. They need CPR.

96
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,900
CPR? Jung Ddol Mi, take care of patient Jung Min Cheol well with Doctor An.

97
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,840
Don't take your eyes of the urine drainage bag and the hemovac.

98
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,750
- Yes, we'll take care of him well.
- If you have something to ask,

99
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,090
- remember to ask.
- Yes.

100
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,890
There, there.

101
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:16,460
It's a pulseless V-tach. 200 joules.

102
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,570
Shoot.

103
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,720
How is it?

104
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,900
We tried up to 200 joules. It's no use.

105
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,610
- How long has it been since you did it?
- 10 minutes.

106
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,650
Increase the charge to 200 and add epinephrine.

107
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,440
Shoot.

108
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,770
Are you okay?

109
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,700
I'm fine.

110
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,990
That's all for the emergency room. Should I bring some down from the ICU?

111
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,580
What if someone needs CPR in the ICU?

112
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,160
What will happen to the hospital?

113
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,010
We have nothing else to do, but trust. Let's have strength.

114
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,640
You have to live.

115
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,950
To save you, we-

116
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,210
Why are his hands so swollen?

117
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,510
If it isn't coming out after administering this many fluids...

118
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,180
By any chance...

119
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,940
 An arrhythmia has occurred. We need CPR. We need a defibrillator. 

120
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,260
The patient's blood pressure is going down.

121
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,290
It's going down.

122
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:41,870
We don't have any defibrillators.

123
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,870
The blood pressure is going down! We need an IV.

124
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,990
Can I get an IV?

125
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,050
There aren't many IVs left.

126
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,910
There aren't any left. They're all used.

127
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,630
Doctor!

128
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,940
Time of death: 2:25.

129
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,520
No. No, honey! Don't go!

130
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,060
What am I and the kids supposed to do, honey?!

131
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,200
Save him! It's because of you guys!

132
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,260
What happened with the generator? What happened with the generator that the electricity won't turn on?!

133
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,810
My husband wouldn't have died if only the electricity hadn't been cut!

134
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,180
Save him! Save him!

135
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,740
Stop it. It's also been too long for this patient.

136
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:44,340
Doctor, save this strength if you want to save another patient.

137
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,540
Time of death-

138
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,520
- I'll do it.
- I'm doing it.

139
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:13,950
Time of death...2:57-

140
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:18,550
Are you a machine that's supposed to put down the times of death? By yourself, why do you-

141
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:24,330
It's all my fault. If this hospital closed down-

142
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:30,710
If it closed down? Patients could die on the streets looking for a hospital.

143
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:37,950
Why did this...why did this happen in Seoul?

144
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:43,330
Honey...honey, honey.

145
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:48,110
Honey. Honey!

146
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,850
It has been over 2 hours since the surgery ended.

147
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:06,130
Even though the tubing is fine and we gave him enough fluids, if the urine isn't coming out this much...

148
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,890
Did it proceed to acute kidney failure?

149
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,890
Ay, forget it. You are so pessimistic.

150
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,050
Let's use a diuretic.

151
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,290
Yes, we should. Lasix here. Give it to me in IV form.

152
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,810
Yes.

153
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,610
Why is the pulse like this? It's tachycardia.

154
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:33,150
Isn't it perhaps an arrhythmia? Ah, I'm going to go crazy. The monitor doesn't even work.

155
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:37,990
Please give me a defibrillator. There's a monitor there. Check it with that.

156
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:50,880


157
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,890
Ahjummoni.

158
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,070
What to do... There's big trouble.

159
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:19,070
It is an arrhythmia.

160
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:23,250
- Amiodarone, Amiodarone! 
 - What happened?

161
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,690
Doctor Lee Hae Sung's mother often has arrhythmias.

162
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,790
She has a chronic condition and that's why she couldn't leave the hospital...

163
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:33,310
The Esmolol is useless. And there are no medications on the unit.

164
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:37,190
Doctor, what should we do? We only have one Amiodarone.

165
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:51,730
Doctor! Fuel!

166
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,790
We got the fuel!

167
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,870
Just a minute over here.

168
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,430
- Honey.
- Sung Mi!

169
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,370
Honey.

170
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:08,010
We got it. Now, it's good. We can take our twins.

171
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:11,990
It isn't plentiful, but we'll be able to get out of Seoul.

172
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:17,130
But...why is the hospital like this? Did the electricity get cut off?

173
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:25,430
Oh Min Ho, I have a really hard favor.

174
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:29,870
Please put some oil inside our hospital's electric generator.

175
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:34,610
What are you talking about? This is the fuel we brought to put in the boat on the Han River.

176
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:40,250
- There are so many patients that can only live if the electricity is present. The ICU is like that and-
- Then,

177
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,830
are you saying we should stay trapped here and starve with the patients?

178
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,130
What are you doing? Hurry up and take your share of the fuel.

179
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:49,150
Can't you see the people dying here? Let's live together, together!

180
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:53,590
Living people should live. They're people that might die anytime.

181
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:57,070
What are you doing, twin's father? Aren't you going to take the twins?

182
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:02,250
There are still quite a few empty seats. If you want to leave the hospital together, hurry up and come.

183
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,590
 Hey! Are you guys human?! What if it was your family member?! 

184
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:09,310
 How can you talk like that?! You rude bastard! 

185
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:15,670
Excuse me... please don't turn away the hospital. The fuel will arrive soon.

186
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,890
So that you can leave when that arrives, I will offer it to you. I will repay you.

187
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:25,170
I'm sorry. I'm a husband and a father. My wife and my babies come first.

188
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:28,610
What are you doing? I said let's go quickly. Where are the babies?

189
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,440
The younger one is there.

190
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:52,470
They're even doing that to warm up our babies to normal temperature.

191
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:59,170
Even while they're starving, they made me seaweed soup in this chaos because I'm a new mother.

192
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,730
They're people that couldn't even sleep a wink

193
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,390
yet they checked multiple times a day to see if the twins were sleeping well.

194
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:15,090
Don't think of anything useless. You have to be vicious so we can survive.

195
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:21,230
Honey, if we leave just so we can survive by ourselves,

196
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,990
won't you be embarrassed to your babies?

197
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:29,490
My children and I survived because of this hospital and the doctors here.

198
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:34,950
But if we just leave like this...if we just leave...

199
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,290
will we be able to live as proud parents?

200
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,750
We have to live and see.

201
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:44,590
I believe in us. We've held out until now.

202
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:49,110
The fuel will come in 1-2 days. Even the congressman that came here said that.

203
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:57,290
I'm sorry, honey. I can't leave them and go, honey.

204
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,990
Start the generator, okay?

205
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,870
Did you get the fuel by yourself? Hurry up and go. Go!

206
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,970
If my mother runs low on sugar, she's going to die!

207
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:15,830
You guys can't leave! You think you can live peacefully by killing so many people?

208
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:19,430
- What?
- If you leave, you're murderers! I'm going to report you!

209
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:28,490
What are you trying to do?

210
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:31,030
Doctor Lee! Doctor L-

211
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:34,190
What? Arrhythmia?

212
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,970
There's only one amiodarone.

213
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,930
Patient Jung Min Cheol has an arrhythmia and so does your mother.

214
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:45,630
What should I do? It seems that patient Jung Min Cheol also has acute kidney injury.

215
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,910
Who's the patient that will survive without electricity?

216
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,150
Doctor Lee's mother.

217
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:59,110
Give it to Doctor Lee Hae Sung's mother.

218
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:05,250
All of the electricity has been cut anyway. There's no other way.

219
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,110
Everything has ended.

220
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:12,490
Jung Ddol Mi.

221
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,050
Yes?

222
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,390
Jung Ddol Mi.

223
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,970
Yes?

224
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:23,370
Give it to patient Jung Min Cheol. That patient is in more danger.

225
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,000
Doctor.

226
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:31,050
Lee Hae Sung, there is no way to save that patient without electricity.

227
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:35,950
Anyhow, the fuel will come if we hold out.

228
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:39,710
Since my mother has a chronic condition, she has been able to survive from time to time.

229
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:42,210
If we work hard,

230
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,330
there'll be a way.

231
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:48,890
You...could lose your mother like that.

232
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:52,930
We treated him as much as we could, Hae Sung.

233
00:18:56,110 --> 00:19:00,370
Go, Jung Ddol Mi. Give it to patient Jung Min Cheol.

234
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,150
Doctor Jung Ddol Mi,

235
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:13,330
give the amiodarone to patient Jung Min Cheol. Right this moment.

236
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,410
Yes.

237
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,790
Nurse On, switch places with me.

238
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:29,270
What do they want us to do?

239
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:33,950
Since we will have to give up on Jung Min Cheol if the electicity is cut, Team Leader Kang says to give it to Doctor Lee's mother.

240
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:38,850
And Doctor Lee said that the fuel might arrive soon. So, give it to patient Jung Min Cheol.

241
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,260
I think that Team Leader Kang's words are right.

242
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,640
We have to choose the patient that we can save in the worst situation.

243
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,950
Min Cheol came all the way here. How pitiful...

244
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,210
Why did he have to get hurt? Bad bastard.

245
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:04,010
Mirae Hospital has a debt to Doctor Lee's mother. A very big one.

246
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,310
Nurse Yang, give the amiodarone to me.

247
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:10,610
I am the doctor. If someone is going to administer it, I'm going to do it.

248
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:17,400


249
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:35,040
 My children and I survived because of this hospital and the doctors here. 

250
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:41,420
 If we leave just so we can survive, won't you be embarrassed to your children? 

251
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,370
Fuel? And?

252
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:08,020
They were going to put fuel in the boat and leave...

253
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:15,090
Ah... When the hospital closes down, those are people that need to leave anyways.

254
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,260
But that is...

255
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,790
But what?

256
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:23,000
It seems that there was a suggestion to use the fuel for the generator.

257
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,610
What suggestion?

258
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:27,120
To use the fuel for the generator.

259
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,500
No! That can't happen!

260
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,780
No, no.

261
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,310
There's electricity!

262
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,840
- You need to look over everything.
- Yes.

263
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,590
Take it out.

264
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,120
Oh, that's a relief. The arrhythmia is gone.

265
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,180
It's a relief.

266
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,470
We are going to perform a blood test.

267
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,060
Charge all of the defibrillators!

268
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,590
Thank you. You have worked hard.

269
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,640
Thank you.

270
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,850
Aigoo.

271
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,370
Mom.

272
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:48,020
The arrhythmia has stopped.

273
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,930
It's a relief. What about patient Jung Min Cheol?

274
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:59,190
I don't really know.

275
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,340
What do you mean you don't know?

276
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,370
I gave the amiodarone to your mother.

277
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,260
It was my decision as a doctor.

278
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:17,150
Patient Jung Min Cheol's life ends if the electricity ends.

279
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:22,580
You could have made your mother lose her life while trying to save patient Jung Min Cheol.

280
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:31,070
Could you live properly after sending your mother away?

281
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:36,200
A doctor who can't save their own family isn't a doctor. And you call yourself a doctor?

282
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,980
We have to save patient Jung Min Cheol.

283
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,160
Then it'll be fine, Doctor.

284
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,120
Thanks, Jung Ddol Mi.

285
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:01,420
Thanks to you, the patients who almost died are alive. Thank you.

286
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:07,390
Just thinking of my kids and my wife, I forgot about your kindness.

287
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:10,480
I understand. I would have done the same thing as well.

288
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,580
Only, it's such a pity for the patients

289
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,930
who left before the electricity came back.

290
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:21,400
I didn't even think that the electricity

291
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,450
would be the life to my twins and to the hospital's patients.

292
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,690
I, too, didn't expect it to be like this...

293
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:32,200
As soon as the fuel arrives, I will make sure you can leave.

294
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,770
But you have to pick your twins' names.

295
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,140
We already agreed.

296
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,650
Oh Him Chan. Oh Dang Chan.

297
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:47,210
Oh Him Chan? Oh Dang Chan?

298
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,210
It's okay.

299
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,510
Doctor Eun Sol named them.

300
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:56,850
Me? W-When?

301
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:01,140
Before when you told our twins to grow energetically and strong.

302
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,650
At that time, I was like "ah, I like those names".

303
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:08,100
Ah. You have to tell them later.

304
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,940
Yes, of course. A pretty doctor picked the names.

305
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,110
How could she be called a pretty doctor?

306
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:17,420
Hey, is he wrong?

307
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,300
What is it? What is it?!

308
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:38,670
That...the electricity came back on  so they ran a blood test.

309
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:41,190
The creatinine levels are very high.

310
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:45,120
Even though we used diuretics, the urine is coming out the size of a tear drop.

311
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,410
Didn't it progress to acute kidney failure? We need to get the dialysis going.

312
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:54,430
The CCRT machine broke because of the earthquake...so we can't use it.

313
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,410
The problem is that it seems like metabolic acidosis has occurred.

314
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:04,030
The pH dropped from 7.2 to 7.0. The uric acid level is 8.

315
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:09,630
The blood pressure fluctuates between 70 and 80. The heart rate exceeds 120 bpm.

316
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:14,540
The urine that is supposed to come out isn't coming out. And the hemovac is bright red.

317
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,900
Due to the blood loss during surgery, I think it progressed to acute kidney failure.

318
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:26,350
If it's metabolic acidosis, it's a matter of time before the body fails.

319
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:30,670
Doctor, what should we do? Min Cheol has to live.

320
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:35,390
I even have a debt. I will definitely save him.

321
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,930
Patient Jung Min Cheol?

322
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:42,230
It's acute kidney failure with metabolic acidosis.

323
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:47,590
Dialysis is impossible at our hospital. The helicopter can't come?

324
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,730
They say that it's hard to come because of the winds.

325
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:56,790
I'm going crazy. If the weather starts acting up, too, then what are we to do?

326
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,040
He's that young...

327
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,560
What should we do, senior?

328
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,600
Let's look for a way.

329
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,740
That's surprising.

330
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,110
In the end, Doctor Lee Hae Sung's greed to proceed with the surgery...

331
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:23,300
It was merely a situation where Jung Min Cheol's life passed another hurdle.

332
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:28,980
While you were pre-occupied with the surgery you were performing with Lee Hae Sung,

333
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:35,020
I woke up Minister Seok. Before people started creating rumors, I covered their mouths.

334
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,620
I'm sorry.

335
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:43,580
I think if he continues to stay in here, someone might recognize him.

336
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,820
I promised him the fastest transfer possible. Go find a solution.

337
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:54,020
That... A solution to keep that promise...

338
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:58,870
Then during this calamity, the fact that we hid the Minister even though we knew of his secret,

339
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,570
do you want to hold a press conference about that?

340
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,390
Do everything you can. Find the solution!

341
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:14,890
  Have you breathed a sigh of relief? 

342
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:18,830
  The level 2 typhoon terror that occurred in Japan has arrived in Busan. 

343
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:22,580
  The workers operating heavy machinery have slowly arrived in Seoul. 

344
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:26,300
  The rescue has started to speed up. 

345
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:30,830
  I am worried that it will be delayed again. 

346
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,290
  This is the Fire Department. This is the Fire Department. 

347
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,760
  Mirae Hospital, please respond. This is the Fire Department. 

348
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,190
Yes, this is Mirae Hospital.

349
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:47,580
  A helicopter can depart from Yeouido Hospital right now. 

350
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:51,080
  Since we are using the time while the typhoon temporarily stopped, you must act quickly. 

351
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,300
 If we lose this timing, the helicopter cannot fly due to the typhoon. 

352
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,590
 Yes,  I understand. I'll get him ready. 

353
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:59,210
 I need to go to the rooftop, right? 

354
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:00,550
 Yes, please prepare quickly. 

355
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:03,950
 Thank you. Thank you! 

356
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,960
 Doctor Jung Ddol Mi? 

357
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,320
The helicopter is coming. Prepare patient Jung Min Cheol. To the rooftop.

358
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,620
Min Cheol, they say you're going to live. I guess you can live.

359
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,350
Since the hospital's elevator has stopped, to move him to the rooftop...

360
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:23,130
The stretcher is heavy. How do we move him?

361
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:25,130
Let's move him with the lightest thing we can use to carry him.

362
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:29,950
That is only if we have something like that. Ah...I should have got it from rescue team earlier.

363
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:34,720
You have to used your head, your head.

364
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,670
Ah, why does he do that to someone else's head?

365
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,610
What are you looking at?

366
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,940
The helicopter is coming?

367
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:50,020
It's a last chance to move Seok Jung Woo then.

368
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:55,430
Team Leader Kang has decided that she will move patient Jung Min Cheol.

369
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:59,590
Depending on the doctor's sovereignty, they can judge what patients are in danger differently.

370
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:05,470
Do you believe that the lives of people are all equal?

371
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:10,990
If Seok Jung Woo cannot be moved because of the patient you saved,

372
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:13,550
I really will

373
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:17,290
not be able to forgive you.

374
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:29,400


375
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,260
Wait, wait, wait! Ah, ah, ah.

376
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,640
Ah, just hold it.

377
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,090
Ouch, ouch!  Wait a second.

378
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:56,270
Hey, Jung Ddol Mi, hold it properly. He keeps going down.

379
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:58,530
Doctor, don't you have any more helpers?

380
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,550
Nampodo bully, please use your strength a bit!

381
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,540
Do you want to die? My waist right now-

382
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,880
If a carpenter says that it is not right,

383
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,800
you orthopedic doctors have the best physical strength among all doctors.

384
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:12,170
Now, let's hold it again. 1,2,3!

385
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:15,640
Chancellor, please take care of yourself.

386
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:20,940
I am very regretful that the transfer was delayed, but there was nothing we could do about the situation.

387
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:25,340
It was hard even obtaining a helicopter of this sort.

388
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,050
I won't forget this.

389
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,600
You can forget it.

390
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,190
I didn't do this to receive compensation,

391
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:37,630
so recover quickly and help with the disaster efforts.

392
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,410
Hold on, hold on!

393
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:59,280
- Ah, seriously!!
 - Wait a second!!

394
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,160
I hear it.

395
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,910
- It's the helicopter, right?
- The helicopter really came.

396
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:12,510
Hey, let's just go up. We just have to go up 2 more flights. Now, have strength.

397
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,940
Once more. 1,2,3!

398
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:18,470
Ah, wait. It's stuck, it's stuck, wait! Ah, ah, ah.

399
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,330
My hand, my hand.

400
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,700
- Where is the helicopter?
- We have to go up way more.

401
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,540
You said we were close!

402
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,120
 The helicopter is really loud. 

403
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,220
Cheer up.

404
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,920
What happened? Where's the helicopter?

405
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:04,380
It left... because there was a patient who is an emergency case due to a sudden turn of events.

406
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,160
  Anonymous 
 Kidney rupture 

407
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:13,950
Sudden turn of events?

408
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:16,780
That bed was in the security room but

409
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,270
the only anonymous patient in that room...

410
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:21,780
There's no other patient that I brought from Hangang Mirae.

411
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,400
You're right. That patient.

412
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,390
Who is that patient that Jung Min Cheol has to be pushed back?

413
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,430
What do you mean pushed back? Watch your words.

414
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:32,130
My judgment was that this patient was more critical.

415
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,530
That judgment, was it a judgment made as a doctor?

416
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,750
Or was it a judgment made as a hospital director?

417
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:41,380
Are you saying you're going to evaluate my judgment right now?!

418
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:46,840
Know your place. I'm the hospital's Director.

419
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,690
Secretary Park,

420
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,920
put down the stretcher.

421
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,230
Doctor Han,

422
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:09,610
you always make logical judgments. Is it true?

423
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:13,890
Was that patient really in more danger that patient Jung Min Cheol?

424
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:19,390
From what I know, he was on the road to recovery.

425
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:23,500
It's a problem that could be different based on which angle the doctor looks through.

426
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,590
Angle?

427
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:30,130
On top of his advancing age, he had his kidney removed. His platelet count wasn't great either.

428
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:34,800
Who was the one that stole the platelet pack, 8 packs that were left in the hospital?

429
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,580
The helicopter has already left.

430
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:41,270
Isn't it a better choice to find another way to save that patient in the time you're arguing with m-

431
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:44,150
If there was a way, we would have done it!

432
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,870
If that friend dies,

433
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:52,340
you have just committed murder.

434
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:56,740
Murder? I'm also a doctor that saves patients, then what about you?!

435
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:03,700
In this ridiculous situation, you who put that patient in more danger by pushing for the surgery,

436
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,410
aren't you the murderer?

437
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:10,740
If you don't want to hear that, then save that patient.

438
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,680
Don't try to push the blame onto me.

439
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,340
 Then, don't we have to go back down? 

440
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:36,740
 Where would we go right now? My legs are shaking and I'm drenched in sweat. 

441
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,700
Aigoo, all of you have worked hard.

442
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,720
Aigoo, why are all sitting here like this?

443
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,620
That Ki Sum or Kang Cheol,

444
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:00,270
if it's not a helicopter, then we should try to find another way-

445
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:02,710
What other way is there? We've tried everything. Everything!

446
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:05,690
Ah! Did I say something wrong? Why are you like that to me?

447
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:08,350
Stop it, Doctor An.

448
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:14,230
Nurse Park Ji Na, can you go and get my walkie-talkie?

449
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,970
Yes.

450
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:20,090
- Have some.
 - Please give me some too.

451
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,170
A temporary airplane flight from Gimpo airport?

452
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:29,590
  Since it's about to be closed down, it is the last flight. 

453
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:33,610
  Patient transportation requires 3 seats, but we will try to our best to reserve the last seat. 

454
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:36,650
 There's only about 2 hours left. Please hurry. 

455
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,890
Yes, I understand.

456
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,280
You're excited.

457
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,940
Because we can save him.

458
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:49,260
Can't you be on my side?

459
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,300
There was once a time when I wanted to be.

460
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,780
But I know very well

461
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,900
what kind of person you are,

462
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,240
what kind of person you will become as time passes.

463
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,340
Don't talk as if you know everything about me. I also have something of a situation.

464
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:09,260
To the point that your choice cools down with one choice, am I that insignificant to you?

465
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,880
It was you, Woo Jin, who thought of me as insignificant.

466
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,790
I begged you like that!

467
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,400
I couldn't lose everything.

468
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:20,700
- To me, time-
- I said I would stay by your side.

469
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,600
You could have not lost me!

470
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:29,170
You lost the most precious thing while trying not to let  go of what was in your hand.

471
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,580
Then why

472
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:35,970
aren't you saying it was my mistake?

473
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:39,010
You should become truthful, too.

474
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,490
- You still-
- Don't be mistaken.

475
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,930
I'm not doing it for you, Professor Han.

476
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:48,390
I don't want to talk to you like this again, Professor Han.

477
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,330
I heard from the Fire Department!

478
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:57,520
There's a last emergency plane that's taking off from Gimpo Airport.

479
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,510
They said that they are going to reserve the patient transportation seat, so to come quickly.

480
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:00,800
- Really?
- B-Busan?

481
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,840
Hurry up! We don't have time. After that flight, that airport will be out of order.

482
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,600
These are the emergency car keys.

483
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,430
There is no driver, so you have to drive it yourself.

484
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,890
Um, can we really go? I heard the roads are a mess.

485
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,890
Ah, I don't know. We're just going to do it. Because it's either a success or a failure.

486
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:13,150
Let's go move the patient.

487
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:16,290
Ah, you are always a pessimist.

488
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:21,920
- We'll be back.
- Oh, yeah.

489
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,040
This. The emergency bag.

490
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,940
- Yes.
- You never know what might happen. You know how to use it, right?

491
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:26,950
- Yes, I'll use it well.
- Here.

492
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,960
We don't have time. Get in quickly!

493
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:32,300
We need to communicate with Dr. Lee Hae Sung. You have the one I gave you, right?

494
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,880
Yes, yes.

495
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,230
We'll be back.

496
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:46,030
Always be careful. The roads are dangerous. Be careful and then be careful again.

497
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,440
Yes?

498
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:10,350
The helicopter was a transfer request that I made based on the need for emergent care.

499
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:13,820
How could you without any discussion... This isn't right, Director.

500
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:19,110
Are you saying that you're upset that Minister Seok wasn't with you?

501
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,400
Director.

502
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,960
You can see this as a 50 million support settlement.

503
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:29,470
Whether it's you or Doctor Han, wherever you both stand, it is a great advancement for Mirae Hospital.

504
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:30,980
It's not something I can lose as this hospital's director.

505
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,770
Anyways, the Minister was already saved...

506
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:36,800
He was alive, we had already saved!

507
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,340
Ah, is the problem solved if he's only breathing?

508
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:45,680
The hospital being on the verge of shutdown may be due to the Minister's absence in his post.

509
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,610
Seoul is currently in a state of chaos. And he is an important figure.

510
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:50,960
If there's no minister, there's also a vice-minister.

511
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,660
The supply distribution is something that can't be helped because the carrier was damaged.

512
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:59,150
It's a pity, but that young man is one of the many sacrifices that died due to the earthquake.

513
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:04,000
But many people's lives in Seoul depend on Minister Seok.

514
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:09,120
Are you trying to say that we have to place a ranking for people's lives?

515
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:31,580
You're sitting in that position but you're asking such a question like that to me?

516
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,490
The person who gave me information about Minister Seok

517
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:39,530
was you, Team Leader Kang!

518
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,110
I'm sorry.

519
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:49,590
But...

520
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:53,720
now, what's the reason for becoming a sensitive girl again?

521
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,820
Team Leader Kang, like an Emergency Measures Chief,

522
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,790
look at the forest.

523
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:01,950
Don't just look at the trees.

524
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,190
An Dae Gil,

525
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,950
let's change seats.

526
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,700
My arm is going to fall off!

527
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,330
Doctor Jung, change with me.

528
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:15,970
Just wait a minute.

529
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:17,260
Dae Gil, you jerk.

530
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:20,920
Ah, how can we change seats when the car is shaking like this?

531
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,260
It stopped.

532
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,500
Hey.

533
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:32,980
Why are you like this?

534
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,760
I think we fell in a pit.

535
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:41,530
Stay here.

536
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,720
Ah, seriously.

537
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:05,100
Hey, the car fell in. Ji Na, hold the wheel and step on it when I tell you to.

538
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,680
Ddol Mi is holding the ambu so An Dae Gil...

539
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,800
I'm not holding the ambu though.

540
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:12,590
I gave the walkie talkie to Nurse Park.

541
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:14,100
Okay.

542
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,460
Step on it when I say 1,2,3.

543
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,380
I'm ready. Push.

544
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,500
1,2,3!

545
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:25,190
Hey, push harder.

546
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:26,650
  I'm though. 

547
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:28,800
1,2,3!

548
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:42,990
Hey! Ah!

549
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,300
Is it done? It's done, right?

550
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,040
That's a relief.

551
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:51,690
Is the patient okay?

552
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,100
Yes, he's fine.

553
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,590
- Ah, I can't live! It splashed everywhere.
- Aigoo.

554
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:58,790
Doctor, you're a mess right now.

555
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,920
Why are you suffering so much after coming to Seoul?

556
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,600
You can't eat, you can't sleep, and you're getting dirty water splashed all over you.

557
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,340
I won't ever come back again.

558
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:09,040
Yeah, you probably don't want to come back. Don't come.

559
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,770
Hey, come here.

560
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:16,230
Here.

561
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:45,190
♫  Do you know   ♫

562
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,770
♫   When it started   ♫

563
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:56,810
♫   Your smile give a tired me rest   ♫

564
00:45:56,810 --> 00:46:00,120
♫   Even though a long heavy rain falls   ♫

565
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,120
 What are you doing? Aren't you getting in? 

566
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,590
Yeah!

567
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:07,610
Oh...oh!

568
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,240
You became a mess. There are wet wipes, I'll give them to you.

569
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

570
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:20,510
What are you doing, Jung Ddol Mi?! Aren't you getting in?

571
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:23,790
What are you doing? Hurry up and get in.

572
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:25,090
Here.

573
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,900
Get in quickly. We don't have time.

574
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:35,110
Here.

575
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:39,320
Are you crying?

576
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:43,710
Ah, why?

577
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,280
We're starting now. Hold on tight!

578
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:59,240
♫  I only have you   ♫

579
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:08,290
Pork and rice soup, wheat noodles and fish... is there anything more to Busan food?

580
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:09,390
  52:00 hours after the earthquake 

581
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:12,200
Ignorant An Dae Gil. An Dae Gil who only knows what's in the textbooks.

582
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,340
Do you know Busan?

583
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:16,470
Then, what else is there, knowledgeable Doctor Jung Ddol Mi?

584
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:20,110
Mountainside fortress rice wine, neighborhood onion pancake and raw flounder.

585
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:21,770
There are so many things!

586
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:23,880
Are you going to treat us if we go to Busan?

587
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,130
- What did they say?
- They say they can't.

588
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:36,160
They say that there's no other way than to persuade a passenger ourselves.

589
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,190
We just need one more seat.

590
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:41,270
What we do if we can't get the patient onboard? His condition isn't good.

591
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:43,100
We have to send Min Cheol.

592
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:45,340
Yeah, we have to.

593
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:49,010
Earlier taking him up to the rooftop and bringing him here, his body must've been through so much.

594
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:50,680
I know, right?

595
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:54,800
But only we know that the patient isn't well, how would other people know?

596
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,090
What do we do if they won't give up their seats?

597
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:00,600
Let's trust the people. We'll be able to find a seat.

598
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,850
Don't we have to think of the worst case scenario, too?

599
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:05,840
If that happens, then patient Jung Min Cheol will become what Professor Han said.

600
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,750
We're not going to think about the worse case scenario.

601
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:11,350
They said that the heavens only put you through suffering as much as you can handle.

602
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:14,350
I've suffered enough. I won't suffer anymore.

603
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:15,440
Where is the elevator?

604
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,730
- Over there.
- Over here.

605
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,490
Are you the only one who smells?

606
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:33,260
We all smell.

607
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,940
Ah, seriously.

608
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:37,950
He's broadcasting it to the whole neighborhood...

609
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:49,590
Everyone! Can you look over here for a moment please?

610
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:52,760
Attention! Attention!

611
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:57,880
I know very well

612
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:02,730
that you are waiting for the last airplane.

613
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:06,480
But that patient over there is in a lot of danger.

614
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,690
He needs immediate dialysis to survive.

615
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:14,120
So...if only one of you can give up your seat,

616
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,570
then we can save that patient.

617
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:18,620
We waited since yesterday so what are you telling us to give up right now?

618
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,280
I ask of you. Just one person.

619
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,970
Look here, do you know how hard it is to get a ticket right now?

620
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:25,610
What do you think you're doing?!

621
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:28,860
Open the airplane doors quickly! It's almost time!

622
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:32,530
Everyone, it just has to be one person.

623
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:33,910
If only one person would sacrifice...

624
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:36,970
Aren't we not going to catch the plane like this...?

625
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,700
Everyone, you shouldn't be doing this!

626
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,700
Don't run. You will get hurt.

627
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,730
Ambu, ambu!

628
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:51,750
I am holding it.

629
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:53,050
Ah, my stethoscope.

630
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:55,710
Don't run. You will get hurt!

631
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:58,920
Doctor Jung, be careful!

632
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,470
What are you doing, Jung Ddol Mi? Get up!

633
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:07,080
Doc!

634
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:13,750
My hair is stuck!

635
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,300
Jung Ddol Mi, get up.

636
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,460
It hurts. It hurts a lot.

637
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:27,200
Someone press the stop button over there!

638
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:32,420
Ah! It hurts.

639
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:46,900
Are you okay?

640
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:55,290
Look over here! Over here!

641
00:50:57,510 --> 00:50:59,750
Look over here, are you okay?

642
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:03,100
His breathing is very shallow.

643
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:06,470
Switch with me and go look at that patient.

644
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:07,320
M-Me?

645
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,250
Quickly go.

646
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:12,060
T-This is damaged.

647
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:14,980
What should I-I do? What d-do I do?

648
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,880
Just do anything. You're a doctor.

649
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,750
It's an open fracture.

650
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,810
Jung Ddol Mi, where are you going?

651
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:31,890
There's a hospital inside the airport.

652
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:36,860
- Are you an employee? 
 - What?

653
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,250
You're a doctor, right?

654
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:42,000
Since there was an incident, there's a patient with an open fracture and many other patients, too.

655
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,300
So... antiseptic, dressings, stuff like that... give me everything you have.

656
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,140
What?

657
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:47,680
We need to hurry up.

658
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,160
Yes.

659
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:52,860
It hurts a lot, right?

660
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:55,460
- Please endure for just a little bit. We'll treat you quickly.
- Hurry!

661
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:56,960
Doc!

662
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,500
I've brought some bondage and disinfectant.

663
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,930
You are quite impressive.

664
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:03,600
Well, this much is nothing.

665
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,910
Give me the saline solution.

666
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:13,410
Hang in there.

667
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:18,140
Be quiet for a moment!

668
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,170
- I guess he can't breathe.
- He can't breathe.

669
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:27,280
Doctor Lee Hae Sung!

670
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,010
Doc!

671
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:30,200
What?!

672
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,470
There's an urgent patient with abnormal breathing!

673
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:34,750
- Jung Ddol Mi, you go.
- What?

674
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:39,010
Hey, even though you and that intern are similar in skill level, two should be better than one.

675
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:41,960
Doctor Lee! What do I do?

676
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,640
Wait a second!

677
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:46,260
Hurry up and go! The intern is going to die from waiting.

678
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,580
Ahn Dae Gil, what is it? why were you like that?

679
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:52,720
He has abnormal breathing

680
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,640
and you can hear the heart sound from outside.

681
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:58,510
From the symptoms, there's probably blood or air trapped inside the thorax.

682
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:06,620
Doctor Lee, his condition is serious.

683
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:07,860
Please wait a moment.

684
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,340
How is it?

685
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:12,500
It seems like there is air trapped inside the thorax. He's not breathing.

686
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:16,000
His blood pressure is 70/40 and his pulse is over 130. And he also has a lot of cold sweats.

687
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,730
Anyway, I think we should take an x-ray.

688
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:20,030
Is there an x-ray machine?

689
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,480
It broke during the earthquake.

690
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:25,690
They say we can't use the X-ray, it broke. But the vitals are really bad.

691
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:27,710
 Then what do we do? 

692
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:30,760
Why are you asking me that?!

693
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:35,300
You guys are doctors, too. If you're only going to look for me, then what's the point of you guys being here?

694
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:39,260
Some nurse even performed thoracentesis because she didn't want to lose the patient.

695
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:41,590
If you can't do anything, give up your doctor's license.

696
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:44,460
 A plane to Busan,... 

697
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,800
I'm about to go crazy.

698
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:49,410
  Since this is the last flight... 

699
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:51,540
What should we do?

700
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,920
Hold still a second. I'm trying to think.

701
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,780
Let's try this.

702
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:01,500
I really... I will do whatever it takes, I will.

703
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,300
Don't we have to do some sort of examination first?

704
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,320
I have an idea!

705
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:11,870
Will this work?

706
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:13,900
Whether it works or not, we have to try it first.

707
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:16,750
This, this isn't for that kind of x-Ray.

708
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:20,210
It doesn't have to be as specific as the medical one. We just need to verify it.

709
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:23,680
Can you expand it a little more?

710
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,620
Ah, stop! Stop! Wait a second.

711
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:30,040
- Oh, I see it! 
 - It's quite blurry.

712
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,060
Magnify it a little more please.

713
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,890
- Expand. 
 - Yes, I mean expand.

714
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:38,590
It seems like the lungs are pushed over to one side.

715
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,890
Know one thing for sure.

716
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:50,190
- What?
- What?

717
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:53,790
Nurse Park, I'm not doing this out of a competitive spirit.

718
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:57,270
I know. Your gaze is that of a doctor.

719
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:59,940
You can do it. Fighting!

720
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:04,730
Just endure it a bit.

721
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:17,410
That's good for the pneumothorax.

722
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:21,190
We need to put in a tube for the hemothorax.

723
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:27,910
According to the textbook, to the side of the nipple, on top of the 5th rib...

724
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:30,270
That's probably what you only know.

725
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:36,290
A thoracic doctor said that when the condition isn't great... to the side of the nipple, 1 or 2 steps down,

726
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:40,050
If you put it between the ribs, he said that you won't cause a problem.

727
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:48,680
Mosquito clamp.

728
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,410
Are you sure you didn't cause an accident here? He's bleeding.

729
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:52,760
Kelly.

730
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:56,700
First of all, put it in.

731
00:55:58,450 --> 00:55:59,940
Here are the water bottles.

732
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,080
Give the empty ones to me. Nurse Park...

733
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,730
I already know.  I'll take those.

734
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:04,900
Ah, the ones with water...

735
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,220
I can just leave 1/3 of it, right?

736
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:09,370
- An Dae Gil, empty the water.
- Yes.

737
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,200
Let's check his blood pressure.

738
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:42,640
Blood pressure is 115/80. His pulse is good, too.

739
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,530
Are you okay now? Try and take a deep breath.

740
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,630
Hey, you finish it up.

741
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:03,040
There shouldn't be any leaks in the thoracic cavity, make sure to suture it well.

742
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,820
Yes. I do sutures quite well.

743
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:17,530
Applause!

744
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,820
Ah, you moved Minister Seok to Suwon.

745
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:36,640
Yes. Since Mirae Hospital has done a great job with the surgery, the prognosis is good.

746
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,080
We were able to breathe a sigh of relief.

747
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,500
It seems like they started receiving reports.

748
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:46,150
They probably should have received report about the hard work and power of Mirae Hospital.

749
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:47,860
Ah, is that so?

750
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:54,130
He told me to thank Director Park Gun personally.

751
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:57,390
It's not something I did so I could receive that type of thanks.

752
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:00,070
Of course, you didn't. That's for sure.

753
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:03,380
Now, Director, let's combine our strength

754
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:06,940
Let's conquer this disaster.

755
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:12,900
Excuse me everyone!

756
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:18,670
A little while ago, only 1 person had to give up their seat.

757
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:22,900
Now, not just one patient but also because of another,

758
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:26,110
a total of 4 people have to give up their seats.

759
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:31,010
I beg of you. The airport will soon open again.

760
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:36,020
If 4 of you yield just a bit,

761
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:38,120
then we can save

762
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,020
these patients.

763
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,420
Please.

764
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:47,160
I beg of you.

765
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:49,770
Excuse me.

766
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:52,370
- Let me ask something.
- Yes?

767
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:55,170
Will I die if I don't receive surgery right away?

768
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:56,480
What?

769
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,420
Will I die?

770
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:01,820
Well, that's not it but your arm is-

771
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:05,360
That's fine. I'll remain.

772
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:10,590
These doctors are going crazy trying to save people they don't even know.

773
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:11,980
I don't have that skill so-

774
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:14,150
We'll stay behind.

775
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,090
The injured people have to get treatment.

776
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:21,000
Why would you remain?

777
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:25,700
This is an airport so there's electricity and there's water.

778
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:27,790
It's enough to stay here.

779
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:32,720
I need to do a good thing before I leave, right?

780
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:27,320
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

781
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:31,150
Min Cheol, just stay alive.

782
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:33,330
Right now, it's not just your life.

783
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:35,460
You have to survive to be someone with a conscience.

784
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:36,970
It's all done.

785
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:41,370
Jung Ddol Mi, hold the ambu.

786
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:42,940
An Dae Gil is going to die from his hand hurting.

787
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:46,080
Hey, let's switch. You should have told me earlier.

788
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,680
Move.

789
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:50,040
Give it to me.

790
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:55,170
Jung Ddol Mi, what should we do? You're already a rock head.

791
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:57,190
Now even your hair became uneven.

792
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:58,800
Let's just say we're even,

793
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:02,340
with your chest crying because I couldn't suture well.

794
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:05,620
Hey, that's my loss. Hair grows quickly.

795
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:10,210
No matter how quick it is, hair is life for a woman.

796
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:14,860
You worked hard all this time. Go safely.

797
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:16,350
Thank you.

798
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,880
Let's not see each other again.

799
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,520
You're joking around, An Dae Gil.

800
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,160
- Go well, lunatic Jung Ddol Mi.
- Hey.

801
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:26,940
Jung Ddol Mi.

802
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:28,990
Your car fare, it's good now, right?

803
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:31,770
Car fare? What car fare...?

804
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:38,090
Ah, the day after the earthquake, you withdrew money from the atm and gave it to me.

805
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:44,030
You worked hard all this time. Go well.

806
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:45,170
Huh?

807
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:48,110
You said you didn't want to come back to Seoul again.

808
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:49,600
You said it's tiring.

809
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:53,530
Ah, then-then are you telling me to go by myself?

810
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:58,500
Seoul is our house. Busan is Ddol Mi's house.

811
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:03,660
I entrust you with the patient until you get to Busan. I'm going.

812
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:07,010
Doctor! Dr. Lee Hae Sung! Wait a minute!

813
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,430
Doctor! Wait a minute!

814
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:19,220
Doctor! Wait a minute!

815
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:21,210
Doctor!

816
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:26,170
Doctor! Wait-

817
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:48,240


818
01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:02,250
 Is the fuel going to come? 

819
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:04,060
 What about the medicines? what about the supplies? 

820
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:05,840
 There are times when giving up is the best. 

821
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:08,090
 Are you saying giving up on the patient is the best right now? 

822
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:11,070
  Now, you should complete your final duty. 

823
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:15,740
  From today on, I have decided to close down the hospital. 

824
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:19,950
  I'm truly sorry that I couldn't keep the promise about your transferring issues. 

825
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:22,650
  The duwl and supplies sent by the government has arrived. 

826
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:23,950
  We won't close down the hospital. 

827
01:03:23,950 --> 01:03:25,790
 Lee Hae Sung. 

828
01:03:25,790 --> 01:03:28,000
 This is Mirae Hospital with doctors. 

829
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,230
 You have crossed the line...by a lot. 

830
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:34,860
 Doctor Lee, you're fired.
