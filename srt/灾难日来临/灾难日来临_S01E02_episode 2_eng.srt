1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:10,240


2
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,080
There! What's that!
 - What?

3
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,240
Aish. Oh!

4
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,350
 Yes, 911. How may I help you? 

5
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,750
Yes. This is the Yeonggwang District intersection.

6
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,900
 A crane has fallen on the road. 

7
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,700
 Yes, there has also been a car accident. 

8
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,020
We still have to check the number of casualties, but there seems be a lot.

9
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,150
 Yes. 

10
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,680
This is the Yeonggwang District intersection.

11
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:30,040
Because of the sudden tower crane collapse, the entire road is a mess.

12
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,280
There are also many wounded.

13
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,560
Are you just going to stand there in a doctor's coat?
- What?

14
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,420
Aren't you a resident in orthopedics? You're not scared of blood, right?

15
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,990
For patients in emergency room and ICU, we use ABC for assessment, but for now, we'll use CAB.

16
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:48,890
If you think it's urgent, call me. I'm Lee Hae Sung, you? Jung Ddol Mi?

17
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,720
 Doctor! Here! 

18
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,740
Yes, coming!

19
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,030
What's going on?

20
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,570
Where? The Yeonggwang District intersection?  A tower crane has collapsed?

21
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,350
Rescue team dispatch! Yeonggwang district center! Emergency!

22
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:12,540
Yeonggwang intersection, crane collapsed.  A large number of wounded!

23
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,770
I'm done with you. If you dare call us again,

24
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,320
and make a mess, I'll kill you for real.

25
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,660
Alright, I'll just ask Mr. 911 to call Mr. 114.

26
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,400
Aish!

27
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,700
What is that?

28
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,440
Something must have exploded.

29
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,230
That's Captain Yoon's car. Woo Sung, get them.

30
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,030
Yes.

31
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,880
What's going on?

32
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,050
Something really big happened today. Hurry, get on.

33
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,400
Ki Woong and Woo Sung, get the equipment and go take a look at the area with the car accident.

34
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,940
I understand.

35
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,390
Captain, there's a man in his late 30s who needs help.

36
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,450
Where is he? 
 - Over there!

37
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,890
It's okay, I'm fine. 
 - Please save him! 

38
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,590
 Please save him! 

39
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,080
It looks like it penetrated through his lungs.

40
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,530
Please stay still, don't move!

41
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,430
Anyone here? The rescue team?

42
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,280
This will hurt.

43
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,620
It's just dislocation, nothing urgent. Let's move other patients first.

44
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,010
We can move this patient later.

45
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:05,600
Excuse me, sir! You're the doctor that I saw at the hospital, right? 
 -Yes.

46
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,260
Oh! Please help us over there. There is an urgent patient.

47
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,520
No! Stop!

48
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,720
Are you crazy, punk?

49
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,960
We've to pull that out at the hospital.

50
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,910
If the vessels get touched and moved even just a bit, it will result in even more bleeding.

51
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,730
Ah, then... How are we going to transfer this patient... We have to shorten the pipe to fit in the ambulance.

52
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,920
Do you have welding equipment?
- Welding?

53
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,320
We have to cut the pipe.

54
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,850
What if while doing it, we grazed other areas, what will happen to this person?

55
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,290
Give me the phone. 
- Ok.

56
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,860
Hurry!

57
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,990
Hey, Ki Woong!  Look for Captain Yoon's car.

58
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,920
Bring the hydraulic cutter hurry, the hydraulic cutter.

59
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,530
Cut it short and close to the body as much as possible.

60
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,910
Don't worry. You will survive.

61
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,710
I promise to keep you alive.

62
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,830
Just wait.  It's almost done.

63
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,660
We need to move this patient as carefully 
and quickly as possible.

64
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,180
Also, his blood vessels might be damaged so please move him to a hospital that can do surgeries.

65
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,390
We would like to do that, too, but at this time there are no emergency rooms willing to do surgeries.

66
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,970
 Doctor! This patient's breathing is abnormal. 

67
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,550
Going!

68
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,480
Minister Seok seems to be partial towards our hospital, too.

69
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,490
When it comes to curing patients, no other hospital can come close to our level.

70
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,060
It's all thanks to you, Director.

71
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,130
Your Robot Surgery should also go to the world's top spot, not just this country.

72
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,530
During these times, you should manage yourself well.

73
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,210
Don't let those trivial lawsuits affect your career progress.

74
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,780
Yes, I am always aware of that.

75
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,050
My belly will get bigger and bigger.

76
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,870
If my dream is just being the hospital's head,

77
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,980
it's too small.

78
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,420
Are you okay?

79
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,670
Captain!

80
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,270
What?

81
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:32,460
Oh! Ok, got it!

82
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,960
Hey, Captain Yoon. If you're all done, let's go over there.

83
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,020
A car fell into a sinkhole. There are two people who need rescue. One is pressed on the ground, another is in the car.

84
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,800
Hey, rescue teams.

85
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,060
Aigoo, Busan lady, we meet again. Must have been fate for us two.

86
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,380
We just met twice and by coincidence.

87
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,330
Woo Sung, where are you?

88
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,190
Captain! Over here!

89
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,400
She's getting held down by the iron rods.

90
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:14,770
Patient! Do you know where you are? Where is this? How did you get here?

91
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,370
She's still conscious. There must be abdominal injuries.

92
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:21,320
We have to move the rods first for me to examine properly. 
- Ok, let's start first with removing the rods.

93
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,520
We'll be ok, so youâ€” 
 - I know.

94
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,520
Ok. Let's move the patient at the count of three.

95
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,290
One, two, three!

96
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,460
Let it down.

97
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,270
Always a sinkhole, every other day.

98
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,840
Um, there is another one in the back.

99
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:11,870
Aigoo, what's going on these days? Captain Yoon, be careful down there.

100
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,840
Hold onto the rope well, it looks deep.

101
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,080
Did you send Yeo Dam? 
- The doctor is looking at her.

102
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,630
Is the hospital we're going to far?

103
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:29,360
Ah, headquarters said Mirae Hospital still have two beds available so we're going there.

104
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,470
There must be some hemorrhage. Just in case, I'll just go with them.

105
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,200
Oh, I would be grateful for that.

106
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,240
You're going through hardship.

107
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,700
You couldn't even eat any pork belly.

108
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,230
Next time, don't forget to buy it for me.

109
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:12,500
Looks like we're going to need heavy equipment. Send two more guys down.

110
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,970
Oh, okay! Be careful, Captain Yoon!

111
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,540
Ah, Rescue Team 1.

112
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,390
Support team? Rescue Team 1, support team, can you hear me?

113
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,720
Doctor, they're now bringing up the guy in the pit.

114
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,910
What?
- The patient.

115
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,530
Patient?

116
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,420
The patient? Oh.

117
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,690
Oh.

118
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,560
This isn't good.

119
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,980
90/40 (blood pressure). And the pulse is weak.

120
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,870
Seems like it really burst. Tell Gook to come quickly.

121
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,420
Hey! When is Gook coming?

122
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,190
Even if he hurries, he said he's going to take at least 15 minutes.

123
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,630
That will be too late! The patient's situation is urgent!

124
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,140
Our ambulance. I'll go in our ambulance.

125
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:55,680
You are going to go? 
- Even if it's not proper form, a doctor is a still a doctor.

126
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,790
I don't want to see a patient die in front of my eyes.

127
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:03,970
The ministry of welfare wouldn't have given me a medical license just because they're bored, right?

128
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,560
 I can't hear because of the car, tell me slowly. 

129
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,560
The blood pressure has risen a little. You've already talked to those at Mirae Hospital, right?

130
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,280
 They must have already been waiting outside the emergency room. Just directly go in for a CT scan. 

131
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,490
My license is not just a sheet of paper.

132
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,620
My license was given to me to save people.

133
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,330
Come here. Hey, Woo Sung, you're not going?

134
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,100
I will go after cleaning up.

135
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,190
Ok. Ki Woong, you sit with Captain Yoon.

136
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,580
Yes!

137
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,960
Don't you have to take a helmet with you on site?

138
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,710
What if they get hurt?

139
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,530
Be careful. You couldâ€”

140
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,540
What are you?

141
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:38,570
If you get hurt, what about mom?

142
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,610
What would I say to mom?

143
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,230
What I was doing as an older brother.

144
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,970
What kind of brother are you?

145
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,710
How?

146
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,490
Woo Sung.

147
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,180
Okay, I know it was all my fault.

148
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,510
So now let's stop.
- Just leave it alone!

149
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,590
Having Dad dead,

150
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:06,020
making mom be in a vegetative state; just shut up and live, don't try to act cool in front of me.

151
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:11,540
Not his own parents, but saving other patients at some hospital!

152
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,170
Coward.

153
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:38,250
Just living and begging in that hospital that made mom this way. Unable to say a word. You trash.

154
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:42,520
What kind of a doctor are you? Because of you...

155
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,910
Because of you that happened to mom!

156
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,970
 Father! 

157
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,550
 Father! 

158
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,310
 Hae Sung! 

159
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,580
 Why isn't mom waking up? 

160
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,700
 It's been one month since the surgery was done. 

161
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,950
 Medical malpractice, right? 

162
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,600
 Reveal what really happened to mom. 

163
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,200
Bring our mom back.

164
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,730
Bring back our mom, you idiot!

165
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,150
Hold the "dandi."

166
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,610
"Dandi"?

167
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,230
I said hold the "ddokdi," the "ddokdi."

168
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,550
"Ddokdi?"

169
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,100
Ambu!
- Ahh.

170
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,930
Ah, so ambu is called "ddokdi" in Busan..

171
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,090
Why is the patient like that?

172
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:27,130
Professor definitely didn't make any mistakes.

173
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,680
It was the best operation I've ever seen.

174
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,090
The patient has hypertension and diabetes, right? It could happen.

175
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,980
Stop food intake for the time being, until we can check the leak.

176
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,520
Check the number of leukocytes, too, to see if it's infected.

177
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,280
Okay, I understand . Get ready.

178
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:51,610
I already told you we can't. Tell them we really only have one bed available left!

179
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,300
What's going on?

180
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:57,700
The first year intern from the emergency room, they keep asking for two beds in the ICU.

181
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,100
Without even checking in with the situation here in the ICU, they're asking for beds?

182
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,330
I will go. Just take care of the patient.

183
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:08,140
Weren't there two beds available? That's why we came here, what am I supposed to do?

184
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,190
The patient's condition is very bad, I was barely able to keep the blood pressure stable.

185
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:16,440
I know that, but a patient with internal hemorrhage came in earlier, so other beds are now full.

186
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,450
I already asked them to find another bed for you. 
- The patient you just operated on seems to have a ruptured aneurysm.

187
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,210
Yes, I've secured an operating room already.

188
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:24,570
What happened? Why do you need two beds in the ICU?

189
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:28,330
They're from the tower crane incident today. Iron rods crashed on the woman's abdomen.

190
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:31,920
The man is confirmed to have ruptured his kidney.

191
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,480
The girl's liver seems to have ripped.

192
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,860
The man's right kidney is ruptured. Did you contact the urologist?

193
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,890
The department head went on a seminar, and I can't contact the others..

194
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,530
The ICU doesn't have any beds anymore.

195
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,350
The one with the ruptured kidney needs to be transferred to another hospital.

196
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,440
Doctor! This patient's condition is really bad!

197
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,280
And you are?

198
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,910
Busan Park Hospital 3rd Year Resident, Jung Ddol Mi.

199
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,600
Jung Ddol Mi?

200
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,520
 One, two! 

201
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:15,210
The urology department can't accept this patient either. How about at Busan Park Hospital?

202
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:19,930
Ah, liver laceration is the right diagnosis but because the hemorrhage isn't much, so you can do it.

203
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,600
This patient's vitals aren't very good either. This is urgent.

204
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,190
Since you're a surgeon, aren't you able to patch up the kidney, too?

205
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:32,020
It's not even something I specialize in, if I do it recklessly, it'll only be more dangerous for the patient.

206
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,220
Doctor.

207
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:38,550
Moving the patient to a urologist is faster way to save this patient.

208
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,990
Move this patient to the ICU.
- Doctor!

209
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,910
Is it really a choice made for the patient?

210
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:01,830
Aren't you just scared of tarnishing your record?

211
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:08,060
And that you're avoiding the patient because he might have damaged liver and lungs, too.

212
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:12,350
And if so?

213
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,290
Is my choice wrong?

214
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:21,860
Can you really blame me that I want to focus on patients that I can give a more proper treatment to?

215
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:26,070
I don't think this is something I should hear from Nurse Park

216
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:29,750
who can't even differentiate the do's and don'ts.

217
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:34,560
Even if the result somehow came out to be good, it still does not justify the means.

218
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,530
You might think that you were being being brave, but it was reckless.

219
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:42,950
All you did was gamble with the patient's life on the line.

220
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,560
This is nothing personal.

221
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,890
What are you doing? I'm getting flooded with calls from Busan headquarters.

222
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,580
They said you're not answering your phone,
and asked when are we going back?

223
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,440
There was no battery, so it turned off. What about 911?

224
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,420
They left once we took out the patient.

225
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,090
But why is the patient out here again?

226
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:09,180
This is the CT we took earlier.
 -Yes.

227
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,800
If this patient's guardian contacts you, please let us know.

228
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,660
Sir, please hurry and open the door. We need to find a hospital for the patient.

229
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,190
Open what door? Our Busan hospital is already a mess looking for us all day.

230
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,560
We have to hurry and go!

231
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,590
A person might die!

232
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,140
Call 911! We will get fired!

233
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,920
911 is busy, there was an accident today.

234
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,330
If we get fired, are you going to take responsibility? I have two daughters!

235
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,990
Oh! Blood pressure! Blood pressure!

236
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,610
Hurry!

237
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:46,930
Brother, we don't even have an emergency rooms, how can you just bring in so many patients?

238
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:51,080
Ah, they are just acute patients. How many people did sister bring in?

239
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,590
Oh, Reporter Seo. I'll just get some treatment. I'll call you back.

240
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,650
Are you a reporter?

241
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,450
Yes. I'm Bae Myung Gyun from JBC News.

242
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:05,070
Why do many sinkholes appear lately? What happened today must be due to faulty construction, right?

243
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:08,800
It can look that way. But we still don't know the real cause.

244
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,820
Ah, it's nothing serious, I'll dress it  now. Sister?

245
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,790
You are amazing.

246
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:17,260
Willing to treat this many people, even without an emergency room.

247
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:20,660
If there is medicine, doctors, and nurses present, then it is an emergency room.

248
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,680
Lee Hae Sung!

249
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,920
Hey, Eun So Yool!

250
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,490
What are you doing?

251
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,190
What is this place?

252
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,100
As for you, what brings you here?

253
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,090
I came to congratulate on your position.

254
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,060
Was it not today?

255
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,460
Here. You did it when you were an intern, right?

256
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,650
Uh, help me with the dressing. If it's more serious, look for me.

257
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:47,040
It's been ten years since my internship ended!

258
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,220
Isn't too much asking these things to a psychiatrist?

259
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,420
Oh, Park Ji Na.

260
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,480
Ah, I'm Jung Ddol Mi, not Park Ji Na.

261
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,190
Um, the fluid is running a bit dry.

262
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:04,710
The patient I went with.. They said it's kidney rupture. But Mirae Hospital said they can't do the surgery.

263
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,890
They said there isn't anyone available in the urology deptartment to do the surgery.

264
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,250
Hanguk Medical University? Other university hospitals?

265
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,020
We've called them all, but to no good...

266
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,820
What do we do? He might just end up dying.

267
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:20,790
The patient's condition isn't good. His BP is 70. What should we do?

268
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,620
Bring him over here.

269
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:27,400
What?
 - Just bring him here. I'll prepare an operation room. 

270
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,650
There isn't any ICU... 
- No!

271
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,580
I'll still do it without one.

272
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:36,750
Just bring him here regardless. Also, bring that resident fool from Busan along with you.

273
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:40,820
Sister, call the anesthesiologist to come here right away.

274
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:45,790
Open the operating room, the ICU that was closed not long ago. Call the mechanics' room and tell them to turn on the electricity for that room.

275
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:50,130
And also, contact the blood bank to bring enough blood type O.

276
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:54,230
What are you doing? Hurry up and go?

277
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:58,030
Brother, you aren't thinking about...

278
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:01,930
What are you doing? Call them immediately to come here.

279
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:06,500
Doctor, you can't! We don't even have residents, and no doctors to keep watch in the ICU. How can we do any surgeries...

280
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,030
I'll do it! I'll do it all!

281
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,670
Hurry!

282
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:16,260
I'm gonna go crazy.

283
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:24,490
 Oh, Doctor! I'm at the hospital right now. 

284
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,460
Eun So Yool, you help, too.

285
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:31,550
Lee Hae Sung, are you crazy? I'm a psychiatrist, a psychiatrist!

286
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,940
Isn't psychiatrist a doctor as well?

287
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:43,620
It's a cardiac arrest. 
- Epi, epi.

288
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,760
Let's switch. You hold the ambu.

289
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,370
Cardiac arrest?

290
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:15,160
Yes, it's only been about two minutes.

291
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:20,120
There's still a chance, hurry and move him to the operation room.

292
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,630
Slowly, slowly!

293
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:25,930
Dr. Ddol Mi, let's go quickly. There must an uproar at Busan.

294
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:28,520
Please tell them that Doctor Jung Ddol Mi can't go.

295
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,550
What? Why?

296
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:36,240
We don't have anyone else to assist.
- Doctor Lee, ambu!
- But why write that there is?

297
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,670
There's you!

298
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,030
This man is crazy...

299
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,970
Please tell them she's doing surgery and she can't leave.

300
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:47,530
Doctor Ddol Mi, Doctor Ddol Mi, please get off of there now!

301
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,140
Let's hurry up and go now!

302
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,690
Ah! I'm going to go crazy, really!

303
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,890
Hurry, let's just go! Hurry and come off!

304
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,590
Okay, lift!

305
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:01,720
Hurry, let's go!

306
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,820
If you leave, you're a murderer.

307
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,480
Only you can assist me doing surgery in this hospital.

308
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,580
Let's just go quickly!

309
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,330
Ajusshi!

310
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:15,360
Aigoo! What should I do? 
 - Get off there quickly, now!

311
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,230
Let's go, quickly!

312
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,550
Let's just go now, quickly! Get off, fast!

313
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,430
Ajusshi! Ajusshi! Aigoo...

314
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,860
Hurry and get off!

315
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,120
I'm going then!!

316
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,070
Please!

317
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:43,060
It's useless. 
 - Whether it's useless or not,

318
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,670
it hasn't been decided yet.

319
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,040
Oh, the heartbeat came back?

320
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,330
One whom I just met.

321
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:27,250
Another whose last time in the surgery room was during internship years ago.

322
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,980
I know.

323
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:34,650
It doesn't make sense. But

324
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:41,350
there are these many doctors, so we can't just leave patients to die on the ground while we look for hospitals.

325
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:44,280
That's too embarrassing.

326
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:51,450
Someone's, father, husband, is this patient. Let's put things back to the way he was.

327
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:56,510
Today, if we make a crazy miracle happen,

328
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,670
he can return to his family.

329
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,460
I'm starting.

330
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,350
A wolf has appeared, please save me!

331
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:09,890
Oh? A wolf has appeared? The villagers stopped what they were doing and

332
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,650
ran quickly.

333
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:15,090
Hey, where's the wolf?

334
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:20,220
The villagers who came running holding axes...

335
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:31,560
You fell asleep while reading story books. Take off your socks.

336
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:57,920
Aigoo, these types of toys, does he really like them that much?

337
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:02,980
Yes, of course, he is a boy so he likes that kind of stuff. I'll play with him a lot.

338
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,570
Oh, when our Mimi and Rara were growing up,

339
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:09,510
I usually went abroad for business trips for about 8 months a year. There weren't any memories made.

340
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:15,120
One blink, and they already graduated middle school. Blink again, and they're studying abroad. Another blink, and...

341
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,630
divorce.

342
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,030
I want to be a really good father to Dong Ha.

343
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:25,300
Should I give you a tip? 
- Huh?
- Dong Ha wants to go fishing.

344
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,670
Ohh, I should learn this.

345
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,120
 Urgent news flash... Another sinkhole has appeared and caused an accident. 
- Can't we just focus on the wine?

346
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,630
Alright.
-   We'll be connected with Reporter Kim Min Jae. 

347
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:41,540
Oh, wait.
 - A large crane fell over at the Yeonggwang intersection construction site tonight. 

348
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:46,250
 Until now, the only known cause is the sinkhole that appeared on site. 

349
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:49,070
Yeonggwang District?
 - The police are now investigating for the exact cause of the incident. 

350
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,710
That's also my constituency.

351
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:55,100
 This is already the 4th recent case of a sinkhole. This time the sinkhole affected a tower crane... 

352
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,620
Oh, Doctor On Jung Won.

353
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:03,220
Ah, really. Okay. I'll leave right now.

354
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,050
Oh, you're leaving?

355
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:08,440
Because of that accident, there are a lot of patients. It must be so chaotic.

356
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,110
Ah, then what about this wine?

357
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:13,160
You don't like it when I'm like this, right?

358
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,350
You want to think about remarrying, right?

359
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,740
No, I know you're a workaholic.

360
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,460
But I like the Kang Joo Ran, who's a workaholic even more.

361
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,440
Women who always just look at me, don't have any charms.

362
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,120
If you can't come back, tell me!

363
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,480
I'll stay with Dong ha and when the ahjumma comes tomorrow morning, I'll leave him with her!

364
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,350
Okay, thanks! I'll call you!

365
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:46,440
So, you are reopening a closed ICU?

366
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,100
Just to be able to operate on a patient that Mirae Hospital refused?

367
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,760
Aigoo, does this make sense?

368
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,290
Ah, I said I don't want to be filmed.

369
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,630
Oh, yes.

370
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:05,910
You also saw the patient coming in while getting CPR right? The most critical of all critical patients.

371
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:11,400
I mean, what are they thinking doing surgery in this hospital?

372
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:17,200
The doctor earlier, he got kicked out from another hospital because he caused an accident there.

373
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,990
I'm really...

374
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:24,730
I'm just too kind that I got caught in this.

375
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:33,520
Can I go put on some BB cream? Then it won't matter if I'm on the news.

376
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:45,600


377
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:59,870
I saw it was a huge incident in the news, these are all the patients?

378
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:04,460
There were 2 critical patients that came in from the accident. But the ICU only had 1 bed left.

379
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:08,690
Professor Han said we'll just accept one with the liver rupture and move her to the ICU.

380
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:11,400
The ruptured kidney patient was returned.

381
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,060
The patient only received some tests?

382
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:16,820
Yes. The urology department doesn't have anyone to accept the patient either.

383
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,670
The ruptured kidney patient had unstable vitals, too.

384
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,960
Generally speaking, any surgeon should be able to patch up ruptured kidneys though...

385
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,310
Chief, you are thinking same as me, right?

386
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:34,760
If Lee Hae Sung was here, it had been different.

387
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,920
Which patient do I have to see first?

388
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:56,370
The rupture on the left kidney is too large. We have to hold the bleeding fast.

389
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,800
Cut.

390
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:03,090
Jung Ddol Mi! Cut, cut!

391
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,540
Yes.

392
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,260
Is this your first surgery?

393
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,550
I said to cut it not rip it!

394
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,820
I've only ever watched it, this is my first time doing kidney surgery.

395
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,800
What are you doing? Gauze!!

396
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,480
What are you doing?

397
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:42,050
Lee Hae Sung, you are the one who dragged an orthopedic and psychiatrist into this...

398
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:47,400
Of course, we agreed to, that's why we're here. But can't you be a little more gentle?

399
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,320
She's not even an experienced assistant, you should've expected this.

400
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,030
Or think that the patient has another fate and move him to another hospital.

401
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:57,670
No one is fated to die on the street.

402
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:00,110
Lee Hae Sung!

403
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:06,230
Sorry. I acknowledge it.

404
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:10,760
I was too anxious. This just feels like sewing with acorn jelly.

405
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,380
And the patient's condition isn't good, either.

406
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,320
Sorry, I'm sorry.

407
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:24,250
This patient, we will surely bring him back to his family.

408
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,330
Suture.

409
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,750
Cut.

410
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:00,220
  If I ever go in a surgery room with him again, then I'm not a human. 

411
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:03,450
 A sea urchin, a sea cucumber. This madman. 

412
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,450
 Better to have just disappeared. 

413
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,070
What's this?

414
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,320
What?

415
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,800
Eun So Yool, get me a better view. Here.

416
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,520
Here, here.

417
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:17,960
Ah, I can see well. Suction.

418
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,200
Doctor, the blood pressure is suddenly decreasing.

419
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,560
Why is that?

420
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,470
It's an arrest. I'll give the epi.

421
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:27,920
We can't do the CPR like this.

422
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,660
You, cover the wound with gauze. Get into position, we'll turn this patient.

423
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,490
One, two three!

424
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:39,390
Hey? Do you see anything?

425
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:45,680
They really fell in here, but there's no wallet or phone.

426
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,850
The hospital is a disaster trying to find a guardian.

427
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:52,270
Aren't they just scared they might not be able to collect the hospital bills?

428
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,600
That, I don't know.

429
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:21,100
Oh, blood pressure and pulse have returned.

430
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,500
Must have been shock from the second bleeding.

431
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,380
Wait.

432
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,330
How is the patient's creatinine count? And the GFR?

433
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:34,200
Creatinine count is normal. GFR is also within the normal range.

434
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,550
Perhaps?

435
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:39,040
Yes, he will live even with just one kidney. Cut.

436
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,600
No. We haven't even met his guardian yet.

437
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,080
We don't even know if he has any genetic disease in his family. If we just remove one of his kidney like thisâ€”

438
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,320
Living on dialysis is still better than being dead.

439
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,710
If you continue this, you'll face another lawsuit.

440
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:52,290
If he lives and files a lawsuit,

441
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:54,410
I'll be thankful.

442
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:06,890
Um, if you really need to get an interview, I can do it, too.

443
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,750
 Sister! The bed is ready, right? 

444
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,020
Yes!

445
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:17,120
Is this the patient that Mirae Hospital refused?

446
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:19,300
Wait.

447
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,950
I'll ask only a few questions, a few.

448
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,250
Hurry and come, let's eat.

449
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,730
Are you not going home?

450
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,370
Ah, I'll come right back here anyway.

451
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:33,370
Why? Did you guys fight again?

452
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:35,170
This time I left.

453
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:43,930
It's just so annoying to hear again and again about how many die in this line of duty.

454
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:46,080
She said we should just open a chicken place.

455
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,160
Is that something you can just say to a rescue team captain, who even came from the marines?

456
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,280
That's because you always like to drink with those beggar-like people.

457
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,630
Ah, Captain! I'm really embarrassed!

458
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,110
Well you can't just let them jump!

459
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,830
You have to coax them to go home.

460
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,950
You should go home, Captain.

461
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,760
Until she comes here begging, I'll never go home.

462
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,410
It's because the mom's like that.

463
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:08,270
Even my daughter thinks lightly of me.

464
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:10,660
Ah, are you not watching the news? The tower crane accident should come out.

465
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,000
We might appear on it!

466
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:20,090
Aiyoo, what earthquake. Give that to me.

467
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,690
We should watch about our rescue.

468
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:24,830
I was pretty cool today.

469
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:27,640
 Doctor Lee Hae Sung who happened to be at the scene. 

470
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,940
 Fulfilled his mission as a doctor and helped many who were injured in the accident. 

471
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:34,240
 Particularly, a critical... 
- That doctor, isn't that the man from earlier?

472
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,520
Let's just hear the highlights.

473
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,650
 The doctor who refused this patient should know this. 

474
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,640
 Maybe, 

475
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:50,320
 this patient's life may have ended today. 

476
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:56,500
 If he just accepted this patient, it'll only bring in trouble. 

477
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,250
 It's tiring to get embroiled in a lawsuit, you know. 

478
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,540
 He just chose to save his own life as a doctor, 

479
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:05,120
 over this patient's life. 

480
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,990
 Then what was the reason you took care of the patient, Doctor? 

481
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:10,220
 Did you have confidence? 

482
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,050
  At this kind of hospital?  

483
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,870
 The confidence I had is going away. 

484
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:22,060
 Please tell us your reason in accepting a critical patient that "M" Hospital refused, even under these harsh conditions. 

485
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:26,030
 I also heard the operating room wasn't even properly prepared. 

486
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:28,510
 It must have been a dangerous operation. 

487
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:36,340
 I do not want any patient to just die on the street. 

488
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,460
 A patient is someone's family, too. 

489
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,170
 A person that's okay just dying on the street... 

490
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:48,520
 does not exist. 

491
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:03,900
Did brother-in-law call me in here just to show off how good this doctor is?

492
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,500
This doctor has many problems. And he's very uncooperative.

493
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,480
His lawsuits...

494
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,290
In the last 6 months, we've spent nearly $600 thousand just for his lawsuits alone.

495
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:15,500
If we let Dr. Lee Hae Sung back in...

496
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,370
The hospital's head is me, Hyung-nim.

497
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:21,780
If the hospital gets ruined, the incurable disease that you're researching,

498
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,740
how are you going to do it?

499
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,240
Didn't you want to Ji Won to get better?

500
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,400
I want to heal him a million times.

501
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,900
It's because of me that the son caught that disease in the first place.

502
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:38,730
If it's hard for you to create a good hospital  according to my wishes,

503
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:40,250
then you...

504
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,840
will have to let go of your position as head of the hospital.

505
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,250
Hyungnim!

506
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:48,900
I came here to celebrate the completion of my thesis.

507
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,080
What have I done?

508
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,370
You know doctor Lee Hae Sung well.

509
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:58,050
An emergency room that was fine turned into a rollercoaster.

510
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,880
It really makes me dizzy.

511
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,230
I might have to prescribe him some pills.

512
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:04,580
Me, too, Doctor.

513
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:09,160
Since I was young, playing with Lee Hae Sung gave me energy.

514
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,360
I met him in such a long time and he didn't even buy me food.

515
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,310
He doesn't even know we are leaving.

516
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,360
He's such a bad guy.

517
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:19,290
But still, I feel good.

518
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:22,680
A feeling where I saved someone.

519
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,690
That's right.

520
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:30,310
 I'm always just looking at depressed, insomniac and obsessive-compulsive patients. 

521
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:31,950
 It feels fresh and nice... 

522
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,730
Here.

523
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,420
If you don't want it then never mind.

524
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,330
The urine?

525
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:51,500
Just like the oil fields in Saudi Arabia, it's flowing out well.

526
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:55,510
Hey, did you see me on the news?

527
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,420
You didn't see?

528
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,560
I came out really well.

529
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,830
This ringtone...

530
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,100
You said you didn't have battery.

531
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,020
I asked the nurse to charge it while I was operating.

532
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:17,030
Yes, Director, it's Jung Ddol Mi.

533
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,800
  Where are you? 

534
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,430
Ah, there was a situation, so I couldn't...

535
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,360
 I heard it all already. 

536
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,400
 The hospital was looking all over for you. You're just doing whatever you want. 

537
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,960
 Are you looking down on our hospital? 

538
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,950
 You think so lightly of our hospital? 

539
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:32,520
How can it be?

540
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,490
 You don't have to come back. We already found another person for the surgery tomorrow. 

541
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:37,830
No! I will go, I will be there fast!

542
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:41,620
 No, if your resting, just have a nice rest. 

543
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,660
I'm coming! I'll join the surgery, Director!

544
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,470
 Don't you dare come! 

545
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:49,270
 You've been fired! Fired, I tell you! 

546
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,670
Director! Director!

547
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,870
Ah, I'm gonna go crazy.

548
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:06,380
 The number you dialed... 

549
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,810
 can't be connected as this time. 

550
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:09,990
Why?

551
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,870
This is your 3rd year, right?

552
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,240
Ah, that's a waste, there is still a year left.

553
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,270
I will go.

554
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:20,040
Even if all the planes and trains are not open?

555
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,960
The subway is still open until early in the morning.

556
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,540
Then go, good work today.

557
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,050
Um...

558
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,710
Why?

559
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,810
I wanted to go with the hospital ambulance.

560
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:18,710
I left my wallet at the hospital, so if you could give me some cab fare,

561
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:20,300
I don't have cash.

562
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:22,340
What?

563
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,120
I will give it to you tomorrow.

564
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,400
Hey, look over the patient. I'm gonna close my eyes for a bit.

565
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,480
Ah, you can just withdraw from the convenience store...

566
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,220
The transaction fee is a waste.. Look around the floor if there are 1,300 won.

567
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:54,380
Doctor An.

568
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,820
Yes, good work.

569
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:17,720
 I didn't want patients just dying on the streets. 

570
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,480
 A patient is also someone's family. 

571
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:24,780
 So like yourself, Lee Hae Sung... 

572
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:28,220
 A person that is okay dying on the streets... 

573
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,280
 doesn't exist. 

574
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,950
Yes, Director.

575
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:33,860
Did you watch the news?

576
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:39,510
Because of Lee Hae Sung saving that patient, the hospital's image was beaten to the ground.

577
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,710
Does Mirae Hospital really need someone like Lee Hae Sung?

578
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:45,290
Find out the patient's identity.

579
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:48,160
As it all happened in the emergency room,

580
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,110
you, Chief Kang, should hold all responsibility.

581
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:05,870
Oh, Nurse On Jung Won.

582
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:09,490
The patient that came in with a ruptured kidney, do you know who he is?

583
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:10,740
No.

584
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:15,860
119 was already looking for something that might help with identification, but they still haven't found any.

585
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:20,940
Ah, but the woman he was in the car with is in our hospital.

586
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,690
Does it hurt a lot?

587
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:49,100
A little. But it's bearable.

588
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,090
Make sure to let us know if it gets unbearable.

589
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,800
The man beside you in the car, who is he?

590
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,000
Why?

591
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,010
We have to contact his family.

592
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:03,230
Please tell us who he is.

593
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:05,560
I don't know him.

594
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:20,580
Hello? I'm Kang Joo Ran from Mirae Hospital. I called in earlier.

595
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:22,410
Were you able to find anything?

596
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:26,340
It was stuck in the sinkhole, took us quite a lot of effort.

597
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:30,680
Ah, but with this, will you be able to find the guardian?

598
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,070
Why don't we just leave it up to the police?

599
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:37,870
Living in the emergency room for 3 years, our skills in finding someone are not far off from the police.

600
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:40,980
I heard that male patient is currently at Hangang Mirae Hospital.

601
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:42,860
Yes, I'll just pass it onto them.

602
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:46,030
It's the same hospital. My hoobae did the surgery.

603
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:37,860
So, the patient Lee Hae Sung operated on,

604
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:41,090
is Minister Seok Jung Won from the Ministry of Health and Welfare?

605
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:42,950
I'm sure.

606
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:46,790
How can this thing happen...
- What's the matter, at this time?

607
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:49,580
Do you know who the patient you sent back is?

608
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:52,780
Director, hospital policy...
- Minister Seok Jung Won.

609
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:56,140
How can you not recognize the person you just parted with not long ago?

610
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,130
It's the end.

611
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:04,950
Robot center, emergency center, too. Everything!

612
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:08,310
Two doctors trying to fulfill their ambitions, too.

613
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:11,250
Now everything ends here.

614
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:14,050
Both of you, get out.

615
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:16,670
Get out!

616
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:18,760
I'm sorry.

617
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,680
Chief Kang, didn't I tell you to get out.

618
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,520
Please meet with the reporters.

619
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,200
What?

620
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,880
Hold a press conference and admit our mistakes.

621
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,780
If they criticize, let them criticize, accept them all.

622
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:49,340
Trying to block it is already unsatisfying enough, what are you even saying now?

623
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:54,650
The more the hospital is able to accept the criticism, the more certain it is for us to receive the funds from the Ministry.

624
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:01,080
Speak clearly so that I can understand, Chief Kang.

625
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:06,440
The liver ruptured patient that was brought in with Minister Se Ok, 35-year old Kim Mi Na.

626
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:11,170
I believe she has an intimate relationship with Minister Se Ok.

627
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:16,410
The reason we didn't let him stay is because we knew about their relationship beforehand.

628
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:19,690
Judging that placing them together in the same hospital will sooner or later expose their relationship.

629
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:24,900
You, Director, deliberately transferred him to Hangang Branch of Mirae Hospital.

630
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:27,780
Isn't that right?

631
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:30,610
That's right.

632
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:36,320
Seems you two doctors can keep your ambitions.

633
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:19,910
Do you think I'm your servant?

634
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:25,180
Seeing that you just saved a patient who almost died, I'll let you off this time.

635
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:30,150
If I really get fired, when I go back to Busan...

636
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:33,340
you're screwed.

637
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,140
Who are you? You can't just come in here.

638
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:40,450
Who are...

639
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:44,170
Ah, are you his guardian?

640
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:46,590
Vitals are good.

641
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:49,820
Urine is also good.

642
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:55,950
Who are...

643
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:59,090
I have something to say to Doctor Lee Hae Sung.

644
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:01,300
Would you leave us a bit?

645
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,120
Ok.

646
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,820
Doctor Lee.
- Ah, what is it?

647
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:18,330
Did something happen to the patient?

648
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:25,090
Director.

649
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:34,090
The patient, let's transfer him to Mirae Hospital, hm?

650
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:38,320
Seems like you saw the interview and got mad.

651
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:43,180
Taking back the patient now, won't make the interview disappear, though.

652
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:45,880
If he died after getting driven out by us,

653
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:49,360
it will cause us another disturbance and another lawsuit.

654
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,990
Shouldn't we prevent it?
- It won't kill him, don't worry.

655
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:56,930
How can you take care of him in this kind of hospital?

656
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:59,610
"This kind of hospital," you say...

657
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:04,030
You closed the emergency room and ICU, and let go of all the medical staff.

658
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:08,420
"This kind of hospital," weren't you the one 
who made it this way?

659
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:11,890
And so?

660
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:14,430
Since I operated on him, I'll take the responsibility.

661
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:17,190
I'll make him live regardless.

662
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:21,090
If you're that worried, how about putting in more staff in here?

663
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:23,490
Lee Hae Sung!!

664
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:25,390
Not bad.

665
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:31,680
Thought he was just an annoying lanky fellow, seems he has a cool side to him, too.

666
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:41,160
How dare he!

667
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:50,910
So am I dead? Didn't I come back normally while saving another person?

668
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:53,770
You're getting too worried!

669
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:57,270
Phlegm only comes out when you cough it out!

670
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:59,180
What if we get kicked out when I resign?

671
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:05,180
If I don't receive my yearly salary, what are we going to eat? Please stop sniffling!

672
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:07,620
Now I won't believe you even if you cry!

673
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:11,720
Whether it's to your parents or to Hong Kong, do whatever you want.

674
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,900
Put Seo Hyun on the phone.

675
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,700
What?

676
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,170
Why won't you let me talk to her? She's my daughterâ€”

677
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:21,010
Hello?

678
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:26,930
Ha!

679
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,970
So, Professor, about the sinkhole phenomenon yesterday..

680
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:34,670
Something is going on with the earth's strata and the plates are shaking.

681
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:36,950
The recent earthquakes in Japan and Taiwan are caused by this, too.

682
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:39,510
Seoul couldn't possibly...
 - That.

683
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:43,910
In Seoul, too, aren't there frequent anomalies happening lately?

684
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:48,510
This is the image recorded by a friend in Incheon this morning. Look at this.

685
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:54,890
This morning?

686
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:56,810
We'll see it very soon.

687
00:53:56,810 --> 00:54:00,850
I don't know exactly when, but very soon.

688
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,090
 It's a refreshing Saturday morning. 

689
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:18,030
But last night, due to a sinkhole, an accident happened.

690
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:22,220
Why do sinkholes keep appearing lately? We have focused on collecting details on this.

691
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:25,900
Then, we'll see you in a while after these commercials.

692
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:34,260
Are you crazy? Are you trying to incite the public by broadcasting this kind of thing?

693
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:39,280
At least, let the people prepare themselves. When they can take preventive measures, why shouldn't they?

694
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,860
Are you a theorist?

695
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:46,210
Always trying to prevent something! When the people are already nervous enough with the sinkhole incidents!

696
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:50,270
If this goes out, Seoul will be in chaos, all hell will break loose! You and I will be dismissed!

697
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:53,320
What if a real earthquake happens then?

698
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,960
Only then, should we report it.

699
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,170
Hey, 5 seconds left.

700
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:13,890
Something happened to the patient?

701
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:17,250
Please give me my fare to go home.
- I asked, what happened to the patient?

702
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:19,670
Vitals are good, urine is coming out well.

703
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:22,650
What are you doing? Can't you give it to me a little faster.

704
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:27,200
The bank already opened!
- Ah.

705
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:31,680
Nurse Kim Hyun Sook already said she'll look after him. Ah, please let me go home! 
- Ah, I said I'm coming!

706
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,030
You should come back in 10 minutes! Otherwise, I'll just leave this up to you doctor.

707
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:37,850
Yes.
- I'm serious!

708
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,560
 Please receive your cash. Thank you very much. 

709
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,010
What are these scissors for?

710
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,840
It's what my mom used in the beauty salon.

711
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:12,880
It looks cool, and is quite useful at times.

712
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,050
Your plane fare.

713
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:19,620
I'm already fired anyway, I can just go slowly and take the train.
- What? Then just half.

714
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:23,360
You can't take back what you already gave, don't you know.

715
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:27,200
Food.
- I'm thankful but...

716
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,530
can I even swallow any food now?

717
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:34,540
Consolation.
- What?

718
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:38,300
Didn't you have 1 year left in your residency? Yet, you got fired. Thank you.

719
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:42,690
I'm a little sorry, but also grateful. Go drink some.

720
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,920
Ah, how much I wanted to be a doctor.

721
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:49,890
When I went to study medicine, my father was so happy.

722
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:52,500
If he gets upset when I just saved one person.

723
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:56,770
The patient did live but I was fired.

724
00:56:56,770 --> 00:57:00,400
How am I supposed to face my father?

725
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,500
You weren't fired.

726
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:07,540
What did you say?
- I said you weren't fired.

727
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:12,720
I gave your hospital director a call. I told him if you hadn't been there yesterday, the patient could have died.

728
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:17,210
And that I'm envious of him for having such a great disciple. He said you're not fired.

729
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:21,350
What?
- I lived for so long, yet it's my first time telling a lie like that.

730
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:24,480
You should have seen how you looked like; your heart was going to drop anytime, when you're doing the cutting.

731
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,430
If that is so, you should have told me earlier! I...

732
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:30,390
thought I was getting fired, I couldn't even sleep.

733
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:35,700
Wow, I get angrier the more I think about it!

734
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:47,120
How can a rainbow be so huge?

735
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:27,740
 What is this?  What's happening! 

736
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:31,570
 Dong Ha, hold on tight! 

737
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:50,880
 When a disaster happens, the first 72 hours are very important! 

738
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,040
 Our current staff is not even 10% of the usual. 

739
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,190
 We don't even have anything, how will we provide the best treatment? 

740
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:59,050
 The hospital will be closed.
- If the hospital abandons the patients, we will have no hope to live. 

741
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:01,900
 You're alive, right?! 

742
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:05,640
 Under it! There's a man.
