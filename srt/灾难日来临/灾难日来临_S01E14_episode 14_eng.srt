1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,080
  Do we just lay her down like this and wait for her to die? 

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,780
 Her chance of survival is too low. I'm sorry. 

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,660
 You said that you'll save them no matter what, so I should just rescue them and bring them to you. 

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,620
 Save her. Do whatever it takes and save her! 

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:14,890
 The husband of President Lee is reported missing due to the landslide. 

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,480
 Every procedure has to fall within my commands. 

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,340
 The greed to save people by overdoing yourself, it isn't allowed. 

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,200
  Seeing that behind the ear is caved in, it's a subdural hemorrhage. 

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,420
 The elder is in danger. We have to save him somehow. 

10
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,340
  You never even drilled a hole inside one's head. 

11
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,610
 But if we just leave him like this, he'll die. I made a promise with Ji Won. 

12
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:33,000
 I promised him that I'll save his father who got injured because of him. 

13
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,180
It's done.

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,900
It's a success, right?

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,020
You got the hematoma correctly and took it right out.

16
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,550
Now, let's transfer him.

17
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,690
It's done.
-Oh Yeah?

18
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,190
 Episode 14 

19
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,440
-Be careful.
-Yes.

20
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,220
Slowly, slowly.

21
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,960
Good job.

22
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,270
At this time, there is nothing better than Beethoven.

23
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:48,420
A landslide, you say... It's fate.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,160
 This is the Yeonggwang District ambulance. This is the Yeonggwang District ambulance. 

25
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,200
  Mirae Hospital, can you admit a patient who is suspected to have a subdural hemorrhage and abdominal trauma? 

26
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,650
Doctor Yoo! Open a surgery room and request the director to perform surgery.. That he might need to do brain surgery.

27
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,890
And for the abdominal portion, Professor Han will perform it.

28
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,440
Who is it all of a sudden?

29
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,570
The President's husband.

30
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,140
She sent her son away last time and now she's sending her husband away as well?

31
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,990
I'll tell the Director.

32
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:27,710
Yes, yes... Ok.

33
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,780
Everyone, hurry.

34
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:39,660


35
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,030
Come in.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,410
Hello, Hospital Director.

37
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,490
What is it?

38
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:33,770
Team Leader told me to tell you in case that you also might need to enter the surgery room yourself.

39
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,290
Surgery? Why would I?

40
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:40,600
The President's husband is currently on their way to the hospital.

41
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
-Who's transferring right now?
-Ah.

42
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,130
President Park Yoon Sook's husband,

43
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,910
Yoo Yong Tak needs brain and thoracic surgery.

44
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,660
Brain surgery?

45
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,560
- Ah... that landslide? 
 - Yes, yes.

46
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,980
But fortunately, the DMAT was able to provide emergency treatment on the scene of the landslide.

47
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,360
With Professor Han's orders, they are coming to the hospital.

48
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,740
I got it. I'll be down.

49
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,980
Ah, then I'll go down first.

50
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,540
Unlock the automatic doors so we can go straight in when the stretcher comes.

51
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,800
Yes, I understand.

52
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,070
Director, did you just say someth-

53
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,240
I said I can hear the car now!

54
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,940
Put down the side railing.

55
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,040
1,2,3!

56
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,020
He's not conscious and his vitals aren't good.

57
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,630
When I looked at the portable ultrasound inside the ambulance,

58
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,120
there was abdominal bleeding.

59
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,270
And we were also suspecting subdural hemorrhage.

60
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,740
Subdural hemorrhage? 
 - Yes.

61
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,020
The pupil size was different, his skin depressed and there was bleeding.

62
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,440
We made a decision to decrease his cranial pressure.

63
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,520
We performed decompressive craniotomy and removed the hematoma.

64
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,270
You did a decompressive craniotomy?

65
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,000
Doctor Lee Hae Sung did it.

66
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,130
Without a proper diagnosis?

67
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,530
The diagnosis...was accurate.

68
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,700
The hematoma was removed and the pupil is coming back to normal.

69
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,070
The abdomen is your part. But the neurosurgery tools have been damaged due of the earthquake.

70
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,600
Neurosurgery is impossible to do right this moment.

71
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,160
We'll do the thoracic surgery first and we'll take a CT at Inu Hospital since they have it there.

72
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,280
Over there...did they say it was possible over there?

73
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,240
Will it be possible?

74
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,230
Professor Han.

75
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,780
Are you going to enter as well?

76
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,340
Looking at this situation,

77
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:27,820
there's a legitimate reason for performing surgery on a family member.

78
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,160
I'll do my best, Director.

79
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,040
Prof. Han.

80
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,500
If I become the director of the hospital, then you'll become the assistant deputy director.

81
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,320
If I become the President, then you'll become the Hospital Director.

82
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:48,430
Sometimes, there are times when not doing anything is the best.

83
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:53,050
Since we're already going into surgery, just pretend like you're doing something.

84
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:58,680
If you say that there's nothing we can do, what are others going to do about it?

85
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,710
Are you telling me to do a fake surgery?

86
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:08,800
Even if you save him, doing the brain surgery itself is an impossible situation to handle.

87
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,110
Just end it here and let's find the best paths for both of us.

88
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,030
Isn't he your relative by marriage?

89
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:20,890
What direction do you think the hospital is going, after my nephew's death?

90
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:25,470
If it goes towards my brother-in-law's interest, we become nothing.

91
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:30,330
Okay? Becoming the deputy assistant director, let alone the director, is going to be extremely difficult.

92
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,350
Because you're connected to me, you'll probably get affected as well.

93
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:38,810
The world is like that. All or nothing.

94
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:45,350
Since we're on the same boat, I'll trust you and wait upstairs.

95
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,180
You came? 
 - Anesthesiologist, how are his current vitals?

96
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,240
I am giving everything, blood and fluids, but the pressure is dropping.

97
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,420
I am barely maintaining 70.

98
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,760
Let's hurry.

99
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,430
Yes.

100
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,670
Scalpel.

101
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,580
Yes.

102
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,150
  The advancement of Mirae Hospital into Jordan; 

103
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:39,310
  as a result of achieving a new era by the advancement of Korea's medical services into a Middle Eastern country, 

104
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:44,950
 the Mirae bio-industry has been pushed forward in the American NASDAQ. 

105
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:59,100
 I heard the phrase "Boys, be ambitious" 

106
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,590
 for the first time during English class in elementary school. 

107
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:08,350
 My ambition that I had followed since I was a boy 

108
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,170
 was an innocent aspiration. 

109
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,080
 Thank you. 

110
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:26,000
"Boys, be ambitious"  I should remember this saying.

111
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,690
Professor, there is a lot of bleeding.

112
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:31,990
Spleen, liver... Did the kidney even get damaged?

113
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:35,090
I see something. Suction properly.

114
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,670
 Since we're on the same boat, 

115
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,150
 I'll trust you and wait upstairs. 

116
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,920
Professor, what do...what do I do first?

117
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,580
Professor.

118
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:00,950
What did you say?

119
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,750
It seems like a field of view has been secured, but what do you want to do first?

120
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,130
Doctor Do. 
 - Yes, Professor.

121
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:11,100
The surgery is bigger than I expected.

122
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,290
It's hard for me to handle alone.

123
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,810
Doctor Lee Hae Sung should be in the Emergency Department. Tell him to come inside.

124
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,750
Teacher Lee Hae Sung...?

125
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,180
Dr. Lee Hae Sung and the emergency team, tell them to come inside now.

126
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,310
Professor, I can do well, too.

127
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,460
I will do my best.

128
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,520
How many times have you done emergency surgery?

129
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,550
It's my first time for...emergency surgeries.

130
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:33,200
There's a huge difference between regular surgeries and emergency surgeries.

131
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,890
It's patient's life first. You can't put your greed first.

132
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,470
Hurry and leave.

133
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,710
How did you know it was subdural hemorrhage...?

134
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,780
That's why you hear that you are reckless.

135
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,710
Because he got hit pretty hard by the debris,

136
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:49,200
I just assumed that even if there was clotting, it should have been clotting there.

137
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,610
Were you not scared?

138
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,220
Of course, I was. I am human, too.

139
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,680
But?

140
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,850
I made a promise with dead Ji Won that I would definitely save his father.

141
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,710
Seeing him guilty that his father was hurt because of him,

142
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,880
it was like looking at me during the accident.

143
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,550
If he was just transferred to the hospital like that, he would have died.

144
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,580
If he's lucky, he will become a vegetable like my mother.

145
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,890
Hit or miss. I had no choice, but to make a bet.

146
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,530
I should have seen the Hospital Director's facial expression.

147
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,320
About So Yeon,

148
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,230
let's see.

149
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:26,000
It decreased! It seems like it's being treated.

150
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,960
Based on the culture, we've seen MRSA and a gram negative bacteria.

151
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,920
So, we changed the antibiotics to Vancomycin and Meropenem.

152
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,420
I am just hoping she will endure it well.

153
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,270
Doctor Lee! Scrub quickly and go into surgery.

154
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,800
-Me?
-Professor Han is looking for you.

155
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,460
He asked for your whole surgery team to come in.

156
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,280
-Why?
-He said since I only did regular surgeries, he can't trust me.

157
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,660
-Is it really bad?
-There was a lot of blood.

158
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,820
Let's go.

159
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,900
Everybody, get ready! We are going in for a surgery.

160
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,300
Yes.

161
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,600
The hemorrhage is severe.

162
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,320
Liver, spleen and small intestines are all damaged.

163
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,230
Then what should I start with first?

164
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,820
No, stand here.

165
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,610
From now on, you are performing the surgery.

166
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,920
There's no one who has performed more trauma surgeries than you have.

167
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,650
Instead of a professor,

168
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:24,090
the patient needs an outstanding doctor with a lot of experience.

169
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:28,840
What are you doing? To the patient, every second is precious.

170
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,270
Yes.

171
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,830
Our staff should give up their positions to the emergency team and leave.

172
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,110
I packed the liver with gauze. It's being controlled.

173
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,480
Yes, it seems like it's controlled.

174
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,930
Then we should remove the spleen. Let's perform surgery on the damaged small intestines and mesentery.

175
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,260
Remove?

176
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,830
Without any concern, spleen removal?

177
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,530
There's no time with emergency. Quick decisions and quick actions.

178
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:00,200
That's how the patient's chances increase.

179
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,340
Let's start now.

180
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,210
Jung Ddol Mi and An Dae Gil, suction and bovie to secure a field of view.

181
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,410
Yes. Hey, Dae Gil.

182
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,550
It's ready.

183
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,650
Suction!

184
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:26,300
I'll start removing the spleen now. Bovie.

185
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,480
Metzembaum.

186
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,010
Suction, suction.

187
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,340
-Doctor An, hold that.
-Yes.

188
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,780
Cut.

189
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,580
Cut.

190
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:13,220
We were living so well, so what is this out of the blue?

191
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,850
Earthquakes and landslides,

192
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,920
I thought they only happened in other countries.

193
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,720
In one morning, I had to send Ji Won away like that.

194
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,180
Even to your brother-in-law...

195
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:31,940
You never know how long a person lives...

196
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:37,050
Please save him, please!

197
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:42,490
If you are going to take him, please take me, too, God.

198
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:45,410
Noona. Noona.

199
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:48,330
Since Professor Han is working hard,

200
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,400
it will be okay.

201
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,540
You have to be strong.

202
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:05,360
Because the damage to the mesentery is severe, there is intestinal ischemia.

203
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,640
It might spread out further in the small intestine, so we have to cut it out.
 

204
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,370
It's a good thing the intestine's empty, we can just directly separate it.

205
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,810
Tonsil.

206
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,250
-Suction.
-Yes.

207
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,090
Do it correctly.

208
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,190
It should be time to be finished...

209
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,690
He should be out by now.

210
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,020
Hey, Nurse Kim.

211
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,180
Ah, yes, Director.

212
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,400
Did the patient come out? Where is he?

213
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,600
Perhaps at the morgue?

214
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,550
They are still doing it right now.

215
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,100
What do you mean they are still doing it?

216
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,030
Why are you here, Nurse Kim?

217
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,920
You were definitely in your scrubs.

218
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,670
Since the patient's condition is very different than during regular,

219
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:20,240
Professor Han ordered us to change out with people who are good with emergency surgeries.

220
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,680
Professor Han did?

221
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,820
Yes.

222
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,380
Because it's abdominal trauma, Professor Han-

223
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,780
Han Woo Jin, you.

224
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,980
Han Woo Jin!

225
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,470
 Wow, this is awesome. 

226
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,080
 They're really the duo in my fantasies. 

227
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,730
It looks good. Let's move on.

228
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,520
Yes. Professor Han's hands are really quick.

229
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,790
Thanks to you, earlier than I thought...

230
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,420
You guys are really working hard.

231
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:02,120
Although I trusted you to operate on him,

232
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,170
I was curious about the situation because he is my family.

233
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:09,720
After opening him, we found his liver, small intestines, and mesentery to be severely damaged.

234
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:15,050
The patient's condition was serious so I requested help from Doctor Lee Hae Sung who has a lot of experience with emergency surgeries.

235
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:18,560
You handed over the main surgeon's spot.

236
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,590
Are you sure it wasn't because you weren't confident?

237
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,920
The patient... Don't you think we need to save him?

238
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:34,390
He's your brother-in-law and he's also someone the DMAT team saved with difficulty and brought here.

239
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,750
Because if we couldn't save him, the DMAT team would lose it's reputation.

240
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,470
 It would... 

241
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,960
But if the DMAT team's reputation is on the line;

242
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,330
for sure, we need to save him.

243
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,510
But Professor Han, you know.

244
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:52,450
Teacher Lee Hae Sung is not part of our hospital.

245
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:57,580
I know that your brother-in-law has rehired him.

246
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,530
Oh, I didn't tell you this.

247
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:05,980
Vice President Lee has signed Doctor Lee's firing.

248
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,490
The reckless surgery he performed on Yoo Ji Won became a problem.

249
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:15,430
Doctor Lee Hae Sung has absolutely no relation to our hospital.

250
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:18,690
I don't think it's a problem as to whether a surgeon is part of our hospital or not.

251
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,280
If there is an outstanding doctor, we should share our surgery techniques!

252
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,420
Even if it's through an invitation, wouldn't it be a priority to perform the surgery?

253
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,360
An outstanding doctor?

254
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,060
Professor Han's presumptions seem to be off.

255
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:36,640
A surgeon recognizes another surgeon.

256
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:43,100
The brain... since the craniotomy that Lee Hae Sung performed was successful,

257
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,180
I think it's better to finish this surgery.

258
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,970
Please leave now so you won't be a disturbance.

259
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,380
I should let you all concentrate.

260
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,920
Ah. But Professor Han...

261
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,250
Yes?

262
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:03,560
You must, definitely, have to save him.

263
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,410
As much as it's a surgery where you pulled an outsider in,

264
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,660
you'll need to take responsibility.

265
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,630
I was happy because I thought we caught the infection...

266
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,750
Why is the BP going up so much, So Yeon?

267
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,210
Lebetalol IV. 
   

268
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,480
Chart. Give me the chart.

269
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,460
It's a big problem if the white blood cell keeps dropping like this... I'm going to go crazy.

270
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,640
You worked hard.

271
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:14,890
Intense bleeding, unstable vitals,

272
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,540
this is a whole different world from robot surgery.

273
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,070
Thank you.

274
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,830
For saving my uncle.

275
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,980
His head is the problem.

276
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,250
With the small procedure Hae Sung performed on his head,

277
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,160
his hematoma is gone but

278
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,040
the hospital is in a situation where we can't immediately go into surgery.

279
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,490
I was shocked because of Doctor Lee.

280
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,560
I can't believe he thought of that emergency procedure.

281
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,150
I was shocked, too.

282
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,840
I was surprised by that procedure and

283
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:49,410
I was surprised that in that condition, he came back to normal.

284
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:53,180
Even if you try so incredibly hard to save these people,

285
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,020
even for those who tried so hard to live,

286
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,940
there is no such thing as gratefulness

287
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,620
from these people.

288
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,720
Ji Na,

289
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,210
I'm apologizing to you.

290
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:19,090
How hard it must have been for you...

291
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,890
It's too late, right?

292
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,380
I now know why

293
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,010
you left me.

294
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,590
The surgery has ended well.

295
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,230
Good work.

296
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,590
Is he fine now?

297
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,190
He'll live, right, Professor Han?

298
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,940
If Doctor Lee Hae Sung didn't perform the decompressive craniectomy,

299
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,840
then we wouldn't even have been able to bring him alive to the hospital.

300
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:32,210
We tried everything we could so we would have to wait for the results, I assume.

301
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:35,630
Please allow us to move him to Inu Hospital so we can use their CT machine.

302
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,080
Ah, they said that hospital closed down

303
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,300
because of the lack of medical supplies, diesel, and medication.

304
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,270
Then what about my husband?

305
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,580
We can either try to fix our hospital equipment or we can just wait.

306
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,100
What to do...

307
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,980
I thought he would be fine because you're here...

308
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:57,470
I'll take care of the patient so you should just rest.

309
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,460
No, it's fine. I'll take care of him.

310
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,020
Why? You should just rest.

311
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,700
It's a given that I take care of the patient I performed the surgery on.

312
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,700
Do you not trust me?

313
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,010
How can that be?

314
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:15,550
You're an outstanding doctor and you're the patient's relative.

315
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:19,020
I'm not sure why you're asking me if I don't trust you.

316
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:23,820
You should take President Lee and rest a bit.

317
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:30,470
President Lee, since Professor Han says he will personally take care of him,

318
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,460
let's entrust this to him and go up.

319
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,660
Today, his sense of responsibility...

320
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,600
is unusually strong.

321
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,760
Professor Han, I entrust my husband to you. You need to take care of him well.

322
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,430
 Noona, let's go up. 

323
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:04,400
Fill the car with gas and we'll leave in 20 minutes.

324
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,810
 -Yes.
-Yes. 

325
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,570
What are we going to do about our So Yeon...

326
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,750
What about dialysis?

327
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,720
Water is not running, so they said that they can't operate it.

328
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,140
CRRT is broken due to the earthquake.
 

329
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,310
Mother, don't do this here.

330
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:38,070
Will you please go outside? Let's go.

331
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,020
-I'm going crazy.
-What's wrong?

332
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:45,170
I thought everything was okay because we caught the sepsis.

333
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:50,600
But due to renal artery stenosis, the kidney function has been compromised. So, we can't get hold of the blood pressure.

334
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,300
Right now, the angiography is non-functional.

335
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,760
Intervention is impossible.

336
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:00,060
The systolic pressure doesn't drop below 150.

337
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,510
Then that means we have to open her up.

338
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,640
Don't act as if you're trying.

339
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,420
You open up someone's head and perform a surgery on the scene because they have money and an impressive background.

340
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,710
Chief, that's a misunderstanding.

341
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,760
I can't let my daughter do it.

342
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,180
Do not even resuscitate her.

343
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,130
I'm just going to let her go, just like that.

344
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,810
Do you think I don't know?

345
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:26,310
You're just putting on a show because she's about to leave.

346
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,540
Doctor An Dae Gil, get a surgery room.

347
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,510
Doctor Lee, what are you doing all of a sudden?

348
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,590
Is it true?

349
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,720
That you're going to perform surgery on the Takayasu patient?
 

350
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,600
You said you've never tried it.

351
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,040
A novice doctor who has never tried it, should I let the patient die without doing anything?

352
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,070
I looked up questions and everything in the library.

353
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:57,590
It doesn't seem like there's no solution to this which is why I'm trying it.

354
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,890
Doctor.

355
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,860
Are you really doing the surgery on my So Yeon?

356
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:12,990
It's really not easy.

357
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:16,470
I'm not being childish and I'm not whining either.

358
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,430
I'm just telling you the truth.

359
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:24,230
And I have never done this surgery, nor have I ever even seen it.

360
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,450
So I could fail.

361
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,330
Please do the surgery.

362
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:33,310
Whether she dies or lives, I'll know that you at least tried to perform the surgery.

363
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,420
Please do the surgery.

364
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,700
Thank you.

365
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:45,170
-Wake An Dae Gil.
-Yes.

366
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,480
Ah, ah! What?!

367
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,890
Doctor Lee is looking for you.

368
00:26:58,890 --> 00:26:59,940
Ah, why?

369
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,480
Get a surgery room. Patient Choi So Yeon is going to go into surgery.

370
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:26,630
Um, you two can only come up to here.

371
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:29,220
Pray a lot

372
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,310
and you know that it's a hard surgery, right?

373
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,330
Yes.

374
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:35,680
Of course, we'll try our best

375
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,610
but we really can't take responsibility for the result.

376
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,230
I'm sorry.

377
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,120
Yes, yes. I know.

378
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,640
So Yeon...

379
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,690
you have to come back alive.

380
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:52,630
Even though it's a hard and difficult surgery, please trust Doctor Lee.

381
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,840
I'll entrust her to you guys.

382
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,870
Please, please save her.

383
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,830
What do we have to do?

384
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:27,860
Your condition doesn't look good either. The rims of your eyes are red.

385
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:31,960
I'll be fine when I go into the surgery.

386
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:36,100
They said it was really difficult.

387
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,410
I think this will be the best surgery I've done so far.

388
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,390
Why? Are you nervous?

389
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:44,870
I wonder if it'll turn out like Ji Won's surgery...

390
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,650
I don't ever want to see something like that ever again.

391
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:49,370
I don't want that either.

392
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,210
What are we going to do about a surgery that we've never even seen before...

393
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,790
It's a surgery where both sides of the heart have blockage

394
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:01,200
called Takayasu's arteritis.

395
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,910
Using an artificial artery to replace the narrow artery,

396
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:07,260
we need to bypass the affected area

397
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,390
to save the other kidney.

398
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:12,060
The problem is sepsis.

399
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:16,480
Although we have some of it under control, there are some areas where it remains so you have to watch carefully.

400
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,150
Now. Everyone concentrate and let's finish this as fast as possible.

401
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:23,990
That this one night depends on the patient's life.

402
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,660
Understand?

403
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,930
Yes.

404
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:34,060
An Dae Gil.

405
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,360
What?

406
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,560
-Concentrate.
-Yes.

407
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,090
Scalpel.

408
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:17,000
You promised me that you would just close up his body... but why?

409
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,620
Because I'm a doctor.

410
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:26,880
Would you explain what you mean by that?

411
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:32,160
I am a doctor who studied medicine to save people.

412
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:37,110
I'm not corrupted enough

413
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,280
to sacrifice a life for my ambitions.

414
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,610
As a doctor, I haven't abandoned my pride either.

415
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:45,760
To me, those words seem like you're saying you're the doctor and I'm not.

416
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,450
I touched that pride.

417
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:51,620
When the surgery equipment are broken and I don't have adequate staffing,

418
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,750
with what solution will I save him?

419
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,410
I said that we should just go the easy way, but you made things difficult.

420
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:01,740
I understand what you're saying,

421
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:06,580
but I will put my conscience as a doctor in the strength and tenacity of one's life.

422
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:10,580
I've seen quite a lot of patients who have survived in impossible situations.

423
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,340
Won't you regret... getting off of my boat?

424
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:20,430
The problem is where that boat is headed towards.

425
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:25,270
If the destination is wrong, then wouldn't it be right to get off even in the middle?

426
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,350
The destination is different?

427
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:31,420
Even now, how about turning the key around?

428
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,950
No.

429
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:36,540
I will soon arrive to my destination, but why would I?

430
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:40,780
Since you performed this surgery with difficulty, I hope that he will survive.

431
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,680
If something happens,

432
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:47,100
I'll definitely have you take responsibility.

433
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:51,580
A surgery where you even pulled a doctor who has trembling hands because of his PTSD...

434
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:54,840
it seems you must have had some hidden intentions.

435
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:01,210
If you saw it that way, then it's a pity.

436
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,360
Dr. Lee Hae Sung,

437
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:08,720
if he knew about your medical malpractice,

438
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,400
what would happen?

439
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:32,510
One more thing.

440
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,030
If you get off the boat in the middle,

441
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,160
it's a vast sea.

442
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:59,810


443
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:03,440
Both renal arteries are mostly blocked.

444
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,860
The lower abdominal aorta is very widened.

445
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,690
Since saving the kidney is most urgent, we should start with the bypass.

446
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,130
Anesthesiologist, give him heparin.

447
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,790
Yes, the heparin is in.

448
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:17,050
We'll start with the aorta then extend it to both renal arteries.

449
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:18,720
Vascular clamp.

450
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:22,000
It's caught.

451
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:26,380
Ddol Mi, take a look.

452
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,370
It's okay.

453
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,280
Scalpel.

454
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:43,210
Ddol Mi, hold it properly.

455
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,710
Artificial blood vessel.

456
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,620
Hey, Jung Ddol Mi. The thread.

457
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,220
Yes, Doctor.

458
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,590
Pliers.

459
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:16,220
An Dae Gil keep your eyes open and hold it properly.

460
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:21,380
What are you doing? Hold it properly, I can't see.

461
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,220
-Ah, this really!
-Ah!

462
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,770
-Clamp!
-Yes.

463
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,530
Hey, An Dae Gil! Pull yourself together!

464
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:34,510
You'll kill someone! This isn't any other place. This is the main artery!

465
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,470
Ah, I really can't do this!

466
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:38,130
Doctor, change my position.
-What?

467
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,770
What good did you do that you're yelling?

468
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:42,090
I'm a human, not a robot that does surgeries.

469
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:44,540
You can just chose from those lively doctors outside!

470
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,050
Hey, stop! An Dae Gil!

471
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,100
An Dae Gil, you can't just leave like that!

472
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,300
-An Dae Gil!
-I'm going crazy.

473
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,920
What is this? Weren't you doing surgery?

474
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,080
I got kicked out because I had no skills.

475
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,640
Who kicked you out? Lee Hae Sung?

476
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,320
No, they really said that they couldn't do it without you and such.

477
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,580
What did you just say right now?

478
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,910
Doctor Lee Hae Sung is looking for you to hurry up and enter the surgery.

479
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,690
Why? Me? Right now? Lee Hae Sung is?

480
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:28,690
I already told you. They said they can't do the surgery without Mirae Hospital's best fellow, Doctor Yoo.

481
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,870
He's making such a big fuss.

482
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:34,690
So you're saying Lee Hae Sung-no, Doctor Lee Hae Sung

483
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:38,150
said that he can't do the surgery without me?

484
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,240
Ah, I said he did.

485
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,340
Hurry and go. There was no one to take over.

486
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,680
I was planning to rest a bit.

487
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:49,630
Nurse On! Tell Team Leader Kang that I went into the surgery room.

488
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,980
Yes.

489
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,670
 -Hyung Seop.
-Yes? 

490
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,680
 -Give me the walkie-talkie.
-Ah, yes. 

491
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,200
Ah... this is...

492
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,590
This is Yeonggwang District Firefighter Chief Choi Il Seob.

493
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,350
Mirae Hospital, Mirae Hospital.

494
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,830
 Yes, this is Mirae Hospital's Team Leader Kang Joo Ran. 

495
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:16,260
Ah, yes. Team Leader Kang, you're working hard.

496
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,820
This is Choi Il Seob. I'm sorry but

497
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:23,250
how is my So Yeon's surgery going?

498
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,420
 They're still doing the surgery. 

499
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,150
That's taking a long time.

500
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,980
 They're doing the best they can 

501
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,330
 so I'll let you know as soon as the surgery is over. 

502
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,900
Yes.

503
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,800
Please, I beg of you.

504
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,750
Please

505
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,570
save her.

506
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:52,290
 -Chief!
-Do you want to get fired? 

507
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,460
The headquarters has a lot of complaints.

508
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:57,940
Did you two high officials come all the way here to threaten me?

509
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,790
This is fuel and water that's like blood.

510
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:03,990
Instead of going around putting out fire, why don't you send it to the hospital and help the disaster victims?

511
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:06,280
Think about the citizens' situation, too. The citizens!

512
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,570
A majority of the citizens want that!

513
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,870
Supervisor, why are you like this? Really-

514
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:15,430
You interfere in everything. Hey, you bastard. How many lives do you have?

515
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,350
One!

516
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:18,090
-Why are you like this? Hey, don't get worked up.
-That, oh he...

517
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:20,240
He grew up a lot. That bastard, really...

518
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,880
Aigoo, this guy!

519
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,740
He didn't do anything to help but is lecturing me instead?

520
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:31,570
Aigoo, Chief Choi. You must be having a really hard time.

521
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,750
You're working hard.

522
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:41,000
You're working hard,

523
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,220
but if you keep ignoring the orders of the control tower every time, it's hard on us.

524
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,060
We can't work.

525
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,910
In times like this, people need to be well-ordered.

526
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,530
Look at the bigger picture. Huh?

527
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,520
I don't know about the bigger picture.

528
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,090
The weather has gotten cold so the citizens are lighting fires in the early morning and at night to keep warm. Fires start like that.

529
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:58,950
Even now, fires like that are happening.

530
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:01,990
So how can we just look at that and stay still? How can we? Huh?

531
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,420
-Chief Choi.
-Yes?

532
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,940
-Choi Il Seob.
-Yes, speak.

533
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,530
Look at my eyes.

534
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:09,500
Look at me.

535
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,720
I'm requesting this for the last time.

536
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,520
Leave the fires alone and just rescue the people. Okay?

537
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,000
Put in your all into the dissemination of water.

538
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,850
Choice and concentration, okay?

539
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,620
 Listen well to the Politician's words. 

540
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:33,790
 We are an organization. The orders of the organization is priority. 

541
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,500
 Chief! Chief! 

542
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,450
 Chief! 
-What, you rascal?!

543
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:48,220
Who is that person?

544
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,600
Oh, the smoke is coming up a lot from over there. I even see flames.

545
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,840
I guess the fire is quite big.

546
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,770
Hey, hey, please put out the fire.

547
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:57,740
That store over there is my store! Hey, please put out the fire.

548
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,720
-Okay.
- Look here, look here, look here. 

549
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,660
Excuse me, excuse me. You have to extinguish it now. Look here, look here.

550
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,810
Chief!
- Hey, look here, hey! 

551
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:05,930
Let's go.

552
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,490
We're just going without putting out the fire?

553
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:10,480
They requested for us to support the Electrical Corp!

554
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,420
Another firefighter will come.

555
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,560
You're not going?

556
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,390
Citizens, please just wait a bit.

557
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:36,990
This Goo Jae Hyuk will rebuild everything as new.

558
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,080
Doctor, you need to hurry. Her blood pressure is falling.

559
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,970
Anesthesiologist, please hold on a bit longer.

560
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:49,330
There are reasons why other people aren't doing this.

561
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:52,450
This blood vessel is blocked. This blood vessel is done.

562
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:56,300
Assisting in this type of surgery is hard. Not anyone can do it.

563
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:00,010
If you assist with your mouth, you will win a Nobel assist award.

564
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:02,040
Quit fooling around and release the clamp.

565
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,050
Already? It's finished already?

566
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,160
An Dae Gil messed this up;

567
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,650
yet, it's been fixed so skillfully and efficiently.

568
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,420
Woah, it's clean and pretty.

569
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:16,040
As expected, we're one team. When you and I combine as one-

570
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,560
Should I release the clamps?

571
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,100
Yes.

572
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,700
Water.

573
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:36,070
Oh? It's not leaking. Usually when you stitch it up his quickly, everything leaks.

574
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:38,550
Woah, this is really outstanding. This is amazing.

575
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:40,190
Her vitals are good.

576
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,950
Her urine is coming out well again.

577
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:44,070
Now, it's the sepsis.

578
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,690
Now, let's quickly close her up and leave.

579
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:50,250
I'm going to suture from the top. Doctor Yoo Myung Hyun, start from the bottom.

580
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,370
Yes!

581
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,480
She's a 15 year old young lady.

582
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,400
-Cleanly and prettily.
-Yes.

583
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,430
-Make sure it doesn't cry.
-Yes.

584
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:01,220
Park Ji Na, suture.

585
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,130
Park Ji Na! Suture.

586
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:12,090
Yes. I'm sorry.

587
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,120
Electric Corp!

588
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,110
Electric Corp!

589
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:22,220
The rescue unit is here!

590
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,220
Electric Corp!

591
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,240
Electric Corp! 
 - Hyungnim!

592
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:31,650
Look over there by the ventilation fan, I believe he's been electrocuted.

593
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,160
What did you say? 
 - I believe that he's been electrocuted.

594
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,690
Where?

595
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,290
Brother-in-law...

596
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:49,100
What should I do with brother-in-law?

597
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,250
 Director. 

598
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:55,270
President Lee Hyung Tak...

599
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:57,830
Yes?

600
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,570
 Director. 

601
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:02,730
Ah, what is it?!

602
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:11,590
The welfare services wants to appoint our hospital as a base for disaster.

603
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:14,580
Do whatever...

604
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:17,840
What did you...what-what did you just say?

605
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,460
Politician Goo Ja Hyuk came here before.

606
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,700
Ah, seriously.

607
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,470
Team Leader Kang.

608
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:36,130
What do you mean a hospital base for disaster?! What kind of nonsense is this?

609
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:38,330
Director, hello.

610
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:40,440
This is a decision made by the Disaster Response Division.

611
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,300
Of course, it reflected a lot of the Minister's ideas.

612
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,000
The Minister? 
 - Yes.

613
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,160
Of course, the Minister, but all the government officials...

614
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,480
say that Mirae Hospital is like this and it's chaotic.

615
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,000
They saw all about the DMAT participation through the news.

616
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,980
Politician, we don't even have a CT or an MRI.

617
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,900
Due to the earthquake, there is a lot of equipment that broke.

618
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,380
We can only perform limited surgeries.

619
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,760
That's why the staff went out to the scene.

620
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,770
I know, I know. That's why by tomorrow,

621
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:09,330
we are planning to collect parts from all kinds of equipment companies.

622
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:12,620
Soon... CT, MRI and all sorts of surgery equipment

623
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:14,410
will all be able to be activated.

624
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:17,360
There are also many medical staff leaving.

625
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,530
And the remaining medical staff are all at the point of dehydration.

626
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:24,990
I'm sure there will be an addition of medical staff. They are gathering medical personnels nationally.

627
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:27,240
Even though it is a disaster,

628
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,600
this is not even a public hospital, but a private hospital...

629
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:34,100
Isn't the launching as a base for disaster a way of socialism?

630
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,170
I'll deny it.

631
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:42,700
Would you like to have a call with the Minister?

632
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,610
Politician Goo.

633
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:45,980
Do you remember what we talked about when we met before the earthquake?

634
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:49,260
Hospital development fund, $5 billion. And I, Goo Ja Hyuk,

635
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,800
will add on top of that a special support fund.

636
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,990
Are you bribing me?

637
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:57,240
I'm saying that we should work together.

638
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,840
Politician, truthfully, I don't trust the government.

639
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,140
If you don't trust the government, then who do you trust in this chaotic situation after an earthquake?

640
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,480
See the MERS outbreak.

641
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:12,050
The hospitals that tried to save their patients even by closing down their hospital have suffered great losses,

642
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:17,330
but the government never provided a supplementary budget.

643
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:20,050
This time it'll be different. Please trust the government.

644
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:21,860
Trust? Trust what? I haven't been deceived only once or twice.

645
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:25,000
Ah, seriously! Trust the government!

646
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,630
If you don't trust them, what are you going to do? Huh?

647
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:29,120
Do you have a choice?

648
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:34,350
Aigoo...Director, seriously.

649
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:35,720
Politician Goo.

650
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,910
Ah, one more.

651
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,980
Due to his current health, the Minister said that he would resign.

652
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:48,920
And to me, he told me to suggest the next Minister of Health.

653
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,360
He said he will personally report it to the President.

654
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,610
  A hospital base for disaster? 

655
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:01,760
  If Lee Hae Sung didn't perform the surgery on the Minister in Hangang Mirae Hospital, 

656
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,120
  if Chief Kang didn't request of Goo Ja Hyuk to come, 

657
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,040
  if Lee Hae Sung didn't prevent 

658
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,400
  the closure of the hospital... 

659
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,560
If he didn't! If Lee Hae Sung didn't go out with DMAT to save brother-in-law...

660
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,920
If he hadn't done so!

661
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,930
Base for disaster... for whose benefit?

662
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,970
If it wasn't for that jerk, Lee Hae Sung!

663
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:30,470
Why would Professor Han get off my boat?

664
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:34,440
And Ji Na, why is she rebelling against me?

665
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:40,500
Lee Hae Sung. Lee Hae Sung. This is all because of you.

666
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:44,780
Lee... Lee Hae Sung!!!

667
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:47,580
You are seriously the cause of all my problems.

668
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:52,810
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

669
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,960
 SMA
True Medic Award
Park Gun 

670
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:20,470
True medic award. Park Gun.

671
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,840
If the equipment become fixed,

672
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,800
brother-in-law's surgery...

673
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,800
I have to do it with my own hands.

674
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,930
No.

675
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:48,510
Brother-in-law, too! Lee Hae Sung, too! No!

676
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,900
Ah, yes.

677
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:55,450
Chief, you're here again.

678
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:58,060
Ah, yes.

679
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:00,680
Taking care of us when we are hungry and thirsty.

680
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:01,830
To me,

681
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:04,560
if the outside is a disaster, in here seems like heaven.

682
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,990
Have strength everybody. Have strength.

683
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,970
You must have strength. Even if you are hurt,

684
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:14,340
At time like this, eat and cheer up.

685
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:18,840
The government will not give up on you until you return back to your normal life.

686
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,010
We will do our best.

687
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:21,700
Our kid, should I give you this?

688
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,980
Cheer up and eat a lot.

689
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,580
Wow, there is a lot here.

690
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,980
Aigoo, you are eating well, our Dong Ha.

691
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:36,110
Thanks to you, the patients get to eat a lot, too.

692
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:38,410
For the water pipe to be repaired, it will take the longest time.

693
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:41,080
I might have to tell them to make food for patients somewhere else.

694
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:44,280
Oh, come here, come here, come here. You eat, too.

695
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,660
Ah, so nice.

696
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:48,120
I didn't know that you were this competent.

697
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,020
What?

698
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,850
Ah, how could you not have known... by looking at me?

699
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:55,540
Didn't you overlook me because I have money?

700
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,600
A little.

701
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:00,960
Do you really have that thought?

702
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,000
What?

703
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,350
Blue House.

704
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:06,210
No, not at all.

705
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:12,810
To me, construction is first. I need to receive well the business passed down from my father.

706
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:14,310
And then?

707
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:16,660
After that,

708
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:20,080
it's the will of the heavens.

709
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,760
The Blue House is luck. Construction is my business.

710
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,710
Our Dong Ha and thinking of our descendants, I need to raise him up well.

711
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:31,790
Kids. Ahjusshi, with this construction company,

712
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:36,800
look carefully at how I will restore Seoul.

713
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:42,170
You've worked hard! Thank you!

714
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,200
Oh, are you okay?

715
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,750
Park Ji Na! Are you okay?

716
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:53,940
I'm okay. There's nothing wrong.

717
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,570
You fall when there's nothing wrong?

718
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:59,600
Get up.

719
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,900
He's an Electrical Corp employee.

720
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:06,100
He got an electric shock while fixing the circuit and fell 5 meters down.

721
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,750
Same with that person. 
 - Both of them?

722
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,870
- Nurse On, prepare the ECG. 
- Yes!

723
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:13,620
And I'm going to request an x-ray.
 - Yes.

724
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:16,600
Nurse On, bring the records as soon as they arrive.
 - Yes, I understand.

725
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,930
Get them in immediately.

726
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:21,950
Chief.

727
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:28,290
Go into the ICU. So Yeon should be there.

728
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:31,270
So Yeon is in the ICU?

729
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,620
Nurse Park Ji Na, you can't do this.

730
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:44,180
Go and get some sleep. 
Your dark circles have increased.

731
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:47,830
Is it that bad? That you can't look at me?

732
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:50,440
So Hyo, give me a mirror.

733
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:55,160
It's been a while; I don't know where I can find a mirror.

734
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:58,490
It'll get better right away if you sleep. Go sleep.

735
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:03,130
Then I'll come back after sleeping. I really can't stand it.

736
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:08,630
Jung Ddol Mi, you need to inspect the blood and urine bag well.

737
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:12,390
Seeing that she still has a fever, we still might not have gotten to the sepsis.

738
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:15,550
And get me another blood culture.

739
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:18,600
Doctor.

740
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:24,040
Seeing that it's not working at all with vancomycin, don't we need to use another one?

741
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,130
Another one? Like what?

742
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:26,330
Linezolid.

743
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:28,210
- Linezolid? 
 - Yes.

744
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:30,270
It's an antibiotic useful for treating MRSA.

745
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:33,900
I heard that it's useful in these situations where vancomycin isn't effective.

746
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:38,080
Our Busan Chief has also seen much progress with that.

747
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:42,540
Since orthopedic doctors are always in a constant struggle with medications...

748
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:43,940
Okay.

749
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,240
Since it will take time for the test results to come out,

750
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,780
we should give everything a try.

751
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,320
Please give us one linezolid.

752
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,180
  Yes. 

753
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:09,130
Oh my, Director.

754
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:12,150
Oh, Director, are you okay? Your hand is bleeding.

755
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,310
Ayo, I dropped something and then...

756
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:16,050
Should I get Chief Kang?

757
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:19,130
No, no.

758
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:21,350
Will Professor Yoo look at it?

759
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:23,510
- Me? 
 - Yes.

760
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:27,500
It's an honor, Director.

761
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:39,790
How is it after going out with DMAT?

762
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:45,460
It's the same as being in the hospital but it's not safe and there are lot's of problems.

763
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:49,500
It's good that my lips are tight or I would have lots of things to say.

764
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:52,340
Like the fact that someone drilled a hole inside one's head.

765
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:55,930
I also have many concerns.

766
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:58,200
This won't be controlled.

767
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:02,400
That's right. Control is always a problem for us.

768
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,680
Speaking of that,

769
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,900
- the anesthetic. 
 - Ah yes, the anesthetic.

770
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:11,630
So, after going into the team,

771
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:15,240
will you become my eyes?

772
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,420
Eyes?

773
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:22,800
You will be my antenna to my control tower.

774
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,110
I can become your antenna, Director.

775
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:30,600
I will become your eyes, nose, lips and blood.

776
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,780
Please believe me.

777
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:34,410
Continue.

778
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:38,680
Can you save our So Yeon?

779
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:42,850
I said earlier already but I can't guarantee the results.

780
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:48,030
I keep on seeing her lying down,

781
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:50,910
and I also feel like she'll get up.

782
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:53,100
I will do my best.

783
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,580
We'll leave it to you then.

784
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:58,420
During this year's fall festival, she was going to perform because she was on the dance team...

785
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:02,100
Even during the break, she has been practicing...

786
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:05,910
She's like her mom and dances well.

787
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:07,280
What did I--

788
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,330
Whenever she sees idols on TV, she dances right away.

789
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:15,330
She's would have been dancing right away...

790
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:21,390
Although...that will be the end, too.

791
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:29,170
Why don't you guys go somewhere and rest? We'll look after her.

792
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:31,350
Thank you.

793
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:34,230
Real man, Choi Il Sub. I won't say another word.

794
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:36,030
Thank you for doing the surgery.

795
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:38,600
Her life, I handed over to you, so

796
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:42,210
whether she dies or lives, I won't resent you or ask you to take responsibility.

797
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:45,240
Thank you. I'm really thankful.

798
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:49,470
Let's go.

799
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:55,090
  But did you try to make a fool out of me in front of the doctor? 

800
00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:56,390
  Am I some kind of dance machine? 

801
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:59,550
  You always danced in Hongdae. 
 - Oh my! 

802
00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:57,130
What's wrong? Do you not feel well somewhere?

803
00:54:57,130 --> 00:55:01,290
Overexertion. I'm trying to rest for a while.

804
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:03,610
Here?

805
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:06,170
It's only for a while anyway.

806
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:10,670
Get up.

807
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:19,940
Sleep.

808
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:35,000
Don't worry. I have to watch my patients.

809
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,120
If you sleep now, I can provide the service of covering you with a blanket.

810
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:58,180
Give me your arm.

811
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:14,760
You're going to collapse.

812
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:19,560
Take this and sleep.

813
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:32,870
What happened... to my uncle?

814
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,050
Well, it's up to the heavens.

815
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:43,060
No matter what, Lee Hae Sung and I are going to save that life.

816
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:45,940
That way, Lee Hae Sung and I will live.

817
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,800
Thank you.

818
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:15,140
I'm thankful, too.

819
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,420
Huh?

820
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:23,460
At one point, I got to love you.

821
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:27,340
If you say it like that, it really seems like it ended.

822
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:38,390
Because we shouldn't do that,

823
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:42,430
because we can't do that anymore.

824
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,860
What does that mean, Woo Jin?

825
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:20,750
Because soon, I will only be able to see you in my memory.

826
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:32,780
  Mirae Hospital 

827
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:47,600
Do you really have to be like this?

828
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:48,800
Yes.

829
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,140
Isn't it enough to just kick him out?

830
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:53,880
Even though I kicked him out, the problem didn't end.

831
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,440
Performing nonsensical procedures while out on DMAT,

832
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,940
he's shoving these patients into the hospital.

833
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:04,540
As a senior... these nonsensical procedures, I can't tolerate it any longer.

834
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:07,110
You should broadcast it, Chief Kang.

835
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:20,270
Chief Kang!

836
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,720
It came down again.

837
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,060
It's over 80cc an hour.

838
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:33,500
It is coming out well.

839
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,180
Temperature.

840
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:37,950
Oh, it's gotten a lot better. 36 degrees.

841
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:38,880
What about blood pressure?

842
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,260
130/90. Heart rate 80bpm. It's really good.

843
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:44,150
What about the hemovac?

844
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:47,630
It isn't too red. The color is serosanguineous.

845
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:49,610
Doctor.

846
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:52,380
Doctor.

847
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:55,400
Yeah!

848
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,750
You too are great. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

849
00:59:58,750 --> 00:59:59,860
Ddol Mi, you received congratulations.

850
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:02,310
What did I do? It's all you.

851
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:04,670
You did it,...
- Ah!

852
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:11,480
- Wait, wait. 
  - This is Mirae Hospital Emergency Measures Chief Kang Joo Ran. 

853
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,660
 Right now, in the conference room 

854
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:17,840
  Concerning Emergency Department Surgeon Lee Hae Sung's license suspension, 

855
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,450
  we will hold a committee meeting concerning his qualifications. 

856
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:22,450
License suspension?

857
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:27,440
  Every department's head chief, please gather in the conference room. 

858
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:33,800


859
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:37,350
♫   If the day we dreamed of comes ♫ 

860
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:43,460
♫   If it becomes that day, like a miracle ♫ 

861
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:48,220
♫   Will the entire world shine again? ♫ 

862
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:51,960
♫   The day we wished for desperately ♫ 

863
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:55,080
  The damage is getting worse. 

864
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,340
  Just now, my mom's name appeared. 

865
01:00:57,340 --> 01:01:01,570
  Now, I don't want to see anything fall or destroyed. I don't even want to see sick people. 

866
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:05,000
  I want to propose and bring up Lee Hae Sung's license suspension. 

867
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,320
  If you take into consideration that it was a disaster scene and that it was an emergency situation, you can't say that it is definitely a wrong decision. 

868
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:12,860
  Lee Hae Sung, you have PTSD right now. 

869
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:15,510
  You drilled a hole into a patient's head... with trembling hands. 

870
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:19,050
  If you keep coming out like this, I will blow the whistle. 

871
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:22,550
  That I caused a medical malpractice and it occurred with the lead of the Hospital Director. 

872
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:24,700
  Discharge room 502, Patient Im Jung In. 

873
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:27,680
  If you forcefully discharge her, are you saying that my mother should die? 

874
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:28,820
  So! 

875
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:34,390
  Then crawl in front of me... earnestly.
