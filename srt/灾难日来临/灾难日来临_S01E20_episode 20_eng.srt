1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,520
  It's correct to strip Doctor Lee Hae Sung of his medical license who  

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,490
 ridicules normal medical treatment. 

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,630
 Lee Hae Sung! Leave him alone. He's a doctor that saved me. 

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,760
  Due to his last accident, he is not in his right mind  

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,450
  11 votes for "yes" with 7 votes for "no."  

6
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:18,020
  Request for Lee Hae Sung's medical license suspension has been approved.  

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,170
  Please confer with me first.  

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,830
  Accept the two doctors along with the 500 million won  

9
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,770
  let's decide to go with a commendation and lets forget about the license suspension request as well.  

10
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,010
  What? What do you mean I am fired as the hospital director?!  

11
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,380
  Who is firing me?!  

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,400
 I'm going there right now, so wait. 

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,380
 

14
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,040
 

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,100
The Minister of Health and Welfare? Yes!

16
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,340
I don't need something as trivial as Mirae Hospital.

17
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,120
Goodbye! Goodbye!

18
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,820
Oh, wait--

19
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:57,800


20
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,780
  Your phone call could not be answered...  

21
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,260
 Last Episode 
 Why isn't he coming?

22
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,120
Why is his phone off? It's urgent.

23
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,070
Aunt, I'll get going.

24
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,450
It seems like Dad isn't coming.

25
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,550
Why did you take your uncle to the hospital?

26
00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:01,590
Did the Director really treat your uncle as an idiot?

27
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,530
Only his speech is a bit impaired but

28
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,670
he said his cognitive abilities are lacking.

29
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:11,190
Why is your dad digging his own grave?

30
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:18,800
Aunt, just block the divorce and follow him.

31
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,720
He just wants the hospital to be public.

32
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,940
If we give the hospital back to society who is that good for?

33
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,140
It's good for many people.

34
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,940
I don't know either.

35
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:34,320
With Director Lee being fired, what choice do I have?

36
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,140
Okay. Go carefully.

37
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,680
- Is it secure? 
- Yes, pull up.

38
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,130
1, 2!

39
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,990
1, 2!

40
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,880
1, 2!

41
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,850
- Tae Hee!
- I got him!

42
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,280
I'm okay, Chief!

43
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,030
Hold onto him.

44
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,190
- Okay, ready? 
- 1, 2!

45
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,350
Okay, okay. Good job!

46
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,270
1, 2!

47
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,360
Make sure to get here soon! As soon as possible!

48
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,430
Doctor Do, empty a surgery room.

49
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,600
I will look into it.

50
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,360
Did our CT and MRI get fixed yet?

51
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,220
It did but as I just passed by it,

52
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,420
there are so many doctor orders for it.

53
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,890
The line is crazy long.

54
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,330
Then get the ultrasound ready and the portable x-ray ready as well.

55
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,110
Tell the CT room to prepare for an emergency patient.

56
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,020
Since it's a car accident, we need cardiothoracic surgery, orthopedics, a neurosurgery...

57
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,960
We already have 2 general surgeons, so we're okay.

58
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,420
Send out this message quickly and ask for cooperation.

59
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,310
Okay, I understand.

60
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,870
It really is the Director.

61
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,000
Director!

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,810
Blood pressure is 90/50 with a heart rate of 123.

63
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,320
X-ray and ultrasound please!

64
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,370
He fell into ravine a bit over 15 meters (~50 feet) deep.

65
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,740
His chest and abdomen received trauma from the steering wheel.

66
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,320
His leg is in a severely broken state.

67
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,880
You see the free air, don't you?

68
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,030
The mediastinum slightly widened too.

69
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,730
The leg being broken is severe too and we would need to use an MRI to know for sure but

70
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,900
let's decide to do surgery when his vitals stabilize.

71
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,580
The doctors here can figure out the rest.

72
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,520
How can you just leave? Chief!

73
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,800
Chief Kim, the why don't we do cardiothoracic surgery first?

74
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,340
We can't just open his heart and stomach.

75
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,260
The CT scanner is fixed, so let's take it and see.

76
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,900
Then it'll take 1-2 hours more. His condition isn't good.

77
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:46,470
You know our hospital's priority is to carry out the best treatment after an accurate diagnosis has been made.

78
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,070
That principle was established by the Director.

79
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,680
We need to treat him by this principle as well.

80
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,040
But it's urgent!

81
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,140
I know.

82
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,670
If we do as we please, who do you think we will end up like?

83
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,120
The blood pressure is dropping even more! It's 80/30!

84
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,270
Lets do a CT first, then see. I came out while I was doing a surgery.

85
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,090
Chief! Chief Kim!

86
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:13,700
Doctor Lee, what do we do?

87
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,660
What? What happened?

88
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,390
Where is he right now?

89
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,200
He just went into a treatment room.

90
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,100
Let's go to the CT scan room quickly.

91
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,310
What is it? What happened?

92
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,920
- Nurse Park... 
- Our Hospital Director...

93
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,690
- What happened? 
 - He was brought in as a car accident.

94
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,890
Oh, his blood pressure is dropping! It's 70/50!

95
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:45,820
Let's go! Hurry!

96
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,150
If you do a CT right now, he'll die!

97
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,600
Go to the surgery room right now.

98
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,080
What are you doing, Lee Hae Sung?

99
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,720
What are you doing, Lee Hae Sung?

100
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,810
Doctor Lee.

101
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,620
 You can't do surgery, so it'll be better for you to go to another hospital. 

102
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,340
  Lee Hae Sung can only be contained when his scalpel is taken away.  

103
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,640
  We announce the approval of Lee Hae Sung's license suspension request.  

104
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,070
I beg you, Doctor Lee.

105
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:27,320
Professor Han can't do surgeries right now.

106
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,490
Go to the surgery room. My dad...

107
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:37,900
save him. I beg you.

108
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,840
Dad?

109
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,280
I know you hate him and I know you won't be able to forgive him,

110
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,650
but just this one time.

111
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:00,150
Just once, okay? I hate him, too.

112
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:05,670
But if that person dies, he can't even hate you.

113
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,000
Hae Sung...

114
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,120
You know the patient doesn't want me to direct the surgery.

115
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,120
He is the one who tried to kick me out saying I am reckless.

116
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,270
The ruptured spleen has been removed. How is his blood pressure?

117
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,070
Fortunately , it is rising a bit.

118
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,850
Okay, let's look for the cause of the free air.

119
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,530
There will be a part of the intestine that is ripped open.

120
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,220
Since the intestines are swollen, be careful that they don't get convoluted.

121
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,040
- Normal saline. 
- Yes.

122
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,220
Doctor Jung, pull so we can see the site better.

123
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,460
When is the heart surgeon coming?

124
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,650
They're in surgery. Let's hurry and do whatever we can.

125
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,740
How is the blood pressure?

126
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,700
It's going up; 80/60.

127
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,070
Why is it only that even after removing the spleen and suturing the blood vessel?

128
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:37,110
That we can't stabilize his BP, could it be a problem in the direction of his heart?

129
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:41,090
Earlier, about his mediastinum being widened... Anesthesia, how is his EKG right now?

130
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:44,370
He's tachycardic and his EKG waveform pattern is quite severe.

131
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,270
No matter how I look at it...

132
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,500
A rupture in the heart...

133
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,030
You're administering the Epinephrine and Norepinephrine, right?

134
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,090
The vitals are dropping!

135
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,040
I believe it may be pericardial tamponade.
  

136
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,200
If not, it's a sign of arteriosclerosis.

137
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,860
That's not it

138
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,180
I saw his exam procedures and results for his annual exam.

139
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,400
I'm going crazy.

140
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,630
It seems similar to Yoo Ji Won.

141
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,830
Yoo Ji Won.

142
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:18,380
At that time, too, there was a problem with his heart and the heart surgeon didn't come so...

143
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,210
 Doctor Lee! 

144
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:25,550
  upon the dead patient, Yoo Ji Hoon, even though it was a cardiothoracic procedure of that specialty,   

145
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,500
  He forcibly performed an unreasonable surgery.   

146
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,520
  If you can't do it, you can't! Not everyone can perform it!  

147
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,600
Doctor An, please hurry and call the heart surgeon.

148
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,770
- Stay there. 
 - What?

149
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:41,070
We have to call the heart surgeon! Or else Doctor Lee would have to open the heart again...

150
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,850
Then, again, he will have to fight for his license.

151
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,200
I'll do it.

152
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,840
Doctor.

153
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,270
I thought you were being reckless,

154
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:53,160
but I get it now.

155
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:59,970
Opening only a specific section of the body due to the profession is only for our personal comfort.

156
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:08,710
If you want to save the person, we're all the same. There is nothing you can't and should not do.

157
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:15,550
Your judgment was right, and the other doctors and I were afraid.

158
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:19,230
Leaving a patient like this is a 100% chance of death.

159
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,720
What should we do?

160
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,230
Sit back and watch? Should we wait?

161
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,490
After we open the chest area and it really is pericardial tamponade,

162
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,510
I'll remove the blood that's pooled inside that's keeping the  heart from pumping.

163
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,300
Jung Ddol Mi, become my hands.

164
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,280
If you instruct me, I will be your hands.

165
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,640
With your wisdom and experience, with my hands,

166
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,940
since the guardian is here: is it okay if we do it?

167
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,040
If you want us to wait for cardiothoracic surgery, we will wait.

168
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,140
It's right that he'll die if we wait. Start.

169
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,220
Okay, we will open the heart. The free air in the abdomen, Dr. Lee and Ahn Dae Gil.

170
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,780
Yes.

171
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,680
Scalpel.

172
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,900
Open the area from the upper pectoral and to the upper ventral.

173
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,220
Get closer, Doctor An.

174
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,400
I have made the incision.

175
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:28,470
Okay, now, concentrating with all of your senses you're going to peel away the diaphragm, slowly and carefully.

176
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,330
I'm going in.

177
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,790
Surgery Time: 5 Hours and 30 minutes

178
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:24,090


179
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,910
Mom,

180
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,440
dad's surgery ended well.

181
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,330
Even though I hated him so much,

182
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,970
even though I really hated him...

183
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,610
 

184
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,840
The orthopedic doctor said he will go into surgery tomorrow as his vitals are stabilized,

185
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,320
but his leg surgery will be complicated so he is a bit worried.

186
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,410
It's a relief he is even alive.

187
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,120
The only reason why is because he had two experts working on his heart and his intestinal area.

188
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,210
That expert is not me.

189
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,620
It was Doctor Jung Ddol Mi.

190
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,210
Jung Ddol Mi?

191
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:31,490
What do you mean by expert?!  I only did what I was told.

192
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:36,910
I just did the surgery with words, and Jung Ddol Mi did it with her hands.

193
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:40,170
Ah, really, I just did what Professor told me to do.

194
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,770
The heart was ripped and bled, so

195
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:48,010
I pressed with my fingers and the heart surgeon came over and finished it up for me.

196
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,760
That's not something anyone can do!

197
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,160
Congratulations, Doctor Jung.

198
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,810
Thank you, Lee Hae Sung.

199
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,700
About not being able to tell you...

200
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,730
I know.

201
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:17,940
I completely understand, how much you suffered all this time.

202
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:23,090
Even if you hate him, a dad is a dad.

203
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:29,670
I, too, didn't have the courage to hold the scalpel in the beginning.

204
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:37,650
It's true that I hated him as much as he hated me.

205
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:41,950
He is the one that threw my mom out into the streets.

206
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:50,490
I wasn't confident that I could do the surgery without any emotions.

207
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,960
Did you change your mind because I begged you?

208
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,190
Of course, there's that, too.

209
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:02,840
He asked for help with open arms.

210
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:09,930
At that moment, he was a patient, not the hospital director.

211
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:16,170
While dying, a patient that entrusts everything to the doctor.

212
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,200
I'm sorry.

213
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,900
Theres nothing for you to be sorry for. Go ahead and go inside.

214
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,240
I'm tired.

215
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,370
My blood sugar is dropping.

216
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,520
Why?

217
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,790
I'll give you a shoulder massage.

218
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,820
Was my surgery today that cool?

219
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,680
It seems like you're showing that you've fallen for me in this way.

220
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,580
You did a surgery you didn't want to do. That's not easy.

221
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,400
Come here. Sit.

222
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,980
Aigoo, there are so many tight knots.

223
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,310
Aigoo. You must've been nervous.

224
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:23,090
Well, what would a carpenter be expected to hammer in a diaphragm or a heart? (This was so sudden with your inexperience)

225
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:27,330
I know right? Such unexpected situations.

226
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,110
Really...

227
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,330
Cancel my comment saying your degree is only a piece of paper.

228
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,640
And I cancel saying that you couldn't even do what an intern does.

229
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:50,610
And I cancel having been mean to you about causing my chest to "cry." (Referring to her having sutured his chest crooked in a previous episode)

230
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,260
I made you cry a lot.

231
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,040
I'm really mean, huh?

232
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,960
No-

233
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,790
Oh yes, Supervisor.

234
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,780
I'm Jung Ddol Mi.

235
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,320
 Yeah, you've worked hard. 

236
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,420
 I'm so proud of you that's working so hard throughout this earthquake. I'm glad I was able to teach you. 

237
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:26,680
It's nothing. Because the people at Mirae Hospital treat me well, I'm here comfortably.

238
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,920
 We heard that your father was hurt in Seoul and needs to return 

239
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,470
 so our hospital has decided to send two doctors  

240
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:36,100
 in support to Mirae Hospital. They've already gotten in the ambulance and left. 

241
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,060
Already?

242
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,370
 Go ahead and come with them in the ambulance. They just contacted us saying they arrived. 

243
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,110
Ah, yes. I understand.

244
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,790
 It was really hard trying to make sure the ambulance went to you 

245
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:49,690
 with all the roads blocked and the limited gas. 

246
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,390
Yes.

247
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,340
Did they say to go to Busan?

248
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:05,510
They sent an ambulance and are going to arrive soon.

249
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:10,700
Doctor Ddol Mi,

250
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,680
the Busan Hospital's ambulance arrived.

251
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,220
They said to come down with your father.

252
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,840
Already?

253
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,210
The car is stopped in front of the ER, so

254
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:24,040
take your stuff and go.

255
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,750
What are you doing? You have to pack your stuff.

256
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,520
Doctor, we're going.

257
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,170
Thank you so much for your hard work.

258
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:52,370
No problem. You came to volunteer to help us and even brought us makgeoli.

259
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,290
If only you didn't get hurt it would have been better.

260
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,950
We are just thankful for taking this doctor here.

261
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:00,410
Doctor An that can't do anything, you're teasing me now?

262
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:03,960
But where did Doctor Lee Hae Sung go? I don't see him.

263
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,900
Well, he looked tired earlier in the room.

264
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,190
But our original DMAT team member is leaving so far away...

265
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,500
I'll go inside and get him.

266
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,530
Ah, no, it's okay.

267
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:18,400
Professor Han, I've had a lot of good experiences. Thank you.

268
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,060
I'm so proud I saved that high school Jung Ddol Mi back then.

269
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,790
Goodbye, everyone.

270
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,160
Go safely.

271
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,580
- Go back safely! 
- Thank you!

272
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,810
Let's not meet again!

273
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,900
I didn't even get to leave my phone number...

274
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,220
What did you say?

275
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,910
It's nothing. Sleep.

276
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,490
 Aigoo. 

277
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,200
Um, Doctor Lee Hae Sung.

278
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,510
Captain, thank you for your help with transporting my mom to a different hospital.

279
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,350
Aigoo.

280
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,220
But we came back.

281
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,860
- Well, it happened for the better. 
 - Of course.

282
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,560
Doctor Lee, do you have time right now?

283
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,440
I have something to show you.

284
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,660
Will you really be okay?

285
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,210
Yes.

286
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,380
It's my brother, I have to look.

287
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:58,200
Reporter Bae said that there was even a suggestion to put this on the news,

288
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,590
but there are also the individual privacy issues as well.

289
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:06,930
It's Woo Sung's last moments as well.

290
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:12,180
Yes. I'm okay.

291
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:18,080
It's also my brother's last image, so I want to see it more.

292
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:22,940
Since it's underwater, you can't hear his voice so I asked Mr. Go

293
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,950
to bring Na Ri.

294
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,190
Yes, I know. Na Ri.

295
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,680
Aigoo!  Hello, Doctor.

296
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,670
I heard from the Chief.

297
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:44,040
Do you think Na Ri can help?

298
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:49,200
Um, look at this.

299
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:09,620
"Mom. Hyung. I'll go first."

300
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:17,350
"Instead, live long."

301
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,470
"Be happy."

302
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,960
"I love you, good bye."

303
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:37,930
Doctor Lee! The Director's eyes opened.

304
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,950
Did you regain consciousness?

305
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,520
Surgery...

306
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,570
The surgery went well.

307
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,500
Ji Na.

308
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,350
Scratch it.

309
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,640
Scratch my leg.

310
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,180
It can be temporary.

311
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,850
After 3 days, they said that they'd do the orthopedic surgery again.

312
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:31,070
They said it could change then.

313
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,980
Why did you save me?

314
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,350
Are you mocking me?

315
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:57,680
Why did you ask for my help?

316
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,640
Isn't it because I'm a doctor?

317
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:08,070
I'm a doctor, and you, Director, are a patient. That's all.

318
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,790
You hate me.

319
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,680
Of course, I hate you.

320
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,720
And very much.

321
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:21,310
If not, it would be a lie.

322
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:25,560
But my colleague Park Ji Na

323
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:29,950
asked me to save her dad.

324
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:35,110
I, too, can only fight the director I hate

325
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:38,230
if he lives.

326
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:46,120
Of course, how can I dare to fight with the almighty hospital director?

327
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,790
But I wanted to do it till the end.

328
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:53,400
So, recover quickly,

329
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,660
and we have to start again.

330
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:00,140
I'm going to go till the end.

331
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,560
I'll go to the end;

332
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:08,350
I will make you acknowledge

333
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,420
that I was right, that I won.

334
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,460
Wake up from your dream.

335
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,390
Doctor Lee.

336
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,620
Yes.

337
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,430
Since we saw you wake up, would you like some more pain killers?

338
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:35,480
Just go.

339
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,610
Go.

340
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:41,010
- It must hurt a lot. 
- Just go.

341
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:01,220
Yes. This is Mirae Hospital Director Park Gun's phone.

342
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,620
The Blue House?

343
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,220
As soon as I get out of here...

344
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,780
It's too late.

345
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,670
Hang up.

346
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,620
Hang up. Hang up.

347
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,350
Hang up.

348
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,660
Hurry!

349
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:28,110
I'm sorry, but the director received surgery from an accident.

350
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,070
Thank you.

351
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,640
It's the secretary.

352
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,690
He said to not worry and recover quickly.

353
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,690
This...

354
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,600
is the last image of Woo Sung.

355
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,350
To you and me,

356
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,290
he said to live well and happily,

357
00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:00,650
and that he loves us a lot.

358
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,400
Woo Sung...

359
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,600
is really cool, huh?

360
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:16,210
Without regrets,

361
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,850
he left cooly.

362
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:28,970
Mom gave birth to the two best sons in Korea.

363
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:35,520
It's okay to show off.

364
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:43,270
I'll leave this next to you, so if you miss him, let's look at it together.

365
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,600
Mom.

366
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,150
Mom!

367
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,150
Mom, are you awake?

368
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,440
Mom, where is this? Who am I?

369
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,950
Mom!

370
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:23,680
Yeah, your son, Hae Sung.

371
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,190
Mom, what are you saying? Tell me.

372
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:54,500
Thank you for returning, Mom.

373
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:15,000


374
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:19,750
Are you sure?

375
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,560
Are you sure you didn't see someone else incorrectly?  Are you sure it was him?

376
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,380
Look here.

377
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:29,820
 We got the exclusive which affects many people's lives. 

378
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:33,820
 Yeonggwang district houses are more than 40 years old. 

379
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,700
 Those houses collapsed and there was a fire. 

380
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,390
 Are you going to put that fire out? 

381
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:41,140
 The base needs to die for the new to grow. 

382
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:44,810
 That is how the debate for redevelopment will begin and how the homeowners will consent. 

383
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:48,200
 You need to pull out the rotten tooth before you do the implant. 

384
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,040
 Yeonggwang district's development project... 

385
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,490
Is he crazy? Is that politics?

386
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:54,920
If this goes badly, he may be fired.

387
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,990
How can he use an implant analogy there?

388
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,960
Did you brush your teeth?

389
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,830
My son is so nice.

390
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,390
Okay, good night.

391
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,960
I'll meet you in your dreams!

392
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,450
Yes, who is it?

393
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:17,320
Oh, what is it Doctor Yoo?

394
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,830
There's something serious.

395
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:29,080
Why? Patient?

396
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,260
Know that I'll always be on your side.

397
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,600
Even if there is trouble...

398
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,770
Get to the point.

399
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:41,690
The Minister was on the news today.

400
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:44,590
And? He always comes out.

401
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:47,410
And it showed that his politician career is finished.

402
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:50,170
There's going to be a hearing about this.

403
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:51,380
What?

404
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,610
What are you saying? A hearing?

405
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:57,620
What exactly was wrong?

406
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:03,160
The houses that are over 40 years old in Yeonggwang district,

407
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:08,390
an earthquake happened and the houses were destroyed.

408
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:11,030
There are very few residences left standing.

409
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,700
But...

410
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,770
there was a fire.

411
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:19,550
A fire started at a collapsed house. Would you put that fire out?

412
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:25,390
Or will you use your resources more wisely and help more people?

413
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:31,060
Trying to push the blame on me trying to grab an opportunity, this...

414
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:37,050
Isn't this only coming out because I am an businessman?

415
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:39,140
If I was an average man,

416
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:42,030
would you scold me to this extent?

417
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:45,820
This is an unprofessional word, so I didn't want to say it but

418
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:48,850
this is a political corruption.

419
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:51,150
Then if that situation came up again,

420
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:55,050
you would make those same decisions again?

421
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,220
Of course.

422
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:02,200
With limited decisions and resources, that is the best way to protect the citizens as well.

423
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,690
The flooded Yeouido pipeline,

424
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,290
if the drainage pump was initiated,

425
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:12,770
that the firefighter working inside could even possibly die.

426
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:15,670
There's testimony that he knew and still put him inside.

427
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,060
I solemnly swear, I did not know.

428
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:25,020
Here is the testimony from the drainage pump engineer.

429
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,980
After the firefighter went inside, I heard this news!

430
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:31,490
The radio was not working under the water and even if it was,

431
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:35,310
the decision to open the drainage pump or not

432
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,650
was a decision I agonized over again and again.

433
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:44,430
All the central power was in the sunken pipeline

434
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:49,040
and overseas payments couldn't be made and the nation was nearing a nationwide bankruptcy.

435
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,830
There was only one decision to make;

436
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,970
to save a nation.

437
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:09,650
Although a life is very precious and wasteful like this,

438
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,740
it was needed.

439
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,260
If you punish me for allowing this mission to continue, I will accept the punishments.

440
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:26,030
But...

441
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,530
this electricity,

442
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,790
all your phones,

443
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:38,740
everything, it was due to that young firefighter.

444
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,850
Without that sacrifice,

445
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:45,430
we would have to run around the workplace begging for money.

446
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:49,130
Yes.

447
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,690
Someone will have to take responsibility.

448
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:54,590
Of course, someone has to take responsibility.

449
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,220
From this time forward,

450
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:06,440
I will come down from my position.

451
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:12,440
As I step down, I ask of you for the last time.

452
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,100
At least, starting now,

453
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,710
please create a law which helps with creating buildings,

454
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:23,690
which can withstand a 7.0 earthquake for all buildings

455
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:28,170
and in case of emergency, each citizen should have at least 3 days worth of food and water.

456
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,300
Because we don't know

457
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,910
when another disaster like this will happen.

458
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,260
What is it, without contacting me?

459
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,570
I had some things to think about.

460
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:01,180
It's been a long time since I gave up on hearing your answer.

461
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:04,240
If you are thinking of scolding me, I will pass.

462
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,880
I heard enough from that room back there.

463
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,540
Marry me.

464
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:16,440
Are you in your right mind?

465
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,580
I came down from all my positions.

466
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,930
I don't know when my company is going to go bankrupt, too.

467
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:26,340
With a clear mind and focus, you did your best to save us from this disaster.

468
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:31,480
The only sin is that you have a private architecture company

469
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,080
and can move faster than others.

470
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:40,370
I can earn money if you don't have a job.

471
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:42,900
A man who begs when he has nothing to be sorry about

472
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,920
is totally unattractive to me.

473
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,780
You're the best out of the men I've seen.

474
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:02,040
 

475
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:13,200
When I was sleeping,

476
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:16,740
many things happened.

477
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:24,120
Rather, I thought that it was a relief that you were sleeping.

478
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,770
Not knowing is better sometimes.

479
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:29,970
Like how I was sleeping,

480
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,460
it seems like Woo Sung is sleeping, too.

481
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:39,150
Someday, he will wake, and run to me calling,

482
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,670
"Mom."

483
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,850
"Mom."

484
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:50,860
It seems like it.

485
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,350
 

486
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:11,810
 

487
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,060
I brought stuff from your room.

488
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,040
The new director needed to take her place so I cleaned your desk with Nurse Park.

489
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:54,130
As for the hospital, a public interest foundation will be established and the hospital will be donated to society as Uncle wanted.

490
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,470
Director Lee was strongly against it, but

491
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:00,120
Chairman Lee is originally so strong willed.

492
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,280
They almost divorced over this issue.

493
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,870
Could you go outside and wait for a minute?

494
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,570
I'll be waiting in the car outside.

495
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:41,250
Do you know what this is?

496
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:57,400
It's your mom's wedding ring.

497
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,770
Like you said,

498
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:07,990
about from her depression and attempted suicide,

499
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,660
I was honestly very embarrassed.

500
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,580
"Let's stay separated for now."

501
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,990
I said we could meet when she got better.

502
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:22,560
As time went on, my greed

503
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:25,700
only grew uncontrollably.

504
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,150
Right now, somewhere,

505
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,400
I wonder how and where she's living.

506
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,240
Let's go.

507
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,520
I already finished the release forms.

508
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:42,690
Where are we going?

509
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,940
You need to go through rehabilitation,

510
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:47,670
where the mountains and water are nice.

511
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:50,290
Yes, where the mountains and water are nice.

512
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,940
Let's go.

513
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,160
Have you been discharged?

514
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,410
Director Kang Joo Ran,

515
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:23,490
save your enthusiasm when you directed the DMAT team

516
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:28,200
and take care of the director position well.

517
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:31,210
If you don't forget your original intention,

518
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:34,270
you'll become a successful hospital director.

519
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,670
I hope for you're speedy recovery.

520
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,190
Doctor Lee Hae Sung.

521
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,450
Yes.

522
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:43,420
You said for me to acknowledge you.

523
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:47,560
In this fight, who was right?

524
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,730
Yes.

525
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:52,690
But since the fight hasn't ended yet,

526
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:55,690
that acknowledgement will not come out easily.

527
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:58,580
Even though my body became like this,

528
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:03,940
I won't give up or fall down.

529
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,880
I would not have even expected it

530
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,770
if it was an acknowledgement easily said.

531
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:13,750
Rather than an easy enemy, a hard one is better.  Isn't it?

532
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:17,020
I also hate an easy opponent.

533
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:20,450
Professor Han Woo Jin.

534
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:21,440
Yes.

535
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,340
You swim well.

536
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,730
You survive well, even at open sea.

537
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:30,880
With my eyes closed, I am seeing what I was not able to see before.

538
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,590
I think I've become a real doctor now.

539
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:36,600
It's good to see that you all seem to be overflowing with such drive.

540
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:40,160
Then the unwelcome guest will...

541
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,300
Ji Na, let's go.

542
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,930
Go inside.

543
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:13,380
Go.

544
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:21,500
 

545
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,750
 - Oh, Joo Ran! 
- Ja Hyuk.

546
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,540
 Did you receive my present well? 

547
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:45,210
What did you say? Politics? I hate politics.

548
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:47,570
Oh, I have to go. They're all only looking at me.

549
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:48,690
Okay, Bye.

550
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:53,650
Okay, everyone. Keep this in mind. Safety is most important. Does everyone understand?

551
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:54,450
Yes.

552
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:57,380
Mega Construction is building a building that can last for 200 years

553
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:00,170
that can survive a 9.0 earthquake. Lets build it together.

554
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:04,220
Keep in mind, Mega Construction is building the future Seoul.

555
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,130
Yes.

556
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:18,880
It's so nice.

557
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,150
We are not going straight to the rehab center?

558
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:29,700
I want to drink coffee, and I also want to see someone before I leave.

559
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:36,260
Who is it?

560
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,890
That person will take you to the hospital instead of me.

561
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:43,520
Who is it?

562
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:00,770
The real owner.

563
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:06,060
Even though I can't turn back time,

564
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:09,930
the future depends on what you wish.

565
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:15,810
During the short time we have remaining,

566
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,890
we can't live with regrets. I'm going.

567
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,310
I'll come to visit you at the hospital, Dad.

568
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:30,060
Okay.

569
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:13,030
It has been a long time.

570
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:17,610
Sit.

571
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:33,920
You're still the same.

572
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:47,390
Now there will be no more difficulties.

573
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:52,120
It's not the end. The fire station is not even done being built.

574
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,200
We will be using a container temporarily.

575
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,530
It's better than a tent.

576
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:58,790
We can't just stand out here.

577
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:01,710
A new one will be better, so it will not fall during an earthquake.

578
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:04,870
How can a fire station collapse? How embarrassing.

579
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:06,330
Lets go.

580
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:07,600
What? Where?

581
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,180
- A fire?  
- Mega Construction site.

582
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:13,580
Two people are hurt from the floor giving out.

583
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,990
Mirae Hospital. Mirae Hospital.

584
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,650
Yes, it's Yoo Myung Hyun.

585
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:24,320
Can the DMAT team deploy together with us to a nearby construction site where a fall has occurred?

586
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:27,280
Yes, we will get prepared.

587
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:41,120
A stretcher here.

588
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:45,260
Get an ambulance ready please.

589
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:49,990
Sung Cheol, be careful.

590
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:52,680
There is a fracture and concussion.

591
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,210
What hospital are you transporting to?

592
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:57,040
One is going to Mirae Hospital and the other is Inoodae. We've already contacted them.

593
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,500
The one complaining of abdominal pain should go to Mirae Hospital and the other can go to Inoodae.

594
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:05,030
Excuse me, will the patient be okay? Will he survive?

595
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:08,180
How can I guarantee 100% with someone's life but

596
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:10,090
- he will be okay. 
 - I'll request you take good care of him.

597
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:12,850
"How can I guarantee 100%?"

598
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:14,740
Oh yea.

599
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:19,250
Joo Hoon Hyung.

600
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:23,450
Yes, Mom.

601
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:31,270
What do you mean you're nervous. Say everything you wanted to tell him.

602
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:35,210
Okay.

603
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:38,040
Alright, I'll visit this weekend.

604
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:46,360
The blood test came out for the patient.

605
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,470
The sonogram is okay and the x-ray is okay, too.

606
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:58,400
Why is her stomach hurting?

607
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,590
Do you usually have strong menstrual cramps?

608
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:02,510
Yes, I do.

609
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:06,450
Look for fibroids.

610
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:08,010
What? Fibroids?

611
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:11,800
I think it may be in the more posterior area in the back. I thought perhaps it might not be visualized because it's covered.

612
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,300
Oh, there is one, Professor.

613
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,720
Let me see.

614
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,030
Oh, it's back there, right?

615
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:32,140
Yes, it's close to the back. No wonder we couldn't see it.

616
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:35,800
But can you feel it with your hands?

617
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,570
Measure it, it seems about 3cm.

618
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:43,980
This patient's hormone levels came out a bit unusual.

619
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,680
Then it's certain.

620
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,190
I respect you, Prof. Han.

621
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:49,160
Don't just try to confirm through the images,

622
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:53,170
but try to listen to the patient's words. Then you will be able to see illnesses you couldn't see before.

623
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:56,000
This patient needs to be transferred to the gynecology department.

624
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,930
Nurse Yong.

625
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:04,810
Nurse Yong, go ahead and help him transfer this patient. I will call and let them know ahead of time.

626
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:05,930
Yes.

627
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:08,370
Doctor Han found fibroids by palpation.

628
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:10,990
By palpation?

629
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:14,230
Doctor!

630
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:18,690
This patient fell from third floor height.

631
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:21,130
The blood pressure is 100/80 and heart rate is 120.

632
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:24,320
The leg is broken so we made a temporary cast.

633
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,640
He's complaining of a lot of abdominal pain.

634
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,220
The ultrasound please, quickly.

635
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,620
I made the cast myself.

636
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:31,950
I see a bit of free air.

637
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:37,420
The blood pressure is okay so let do a CT and X-ray of the abdomen and transfer him over to surgery.

638
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:41,070
Doctor Yoo, your treatment was great.

639
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:44,130
Thank you.

640
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:47,020
The x-ray and CT, quickly.

641
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:49,440
Wow, Doctor Yoo is now the ace of the ER.

642
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,400
Oh, don't say it like that.

643
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:55,150
I still lack a lot.  I have a lot to learn.

644
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:56,910
I'm still far from it.

645
00:50:56,910 --> 00:51:00,230
I feel the worth of saving these patients now.

646
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:05,480
I don't know if as we experienced the earthquake we  underwent training, but the DMAT team and we are matching up so well.

647
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:09,140
Doctor Yoo has changed so much, he's flying around.

648
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:13,770
Since the reconstruction started, I'm sure more patients will be coming in.

649
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:16,320
So, I was thinking.

650
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:21,810
I was thinking we should have a meeting with the other hospitals' DMAT teams and rescue workers

651
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:23,990
and have training all together once a month.

652
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:29,660
That's what I'm saying. Whether they allow or not, let's just do it. That's how we will save people.

653
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:53,600


654
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,870
Why are you out here? It's so cold.

655
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:58,770
Yes.

656
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:02,690
It's okay.

657
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:03,940
Thank you.

658
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:08,010
What are you thinking about?

659
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,140
In that large sea,

660
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:16,120
wanting to have sailed my gorgeous boat.

661
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,190
What was that boat anyways.

662
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:25,380
Do you feel empty?

663
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,470
Of course.

664
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:32,510
Regretful and I feel like an idiot.

665
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,340
What is this?

666
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,330
Hmm?

667
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:43,370
Oh wow, isn't this my picture? Did Mom give it to you?

668
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:51,160
Our Ji Na, I can only see you this young in pictures now.

669
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,660
But I was not even there.

670
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,800
What was the outcome of my efforts?

671
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:05,230
Try remembering your past days.

672
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:07,050
My photos?

673
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:12,590
School Society, dinner with the employees, or a seminar?

674
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:16,240
Also scolding Nurse Park Ji Na.

675
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:22,690
A useless stubborn attitude, that is probably all of my life.

676
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,440
Make your life now, it's still not too late.

677
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,390
Why?

678
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:34,810
Why was there no thankfulness?

679
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:40,700
Why was there no contentment?

680
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:46,030
Desire makes a man into a fool .

681
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:47,920
I know, right?

682
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:54,720
Your mom didn't change at all. I seem to be the only one that aged.

683
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,330
She tried so very hard to become happy

684
00:53:58,330 --> 00:54:01,090
and also tried to protect me.

685
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:03,210
She could have remarried.

686
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:07,120
Was she too burned by you?

687
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,770
She says that she can't believe a man anymore.

688
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:15,260
She doesn't like relying on anyone and she wants to find happiness herself.

689
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:19,690
I only did spiteful things.

690
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,610
In this worthless life.

691
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:29,050
What are you going to do about our staffing?

692
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:32,490
Intensive care and minor care,  if you want to make the ER a dual layer treatment area,

693
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:34,660
the basic salary of each person is 200 million won!

694
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:38,540
I know but there are not that many applicants! They're the worst picks from the bottom of the barrel...

695
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:40,720
Should we return the 500 million won we received from the government?

696
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,240
I can't do that!

697
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:47,970
Thats why find the most vital doctors for this program.

698
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:49,130
If not, you're really--

699
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:52,150
What? Are you going to fire me?

700
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:54,590
Do you think I can't?

701
00:54:54,590 --> 00:55:00,480
How does it seem that you're slowly turning into Director Park Gun? It seems everyone who sits here becomes like that.

702
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,610
Okay, I'll find someone.   Give me some time.

703
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:04,820
How much?

704
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:06,540
Well, about 2 days?

705
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:08,740
How can the Chief be absent for so long?

706
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:11,450
Please cover for me in the ER.

707
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:14,440
Is there a law that says that the Chairman has to just sit and stay here?

708
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,280
This will be enough.

709
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:33,370
She will like it.

710
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,760
Why?

711
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,430
Do you not know today is my free day?

712
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:56,630
It's my free day after so many days. Why are you looking for me?

713
00:55:56,630 --> 00:56:02,540
Ah, I got it. I got it. I'm going. If I go and there's nothing, you're dead.

714
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:09,230
2nd year resident, Oh Man Suk

715
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,800
Are you not going to reply?

716
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:12,990
Yes.

717
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:16,700
Hey, your patient fell and says their arm hurts.

718
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:20,500
How can you only take an x-ray of the arm?

719
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:26,700
How can you not think that the arm might hurt because they broke their shoulder?

720
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:28,790
They didn't say that their shoulder hurt.

721
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:31,150
Hey, then would the patient know for himself to say,

722
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:34,850
"Oh, my arm hurts, and I think it's because my shoulder is broken,

723
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:38,550
so let's take an x-ray of the shoulder." Like that?

724
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:44,090
Orthopedics are getting looked down on  because of people like you!

725
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:48,550
Do you have your head on as an option for your shoulders?

726
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:50,650
 Intern An Dae Gil, 

727
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:54,120
 do you have your head on as an option for your shoulders? 

728
00:56:57,230 --> 00:57:01,150
If you call a 4th year who needs to study for the specialty board exams over something so trivial as this

729
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:04,160
you will need to go pick out a coffin.

730
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,690
Whatever you do, you...

731
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:12,170
 Whatever you do, you guys figure it out 

732
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:15,040
Wow, I'm going crazy. I'm going crazy.  Why am I like this?

733
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:15,910
Yes?

734
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:18,230
What are you doing?

735
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:20,740
Get a surgery date for the patient whose shoulder is dislocated.

736
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:25,060
Give him narcotics to relieve his pain and keep a close eye on him. Do you understand?

737
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:27,470
What are you doing not running?

738
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:31,210
- What is he doing? 
 - You're almost here? Okay

739
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:34,560
- They don't even let me rest properly. 
- Alright, I will have a doctor on standby.

740
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:39,300
Doctor, the firefighters are bringing an injured man.

741
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:39,890
Huh?

742
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:43,570
After falling from the airport escalator, they say he has a compound fracture.

743
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:47,660
- What are you doing 2nd year?! 
- You just sent him to get a surgery date not long ago.

744
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:49,920
Oh, it's my day off. My day off...

745
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,220
Everyone else is in surgery right now so they can't come. You see them before you go Doc.

746
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:54,290
It's my day off...

747
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:56,320
Ah, seriously.

748
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,840
Stretcher!

749
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:05,350
Patient? Where is it? What hurts?

750
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:10,470
Just a moment.

751
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,510
 Oh, you can't! 

752
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,070
Guardian, how did the patient--

753
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:25,150
Guardian.

754
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:32,740
Oh. Oh!

755
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:34,440
So cute, seriously.

756
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:45,210
After not seeing me for so long, you aren't even going to greet me?

757
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:46,620
Hi.

758
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,940
What kind of greeting is that?

759
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:52,120
Hello.

760
00:58:57,690 --> 00:59:02,280
You seem like you're doing fine. Seeing you come out to check on patient when they come.

761
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:10,010
Why did you come? Shall I call someone for you? Do you want me to call someone from our hospital for you?

762
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:13,610
Yeah. Call Professor Jung Ddol Mi.

763
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:16,060
Huh?

764
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:19,070
Hey. You don't want me here? Should I go?

765
00:59:19,070 --> 00:59:21,220
It's kind of weird to chase someone away.

766
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:22,880
What reason do I have to to call you?

767
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,430
Jung Ddol Mi, you really aren't happy to see me?

768
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:29,570
I came all the way to Busan...

769
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:34,190
Doctor, do you think I need to

770
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:37,600
greet you like a dog wagging his tale?  I'm not going to.

771
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:42,760
Why am I happy to see someone who didn't even call once?

772
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:48,750
We ate together, starved together, did surgery together, and even shared the same bed. Yet we're nothing to each other, right?

773
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:59,500
Okay. I got it. I'll contact you when I get to Seoul.

774
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,810
Oh, right.

775
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:08,040
This is a present. Ah, it's so pretty! It suits you so much better than that! I'm going.

776
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:10,460
- Doctor. 
- Why?

777
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,830
Even though I have to leave, let me hear your answer before I go.

778
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:25,840
- How is Seoul? 
- I hate it.

779
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,330
- What about me? 
- I hate you more.

780
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:28,660
Why?

781
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:31,400
I just hate you.

782
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:41,690
This is Jung Ddol Mi.

783
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:42,940
What?

784
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,820
Then what do--

785
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,220
Something big happened.

786
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:54,080
Doctor, the earlier patient didn't have any orthopedic doctor so they asked me to take care of him.

787
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:57,700
Really? That's great. We have make sure that patient gets to see tomorrow.

788
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:00,990
Jung Ddol Mi,

789
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,960
let's do surgery.

790
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:19,620


791
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:31,490
 Thank you, even though this world is in pain 

792
