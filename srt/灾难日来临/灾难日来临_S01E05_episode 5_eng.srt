1
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,000
 An unprecedented magnitude of 6.5 earthquake has hit Seoul. 

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,950
 Being the most powerful earthquake that has ever occurred in Korea, 

3
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:16,010
 electricity, gas, and water supply have all been suspended. 

4
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,350
 To citizens currently listening to this broadcast, please evacuate from your buildings. 

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,850
 Please move to any nearby shelters. 

6
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,620
  I said the building might collapse! 

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,270
 No! 

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,590
 You are alive, right? 

9
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,720
 You must be alive. 

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,620
 I said there are people. 

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,930
 We don't have enough supplies, s0 how can we do our best? 

12
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,230
 We should close the hospital. 

13
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,170
Must stay open.

14
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,060
 Can you take the responsibility, Chief Kang? 

15
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,210
 Give me the right to command this hospital. 

16
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,690
 Will we be able to take all these people
to Hanseo University Hospital? 

17
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,190
 We will go to Mirae Hospital. 

18
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:59,960
 This doctor isn't from Mirae Hospital; therefore, we can't accept you guys. 

19
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,450
 There are so many lives that cannot be protected, Director. 

20
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:08,050
 If the hospital abandons the patients, then we have no hope to live. 

21
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,730
 You must remember that urgent promise earlier. 

22
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,860
 From now on, Mirae Hospital is running the emergency system. 

23
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,190
 The hospital isn't abandoning you guys. 

24
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,300
  In front of the earthquake, this is the best we could do. 

25
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,950
 Please be understanding. 

26
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,390
 Episode 5 

27
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,020
Thank you, Doctor.

28
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,740
Go safely.

29
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,660
Jung Ddol Mi.

30
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,620
Why didn't you return to Busan?

31
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,560
Uh.. I see you remember me.

32
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,940
While coming here to Mirae Hospital, I wanted to see you. 
 Somehow, it turned out like this.

33
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,000
I thought you didn't remember me.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,800
Jung Ddol Mi, how can I forget that name?

35
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,340
You said you were in 11th grade, right?

36
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:06,180
Right. I was about to die from a car accident but you opened up my stomach and saved me.

37
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,340
You were so awesome then, 
Doctor, that I felt like I had to go to medical school.

38
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,660
I really wanted to meet you once.

39
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,200
But...

40
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,240
But what?

41
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,300
Are you really the doctor I knew then?

42
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,720
That time, even without anesthesia at a poor hospital,

43
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,020
you opened my stomach and saved me, but...

44
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,380
Let me ask you one thing.

45
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:37,200
Haven't you ever whined because the scar 
on your stomach is long?

46
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,700
I was young so....

47
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,040
It's a given that patients are like that, because "It's my body.

48
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,780
I am in pain, so I have no choice but to be selfish."

49
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,000
I did surgery without anesthesia and saved you?

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,280
It's not a legend. I did a crazy thing and just got lucky.

51
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,400
I'm saying you survived because you were lucky.

52
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,260
Don't think that the same thing will happen to all these patients here,

53
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,680
because that confusion will put many more patients in danger.

54
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,260
Then if the Doctor Han back then was like Doctor Han now,

55
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,840
would I have died?

56
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:30,300
Do you regret doing a crazy thing to save me?

57
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,300
No.

58
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,320
I just don't want to do it again like that.

59
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,000
You asked for me?

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,840
You're a bit late.

61
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,220
This situation right now... this hospital can't handle it.

62
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,620
Regardless, it's the only for two days.
 Doing all that can be done in two days,

63
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:17,580
we'll cover our insufficiency in disaster preparation and avoid denounces.

64
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:22,260
If something happens, Chief Kang will be responsible.

65
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,660
The saying that all lives are the same is wrong.

66
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,960
This person's life is different. He is an important person to us.

67
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,100
This is the line you once let go of.

68
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,560
Take responsibility and care for him. Save him

69
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,480
and catch it again.
 -I understand.

70
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,690
We give up on patients who need massive blood transfusions.

71
00:04:54,690 --> 00:05:00,580
Problems with muscles and bones, then lead to amputation. We are running out of blood.

72
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,780
The patients keep coming in. Please take them quickly.

73
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,640
Everyone heard? For now, we need to take them all in.

74
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,240
Let's first do what we can, and accept help, from the hospitals' doctors.

75
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,120
Let's go see the patients then. 
 -Yes.

76
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,520
Are you ok?

77
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,720
Yes. It's the start, but I'm like this.

78
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,660
Get some rest as your hand's injured.  Let us handle it.

79
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,460
But where is Dong Ha? Where did you keep him?

80
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,000
Chief.

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,620
I can't find him.

82
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:07,800
He was with me in the car.  Once I opened my eyes, he was gone.

83
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,260
I tried looking everywhere.  He wasn't there.

84
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:20,660
He was riding in the back seat with his toy,

85
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,980
and only the toy was found there.

86
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:30,160
What should we do?  Instead of you coming here, shouldn't you be looking for him?

87
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:37,200
Dong Ha knows.  If anything happens, we decided to meet at the hospital.

88
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,560
Just as I'm taking care of the patients here,

89
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,440
someone will be protecting Dong Ha like that.

90
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,720
He will survive and we will meet.

91
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,320
He will definitely survive and we will meet.

92
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,820
Of course, Chief.

93
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:16,040
Ok, only the red (emergencies) are being sent in. If we can't triage, we won't save even the save-able.

94
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:32,080
Doctor, please look at my son.

95
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,220
His blood pressure is 70/50.

96
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,260
The pulse is over 140.

97
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,640
How did he get hurt?

98
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,720
A car hit him when the earthquake happened,
his stomach was hurt by the bumper!

99
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,320
Here! Mr. Min Seok! Hurry!

100
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,720
It's okay. He will be okay.

101
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,600
Doctor, please save my son. I beg you.

102
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,820
Consider him as priority.

103
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,120
Doctors, we're ok here. Please get blankets to the patients outside. They've run out.

104
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,900
Again? What about the orderlies?

105
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,690
Ugh, that rock-headed nurse. Doesn't she know that I'm an intern that came in by proper procedure?

106
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:31,190
Isn't it because she knows the way around this hospital well?

107
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,710
And me? Does she think this is a food nutritionist's gown? She keeps on ordering me about.

108
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:40,990
Food nutritionist? Well, you're similar to a soul nutritionist.

109
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,450
That sounded like praise.  Thank you.

110
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:04,290
This way!

111
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,530
Oh my, are you ok?

112
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,990
Careful. You've to be careful.

113
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,350
This won't do.  Hop on my back.

114
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,020
Here.  Hop on brother's back.

115
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,490
Here we go.

116
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,990
Blow it harder.

117
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:34,290
Everyone, don't be scared. Follow the whistle.

118
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,670
Then...

119
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,870
are we still far from getting out?

120
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,470
Just a little more.

121
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,570
Be strong, everyone!
 We're almost there!

122
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,850
Watch out!

123
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,040
That way.

124
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,880
Be careful.

125
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,940
The convenience store across the street is completely busted.

126
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,470
I picked up a few things that rolled out.

127
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,460
Anything else? Isn't there anything else to eat?

128
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,510
There were people who crawled in there and pulled items out,

129
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,670
but how can a rescue team do that?

130
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,490
Hey you jerk, you think saving your face feeds you?

131
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,840
We have to eat to have strength,
 and we need strength to rescue people.

132
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,570
Chief, is there no call from HQ?

133
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,230
When will we get supplies?

134
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,250
Is there no rotation?

135
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,780
I'm so tired I can't do this anymore.

136
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,600
I'm tired, too.

137
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,980
This radio has to work first!
There's no place to charge it.

138
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,670
We'll have to rescue more people.

139
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,100
Ah, I don't know, I don't know!

140
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,890
I can't even take care of my own body, but what's with the rescue?

141
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,230
Chief! Chief!

142
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,540
What is it?!!

143
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,690
People are escaping from the subway at the Yeonggwang station.

144
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,670
Subway? Let's go.

145
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,990
Hold my hand.

146
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,380
Right. Be careful. Quickly.

147
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,990
Be careful.

148
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,740
Come this way.

149
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,450
Yes. Hold my hand.

150
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,860
Good.

151
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,900
Here. Be careful.

152
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,260
Careful.

153
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,180
That's good. That's good.

154
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,510
  Don't run!  Don't run! 

155
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,790
  You can walk, walk! 

156
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,790
 Help them out. 

157
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,370
Hey, friend!

158
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,840
You. You were alive!

159
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,010
Seob, you came to find me! My friend!

160
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,980
I said to stop that friend thing!

161
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,230
Are you okay? 
- Yes. I'm fine.

162
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:44,170
I took all the....oh, that guy. Recruit him for your rescue team.

163
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,810
That guy is strong, and has leadership just like me.

164
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,280
What are you saying?

165
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,000
Good job.

166
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,980
That friend blew a whistle in that dark place and made all the people follow him.

167
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,090
With me.

168
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:01,080
But what is this commotion?

169
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,480
Earthquake. It was an earthquake.

170
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,630
Really?

171
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,340
Don't run!

172
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,740
Don't run.  Sit!

173
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,800
Move away from the buildings!

174
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,760
  Sit! Sit! 
 -Lay down! 

175
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,150
Ki Woong! Ki Woong!

176
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,580
Take the equipment.  Hurry!

177
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,640
Woo Sung!

178
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,590
Take everyone away from here!

179
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:53,190
Please wait a minute, Just a minute, a minute. You're fine, you're fine.

180
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,240
Wait a minute!  Hurry up!

181
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,890
I'll take a look at this area first so you go
 and take a look over there first.

182
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,020
Doctor! Doctor!

183
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,690
Here, here. 
- Hey!!

184
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,220
Hurry and stop the bleeding!

185
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,480
What are you doing? Do it properly!

186
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,870
What are you doing? Are you nervous?!

187
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,680
Ah, this glove.

188
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,380
Here you go.

189
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,910
Just in case, look for the blood vessels there.

190
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,250
Grab and pull on it before it gets dragged up.

191
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,960
Ok.

192
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,320
I found the vessels.

193
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,610
Don't let it go.  Hold it tight.

194
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,620
Give me an IV!

195
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,550
You scared me.

196
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,410
It's completely crushed under his calf.

197
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,830
And there's also a fracture in his femoral region.

198
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,190
His blood pressure is unstable; the artery must have ruptured.

199
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,110
I think so, too, the location seems so.

200
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:09,550
The pulse can still be felt but there seems to be symptoms of acute ischaemia.
   

201
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:13,580
But we're unable to diagnose the condition of other arteries.

202
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,470
But we're unable to diagnose the condition of other arteries.

203
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,780
I'm holding onto it with my hand right now but it's hot and pulsing.

204
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,550
I think deciding quickly and then moving him
 to the surgery room-

205
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:24,710
Hey. We're thinking about whether we're going to save the knee of not.

206
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:29,890
Busan doctor, you said you're from the orthopedic department, right? Should we just cut it off at once with a saw?

207
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:30,700
Cut it off with a saw?

208
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,420
Saw?

209
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,460
Hey! Don't throw up near the patient!

210
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,980
You punk! 
 -Hey, where are you putting your dirty hand in now?

211
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,900
Go away! Right now.

212
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,580
Really...

213
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,520
It's enough to decide on the way to the surgery.

214
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,810
Just hold the artery first. We can treat bones after we get the vitals.

215
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,850
Orthopedics is later.

216
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,650
I'll tell Dr. An Dae Gil to get a surgery consent.

217
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:08,500
Thanks, Busan Doc and Nurse Ohn. It went well thanks to you both.

218
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,780
Ugh, Ahn Dae Gil is such a....

219
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,080
What the heck is this.

220
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,710
What is this all?

221
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:26,160
He can't do anything properly? It's not like he's a little kid.

222
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,550
Hey!

223
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:36,120
You've been memorizing the books well,

224
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,490
but it make you nauseous to even think about cutting off a leg with a saw? How are you a doctor?

225
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:44,390
If you were my junior, I would have smacked you and you would have been done for.

226
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,150
Do you know?

227
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,660
Hey, Miss Jung Ddol Mi!

228
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,960
What did you say? Miss Jung Ddolmi?

229
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,270
Miss?

230
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:54,210
Why, DOCTOR Ahn Dae Gil?

231
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:57,260
You're just an intern, how dare you 
go around spouting around "Miss"?

232
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,880
We are 3 years apart. 3 years.

233
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,670
Your senior of 3 years!

234
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:07,100
Hey, Dae Gil.

235
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,100
You're doctor license is just a piece of paper.

236
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,620
A piece of paper.

237
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,340
You got it?

238
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,640
How can there be a such person, Ddol Mi...

239
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,130
Dr. An Dae Gil,

240
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,280
you didn't bring the blankets we asked for?

241
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,670
I distributed it to the patients already.

242
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,700
You think I'm just an orderlie when I just listen to you?

243
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,360
I'm Dr. An Dae Gil.

244
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,170
Dae Gil, where are you going?

245
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,210
You've to endure it. 
 -Does it make sense?

246
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,420
To treat a top class intern like this?

247
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,020
That's why that crazy Busan girl treats me poorly.

248
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,850
You saw it back there, right? The way she poked me in between my eyes.

249
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,880
How can she kick my joint? That wench....

250
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,720
You're scared of blood, so why do you try to be a plastic surgeon?

251
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,060
You're smart. So just choose the internal medicine department.

252
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,290
I can't give my father's plastic surgery hospital to someone else.

253
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,530
Hey, where are you going? 
- I'm going home, home.

254
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,580
Hey, this isn't the only hospital.

255
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:15,150
You just stay here and be loyal.

256
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:17,630
Ugh, that dumbhead really...

257
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,490
Open your eyes, Dad.

258
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,880
Dad.

259
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,750
Why are you like this?

260
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,070
Is she my direct senior or what?

261
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,740
Why?

262
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,180
Even if she is, how can a senior just lash out like that?

263
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,050
Aiyoo, just...

264
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:43,800
When the earthquake is settled, I'll sue her!

265
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,130
How can a stranger even...

266
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,930
Open your eyes, Dad.

267
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:53,050
Please get up.

268
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,440
 Dad. 

269
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,840
 Open your eyes. 

270
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,300
Mom.

271
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,290
My legs are gaining muscles.

272
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:40,410
When my legs are already thick enough.

273
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:44,670
You finished triage of so many patients. You're all awesome.

274
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:49,530
I'm so hungry, my energy is depleting. 
What kind of hospital doesn't even give us food?

275
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,100
More patients will come by tomorrow morning, right?

276
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,120
Rescue will start again, so.

277
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,940
They will give us breakfast tomorrow, right?

278
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,840
I'm going to eat a lot.  Since, we don't know when we will get food again.

279
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,110
Again. 
- You are hungry right? Have these.

280
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,920
I don't know if canned coffee can be considered food,

281
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,030
but I can't drink coffee on an empty stomach.

282
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,500
Then don't.

283
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,710
We'll just fill up our stomachs with coffee.

284
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,340
It's better than starving. Huh?

285
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,970
Have a look outside.

286
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,940
Rescue team rescued a patient.

287
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,930
The road is cleaned up?

288
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,270
What is that?

289
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,460
They carried a patient on a supermarket cart.

290
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,660
Not 911?

291
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,150
I think the roads are still stuck, 
since 911 is doing it like that.

292
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,340
Nurse Ohn, take that kid to the tent.

293
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,700
Yes.

294
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,760
We're here.

295
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,910
She's deaf.

296
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:22,150
She can understand when you talk by looking at 
your mouth or you can write it out.

297
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,080
Does it hurt a lot?

298
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,540
Ah. Does-it-hurt-a-lot?

299
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,680
Mom-dad-anyone?

300
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:46,750
You don't have mom.

301
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:51,740
Your dad is home?

302
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,510
My brother,

303
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:04,990
you must save him.

304
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,200
Ok.

305
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:19,190
What is this? What?

306
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:25,590
Blood pressure 70/50, pulse 130. It seems his abdomen bleeding is severe.

307
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:28,710
If we try to do something with a pelvic fracture, massive bleeding is inevitable.

308
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,530
They say he got covered in the rubble of the collapsing building while trying to save the child,

309
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:36,370
and was rescued after 3-4 hours later.
It seems there's compartment syndrome,

310
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:41,360
and crush syndrome, too; though we'll have to
take blood tests.

311
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,070
Leave him over there.

312
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,470
Excuse me.

313
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,770
Aren't you going to take the patient to the emergency room?

314
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:52,440
If we need a massive blood transfusion, we give up. That's the disaster managing rule of Mirae Hospital.

315
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,480
Give up? Are you saying you won't save this person?

316
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,420
I'm not not saving, but I can't.  The hospital doesn't have blood.

317
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,280
Dr. Han, please stop.

318
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,300
The patient is conscious.

319
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,760
If you want to save this patient then move him to a different hospital.

320
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,200
Take him to a different hospital now? Do something, at least.

321
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,730
There is nothing I can do.

322
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:22,180
Are you joking right now?

323
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,750
The road is stuck, there's no fire truck nor equipment!

324
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:30,690
But we've saved someone, so you can't just give him up by saying so!

325
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,270
What the....

326
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,130
Jung Ddol Mi,

327
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,090
let's do the surgery.

328
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,170
Nurse Ohn, get us an operation room.

329
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:02,940
What are you?  With whose permission, are you going to do the surgery?

330
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,970
I told you, we don't have the time or the blood.

331
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:07,330
Within an hour, and with no blood transfusion.

332
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:11,620
1 hour? Your arrogance is piercing the sky.

333
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,160
I'm desperate.

334
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,560
What are you trying to show to a patient who's dying?

335
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,370
Your skill? Your technique?

336
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:22,970
For tomorrow. They have to live and see tomorrow.

337
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:27,090
If the doctor gives up, there will be no tomorrow for this patient.

338
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,770
What about the operation consent?

339
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:33,140
I think I can save you. Should I do the surgery or not?

340
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,970
I want...to live.

341
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:41,250
I got his consent. I'll explain to you what type of surgery it is on the way there.

342
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,570
Dr. Jung Ddol Mi... 
- Yes.

343
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:44,360
What are you doing? Let's go the surgery room.

344
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,700
Yes.

345
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:49,900
He took lots of painkillers, he's not fully conscious!

346
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:54,180
No matter how drunk he is on painkillers, there is no patient who expects to die this way.

347
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,720
Please move aside.

348
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,340
This is reckless. Don't gamble with the patient's life! This is against the hospital rule, too.

349
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:05,620
Hey, what kind of rule lets the patients die?

350
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:09,980
Do you think we dragged him all the way here for you to declare him a corpse? You need to do something, something!

351
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:14,320
This is a hospital.  So, leave it to the hospital people.

352
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:22,850
While saving people who were covered in dirt, people who were limping, all sorts of people, do you know what we told them?

353
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:26,330
We tell them they can get treatment once they reach the hospital, it's fine, just endure for  a little bit.

354
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:32,260
But if the hospital is like this, with what hope can we save people?

355
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,830
Save people?

356
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:38,700
So, you carried this abdomen bleeding patient on a supermarket cart?

357
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,410
No, this person! We had to carry him here with that since the car won't run!

358
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:44,230
Just try your best with rescuing!

359
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:47,650
We will decide, whether to save or not.

360
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,350
Don't involve yourself with the hospital affairs, know your place.

361
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:52,630
Stop!! Please, stop it.

362
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:55,850
This patient... is still conscious.

363
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:58,190
I'm saying he can hear everything.

364
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:03,170
Please think about this patient's feelings. Huh?

365
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,200
I want to...live.

366
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,720
Push, Jung Ddol Mi. We're going to the surgery room.

367
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:27,120
I know what you are trying to say.  You're asking us to save him. Right?

368
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,930
We will try our best. OK?

369
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,860
Nurse, please take her away.

370
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,110
Yes.

371
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,640
It's going to be okay.

372
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:48,740


373
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:54,240
Ugh, 'try best with the rescuing?'

374
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,170
Who doesn't want to do that?!

375
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,820
The way he says...

376
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,270
What is it?

377
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,940
I've something to say.

378
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,700
Oh ok.

379
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,680
It's a personal favor.

380
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,440
Yes. Tell me about it.

381
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:26,530
When the earthquake happened, near the Yeonggwang Mart,

382
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:33,140
the people who were injured, 
people who were rescued, or the patients,

383
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:38,200
is it possible to know where they are by any chance?

384
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:42,710
I thought you might know about that.

385
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:45,170
He is 7 years old.

386
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:49,850
He was wearing a green t-shirt.

387
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:55,730
That's not our jurisdiction, so it'll take some time. But why are you looking for him?

388
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,920
He is my son.

389
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:04,370
7 years old. Song Dong Ha.

390
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,720
Oh. You must be suffering.

391
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,320
And you're still doing your best as a doctor.

392
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:21,770
Yes, I'll look for him. When I go to different hospitals or shelters, I'll look for him.

393
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,370
Don't worry.  Everything will be okay.

394
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:27,630
Yes. Please do me this favor.

395
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,170
It will be okay.

396
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:56,100
Isn't this your first time? With no blood transfusion, and within an hour.

397
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,230
Yes.

398
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:59,960
Your nervousness is showing.

399
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,440
Is that so?

400
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,810
If you aren't confident, let's just give up. No one will say anything.

401
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:12,230
I'm a little nervous, wondering if I can do it well.

402
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,400
It's a waste, this friend.

403
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,890
I can't let him go like this.

404
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:21,530
Then let the nervousness end here.

405
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:26,750
Everyone is putting their trust in you, 
the surgery room will be in chaos if you're nervous.

406
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,850
Can I do well?

407
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:32,150
Tell me here that you can do well.

408
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,930
If not, I'm not going inside.

409
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,150
You're scary, you know.

410
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,080
Dr. Lee Hae Sung took the patient in?

411
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,220
Yes.  Without knowing, how much blood the patient needs.

412
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,340
Without examination, just with the consent.

413
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,350
Chief Kang,

414
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:59,960
you said he'll be helpful since he has lots of emergency experiences.

415
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:07,350
Where is the surgery room?

416
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:11,950
This operation consent contains the side effects as complications..

417
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:18,310
and you agree with the operation.

418
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,320
About the blood poisoning, 
cerebral infarction, heart attack;

419
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,840
forget these scary terms.

420
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,110
Just think of wanting to live.

421
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:33,310
Doctor, thank you.

422
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:36,430
You are early.  I haven't even started yet.

423
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:44,000
You didn't let me die in the streets.

424
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:49,930
Even if I can't open my eyes after the surgery,

425
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:54,280
I won't hate you, Doctor. 
 Don't worry.

426
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,390
Well, you still have energy to talk.

427
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:01,050
Please hurry, Nurse Park and Dr. Jung.

428
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,410
The anaesthesiologist will suffer stabilizing his vitals when things get late.

429
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:04,280
Yes.

430
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,350
It's ready.

431
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,220
Let's start the anesthesia.

432
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,840
  Yes, we're going. 

433
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,680
It's fine.

434
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,520
Stop the surgery.

435
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,110
You promised to keep the hospital rules.

436
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:26,550
You know about the blood inventory, right?

437
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,530
I can do this without blood transfusion.

438
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,660
What about consent?

439
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:32,700
I received it.

440
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,450
Guardian?

441
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:40,950
Even if this succeeds, this is an operation
without any guardian or guarantor.

442
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:43,450
How will you take care of it?

443
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:48,390
Hospitals' rules and stability are more important than the challenge and good will of an individual doctor.

444
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,240
Please send the patient out.

445
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,380
Director.

446
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,700
We're not a volunteer organization.

447
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,320
We have to kick the patient out to follow the rules?

448
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:59,610
We're just telling you to move him to
 a hospital that can accept him. Hurry.

449
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:03,900
His survival rate fell to 9%, because Dr. Lee is in the way.

450
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,320
Is it because of the fee?

451
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,870
If so then, I'll be the guardian...

452
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,880
Dr. Lee Hae Sung.

453
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:21,180
Don't try to carry everything. Your shoulders are already heavy enough.

454
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,720
You've to think about your mother as well.

455
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,740
I hope you get well.

456
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,880
I'll guarantee. I will.

457
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,640
I'll do it.

458
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,170
An Dae Gil.

459
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:41,910
I'll guarantee.

460
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,980
So, please do the surgery.

461
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:48,740
You know my father, right? Director of An Plastic Surgery Hospital. I'm qualified. Right?

462
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,840
Why you?

463
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,350
He is my friend. A high school classmate.

464
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,850
Please.

465
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:58,290
You...you, shut it!

466
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,620
Don't move. Stay still!

467
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:04,860
You lied when you said you wanted to live?

468
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,570
Please.

469
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:13,450
You signed with your words saying you wanted to live. I'll do the surgery and

470
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:15,460
you'll be saved.

471
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:22,080
Fine then. Please do the surgery.

472
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,960
You must. You must succeed.

473
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:31,230
If you're not going to get involved, then please leave.

474
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,370
The patient is in a rush.

475
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:47,090


476
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,490
Start the anesthesia.

477
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:58,060
Yes. Anesthesia is going in.

478
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:06,440
Blood pressure 90/60. Pulse 120.

479
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,940
We found him now, he was buried under a car.

480
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,920
It's a 7 years old boy.

481
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:35,380
Why? Why are you like this, Chief?

482
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:41,110
Nothing.

483
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,970
Take care of him.

484
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:03,400
Be prepared. Within an hour, without a blood transfusion.

485
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,200
But is it possible?

486
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,720
We saw free air on the X-ray.
 

487
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,200
Properly assist us.

488
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,860
Scalpel.

489
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:42,730
Dr. Ahn Dae Gil guaranteed the patient, and they have started the operation.

490
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,800
Dr. Ahn Dae Gil?

491
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,010
He knows that patient?

492
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:50,220
About that... they were best friends in high school.

493
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,220
But there was no news- 
- Hey!

494
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,190
That's because Doctor An is still young.

495
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:56,710
He can't even differentiate between when he should get involved and when he shouldn't.

496
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:59,740
I gave good advice to him, but...

497
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,180
Did you check on that earlier patient?

498
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,590
Don't worry about that.

499
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,450
Because of that, I talked to Doctor An-

500
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:08,200
Doctor Yoo, follow up on that child.
 -Ah, yes.

501
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,340
That's really fast, right?

502
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:13,890
If they took a CT and MRI, 
it would have taken 2 more hours to do the operation.

503
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:18,040
Nurse Ohn, speed is not everything for medical treatment.

504
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,000
Accurate diagnosis comes first.

505
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:32,620
You should've stopped the surgery.

506
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,600
I went there to stop it.

507
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,620
Excuse me?

508
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:39,150
After thinking about it, I didn't have a reason to stop it.

509
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:43,060
There's no damage to our hospital, and we've got the consent.

510
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:47,640
If anything goes wrong, the patient will definitely sue us.

511
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:52,650
Dr. Lee Hae Sung did it on his own.  We can get rid of him if something happens.

512
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:56,840
Why? Are you worried?

513
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,960
Let me ask you something.

514
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:06,790
Is it this hospital you worry about or is it Dr. Lee Hae Sung?

515
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,960
It's this hospital.

516
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,130
Don't forget what you just said.

517
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:24,460
Ahn Dae Gil, I put glue on the liver, so pack with gauze quickly.

518
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:29,570
The liver is lacerated, but we can control the bleeding. And the pancreas is okay.

519
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:34,400
He's got hypothermia, coagulopathy and metabolic acidosis.

520
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,580
We must hurry.

521
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:41,320
It's ripped from terminal ileum to the right side colon, and the mesentery is damaged.

522
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,520
So we'll cut off right side colon and small intestine.

523
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,850
Remember that time is life.

524
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:47,790
Here.

525
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,740
Professor Han?

526
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,550
What is Professor Han doing here?

527
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:14,960
I came to see where your recklessness leads you. You said no blood transfusion within an hour?

528
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:21,580
Then please do so.

529
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:24,690
If you opened him up like this, you need to save him.

530
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:29,080
It's not enough with your boldness holding a scalpel. Prove it with the result.

531
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,850
Just wait and see.

532
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:55,200
You should care for his creatine figures,
his blood pressure is not even in normal range!

533
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,860
I'm sorry. There's no pediatric department, so I can't get any help.

534
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,770
Then, you can just leave him like this?

535
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:04,480
If it's this much, then it's enough to be considered normal.

536
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,500
This kid.  Will you be responsible?

537
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,490
Me?

538
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:12,210
Yes.  Will you be responsible?

539
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,120
I take responsibility here.

540
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,850
You need to ask everything and resolve things together!

541
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:20,670
You deciding by yourself and then throwing the kid aside like this, is this the right thing?!

542
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:25,980
I'm sorry. I'll be careful.

543
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:35,820
Does it hurt a lot?

544
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:39,110
Your mom and dad will come looking for you here.

545
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:43,460
Don't be scared and be strong.

546
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,280
Stay like that.

547
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:55,740
Dr. Lee, the segmental resection here...

548
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,230
I won't do it. You won't do it?

549
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,980
Stop. Lee Hae Sung, stop it!

550
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,390
Stop this operation.

551
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,770
With whose permission?

552
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:06,880
I can't approve this operation 
as a professor of a surgery department.

553
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,220
Move, I'll do it.

554
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,060
I'm the operating surgeon.

555
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:15,650
If you can't watch, then you can leave right now.

556
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:17,210
Cut.

557
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:19,370
Park Ji Na, didn't you hear me?

558
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:20,560
I'll do it!

559
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,720
I said to cut it!!

560
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,640
Lee Hae Sung.

561
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,540
Cut now.

562
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,720
Won't you think about the patient?

563
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,440
If you do this segmental resection...

564
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,200
Don't easitly decide this like you're a butcher or something!

565
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,390
Easily? What doctor decides easily while holding a scalpel?

566
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,910
You're a surgeon. You've never been through a hard operation like this.

567
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:46,730
It doesn't matter whether it's hard or easy.
I'm the operation surgeon.

568
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:50,740
For this person, each second is a fight with death.

569
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:58,230
Everyone, concentrate. Ddol Mi... cut.

570
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:18,080
Close it like this for now and let's go to the ICU. End of surgery.

571
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,500
What's the vitals?

572
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,520
80/40. Pulse is between 110 and 120.

573
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,990
You can take care of this, right?
-Yeah.

574
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:33,660
Take care of him properly when we go out.

575
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,630
Damage control.

576
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:46,320
This is something I only saw in the book, but you're really doing it.

577
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:51,800
His intestines are swollen, so I wondered
how he'd close them, but he's just leaving them opened.

578
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,550
Professor, you may consider an operation

579
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:04,380
as something you should so to get rid of the cancer at once,

580
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:07,620
but I just need to save them.

581
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:12,050
Mirae Hospital only does regular operations.

582
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:17,820
So it was my first time doing damage control,

583
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,310
it works.

584
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:23,840
What are you doing? Move the patient.

585
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,680
Yes.  Ah, yes.

586
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:40,080
Did you hear it? It's a first time.

587
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:44,680
He's out of his mind. His liver's swollen a lot, I guess.

588
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,740
You're adventurous, or what?

589
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:56,730
I'm not a person without a conscience to take a risk with someone's life.

590
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:59,370
What is this actually?

591
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:02,390
I wanted to save him.

592
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:07,330
I'm a doctor. Saving the patient is a given.

593
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:11,800
I'm a doctor, too; but this is just arrogance and a gamble.

594
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:17,000
Then what can we do now? We take our hands off the easy patients because they won't die.

595
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,150
We take our hands off the critical patients because they're critical.

596
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:25,520
Do you want us to hold onto moderate patients, pretend to put our effort in, and then drop a death sentence?

597
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:33,390
Whether it's arrogance or gambling, if I can save them with even a 1% chance of survival,

598
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:37,890
I will do everything. That's why I am a  doctor.

599
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,560
That's Lee Hae Sung.

600
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:56,270
That person, isn't he scared of anything?

601
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,120
The death of a patient is what he is afraid of.

602
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:04,570
Prof. Han is probably scared of something else?

603
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,330
What is that?

604
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:09,290
That, you know yourself well.

605
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,370
Something that I'm really scared of?

606
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:40,790
You don't know. What I'm really scared of.

607
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:01,140
Damage control. Stopping the bleeding in a short amount of time

608
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:05,320
and making the patient's condition better so that he can go through another operation in a short time, it's the key.

609
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,770
Then what should you take care of?

610
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:12,000
First of all, we should take care of his vitals 
with norepinephrine and reduce the amount slowly,

611
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,400
and control his I/O balance to treat his swollen intestine.

612
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,090
For his coagulopathy, though the blood supply is short,

613
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:22,030
we'll try best in that. And there might be a striated muscle fusion,

614
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:26,140
his creatine is bit high, so I'll consider running CRRT.

615
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:31,380
Mm. You know well. Then tell me what we need to do in detail.

616
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,980
Dr. Jung Ddol Mi.

617
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:39,150
You can't even say a word?

618
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:40,990
I'm not in the internal medicine department.

619
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:44,640
I'm not either. How ignorant.

620
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:50,780
When I first got the license, I wasn't like this!
 I was the symbol of intelligence!

621
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:53,450
Hey.  The most important thing is...

622
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:57,240
to take care of the platelets as there was no blood transfusion.

623
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,200
Hey, I think I'm out of sugar. If I lack sugar, I explode.

624
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:05,040
So while I go recharged, don't cause any trouble.

625
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,240
Nice. 
-Thank you.

626
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,610
You...that-

627
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,350
Now I think I'll live.

628
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:00,840
Sugar's the best for recharging.

629
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,550
Doctor.

630
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:10,070
What is it?  The patient is up already?

631
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:13,540
No. It isn't that.

632
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:17,690
Min Cheol.  Please take care of him.

633
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:22,640
Take care of him? You don't like me though?

634
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:28,650
Yes, I don't like..Ah, but still I'll acknowledge one thing.

635
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:33,840
You're the only one who can save him.

636
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:37,920
Why are you like this?  This isn't you.

637
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,360
It's similar to the reason you begged on your knees in front of the Director.

638
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:47,890
If I can save Min Cheol by begging on my knees, I can do it over and over again.

639
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:56,800
When you guys are just from the same high school? What relationship are you with him?

640
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:00,240
I owe him a lot.

641
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:03,110
Please save him.

642
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:07,510
Save him because you owe him a lot?

643
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:10,610
Ok.

644
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:12,780
Thank you so much.

645
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,310
Hey, An Dae Gil. 
- Yes.

646
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:19,010
We only have these to eat.

647
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:23,600
Here. Good, good.

648
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:27,970
Take it easy on those. And give some to Jung Ddol Mi.

649
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,180
Why? You don't like gummies?

650
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:35,710
Ah, no! I really love them.

651
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:37,870
I'll enjoy them.

652
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:50,080
The thing I hate the most in the world, adzuki beans. The second thing I hate the most is coffee with cream inside.

653
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:55,980
Garbage can.  Where is the garbage can?

654
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:03,000
What are you doing right now?

655
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,920
You can have them.

656
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:14,180
Hey, sit down for a bit.

657
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,820
It's okay, sit down a bit.

658
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:26,330
Those... You are giving them to me?

659
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:29,350
Take these. All of them.

660
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:31,900
All of these, for me only?

661
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:35,150
Yes.  I don't like them.

662
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:44,200
You're so shy.

663
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:49,330
You can just tell me truthfully. I understand.
 Just say you want to give all of these to me.

664
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:51,340
Wow.

665
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:55,400
Thanks!

666
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,240
He's pretty nice, he must be hungry, too.

667
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:21,150
Why did you come back after going home?

668
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:23,870
The house was dark and I was bored.

669
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:27,350
I had to eat uncooked ramen because the gas didn't work.

670
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:29,500
How's outside?

671
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:33,870
It was if Seoul was put into a giant blender and that blender was turned on.

672
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:38,570
Han River Bridge is broken, and there are fires everywhere.

673
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:40,020
That serious?

674
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:45,510
It's a miracle that the people survived.
 You, me, and Min Cheol, too.

675
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,330
Your urine doesn't have problems.

676
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:54,270
And the temperature is fine, too.

677
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:58,970
It's all in the past.  Think as it never happened.

678
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:03,030
Pressuring a kid who didn't want to and then stealing a motorcycle,

679
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:09,600
and my dad using his connections and money into making Min Cheol the only culprit,

680
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:14,440
and him getting kicked out of school and becoming and ex-convict,

681
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,920
I can't think of them as having never happened.

682
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:22,310
My dad said he would set up a lawyer and compensate him with money.

683
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:28,590
The day I stole the motorcycle, was the day I got permission to enter med-school.

684
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:33,570
When he asked me if I was going to give up being a doctor, when he told me everything was going to turn into foam,

685
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:38,480
"Yea...since Min Cheol is poor,

686
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:43,560
it'll be fine because my dad said he would give him money. It's better for Min Cheol like this."

687
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,860
I was like that because I was greedy in wanting to become a doctor.

688
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:53,300
I trusted my dad's words so much,

689
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:59,370
but he didn't even compensate him or set up a lawyer.

690
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:07,070
I wore this gown like that. So dirty and cheap.

691
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:09,430
You were young that time.

692
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:16,880
If you're that sorry, then take care of him so he survives and repay him.

693
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:22,980
I should.

694
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,370
I'm in debt.

695
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:49,700
Damage Control.

696
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:54,470
In a situation where medicine and electricity are in danger,

697
00:51:57,430 --> 00:52:00,240
he only put on a show with a patient.

698
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:02,870
Show.

699
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:40,570
 To save a life, Dr. Han must have cried a lot. 

700
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:42,930
 It's awesome. 

701
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:46,050
 Gosh, you even write poems for him? 

702
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:47,670
 Just date already. 

703
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:49,720
 Should we? 
- Get lost. 

704
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:54,030
 Just drink whatever you want! 

705
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:56,130
 You're paying it? 

706
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:57,970
 Cheers!
- Cheers! 

707
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:00,120
 Wait a second, let's take a picture. Ask someone to take it for us. 

708
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,950
 Excuse me, please take a picture. 

709
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:04,090
 Yes. 

710
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:06,350
 Ok. 1,2,3. 

711
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,750
 Cheers! 

712
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,620
Park Ji Na.

713
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:02,330
You don't have the manners to at least nod to 
the director of the hospital?

714
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:04,430
I've handed in my resignation.

715
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:06,640
As a father.

716
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:10,610
I forgot that I've a father like you.

717
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:19,350
Why are you hanging out with Lee Hae Sung? If you're trying to show me something,

718
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:22,590
you're wrong. I won't be shaken by that.

719
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:24,700
That's good then.

720
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:27,640
I don't have intentions to end it.

721
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,830
Park Ji Na.

722
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:37,420
You said manners?

723
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:43,240
We've been living apart for 20 years, but we were still family once.

724
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:46,870
And you don't have manners to ask me about my mother, at least once?

725
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:06,020
 He's going to sue? 

726
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:11,050
 You think Lee Hae Sung will win? Everything is perfect! 

727
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:13,670
 You're a nurse but also a close friend of his, so how will that be a strong evidence? 

728
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:15,010
 You're really... 

729
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:18,420
  Watch your words. I'm your father! 

730
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:29,010
 If he sues, where do you think he'll have to take his mother? 

731
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:32,550
 Will he be able to pay for his vegetative mother's hospital fee? 

732
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:36,880
 Do you think humiliating Han Woo Jin and Mirae Hospital 

733
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,120
 will make Lee Hae Sung's mother conscious again? 

734
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:43,940
 I'm teaching you as your father. 

735
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,600
 Don't do anything. 

736
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,600
 Not doing anything is 

737
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:51,700
 the best thing for Lee Hae Sung. 

738
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:00,570
 I'm embarrassed of a father like you. I thought you changed. 

739
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:03,840
 Ji Na. 

740
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:10,040
 A chair once broken, will always make sounds even after it's repaired. 

741
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:13,080
 You and your mother, 

742
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:16,940
 our family has already been destroyed. 

743
00:56:58,580 --> 00:56:59,900
What is it?

744
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:01,610
What's the matter?

745
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:09,430
Let go.  I've to go.

746
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,150
What is it?

747
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,300
What are you curious about?

748
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,510
You are crying.

749
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:23,670
Did the Director say something?

750
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:26,100
Nothing happened.

751
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:27,930
Then why are you crying?  What is it?

752
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:30,410
I said nothing!

753
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,800
Just push it out.

754
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:38,000
I never broke up with you.

755
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,730
You turned around by yourself and I'm the same.

756
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:43,790
It's all in the past.

757
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:46,630
If I was going to give you up that easily, I wouldn't have started.

758
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:52,820
I think you punished me enough.

759
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:55,960
We can't go back.

760
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:21,330
Why aren't you carrying it out?

761
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:24,360
Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport,
just don't avoid the responsibility and

762
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:29,590
gather labor forces who have license of heavy equipment!

763
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:32,510
Ministry of Strategy and Finance! Hurry and set some budget,

764
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:35,540
to ensure food, water and shelter for victims!

765
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:37,380
And dispatch a medical team.

766
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:42,270
Everyone, the roads have to be opened first. Then electricity, gas, phone, everything can pass through.

767
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:46,040
Do you understand? Opening the roads is our first priority!

768
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,980
How can he..

769
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:55,370
You're uncomfortable with me sitting here, right?

770
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:59,040
You think I've become a special minister because I'm rich, since I'm just a young beginner?

771
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:02,970
And that I'm just making a fuss because I don't lack anything?

772
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:06,160
All that jealousy,

773
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:11,870
express that after we take care of this disaster. Hold a hearing then and tear me into pieces!

774
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:15,710
You can create a fuss later but follow my words for now!

775
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:20,470
For the disaster, 72 hours is the golden time!

776
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:33,450
For the disaster, 72 hours is the golden time.

777
00:59:33,450 --> 00:59:43,020


778
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:55,900
 Yeonggwang area 43, a fire has occurred. We need immediate support. 

779
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:58,760
 This is the disaster management unit, stop the fire control. 

780
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:02,150
 You've come here, and why don't you stop the fire? 

781
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:05,830
 The buildings are collapsing, and there are people dying! 

782
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:07,240
 What's with this? 

783
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,670
 Then we can't last two days? 

784
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:13,100
 We have 300 patients, and how do we move all of them to which hospital, in which region, and how long do you think it'll take? 

785
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:14,540
  Then what are you saying we should do? 

786
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:17,230
  Should we collect all of the dead 
patients and hold a mass funeral for them? 

787
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:19,280
 Dr. Yoo, what have you done till his platelet fell like this?! 

788
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,230
 Dr. Yoo took all of it. 

789
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:24,400
 Spare some platelets for us. 

790
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,880
  It's the moment to decide. It's the moment to decide between the two. 

791
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:30,480
 Give it to the isolated patient. 

792
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:35,140
