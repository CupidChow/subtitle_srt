1
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,810
 It's a refreshing Saturday morning. 

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:15,110
 But last night, a sinkhole caused a tower crane to collapse. 

3
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,870
 Why do sinkholes keep happening? 

4
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,100
 We have conducted our own investigation with focus on this matter. 

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,620
 This is the Yeonggwang District intersection. 

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,580
Buy another? But you already have one? 
 -"Traces of the crane rollover incident last night are still vivid." 

7
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,440
 Episode 3 
This is Roy the Firetruck.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,950
The new one released is Amber the Ambulance.

9
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:35,440
~ siren noise ~

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,570
Please make sure to protect people who are sick.

11
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,230
Yes, just like you mom.

12
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,820
It's the ahjussi from the national assembly!

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,300
Hello?
-  Where are you? 

14
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,510
How did you know?

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,290
 Know what? I'm asking because I don't know. 

16
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:54,300
We're on the way to buy a new toy for Dong Ha.

17
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,900
Ja Hyuk, we're having lunch together, right?

18
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,820
Yeah, I called because of it. I'll be a little late because of a meeting. Just give me 30 minutes.

19
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,110
Yeah, sorry.

20
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,220
Everyone sit down.

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,660
The money poured in just for development of Yeonggwang District is 20 billion.

22
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,460
I said sit down.

23
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:19,800
Doesn't matter whether it's persuasion or threat, we have to make some results!

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,940
Why is the company wavering over this little money?

25
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,320
Oh, Professor Han. Why are you coming here when it's a Saturday?

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,060
I was called in at dawn.

27
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,700
Get some rest, you look tired. 
- Yes.

28
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:48,720
Aigoo, still haven't found it yet?
- Yes, not yet.

29
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,830
Your kicking is good.

30
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:03,400
One! Two! One! Two!

31
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,740
1 2 3 4 5 6!

32
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,500
7 8 9 10 11 12 13...!

33
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,100
Ah, why aren't you answering your phone? Your phone...

34
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:44,350
Ahh, he said he'll come back in 10 minutes.  Where did he go?

35
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,040
Why is the rainbow so big?

36
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:06,460


37
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,690
Dong Ha!

38
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:48,160
I didn't do it, Mom!

39
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,440
Dad!

40
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,270
What's happening!

41
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,920
Watch out guys!

42
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,980
Dong Ha!

43
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,800
Mom! Mom!

44
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,420
Mom, my Roy! 
- Quick, get in!

45
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,410
Dong Ha, your seatbelt!

46
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,880
Dong Ha, hold on tight!

47
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,710
 Currently, there is a fire incident in Yeonggwang. 

48
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,090
 After confirming the situation, proceed with the rescue immediately. 

49
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,430
Oh, 2677 dispatch-dispatch.

50
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,010
 Please confirm first that there was a call for rescue. 

51
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,490
Hey! Kim Hee Yeon! Hey! Come here!

52
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,720
Aish!

53
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,940
Dad! Dad! 
- Ji Won!

54
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,910
Ahh, what is this?

55
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,660
What's this?? What's happening??
- I don't know!

56
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,030
Aigoo.

57
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:47,510


58
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,610
Here! Please help me! Here!

59
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,050
Please help me!

60
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,380
Hurry!

61
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,800
Please lift this.

62
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,400
Please wait a little longer. I'll open the door for you soon.

63
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,700
It isn't opening!

64
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,990
No! No! No!

65
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,600
Please calm down!

66
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,150
Then, what do we do?

67
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,910
Should we kill the fire first, isn't there a fire extinguisher in the car?

68
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,450
I don't have it! Please report this!

69
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:05,670
The phone doesn't work right now.

70
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,600
Ah!

71
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,520
Please breathe first, and calm down a bit!

72
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,820
She's 8 months pregnant!

73
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,260
Hey, are you okay?

74
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,850
Look here! Look here!

75
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,430
Look here!

76
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:54,710
Where is Dong Ha? Dong Ha?

77
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,600
Dong Ha!

78
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,840
Dong Ha!

79
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,850
Dong Ha!

80
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,990
The car will explode, avoid it!

81
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,410
Don't come here, the car is on fire!

82
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,640
Dong Ha!

83
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:49,490
Dong Ha! Dong Ha! Dong Ha!

84
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,460
Dong Ha!

85
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,800
Can you hear me? Please lift your head.

86
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,420
Could you please step aside for a moment?

87
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,160
No! Don't! Her cervical spine seems to be damaged. If we carelessly take her out, she might become paralyzed!

88
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,810
Then, what do we do?

89
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,650
Please save me. My hand isn't moving.

90
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,200
Can you feel where I'm touching you?

91
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:05,200
Yes. Index finger. Middle finger.

92
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,730
I think the nerves are in a good state.

93
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,380
What is this?

94
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,790
Jung Ddol Mi! Scissors!

95
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,130
Yes!

96
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:45,720
Please hold on.

97
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,240
Yes.

98
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:57,430
We can't move the cervical spine, I don't know the injury yet.

99
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,030
Please endure it a little longer.

100
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,340
Ok, let's take her out.

101
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:26,390
Please avoid it! 
- An explosion!

102
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,340
 Report your status. 

103
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,280
Current location, at entry point.

104
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,580
Due to road blockades there's no entry.  No entry.

105
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,490
Sir!

106
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,420
Looks like the heavy equipment is needed!

107
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,340
Alright! The cellphone is with Woo Sung so...

108
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,520
What is that?

109
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,380
Hey! Hey! Hey!

110
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,760
It hurts.

111
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:25,820
It's fast... Does it hurt a lot?

112
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,820
My stomach feels stiff.

113
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,480
And it's pulling down.

114
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,910
I don't really know gynecological surgery.

115
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:37,450
Her pulse is faster than it normally would be. I worry about the fetus.

116
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,740
Go to the closest, large hospital with obstetric and gynecology.

117
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,860
But still, if you just go like this—

118
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,230
I'm really sorry. I don't really know gynecology.

119
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,330
You must go to a big hospital.

120
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:55,300
Also, don't walk. Try to find something to carry her with.

121
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,960
I've to go and take care of the patients at our hospital.

122
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,790
I'm really sorry.

123
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:17,740
But is it really ok to just leave like this?

124
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,820
It's best to visit a obstetric than me helping them.

125
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,350
What?
 - We have to go to our hospital's ICU. Let's go.

126
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,950
Ok, let's gather.

127
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,100
 

128
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,620
Are there no patients hurt?

129
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,400
Many patients who had fractured bones fell and got fractured again.

130
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,880
- Inpatients? 
- Yes.

131
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,140
Let's all work in our position and do what we have to do.

132
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:04,150
Yes.
-An Dae Gil?

133
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,380
Let me see you for a moment.

134
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,320
Me?

135
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,020
Yes, yes. Follow me.

136
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,350
Come quickly.  Follow me.

137
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,060
 Why are you being like this? 

138
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,910
 To a sunbae— 

139
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,800
What is it? What's happening?

140
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,160
Chief Park!

141
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:59,100
This power outage aside, seems our emergency generator broke down, too.

142
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:04,960
Jung Ddol Mi, you take a look at other patients while I'll look in the ICU.

143
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,550
Park Ji Na!

144
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,750
Where did you go? Things could've happened if it wasn't for me.

145
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,710
It's a relief.

146
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:28,570
Really, thank you. When did you get here? No one was here?

147
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:32,570
The nurse on duty was here, but she disappeared as soon as she saw me.

148
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:36,950
Seriously, how would I have lived without you?

149
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:41,530
You saved this patient. Really.

150
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:45,560
But why did this hospital shake? And what was that just now?

151
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,110
I don't know either. I have to find out now.

152
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:51,510
Park Ji Na, please stay here for a little longer. I'm gonna go check on mom.

153
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,300
Okay.

154
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:03,440
Mom. Mom!

155
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,420
Mom! Mom!

156
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,410
It's a relief, Mom.

157
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:58,860
Thank you for not getting hurt, Mom. You can't leave, okay?

158
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,900
It's a relief.

159
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:20,420


160
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:41,040
The patients here all seem to be okay.

161
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:46,200
Except for having a faster heartbeat from the shock.

162
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:51,120
Well, what do we do now?

163
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:21,390
I don't know whether it was an explosion or what, but patients will surely come here soon.

164
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:26,250
Patients will gather here but since the operating room is in the 2nd floor, it'll be hard to move.

165
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,490
Then what do we do?

166
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:33,530
First, we've to make this room possible to do surgery here.

167
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,890
Okay, I'm going. 
- Eh?

168
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:53,380
Just what am I doing here?

169
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,550
Until when do I have to stay here? Is the electricity recovered?

170
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:13,290
Well, that... I don't know either.

171
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,880
You haven't seen Kim Yoon Seok?

172
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,720
No, I haven't seen her. What is it?

173
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,710
Is it okay here?

174
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,890
I'm telling you, I don't know either.

175
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:24,190
Phones don't work. Power was cut. Water won't come out either.

176
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:26,610
First, someone who can fix this needs to come.

177
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,590
Look here.

178
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,960
Sister!

179
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:38,120
Are you hurt?

180
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,390
They won't come. No one will come.

181
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,370
What's wrong? What is it?

182
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,220
I can't believe it.

183
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,070
What is it! What's wrong?

184
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:54,270
It was...

185
00:24:55,210 --> 00:25:00,310
It was an earthquake. In Seoul.

186
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,250
Dong Ha...

187
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:42,030
Dong Ha...

188
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,160
6.5? Magnitude 6.5? Are you sure?

189
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,900
Yes. It's being reported on the radio.

190
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,680
The congressmen are having an emergency meeting, too.

191
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,750
Find the damages the company suffered.

192
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:14,180
Yeonggwang District, send someone to Yeonggwang District and find out the scale of damages.

193
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,210
Yes. I understand.

194
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:22,040
The problem we haven't been able to resolve up until now, we might be able to resolve it soon. If it's a magnitude 6.5.

195
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,950
Even earthquake resistant buildings can only resist up to magnitude 4.

196
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,370
If the magnitude moves up by 1 point, it means 10 times the intensity.

197
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,790
If it's magnitude 6.5, that means 150 times the intensity of that.

198
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,410
What kind of facility can even withstand that?

199
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,860
Should I hate the sky,

200
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,540
or should I be thankful?

201
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,810
 An unprecedented powerful magnitude 6.5 earthquake just hit Seoul. 

202
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:58,100
 This Saturday morning at around 8am, Yeonggwang District was struck with a magnitude 6.5 earthquake. 

203
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:03,190
 The meteorologists say due to this being the most powerful earthquake that has ever occurred in the Korean peninsula, 

204
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:08,180
 the entire area of Seoul experienced power outages and water supply has also been suspended. 

205
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,220
 The subways and trains... 

206
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:15,450
Why isn't 6.5 that big? Last time, it was over 7.0 in Nepal, right?

207
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:19,730
Will this building be okay too? What if it collapses?

208
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,500
Electricity is our main problem now.

209
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,700
The radio said many roadways and structures collapsed.

210
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,940
Electricians and such, will they really be able to come here?

211
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,770
If the electricity doesn't return...

212
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:34,170
Then what about that patient? It's a kidney extraction patient.

213
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:36,220
We can't do anything without electricity!

214
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,140
Why can't we move him somewhere else?

215
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:42,840
Of course, we'll have to transfer him, but if other patients come...

216
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,040
We'll have to send them away!

217
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,750
A general checkup hospital that doesn't even have an emergency room, how are you going to accept any patients?

218
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,990
We are here. Let's give our best.

219
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:55,280
Doctor Lee!

220
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,230
Phones aren't working! Never mind the mobile phones, even wired telephones are dead!

221
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:03,170
Transceiver? Please confirm if a transceiver can be used!
- Yes!

222
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:07,300
Also, check up on each fire station and report back!

223
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,900
What are you guys doing?

224
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,320
We don't have water.

225
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,820
Connect the water pipe, connect them!

226
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,380
Do you think we didn't try that?

227
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,420
The entire Seoul water supply has been suspended. Would hydrants even work?

228
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,780
Well, we have to find something.  We can't sit around since there's a fire!

229
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:31,030
The path has to be opened for us to draw some water from the stream.

230
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:34,240
But the road is blocked, we can't move.

231
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:57,050
Does this make sense?!

232
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:02,730
Firefighters just watching the fire unable to extinguish it. Does this make sense?!

233
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,790
 Bo Kyung! 

234
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,030
Are you okay?

235
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,020
Are you okay?

236
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,970
Sister, go to that side a bit.

237
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,110
One, two, three!

238
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,170
Ah!

239
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,510
Oh, what to do! I'm sorry!

240
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:27,040
You pushed it, be careful.

241
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,310
  Are you okay? 

242
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,850
Let's go.

243
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:33,320
Really. Ow.

244
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,720
Even if patients come, we can't move them up to the ICU.

245
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:44,050
To be more efficient, Sister... fluids, medicines, and other supplies, make sure to bring them all together.

246
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:48,020
I'll repeat it again, this is a health screening clinic.

247
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,010
Even then, there should be some basic items.

248
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,670
Just get everything that can be used.

249
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,160
I'm going crazy, really.

250
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,380
I'm stepping back from here. I'm sorry.

251
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,830
I worry about my house, so I think I'll have to leave.

252
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,920
Wait, wait, Sister!

253
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:05,790
I'm a Doctor who believes in Nurse Kim's work.

254
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,950
Even now, I believe in you Nurse Kim.

255
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:10,980
What do you mean believe in me? When did you see me?

256
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,560
I understand that you worry about your family.

257
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,330
But we're not at home right now, we're at a hospital.

258
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:19,000
How can you turn a blind eye on a patient?

259
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,100
Doctor, why do you do this to me?

260
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,910
Well, I'm not a nurse, I'm an assistant.

261
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:26,060
What does that have to do with it?

262
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,660
We need Kim Hyun Sook's help

263
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,090
and it would be best if Kim Hyun Sook didn't regret it later.

264
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:34,610
But my mom has diabetes...

265
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:37,140
Bl-Blood, she can't bleed as well...

266
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,580
And doesn't know how to manage her sugar level.

267
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,950
And I...

268
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,190
I understand you.

269
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:53,730
She'll do fine. Let's believe that.

270
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:56,370
Because things happen as we believe.

271
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,150
Okay.

272
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,940
I can't do this, sorry.

273
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:13,410
Hyun Sook, do you know where the stock room is?

274
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:18,570
The stock room is on the 4th floor. Take the staircase by the west, and go up one more floor and you'll see it.

275
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:19,980
What about the keys?

276
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:24,570
The keys... They are in Miss Seo's drawer of the General Affairs Division.

277
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:27,070
Where is her desk?

278
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,820
Why are you doing this to me?!

279
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:34,320
Won't let me go home in peace!

280
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:51,840
We really...

281
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,300
need Kim Hyun Sook's help.

282
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:04,930
How did he notice?  How did he know?

283
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:10,510
Right, even if... I'm just a nurse aide.

284
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:14,650
10 to 20 head nurses..

285
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:17,250
So... what was it? Yes...

286
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:20,250
That I can take them all on, how did he know?

287
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:25,720
But doesn't he know this hospital's situation just by looking!

288
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,030
What is this?

289
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,660
Seriously...

290
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,360
People with abilities always get ruined!

291
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,970
If something ever happens to my family..

292
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,610
Ahjumma! Ahjumma, can you hear my words?

293
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:46,710
Yes...here...please save me...

294
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:50,480
Okay, okay. Hold on for just one minute!

295
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,850
Here!

296
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:57,200
Help me a bit.

297
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,510
Ahjussi! What are you doing just sitting? Let's help her out.

298
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:03,880
We've confirmed her safety! Raise it up!

299
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,040
Now, 3... On the count of 3,  okay?

300
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,380
One, two, three!

301
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,580
Let's do it again!

302
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,080
One, two, three!

303
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,100
Done? 
- It's ready!

304
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,570
Let it go.  Let it go.

305
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,900
Okay, it's done, okay. Do you see her?

306
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,630
I can see!! 
-  Now, wait a second.

307
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,920
Okay, just wait a second!

308
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,920
Hey, rescue team! Rescue team!

309
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:42,430
Okay, slowly, slowly. Okay.

310
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:55,570
One, two, three.
- It's okay, it's okay.

311
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:57,780
Now, watch your feet!

312
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,870
This is everything. Everything.

313
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:05,780
I got everything from the hospital.

314
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,510
Is this everything?

315
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:12,720
Because we don't have the key, I couldn't open the medicine room. But there's nothing to even look at in there.

316
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,900
So, are we still taking patients with these tools?

317
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,040
Is having the medical staff good enough?

318
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:22,900
It's not much.
- Let's tell the patients outside to go to another hospital.

319
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,640
Closing the hospital is the right thing to do.

320
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,390
These are the only bullets we have.

321
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:30,430
We can't just shoot in the air, we can't just shoot empty bullets either.

322
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,740
If we don't want to waste any bullets trying to fire at everything,

323
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:43,990
we won't use the bullets at minimum and worst cases.

324
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,470
Minimum and worst?

325
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:49,600
Minimum: patients who won't die, even if not given immediate treatment.

326
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,300
Worst case:

327
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,300
people with the lowest chance to live.

328
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,170
CPR? 
- Exclude that.

329
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:57,400
Exclude CPR?
 - We can save other patients instead of  doing CPR.

330
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,510
Ah, Brother! I said we can't! We can't perform the duties of a hospital in this kind of place!

331
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:03,330
It's a hospital if there is medical staff and medicine.

332
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,840
Then.

333
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,810
Let's go out and start from the triage.

334
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,680
What is this?

335
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,530
Excuse me!

336
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:27,690
He injured his leg when he fell down the stairs.

337
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:30,830
Since we don't have any other labels, just mark their foreheads.

338
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,280
There are 3 colors.

339
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,860
Emergency: people whose life can be saved when given urgent medical attention.

340
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,920
Put red and bring them to me right away.

341
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,200
It's a femoral fracture. Bring him inside.

342
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,440
Put blue for not life threatening and who needs major surgery.

343
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,810
What are you doing?

344
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:50,970
I think I've ruptured eardrum, why blue?

345
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,770
Sorry, other more urgent injuries need to be seen first.

346
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:55,170
If you were me, would you still mark me blue?

347
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:58,950
You won't die because of it, we really don't have any other choice. Sorry.

348
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:01,270
The minimum and worst cases will all use blue.

349
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:04,540
We'll give it up. And then black...

350
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,200
Black for dead.

351
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:17,750
Please endure a bit.

352
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,130
It's going to hurt a little. Sister,

353
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:25,310
I said hold it correctly. Hold tight in the back.

354
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,290
I got it.

355
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:29,160
We will count to 3 to fix it.

356
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,790
One!

357
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,080
It's done now.

358
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,100
Sister, secure this here.

359
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:52,070
It's a femoral fracture.

360
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:56,100
Blood pressure and heart rate are all normal. So for now, it's nothing major.

361
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:00,400
But we can't judge it properly here. Transfer him to a bigger hospital.

362
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,870
Also, while you do that, try not to move him.

363
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,880
We should avoid any neurological damage.

364
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,940
Coming here was difficult enough.

365
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,470
Which hospital should we go to?

366
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:21,820
Those that can withstand the earthquake.

367
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,250
It's closed!

368
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,920
Go to the emergency room. Emergency!

369
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,930
What are you talking about now?

370
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:34,370
Go to the front emergency room!

371
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,920
Open the door.

372
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,940
 

373
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,100
You can't go through here.

374
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:27,010
It's closed! Closed!!

375
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,130
It will hurt.

376
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:34,200
Sister. 
- Yes, Brother.

377
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,700
Help straighten his arm.

378
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,060
Here you go.

379
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,350
Please endure it.

380
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:42,120
Lidocaine?
 

381
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,470
Only a bottle left now.

382
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,260
One bottle left?

383
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:50,310
Yes. There are no bandages and syringes either.

384
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:54,230
Are you okay?

385
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:07,510
Excuse me, excuse me. Please take a look at my mother.

386
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:10,340
She's breathing, but she's not responding.

387
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,310
Dr. Jung Ddol Mi!!

388
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,470
 I'm coming.  Here? 

389
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:43,600
Basal skull fracture...
   

390
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,680
Why is it black?

391
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,590
My mom is breathing.

392
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:59,520
Put red on her,  I heard he'll treat the ones with red.

393
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,630
Your mom's head is serious—

394
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:03,320
No! She's still breathing!

395
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,060
Please do something! She'll die this way!

396
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,440
I'm sorry.

397
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,090
You think I don't know?!

398
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:12,320
Please don't misunderstand.

399
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,130
Are you guys doctors?

400
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:17,560
You guys aren't doctors, you guys aren't even human!

401
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:23,430
Doctor Lee! Hurry and come out.

402
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:26,420
A patient's guardian is using violence. He's hitting Dr. Jung. 
-  What?

403
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,710
Wait here.

404
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:31,240
Why is my mom dead? She isn't even dead, why aren't you guys treating her?

405
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,590
Hey! Dude! Won't you put that down?

406
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:36,380
Don't come! I'll kill you!

407
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:49,740
Wouldn't even try to treat my mom!

408
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,650
Save her. Save my mom right now.

409
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,480
I want to save her as well.

410
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,560
I want to save her and send you guys home together.

411
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,180
But even if we want to, we can't do anything.

412
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:04,260
There is no medicine nor blood in this hospital!

413
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:08,030
We don't even have the microscope needed for your mom's surgery.

414
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:13,230
If hitting me brings you mom back to life, then

415
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:17,580
hit me. Hit me heartily.

416
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:21,830
I'll take all the blows so I can save her.

417
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,410
Let go of him.

418
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,300
Our mom is so pitiful...

419
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:46,060
At least your mom won't forget your voice.

420
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:54,990


421
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:08,500
What are you doing?

422
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,010
Aren't you going to stitch it quickly?

423
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:12,050
I have to receive patients.

424
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:14,530
It will hurt a lot though.

425
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,130
It's just a few stitches.

426
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:21,020
Well, it'll just sting a bit.

427
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,050
Hurry and do it.

428
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,500
I heard a bottle of lidocaine is left.

429
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,730
Hey, how can I use that when we've lots of ICU patients coming in?

430
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:04,510
I don't need anesthesia. Am I a kid?

431
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:06,400
Stitch it quickly.

432
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,040
Something so small, it'll just st..ing!!

433
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:12,300
Sting...

434
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,850
It hurts a bit, right?

435
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:24,820
No, it's okay. Continue.

436
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:28,190
It's going to be okay, I'm fine...

437
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:31,420
Continue, continue.

438
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:35,170
Hm, you endured it well, little child.

439
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:49,910
Will you help her? Please help us.

440
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:52,690
It looks like the baby is about to come out, please do something!

441
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:56,030
We can't deliver at our hospital. We don't have gynecology.

442
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:59,340
Please save her. All the hospitals say they don't have gynecology and won't accept us.

443
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,910
Our Sun Mi will die!

444
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:02,620
I told you that you can't come here.

445
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:05,510
There are lots of patients here. Go to a different hospital.

446
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:07,830
Wait, I think it's dangerous?

447
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:10,230
Don't you see her bleeding already?

448
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,700
We might give birth on the street then.

449
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,700
But we can't help you guys!

450
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,490
Aren't you going to bring them in!!

451
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:18,880
Sister, Park Ji Na, prepare for the birth.

452
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:31,340
She's lost quite a lot of blood already, what should we do?

453
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:35,800
Park Ji Na, have you delivered a baby before?

454
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,720
Me neither.

455
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,450
Doctor, you sure you're not crazy?

456
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:52,260
Then what? Should we just watch when the baby is  about to come out?

457
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:55,660
We only have one bottle left of lidocaine right? Give it to the mother.

458
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:59,180
Doctor, this is completely crazy!

459
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,080
There are two doctors, do you think we can't deliver the baby?

460
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,210
It's not one.

461
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:08,950
There are two. Twins.

462
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:20,400
Let's go then.

463
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,660
Doctor!

464
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,590
Excuse me, how many months along are you?

465
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:32,450
8 months.

466
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:38,500
Okay. Let's try to do this.

467
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,250
It'll turn out well.

468
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:44,070
I've never delivered an 8 month baby, but everything will be fine.

469
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:47,190
Although it's familiar, we don't have an incubator.

470
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:52,390
If we don't even have an incubator, it could be hard to attempt to save them.

471
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:57,280
This is just an imaginary situation, but

472
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,520
if we have to choose, we would choose the mother, right?

473
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,150
No!

474
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:04,500
My babies...

475
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,400
Save my babies, Doctor.

476
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,160
Seong Mi! The babies come second after saving you.

477
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,670
If you're not there, there's no use for having the kids.

478
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:14,360
You definitely can't!

479
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,160
Doctor, save my babies.

480
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:21,340
We've waited for 7 years.

481
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:23,780
We got two babies after waiting for so long.

482
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,460
This person was really happy about that...

483
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:30,130
Doctor,

484
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,500
please save them.

485
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:38,300
The blood pressure and pulse aren't good. Contraction intervals are down to 2 minutes.

486
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:43,100
I'm really not sure what to do.

487
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:48,100
But still, I will try my best.

488
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,560
Okay.

489
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:55,920
Seong Mi! Seong Mi!

490
00:46:57,370 --> 00:47:02,500
Please take short breaths.

491
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,220
Yes, strongly, give more strength!

492
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:21,420
Good!

493
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,490
Ji Won!

494
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,140
Lee Ji Won!

495
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:43,090
Answer me, Lee Ji Won!

496
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,790
Dad...

497
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:05,560
Are you hurt anywhere?

498
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,850
I don't know.

499
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:21,250
People are going to come soon.

500
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:22,950
Let's stay strong.

501
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:25,980
We can get out of here alive.

502
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,180
Okay.

503
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:31,600
Dad, too, stay strong.

504
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:47,740
Ji Won, this... this...

505
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:52,010
Use this.

506
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:06,810
Dad, are you okay?

507
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:08,500
I'm okay.

508
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:13,580
Excuse me, have you seen my ukulele?

509
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:16,800
Oh, I got it after going through so much trouble.

510
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,820
Oh, it's here.

511
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,830
Attention!

512
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,260
Oh, now it's great.

513
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:35,470
I'm not sure if you will trust me or not with the way I look.

514
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:39,220
This Yeonggwang subway is like my home, so I know every corner well.

515
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:42,230
I'm going to open the emergency door now so...

516
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:45,840
Calmly, follow me.

517
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:49,870
Understand? You go it?

518
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:54,700
Oh, It's good now.

519
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,620
Now, follow after me.

520
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:04,620
It's this way. This way.

521
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,920
Please be careful.

522
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,710
Come down.

523
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:13,030
Come down, it's okay.

524
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:22,620
Here. Trust me.

525
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:27,190
Now, slowly. Don't be scared.

526
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:35,970
It's almost done, done. 
-  I see it.

527
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:38,870
A little more push, 1,2,3!

528
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:42,800
Oh, I see it, see it.
 - I see it, everything is fine now.

529
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,250
It's done now.

530
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:03,010
1.41kg, it's a boy.

531
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:05,250
It's a son!

532
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:14,340
We can see it now.
- Now, push! Push! Push a little harder!

533
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,470
Push it hard, one last time!

534
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:20,310
Oh, I see it, see it. 
- I see it, everything is going fine.

535
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:22,350
One  more push.

536
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:27,500
Park Ji Na!
- Yes.

537
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:37,140
Doctor! The mother's condition is not good.

538
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:40,550
Why isn't my baby crying?

539
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:49,040
Why isn't our baby crying, doctor?

540
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,590
Yes, suction.

541
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:54,450
We don't have it.

542
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,640
Honey,

543
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,550
what's going on with our baby?

544
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:06,830
Excuse me!  Please doctor!

545
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:08,660
Doctor!

546
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:39,510
They are handsome.

547
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:49,000
Sister, keep holding the baby so as not to let them be cold. And keep massaging them.

548
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,100
Park Ji Na, monitor the mother's vitals.

549
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:56,530
Jung Ddol Mi, you come with me to look for 2 styrofoam boxes.

550
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:58,680
Where are you going to use... ?

551
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,930
Good job.

552
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,220
Here you go. 
- Thank you.

553
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:44,690
Ddol Mi!

554
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,280
Doctor.

555
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:25,310
What are you doing there?

556
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:27,230
Huh?  It's done.

557
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:59,620
Insulation is the most important with incubators.
 This should hold out for a few days.

558
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:01,810
It's a fine incubator.

559
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:05,020
If you don't have teeth, just use your gums. The mother?

560
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:09,850
The blood pressure keeps going down. We can still keep it up at the moment with the fluid but...

561
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:15,550
Hey, listen carefully.

562
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:20,010
This building... it's dangerous.

563
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:22,320
Huh? What are you saying?

564
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,530
This building may collapse.

565
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:29,400
Without making a commotion among the patients, we'll have to take them out of the hospital as fast as possible.

566
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,830
Oh, how?

567
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:34,920
Slowly, calmly.

568
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,970
Staying calm will keep us alive.

569
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,030
Yes.

570
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,520
Everyone look this way.

571
00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:02,820
We ran out of medicines and other things.

572
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:05,890
So, we can't treat you all here.

573
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:10,000
And since this building is very old already, we're in a dangerous situation.

574
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,470
We'll close it down now, so please find other shelter nearby.

575
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:16,530
It will be dark soon, where should we go?

576
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:19,390
Wouldn't emergency rescue come here to the hospital first?

577
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:22,110
They'll probably go to shelter areas first.

578
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:27,480
Food, water, bedding, blanket, should go there.

579
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:30,920
People would come looking here at the hospital for their family members.

580
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:38,500
Take these people and leave first. I'll come after I get my mom.

581
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,340
Mom, let's go on a date with me.

582
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:03,450
Mom, I'm going to give you a piggy back ride.

583
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,500
Your son's shoulders are broad.

584
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:11,220
Don't worry.

585
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:38,130
Why would I leave?

586
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,320
What are you doing, not leaving? Leave quickly!

587
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:46,360
My legs hurt!
- We have to contact our family members first before we leave.

588
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:50,760
The building might collapse! Please!

589
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,730
How can it collapse?

590
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:55,190
Is it true?

591
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:59,030
Let's go out.

592
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:01,020
Please go out quickly!

593
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,900
Brother! This way!

594
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:34,020
Her blood pressure's too low. The blood loss is increasing.

595
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:41,540
Doctor, the kidney patient's vitals are getting unstable, too. He was fine a while ago, though.

596
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,060
Somehow,

597
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:48,400
we will go to a hospital with incubators.

598
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,390
We will walk that far bringing along all these people?

599
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:56,900
I don't know about the other patients, but the babies need to go to a hospital with incubators.

600
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,360
There are lots of hospital with incubators in Seoul.

601
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:03,120
How about with helicopters...with so many patients...

602
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:06,480
I would like it, too, but we have no way of contact...

603
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,370
In this hospital, isn't there anything like a transceiver that could connect you to 119?

604
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:13,780
Even big hospitals' emergency rooms rarely have one, let alone this hospital...

605
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:20,200
There's a boat.

606
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:24,230
Hangang dock is a little far, but wouldn't a boat be better than none?

607
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:26,210
Boat?
- Yes.

608
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:31,650
I'm a cruise ship electrician. I don't have something like a certification but I've learned a few things when we were sailing.

609
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:37,040
The key should also be in there. It's better than walking on our bare feet.

610
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:42,790
Of course. The destination's far and the earthquake was very intense, we don't have certainty on the road conditions.

611
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:47,230
Let's go there.

612
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:50,070
Everyone, please follow us!

613
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:53,760
Doctor! Put your mother on this wheelchair.

614
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:55,530
Are you okay?

615
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:11,570
There is a sinkhole here so, be careful.

616
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:27,870
I can't go any further.

617
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:30,820
The area where I had hemorrhoid surgery long ago is getting painful.

618
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:34,390
Rescuers will rescue those in the hospitals, wouldn't they?

619
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:38,270
If my wife comes and we miss each other on the way, wouldn't it be more troubling?

620
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:41,300
Shouldn't we just wait in the hospital?

621
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:49,020
Be careful.

622
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:51,910
Where are you going? You can't go back!

623
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:55,790
Just how far are we going to walk like this?

624
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:58,920
Just until Hangang dock. There's a boat there.

625
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:02,430
The distance to Hangang dock is too far, I can't.

626
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:05,390
Even if there is a boat, it might just flip over.

627
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:09,460
That man said he's an electrician? How can you just believe him and get on the boat?

628
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:11,640
I can't even swim!

629
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:16,660
Please don't go! That building might collapse anytime now!
- Ah, I said don't go!

630
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:18,970
You shouldn't go!

631
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:21,950
Dr. Lee!

632
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:24,840
What is that?

633
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:27,990
The patients are returning to the hospital.

634
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:31,580
Sister...

635
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:37,500
Quickly!
- Seriously!

636
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:40,360
Aish!

637
01:02:42,830 --> 01:02:44,880
I said stop!

638
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:50,760
No!

639
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,800
Come out quickly!

640
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:04,030
No!

641
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,660
No!!

642
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:21,450
Dr. Lee. Lee Hae Sung!

643
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:37,290


644
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:45,660
 Why are you all so indecisive every time an incident happens?
Why is it always like this! 

645
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:48,270
 I specially appoint Goo Ja Hyuk as chairperson. 

646
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:53,780
 I'll issue my 1st order. It's about the mobilization of all medical personnel in Seoul, Yeonggwang District. 

647
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:58,140
 Our current staff isn't even 10% of the usual number. We're not equipped with the basics, how can we provide the best treatment? 

648
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:01,010
 We have to close the hospital.
- We have to open it. 

649
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:06,910
 Doctor Lee Hae Sung is not part of our hospital. Mirae Hospital can not accept everyone. 

650
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:10,370
 It might stop on the way, is that what you're saying? 

651
01:04:11,730 --> 01:04:15,000
 It'd be great if we can just reach Seoul like this. 

652
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,890
 One step at a time.
