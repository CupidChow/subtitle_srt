1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,880
 Disaster day 

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,580
 Despair day 

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:11,100
 Determination day 

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,960
 D-Day 
Disaster Despair Determination 

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,500
 "Life has to continue on" 

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,520
 Due to the thick fog, I couldn't see beyond my nose. 

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,860
 Recently, due to the snow, the ground is slippery. 

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,380
 Headquarters here. 
Headquarters here. 

9
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,510
 A 20-car collision on Yeongdong Bridge. 

10
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,770
 A 20-car collision on Yeongdong Bridge. 

11
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,350
 Due to the thick fog. Prepare a defibrillator.  Fully charged? 

12
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,390
 Due to the thick fog. Prepare a defibrillator.  Fully charged? 

13
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,700
 Charge 200 Joules, please. 

14
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,230
 Okay, pad. 

15
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,440
  Please stand back. 
Stand back.  

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,510
 Ready, Shoot! 

17
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,460
 When you do CPR, the broken bones stab the lung. 

18
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,320
  Episode 1 
 He had surgery for a punctured lung by a broken bone due to cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,140
  The plaintiff can't walk up the stairs because of  pulmonary function decline, 

20
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,370
 shouldn't compensation be rightfully received? 

21
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:58,910
I object.

22
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:03,320
The plaintiff's attorney presents assumptions and irrational logic.

23
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,540
Exaggerations and accusations?

24
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,870
It's true that the plaintiff can't go up the stairs.

25
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,640
Even before the surgery, he couldn't go up the stairs?

26
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,640
Isn't it written right there that he can't go up the stairs?

27
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,790
The plaintiff's lawyer can't read between the lines?

28
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,720
 Did you doze off in language class? 
- Excuse me? 

29
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,440
 Yes. Defendant. What is it? 

30
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,390
Can I say something?

31
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,270
 Yes. Go ahead. 

32
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,710
When the defendant arrived in the emergency room,  he was in cardiac arrest.

33
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:35,280
CPR. The goal of this procedure was to make the heart beat again.

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:42,110
That is why whether it breaks bones or injures organs, we always do CPR.

35
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,910
Why?

36
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,180
If you die, that's the end.

37
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:08,380
My medical license number is 1353985. That's right. I'm a bomb squad.

38
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:22,580


39
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,440
 

40
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,960
 I took a biopsy of this section but the diagnosis is stomach cancer. 

41
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,470
Of course, I think it's in the early stages of stomach cancer.

42
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,130
In order to decide the extent of surgery,

43
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,430
we need a CT of your abdomen and check your bowel system.

44
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:01,810
Because there's a possibility that it has spread to other organs, a lung CT is also recommended.

45
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,190
A lung CT?

46
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,730
I mean. Do I really need it?

47
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,890
From what I've checked on the internet, it said it wasn't really needed.

48
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,000
You trust what the internet says more than me?

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,770
No. That's not what I mean.

50
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,770
I did the biopsy to obtain the diagnosis of stomach cancer,

51
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:26,390
but what if the cancer has spread more than we thought?

52
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:32,810
I would assume you wouldn't want us to gamble with your life.

53
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,950
Then, we won't do the scans and just end it here.

54
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,470
This conversation... has all been recorded here.

55
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,830
No, Doctor, Listen.

56
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,430
Park Ji Na!

57
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,760
What is it? 
- It's a TA (traffic accident).

58
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,840
Blood pressure 170, Pulse 85.

59
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,600
There is shock to the head and abdomen.

60
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,000
He got into a car accident while running traffic lights.

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,150
Patient, don't worry. This is a hospital.

62
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,190
Hey, what is this? You know we don't accept TA patients. Take them to a different hospital. Okay?

63
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,600
I know but the patient's condition is very urgent and even at other hospitals they wouldn't accept them so here he is...

64
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,760
No. We have no space! Why did you just haul them in here without calling?

65
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,940
Accept them. I will send up three people in the emergency room to a hospital room.

66
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,780
Doctor. This is against hospital poli-

67
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,980
This patient goes to X-Ray.

68
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,660
Here is a portable x-ray.

69
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,800
What about the trial?

70
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,160
As expected, acquitted.

71
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,310
You're all dead.

72
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,470
Doctor, hurry this way.

73
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,290
Patient, do you know where you are?

74
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,870
The vital signs are good, too. Other than some scratches, there are no injuries.

75
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,090
Patient, if you feel any pain you have to tell us immediately, okay?

76
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,960
Move.
- Okay.

77
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,590
Do a head and abdomen CT and MRI on the shoulders.

78
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,310
What are you doing, Doctor Yoo?

79
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,610
Okay.

80
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:55,460
Chief, isn't a CT, MRI, and an examination a little too much?

81
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:02,160
Nurse Park! That patient from earlier, just give them an x-ray and bring them here quick.

82
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,080
Yes, sir!

83
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,910
Is it a TA? 
-Yeah.

84
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,630
Chief Kang accepted them? A TA?

85
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:23,300
Yeah. No, I mean. I stopped them but they were placed in ER for a brain and abdomen CT, and a shoulder MRI.

86
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,190
Oh, really?

87
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:29,370
He's part of the earlier TA. He hit his steering wheel and is in shock.

88
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,390
They were trapped in the car and we were able to save them. It just took some time.

89
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,780
Patient, do you know where you are?

90
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,440
Ultrasound, hurry! 
 - I'm going. 

91
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,680
We should take a CT, right? Head, chest, abdomen, everything.

92
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,780
  The CT rooms are full.  

93
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,550
Tell them to switch it. It's urgent.

94
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,120
  Yes!  

95
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,600
  This is the ER.  

96
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,050
Doctor Lee Hae Song, you should go to the CT room.

97
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,970
It's packed in there.

98
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,800
Lee Hae Song, I said go to the CT room.

99
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,640
Huh?

100
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,920
Look at this. The abdominal cavity is full of blood.

101
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,390
There is an aorta hemorrhage. Intern! Find a surgery room right now!

102
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,890
 Contact anesthesia and ask them for O blood. 

103
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,270
Call Cardiac Surgery and Vascular Surgery, too.

104
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,010
What are you doing, Nurse Park? You should be following them in.

105
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,910
We can get the patient's vital and CT's.

106
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,410
This is urgent! On the way to get a CT, they might go into arrest.

107
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,400
You just finished a lawsuit. Do you enjoy them?

108
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,230
How are you going to prove that it was an emergency?

109
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,770
Let's transfer that patient.

110
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:27,080
I called the other heads,

111
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,170
sadly they are all mid-surgery, so help is impossible.

112
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,950
After we transfer him,

113
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:39,830
he will get a proper surgery. This is the procedure for our hospital.

114
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,590
Intern, find out about a hospital that we can move him to.

115
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,030
Yes, sir!

116
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,510
This patient, while finding a hospital, will die on the road.

117
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,730
Then you shouldn't have accepted him!

118
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:52,000
Our hospital is a cancer, spine, and joint specialty hospital.

119
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,390
All of our rooms are full as well.

120
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:01,530
Because we can't do surgery, it's better if we hurry and find another hospital for this patient.

121
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,230
Director! The patient is in danger!

122
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,610
With an aortal hemorrhage, the death rate is 90%.

123
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,240
The survival rate is about 10%.

124
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,970
Just now it's become 9%, since you wasted time.

125
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,730
A positive optimistic view could kill the patient, too.

126
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,020
Find and send them to a specialist.

127
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,130
Let's be honest.

128
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,480
You just want to send this "patient bomb,"

129
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,900
so that it won't explode in our hospital.

130
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,840
 Do something. Blood loss is over 1500CC. 

131
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,920
  Where the heck did it explode? 

132
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,860
 Suction. 

133
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,860
 Injection. 

134
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,560
It's an arrest!

135
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,450
Let this go, start CPR.

136
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,880
You should stop now, how about it?

137
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,980
He's bleeding to much.

138
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,600
It's hard to find a bleeding site.

139
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,740
I haven't pronounced him dead yet!

140
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,820
Since you don't want to do it, I will.

141
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,320
Current time 2 o'clock...

142
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,440
I'm not stopping!

143
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,190
Think of the other people a bit, huh?

144
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:34,390
All because of you, you're always in trouble with the law and we're doing a surgery that's not even possible. Ah, it's so frustrating!

145
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:37,750
I can't do this anymore! Okay?

146
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:42,170
This patient only has us. Don't turn your back.

147
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,250
Ah, seriously. You seem to have read too many medical comics.

148
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,280
 Doctor, they are back! The heart is beating again! 

149
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,220
What are you doing?!

150
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,150
 Suction! 

151
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,590
It's clean.

152
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,530
This is an ENT operating room. We don't have it here.
 - I'll go fetch it.

153
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,810
Where are you going, he had a cardiac arrest, the patient could die.

154
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,980
There is a foley catheter, right?

155
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,090
Foley catheter?

156
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,960
You worked hard. 
- Professor, you are really amazing.

157
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,520
For a robot to be like a human hand like that so naturally... 
- Practice hard.

158
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,000
I want to become like you, Professor.

159
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,450
I respect you, Professor!

160
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,070
Grab it!

161
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,240
Water.

162
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,920
Blood pressure is going up. The pulse is better also.

163
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:35,170
The pronouncement of death is not when the monitor says the heart stopped beating.

164
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,860
The pronouncement of death is when the doctor gives up.

165
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:47,940
As long as you don't give up, the patient lives.

166
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,260
Why? Are you not going to assist?

167
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,000
Yes.

168
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,530
Suture.

169
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:12,660
If he dislikes being on my ship, he needs to leave,

170
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,500
Cotton swab.

171
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:22,690
9%... He's challenging a miracle.

172
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:30,440
Oh Director? Let's cancel the purchase for 3 days worth of disaster supplies.

173
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,660
Excuse me, Director? The law s—

174
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,980
I'm not talking about law. This is about figures.

175
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,530
What is the probability of a disaster coming to Seoul?

176
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:41,570
And how much is the cost to buy 3 days' worth of disaster supplies?

177
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:45,670
If the expiration date passes, how much will the disposal costs amount to?

178
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,530
The penalty is cheaper.

179
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,430
The disaster preparation is the public's territory.

180
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:55,130
It's not the responsibility of a hospital treating cancer.

181
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,670
We're done talking about the budget. How about we talk about our earnings?

182
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,530
Emergency Room Department Head Kang Joo Ran.

183
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,610
Last time our loss figures were in first place but

184
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:10,950
this time our earnings are number one.

185
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:14,350
Great job, you really worked hard.

186
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,530
What is your secret?

187
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,330
I think reinforcing tests is the biggest help.

188
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,690
As expected, tests.

189
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:32,730
Tests and more tests.

190
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,670
These tests boost profit,

191
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:38,270
help with more accurate diagnosis, and prevent lawsuits.

192
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,250
It's 1 stone against 3 birds.

193
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,860
As you probably know,

194
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,680
this hospital is working hard to get the government funding

195
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,010
of $50 million.

196
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:56,690
Those funds will be used either for the emergency
 department which Chief Kang Joo Ran is in charge of,

197
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:02,670
or the Robotic Surgery Center led by Professor Han Woo Jin.

198
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,930
We will consult with the hospital development committee.

199
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,190
Let's end the meeting here.

200
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,700
 Chief Kang? Come see me for a minute. 

201
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,240
 It's regarding Dr. Lee Hae Sung. 

202
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,980
Dr. Yoo Myung Hyun... When I was a fellow, we had to make macrame with ties.

203
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,120
But how can you stab the blood vessel while tying.

204
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:36,200
Can't you tie it as fast as you pronounce someone dead?

205
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,580
If the anesthesiologist wasn't good in stabilizing the vitals,

206
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:43,560
the patient would've just... Even thinking about it makes me dizzy.

207
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,300
Properly thank the anesthesiologist, got it?

208
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,060
Yes, thank you, Doctor.

209
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,890
It's okay, forget it.

210
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,520
Ah, how nervous must your heart have been?

211
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:03,600
The patient had cardiac arrest, the kids kept making mistakes.

212
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,090
Aigoo, were you not scared of performing without a CT scan?

213
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,090
It sucked all my blood out.

214
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:11,370
"Sucked your blood"? Am I a vampire?

215
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,400
Dr. Yoo.

216
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,290
What's with him? He must have no pride.

217
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:25,410
Always flattering other departments, and criticizing me.

218
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:28,310
What are you doing? So rude!

219
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,490
Anesthesiologist Kim did a good job.  Right, Myeong Ja?

220
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,330
Dr. Kim is good, right?

221
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:42,930
Next time, ok? I'm begging you, Director!

222
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:46,790
Oh my, forget it! Hello...

223
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,870
Go ahead then.

224
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,270
Oh, why?

225
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,690
The director is looking for you.

226
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,100
Why? I handled the lawsuit myself and with my own lawyer.

227
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,840
You didn't take any CT scans before the operation and refused to move the patient.

228
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,690
They're keeping a close eye on you with your lawsuit, how can you just pretend not to know?

229
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,610
Sunbae, is that why you run so many tests?

230
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,810
You are scared of lawsuits? 
- What's that supposed to mean?

231
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,730
The vitals are fine, the patient is perfectly conscious.

232
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,620
A CT and MRI just because the shoulders or stomach are a bit sore.

233
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,810
It's too much.

234
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:19,400
If you're in the ER, you have to imagine the worst situation. Not all patients are nice.

235
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,090
Sunbae, do you also see patients as bombs?

236
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,630
I'm taking these to make sure the bombs don't go off.

237
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,750
You should be honest, too, Sunbae.

238
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,630
You want to keep the ER doors open by making money for the director.

239
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,320
Ah! But it probably won't close!

240
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:39,280
The cancer patients waiting in the ER are lining all up to the hallway.

241
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,100
Yes.

242
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,040
The government funding can change our ER that has became the cancer patients' lounge.

243
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,760
We can have a separate severe trauma center and minor injuries center.

244
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,050
Then emergency patients don't have to die on the way here.

245
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:58,730
If it could happen, I can do whatever it takes.

246
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,710
So just be a little more cooperative with  whatever the director asks of you.

247
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:06,390
You can only save more lives, if you manage to keep your position!

248
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:12,100
I thought you said that patients aren't very nice. Now you're saying it's for the patients?

249
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,200
Very confusing.

250
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,400
Yes.

251
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,480
I heard you were looking for me.

252
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,020
10%...

253
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:41,200
Oh no, the 9% to 100% miracle you created is incredible.

254
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,170
It was the patient's luck to live, of course.

255
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,670
The patient did have good fate, but if you failed to find the source of bleeding

256
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:49,660
because you didn't take a CT scan, prolonging the operation and the patient ended up dying.

257
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,780
It would make a great story to damage the hospital.

258
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,600
That's I why I do so many operations to bring in profit, don't I?

259
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,920
#1 in lawsuits, #1 in expenditures, in the end that profit turns into deficit.

260
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,840
And that deficit has to be filled in by Chief Kang Joo Ran's profit.

261
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,870
I called patients "bombs", didn't I? They're not.

262
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:17,570
To me, you, Doctor Lee Hae Sung, are the bomb.

263
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:23,250
Doctor Lee Hae Sung, you have to go to Hangang Mirae Hospital.

264
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,470
Right away.

265
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:34,360
Um...

266
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,350
Hangang Mirae?

267
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,680
 Hangang Mirae Hospital  

268
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,610
  
  

269
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:40,970
 Closed  

270
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,900
Aren't you going to examine?

271
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:49,310
Hangang Mirae doesn't have an ER nor ICU,
 your body will be very comfortable there.

272
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:52,180
Because checkups are the main work.

273
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:56,210
Ah yes, please take an endoscope with you.

274
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,930
Taking the scalpel from me, is that a punishment for disobeying?

275
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:04,260
Oh no, no. It's the hospital's  decision.

276
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,350
Because illness prevention is also important.

277
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,500
Charging the battery is...

278
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:22,550


279
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:31,440
Oh right, your mother will have to move with you.

280
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,240
Excuse me?

281
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,960
My mother as well?

282
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,990
Our promise...

283
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,730
I'm not breaking the promise.

284
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,290
We're only changing the hospital for your mother.

285
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,330
Director,

286
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,600
you know my mother is in a vegetative state.

287
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,700
She often gets heart attacks...

288
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,720
She often gets cardiac arrhythmia...

289
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:02,050
Taking care of her wouldn't be possible in a hospital different from this, don't you know?

290
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,690
But Hangang Mirae?

291
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:06,080
That's why you should've just followed me well.

292
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,130
I'll call you later.

293
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:12,520
It wasn't even the hospital's fault, but we still looked after her.

294
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,680
I can't feel your gratitude, Dr. Lee Hae Sung.

295
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,060
Anyhow, I'm sorry.

296
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:24,800
My mother...  My mother, please, protect her.

297
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,720
I completely understand a son's perspective.

298
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:38,660
So If you can promise me that you won't perform a one-man operation again.

299
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,520
On your knees.

300
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,520
Goodbye.

301
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,740
I said I'll get to you later!

302
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,650
Dr. Lee is being kicked out.

303
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,700
Really?!!

304
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,840
The director's secretary told me. We joined the hospital at the same time.

305
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,770
Yes! Hooray for independence! High five!

306
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,390
You've suffered a lot.

307
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,210
Ah, let go.

308
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:43,370
Why so cocky? This is big news!

309
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,750
Just go away, go away.

310
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,410
Is it true?

311
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,930
Rumors surely spread fast. Do you want to come with me, Nurse Park?

312
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:59,460
Do they even perform surgeries in that hospital?

313
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,140
You might as well quit from this hospital.

314
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,130
And my mom?

315
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:09,460
This rock-headed surgeon and a vegetative mother.

316
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:13,120
Is there another hospital who takes a "one plus one"?

317
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:22,390
Romeo... Juliet... You should come with me as well.

318
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,590
She isn't coming with me.

319
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,630
Thank you.

320
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,550
Go inside.

321
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,910
Mom.

322
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:00,150
Mom, we are moving.

323
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,430
The hospital doesn't have enough nurses,
 so I won't be able to take care of only her.

324
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:12,590
Feed her through a tube and turn her over frequently to prevent bedsores.

325
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,840
I'm responsible for the feces.

326
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,720
Yes, that's good.

327
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,660
Seeing a nurse like my little sister makes me feel at ease.

328
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,880
Little sister?

329
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,900
With that hair and skin, no way you are an older sister?

330
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,740
You didn't even look older than 30 years old.

331
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,830
I do look young, right? I keep hearing it.

332
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:43,670
Then, think of me as your little sister then. It's okay with me.

333
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:46,390
Please take care of me, sister.

334
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,310
Yes, brother.

335
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,450
She went.

336
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:07,300
Just so they'll take good care of you,  I'm starting to tell some lies.

337
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,340
Mom.

338
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,200
You don't like here, right?

339
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:24,460
I'll come more often, so let it be, hm?

340
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,140
Mom.

341
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,950
How are you getting old, when you've only been sleeping?

342
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:49,950
You'll be surprised when you wake up and I'm already an old man.

343
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:05,850
Among the 93 occurred earthquakes last year, 50 cases were concentrated in the west coast.

344
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:10,570
Based on the fault's structure, the west coast tectonic plate does exist.

345
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:15,590
When the energy gets compressed inside, it can cause an earthquake.

346
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:21,750
Judging on these points, we can see the probability that earthquakes can occur in the Korean Peninsula.

347
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:31,140
7 out of 10 structures and buildings don't have any kind of earthquake resistant design at all.

348
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,630
In particular, schools and hospitals are a problem.

349
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:39,550
Even if there were any earthquake resistant designs, they are only based on magnitude 4.

350
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:43,390
Last year, we had magnitude 5 off the coast.

351
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:47,430
If this should happen in the inland, it would be painful.

352
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:52,710
 Ah Hello, I am now at the National Assembly. 

353
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:56,350
 Aigoo, no, it's nothing important. 

354
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:59,790
 It's no fun at all. 

355
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:02,690
I think there is a necessity in

356
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:06,910
starting now with reconstructing,

357
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:10,910
receiving funds from the government after they decrease taxes.

358
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:16,190
It was a failure. But still, thank you for coming, Reporter Bae.

359
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,910
It's not like you were just scaring the public. Didn't you just tell the truth?

360
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,290
If before the news,

361
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:24,710
an earthquake hits Seoul and ruins the city, Reporter Bae, you'll be able to get the headline first.

362
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:28,050
Aigoo, now that's a bit...

363
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:31,410
I'm just saying. Aigoo, you're so scary. Are you gonna write another article?

364
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:35,670
Reporter Bae, I'm sorry I really have to take this.

365
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,190
Make sure to write an article on it, about earthquakes.

366
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:40,350
Yes, I'll go for it!

367
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,870
Hello?

368
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,690
Are you busy, Ja Hyuk?

369
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:48,210
What's going on that you are calling me first, Joo Ran?

370
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:51,600
Something bad happened, right?

371
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,830
I feel like my right arm has been cut off right now.

372
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,070
Buy me a drink this evening.

373
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:02,370
Rescue Team 1 report for the past week. Discarded 3 beehives. Rescued 1 abandoned dog.

374
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:05,730
Dispatched after receiving a suicide report from Banpo Bridge, but the person just went home.

375
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:09,380
No issues with equipment and supplies. That's all, end of report!

376
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,560
You've worked hard!

377
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,490
Suicide? It's the homeless, Mr. Kang again, right?

378
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:17,830
He's truly a romanticist, 
since he only runs wild during your work hours.

379
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,830
Hey!

380
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:22,250
He's trying hard to make you exercise, running back and forth.

381
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:25,430
Your romance is so touching...

382
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,990
Looks like you ate something wrong!

383
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,130
Homeless Kang, that jerk!

384
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,700
I'll make sure to make him move to another town.

385
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:46,590
  
 

386
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,500
Hey, Woo Sung, follow me!

387
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,740
Come on, I'll treat today.

388
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,930
Ah, but today I...

389
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,100
There is no reason.

390
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,770
You're going to catch Mr. Kang again?

391
00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:00,160
Why are you staring at me like that? Once a soldier...

392
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,990
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

393
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:04,400
I'll come. 
- Come faster.

394
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,130
 

395
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:20,200
 

396
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,950
So, I'm not family anymore?

397
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,140
Yeah, take whatever you want.

398
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:30,810
Brother, if you only do two more you'll be done. Hwaiting!

399
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,200
Hurry, Doctor!

400
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:09,920


401
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:41,990
Doctor, wait a little longer.

402
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,670
I'll be there soon.

403
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,560
Yes, it's Jeong Ddol Mi.

404
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,290
Chief, I'm not there.

405
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:04,870
I told you last time.

406
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:08,930
I told you I had to go to Mirae Hospital in Seoul.

407
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:12,110
Ugh, please ask that kind of thing to surgery department!

408
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,830
Why?  Do you only have one resident?

409
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,590
Come on.

410
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:26,370
I'm sorry, the women's bathroom was full. So...

411
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:32,990
Oh, Captain Choi! My best friend! You came to recite poems with me?

412
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,130
You. 
-Yes?

413
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:38,090
Why do you pick on my work day and call 911 that you're going to commit suicide? Why?

414
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:40,350
Oh, did they tell you? I said not to.

415
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:43,930
What the.... Why don't you just jump off once!

416
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,210
Why do you ask for Choi Il Sub!

417
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,400
If I call 911, you come right away.  It means 911 does care, doesn't it?

418
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,000
You're wasting taxes!

419
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,200
What if we can't save an actual person in danger because of you?

420
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,700
Don't be like that, let's have a drink...

421
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,480
There is no alcohol.

422
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,500
I was just going to have the last sip and then walk away endlessly.

423
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,580
You're going to walk endlessly? 
- Yes.

424
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,520
Where? Somewhere else? Really?
-Yes.

425
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,840
You going for real?
-Yes.

426
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,790
Woo Sung! Go buy some!

427
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:15,250
This is the CT, MRI taken at our hospital. And also,

428
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:18,670
a transition request form...

429
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:23,270
Grandma, all your family came. Please get well!

430
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,130
Thank you.

431
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,870
Work hard!
 - See Yok! (Yok is 'hard work' in Busan Dialect, 
but also is 'swear word' in standard Korean)

432
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,810
I didn't say swear words!

433
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,580
Gosh, this hospital looks amazing.

434
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,510
At this Hospital, Dr. Han, no...

435
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:40,850
Isn't he the best robot surgeon in Korea?

436
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:48,030
Yes, Ddol Mi speaking.

437
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,900
I'm leaving, now!

438
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:56,350
Chief, urging doesn't make Seoul and Busan closer!

439
00:31:56,350 --> 00:32:00,190
You should've made us take planes if you were going to look for us so much!

440
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,830
I'm coming already!

441
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:07,530
Maybe Park Hospital doesn't work without you.

442
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:12,150
It seems so. Even the song says you should be good when they're around.

443
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,730
Mister.
-Yes?

444
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:19,370
Since we're already late, can't we play hooky for one hour?

445
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:20,790
Ok. Ok.

446
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:23,110
I've someone I must meet.

447
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:33,050
Professor Han, there's someone looking for you.

448
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,010
What?

449
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:36,130
Jung Ddol Mi.

450
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:40,090
Hey, I'm doing surgery right now.

451
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,710
I'm sorry.

452
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,030
He's doing surgery right now.

453
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:48,490
Hey, no matter who calls during my surgery, don't bother me with it. I can't concentrate.

454
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:02,910
You said you had to meet someone but you're back already?

455
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:06,440
He won't come to the phone because he is doing surgery.

456
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:12,080
I can't wait because I'm busy as well. So, I guess I've to come back next time.

457
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,510
Well, then should we depart?

458
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:20,250
We came all the way to Seoul, isn't it a bit sad to return just like that?

459
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:46,230
Well, that, Han River isn't as good as expected.

460
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:51,610
Why? I like the wind, and the sunset is nice.

461
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:55,310
Ah, I always wanted to see the Han River.

462
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,770
Hey, do something.

463
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:09,330
Do they listen to me? Both of them.

464
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,780
Ah, it's embarrassing.

465
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,150
The atmosphere is good.

466
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:17,350
This place feels similar to our Gwanganri.

467
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,580
Please be quiet.

468
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,110
You're just eating and sleeping here but it doesn't make this place your home!

469
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:25,430
I'm sorry.

470
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,680
But we're not people who eat here.

471
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,140
Ah, those homeless people are getting more and more shameless.

472
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:33,600
What are the police doing, not taking those kind of people away?

473
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,480
These trash. Let's go.

474
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,650
What did you say just now? 
-Sit down.

475
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,690
I'm asking what did you just call us?

476
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:44,080
Why do you call a poet trash?

477
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,460
I'm sorry.

478
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,720
What? What did he do?

479
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:52,220
This crazy person!

480
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:56,000
I'm helping her.

481
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,260
What's wrong with you?

482
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,800
Hold on. Wait.

483
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:06,830
Wait, let's talk this out!

484
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,280
Hey, come here, come here!

485
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:15,350
Grab him!

486
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:25,040
Exactly the same as Gwanganri.

487
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:31,910
Mister, mister! Look here!

488
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:35,170
Uh? I said stop!

489
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:38,980
After making me like this. Hey, stop there.

490
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,160
They're running away, get them!

491
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,690
Catch them!

492
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,050
Aish, hey! Let's go!

493
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,160
What's going on?

494
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:26,560
Excuse me. Move Aside. Are you okay?

495
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,690
Do you know where you are?

496
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:31,760
I'm okay so go check on them.

497
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,360
Where are you uncomfortable?

498
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:37,890
My chest...

499
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,660
Are you a doctor?

500
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,760
I'm asking if you are a doctor?!!

501
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,930
Let's use your ambulance.

502
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,390
Our ambulance?

503
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,680
The patient is serious.

504
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,610
It looks like pneumothorax?

505
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:04,700
Slowly...

506
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:08,080
I don't see any other problem but the vitals aren't good.

507
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,240
Perhaps, tension pneumothorax?

508
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,250
The heartbeat is a bit weird.

509
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,470
It does seem like tension pneumothorax.

510
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:21,700
The blue lips have appeared!

511
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,850
Well then we have to treat him immediately!

512
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:37,250
What are you doing? Stab him.

513
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,110
I haven't done anything like this before, I'm an orthopedic resident.

514
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,790
Well, then who's the doctor here?  If you don't do it now, the patient dies.

515
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:45,320
You said you're only going to use our ambulance!

516
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,000
You won't do it? If you don't, he'll die!

517
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,330
What if something goes wrong!

518
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:00,950
No.

519
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:35,130
They told me to return this today. But the admin's office got off work already, so please return it for me.

520
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,500
Let's have a talk.

521
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:40,900
The hospital was really nice, the air was nice and the nurses were sweet and pretty.

522
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:45,260
Oh, and I gathered the can coffee the pharmaceutical companies gave the department.

523
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:48,430
Enjoy them. Don't you like coffee?

524
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:50,190
I drink it once a month.

525
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,110
Well, then I should just go.

526
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,460
Let's have a talk if you aren't busy.

527
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,220
I'm leaving.

528
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,540
Hey, let's talk.

529
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:01,090
Park Ji Na sunbae is coming in an ambulance with a patient

530
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:04,010
and 911 asks if they can send 5 patients.

531
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:08,270
Oh, well the regular surgery is almost over, since there are no patients take them.

532
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,800
Oh.

533
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,120
Good job.

534
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,350
It's so embarrassing. A rescue team member being rescued?

535
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:32,150
I also pay taxes.

536
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,440
Why can't I get treated?

537
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,810
Here.

538
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:39,330
Leave.

539
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:40,890
You've worked hard!

540
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,350
But you?

541
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:47,450
I sprained my ankle earlier.

542
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,250
Let's go!

543
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:02,520
Blood pressure 100/80. Pulse 62.

544
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,490
He's conscious. He was riding a bicycle and crashed into a car.

545
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:08,010
What is this? Tension pneumothorax?

546
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,770
Yes.

547
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:15,590
Oh, you're great! Thanks to you the patient survived.

548
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:18,630
I said well done!

549
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,370
Talking informal...

550
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:22,650
Ah, this lady came from Busan...

551
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:25,590
Ah, it just happened like that.

552
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:28,410
Okay, what are you doing? Let's move him.

553
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:30,900
1,2,3.

554
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,930
But why is Nurse Park Ji Na here?

555
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:36,470
I happened to be at the scene.

556
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:38,290
Did you not go to Hangang Mirae?

557
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:39,890
Ah, I returned my ID.

558
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:41,260
Intern Ahn Dae Gil. 
  - Yes!

559
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:45,470
First call cardiovascular surgery for the patient, and Nurse Park Ji Na, I'll leave the X-Ray and the CT up to you.

560
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:47,410
Yes. Let's go.

561
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,830
Yes.

562
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:52,970
 Stop, stop. 

563
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,960
 Hey, patient, I'll ask your name. 

564
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,420
 It's Choi Il Seob. 
- Do you know where are you? 

565
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,760
 Il Seob, do you know Mirae Hospital? 

566
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,010
 Hey, Nurse On.
-   

567
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:03,180
 You know Mirae Hospital, right? 

568
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,200
 Do you know him? 

569
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,560
 I'm his friend, I mean his guardian. 

570
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,600
 Yes, please wait in the waiting room. 

571
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:17,050
 No, no, I'm also a patient. I sprained my ankle it hurts a lot. I'll sit here.  

572
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:27,830
Thank you doctor. I saw you saving me.

573
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,890
Thank you so much.

574
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,430
Dr. Han Woo Jin.

575
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,360
Woo Jin.

576
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,060
Park Ji Na saved him?

577
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:03,270
What are you doing!

578
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:07,450
They should've took the homeless to the municipal hospital!

579
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,510
Ah, please call before coming! Can't you see I don't have any beds?

580
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:15,880
Ah, he passed out at the intersection.

581
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,490
This can't be! There are so many patients right now, and the doctors are not enough!

582
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:22,270
I'm sorry, it's because we're in a hurry.

583
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:24,610
Ah, really.

584
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,550
Ah, the smell of alcohol.

585
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:35,090
Grandpa, where is this place? Do you know what place is this?

586
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:38,010
Yes, a theater.

587
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:41,140
Grandpa, come to your senses, eh?

588
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,920
I want to go.

589
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,350
No, grandpa.

590
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:48,150
Hey, Intern. Why would a drunk person need treatment?

591
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:50,170
Tie him up.

592
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:51,790
Tie him?

593
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,330
Dr. Lee, aren't you going to help? You're not a doctor here anymore, right?

594
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:01,470
Yep, I must. Patients comes first, not the ID.

595
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,650
They are doing a CT right now.

596
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:18,270
Now, the vitals are good. We've already contacted the family members, so they will get here soon.

597
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:26,750
Aren't you going to Busan? Your phone kept ringing earlier.

598
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:29,460
Yes. I should. I should, but...

599
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:34,280
That patient thinks that I saved him, so I'm just worried if anything goes wrong.

600
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,950
Nothing can go wrong and if it did go wrong, he will be saved here.

601
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:43,370
There's the entrance. Sorry for our greeting.

602
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:49,990
I'm Park Ji Na. If anything goes wrong with the patient, tell them I did it.

603
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:56,920
What kind of...

604
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,220
You don't know what a nurse should do, and shouldn't do?

605
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,580
What if he had died?

606
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:24,210
I wouldn't have forgive myself! If I just stood and watched him die!

607
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:25,910
I'm busy.

608
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:39,570
You being cold to me, yes.

609
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:43,490
Okay, it's how you feel.

610
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:48,030
But why do you keep on doing dangerous things? 
And on top of that next to Lee Hae Sung?

611
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:50,290
You should care about yourself!

612
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:53,890
Someone might have been the master of robot surgery by taking care of himself.

613
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:55,790
Are you sarcastic now? 
- I feel at ease now.

614
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:58,110
Ji Na, you have to understand me.
- This is what I've been piling up in my heart.

615
00:44:58,110 --> 00:44:59,520
Huh? 
 - I have nothing to talk to you about anymore.

616
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,320
Ah, stop. Stop it please!
- Why can't you just go and take care of yourself?

617
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:22,400
It's been 3 years.

618
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:28,510
The Professor Han, who's always so logical and cold, being shaken by old feelings,

619
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:31,300
it's hard to see.

620
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:43,920
Vitals are fine and the x-ray as well. Does your head hurt?

621
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,360
I think he's homeless. His rough hands and the grease...

622
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,040
I am not homeless!

623
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,090
I... I'm telling you I'm not homeless!

624
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:54,860
Prepare for the dressing first, then we'll observe. Call me when it's ready.

625
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,190
Yes.

626
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,620
Dr. Ahn!

627
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,140
Yes!

628
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,870
What are this patient's vitals?

629
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:20,180
160/90 and the pulse is 98, he seems to be drunk.

630
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,600
Hey, isn't this a cold sweat? Did you run a blood test?

631
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:27,080
Not yet... He doesn't cooperate, so I'm just waiting for him to wake up.

632
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,330
Hey, I'm suspecting a hypoglycemia, run a blood test immediately.

633
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:30,670
Yes. 
- And untie those.

634
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:32,090
Yes!

635
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:38,300
Excuse me. Excuse me!

636
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:41,770
Is Dr. Han Woo Jin perhaps...

637
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:45,530
Aish, I can't even talk to someone.

638
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,650
I can't locate the vein.

639
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:56,460
Doctor, a seizure!

640
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:01,810
What are you doing?

641
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:03,870
I was doing the ABG check, and was about to extract his blood but suddenly...

642
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:05,800
Why check ABG?

643
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,150
Ah, that's what the book says...

644
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:10,640
Why would you run a blood test to check on arterial blood gas?

645
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,610
Nurse Ahn, 50% DWIB.

646
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:13,930
Yes.

647
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,520
It looks like a hypoglycemia shock. Grandpa, please say something. Grandpa.

648
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,350
Say something, Grandpa.

649
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:23,140
Yes, he's still conscious.

650
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:27,020
Grandpa, are you perhaps diabetic?

651
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,110
I took the medicine.

652
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:31,780
Oh. So you took the diabetic medicine?

653
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:34,910
Endure a bit, you will be fine soon.

654
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:37,200
Please endure for a bit.

655
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:10,670
What did you say? I can't hear.

656
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:12,830
It was hypoglycemia.

657
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:13,810
Say it again.

658
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:15,090
It was hypoglycemia.

659
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:16,600
How much?!

660
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,160
Blood sugar level is 53.

661
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:22,150
Intern An Dae Gil,

662
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:25,990
do you carry your head for your shoulder for exercise?

663
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:29,530
The patient was getting cold sweats, and his blood pressure and pulse were not normal,

664
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:33,710
and you didn't even check his blood?

665
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:35,630
I just thought he was a drunk homeless, so he said to tie him up...

666
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:39,210
You can't tell the difference between drunk people and sick people?!

667
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:43,150
The patient almost died from shock.

668
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:50,200
Y...you didn't check his blood? That's basic.

669
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,050
Grandpa, did you drink today?

670
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:55,330
 I'm disappointed in you Dr. An! 

671
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:58,010
I also forgot.

672
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:02,700
I think you got a shock because of that.

673
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,800
That shock turns into the Grim Reaper,

674
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:10,000
so carry some candy or chocolate for emergencies.

675
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,700
I also carry things like that because my blood sugar drops well.

676
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,560
Yes.

677
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:19,390
Thank you, young doctor.

678
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:21,630
Everything will be okay.

679
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:23,630
Rest then.

680
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,400
Intern An Dae Gil. 
- Yes.

681
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:31,310
Check his blood sugar and inform me.
- Yes.

682
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:35,710
Since when did a stranger act as a doctor in our hospital?

683
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,700
Is that patient from Hangang Mirae?

684
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:50,400
If something goes wrong, who will take responsibility, Dr. Kang Joo Ran?

685
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,790
Professor Han.

686
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:56,230
Aren't you being too greedy to keep emergency room's ranking?

687
00:49:56,230 --> 00:50:00,310
Borrowing a hanger-on's hands just because you're short staffed,

688
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:03,140
and blindly receiving patients. I don't think that's right.

689
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:08,960
I'm not sure if the director, who always goes on about 'responsibility', knows about this.

690
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,190
Because the director is like this,

691
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:14,620
both doctors and nurses are running around doing things

692
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:16,600
outside the limits of their jobs.

693
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,080
Watch your language, Professor Han!

694
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,960
Not at all.

695
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,400
You can't even control your own staff;

696
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,470
yet, you're always going on about improving the ER system.

697
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:31,100
Look here, Professor Han.

698
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:37,720
How about you try to raise your sense of responsibility and competence along with your greed.

699
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,670
I take responsibility.

700
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:42,960
I haven't avoided nor pretended not to know anything.

701
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,400
Excuse me, I've an important meeting.

702
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,100
Hanger-on?

703
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,310
There were a total of 1967 earthquakes in the Joseon Era...

704
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:15,140
What's with your clothes? 
- Up to magnitude 7...

705
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:16,970
Are you attending a funeral?
- Strong earthquakes have occurred.

706
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,500
In 1518, even here in Seoul,

707
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:23,760
the walls collapsed and many people died!

708
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,120
Oh, really?

709
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,600
You did a lot of research, you can leave now.

710
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,100
It's getting more and more frequent!
- Thank you!

711
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:34,530
In 1978, there were 5 recorded, but in 2013 there were 93!

712
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:36,590
I'm on the phone!

713
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:39,410
Director!

714
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:42,700
Come here. Come!!

715
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:52,110
Singer Han Jin is currently dating someone 13 years younger. Go investigate it secretly.

716
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,850
We're starting in a moment, please get ready!
- Ok!

717
00:51:57,850 --> 00:52:00,340
Are you done?

718
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:04,360
Okay, I got it. I'll wait for you in the parking lot.

719
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,200
Ok.

720
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:12,010
Chief Kang!

721
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:15,790
Yes, Nurse Park Ji Na.

722
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:19,370
You've worked hard today. Somehow—

723
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:22,050
What is that?

724
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:26,400
I've been thinking about this all day.

725
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,850
I liked working as a PA for the night emergency surgeries.

726
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:34,200
But without Dr. Lee, it isn't the same for me.

727
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,210
I realized that today.

728
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:37,900
Why are you like this?

729
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,540
You know how much I trust you.

730
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:44,470
In the ER, you're the veteran of the veterans.

731
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:48,230
I'm afraid that I might not deserve it... your trust.

732
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:55,060
Earlier, that pneumothorax patient... actually, I did it.

733
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:56,820
What?

734
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:00,800
What about the doctor who was next you?

735
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,320
She said she couldn't do it because she had never done it before.

736
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,620
If I hadn't done it, the patient would've died.

737
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,170
I know.

738
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:10,930
But that patient is doing okay, so what's the problem?

739
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:13,250
Professor Han found out about it.

740
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:16,650
The director will soon know about it, too.

741
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,400
No matter what...

742
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,800
You might get affected, too. So just say you didn't know.

743
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,390
Nurse Park Ji Na.

744
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:28,790
I'll always be grateful to you for taking me under your wing and being considerate of me.

745
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:31,870
Please don't lose your cause and I hope you make a good ER.

746
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:32,910
Goodbye.

747
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:35,570
Nurse Park Ji Na.

748
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:37,750
Nurse Park!

749
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:45,640
Yes, Chief?

750
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,860
Where are you, Hae Sung?
 - At the department. 

751
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:50,080
 I came to take my belongings... 

752
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:53,060
Nurse Park handed me her resignation letter.

753
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:55,810
What? Why?

754
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:59,720
Earlier, that pneumothorax patient, Ji Na did it.

755
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,840
The doctor who was next her said she'd never done it before.

756
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:05,650
Because Professor Han knows, she thought I might be in trouble.

757
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:08,450
So she handed her resignation letter before hand.

758
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:10,490
Where is she right now?

759
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:22,190
Oh. Hello.

760
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:30,490
Jung Ddol Mi.

761
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:32,430
Doctor.

762
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:35,010
Why didn't you  return to Busan?

763
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:38,850
You're worried about the patient who's known to have been saved by you?

764
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:40,610
Do you have a conscience?

765
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,450
Oh, that... I've never don't that before so...

766
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:46,430
Pneumothorax puncture!

767
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:48,580
Are you the only one who hasn't done it?

768
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:51,130
She hasn't done it, either.

769
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:52,910
But what's the difference?

770
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:57,230
You don't want to be blamed for killing a person.

771
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:02,530
She didn't want the patient to die in front of her eyes without doing anything.

772
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:08,360
The unluckiest people

773
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:14,040
are those who trust their lives to doctors like you.

774
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:18,830
I also tried.

775
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:21,210
I had only seen it once during my internship, how could I do it?

776
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:24,110
Killer is better than the bystander.

777
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:30,210
Your rotten license is just a sheet of paper than can't use even a needle.

778
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:58,440
 Dr. Jung Ddol Mi 

779
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:04,090
Ji Na.

780
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,040
You're not going to Hangang Mirae?

781
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,180
I heard you caused trouble.

782
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:15,490
You heard it already?

783
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:19,980
You always walk when you have to think a lot.

784
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:24,340
Instead of grieving over your unemployment, let's celebrate.

785
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:27,310
Your first pneumothorax puncture.

786
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,840
   
- Based on recognition and excellence of their medical staff,

787
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:40,020
it's right for the $50 million funding to go to Mirae Hospital.

788
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:43,320
They will soon open a branch in the US, too.

789
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:48,490
Well, the council will decide on it objectively.

790
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:52,230
But from what I heard, they're leaning towards Mirae Hospital

791
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:56,000
as it is a hospital specializing in cancer.

792
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,410
If you received the funds, how do you plan to use it?

793
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:04,650
Professor Han seems to be gaining the spotlight both home and abroad.

794
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:07,370
I should focus on developing it.

795
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:14,010
And our ER is not yet advanced enough to compete on a global scale.

796
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:19,310
Ah, you performed robot surgery for the minister's wife, didn't you?

797
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:22,490
Ah, she's fully recovered now.

798
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:24,830
I'm really thankful.

799
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:28,300
Don't mention it. It was in its early stage.

800
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:33,650
But since I have an appointment, I need to leave first.

801
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:35,940
Then I'll see you off.

802
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:38,470
Sorry for taking your time when you seem to be busy..

803
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:41,410
Oh, no. Please continue your talks.

804
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:42,450
Go right ahead, Minister.

805
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:45,500
Goodbye 
 -Yes, goodbye.

806
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:49,490
You've heard his answers, right?

807
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:53,630
Thanks to you, Congressman, everything went smoothly.

808
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:58,570
Honestly, I'd prefer it that you use the fund on Chief Kang's ER.

809
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:01,730
You'll be family soon, it's only natural for you to look out for her.

810
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:04,280
Thank you for your understanding.

811
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:09,780
I'll go home on my own, so you can get off work now.

812
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:13,280
It's personal. Someone will pick me up.

813
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,640
   
Why is he not coming with the minister of health?

814
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:41,670
Cheers!

815
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:44,170
I feel really good today.

816
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:48,010
Why? Because I praised you for your pneumothorax puncture?

817
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:53,540
I didn't know how good it felt saving someone.

818
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:55,910
I learned well staying by your side.

819
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:59,140
Still, don't do it again. You will be in danger.

820
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,880
There's someone else who said that.

821
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,180
Who? Professor Han?

822
00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:05,800
You know?

823
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,270
What happened between you two? You two seemed to get along well.

824
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:14,610
Did you fight? Or dated and crashed?

825
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:18,670
Yes, we had a huge, huge fight.  Why?

826
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:21,920
Why couldn't I become a doctor?

827
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,830
That...

828
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:27,190
There must be a reason.

829
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:29,750
What is it?
- You can't be better than me.

830
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:32,680
Oh really this evil—

831
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:38,450
Dr. Ddol Mi, I don't know what happened but stop crying and lets eat.

832
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:43,120
I'm starving to death! I lied perfectly to the hospital,

833
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,430
that the car completely broke.

834
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:48,310
Here. Let's eat.

835
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:58,900
I'll never come back to Seoul. These bastards...

836
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:06,790
I want to perform a surgery, the meat smells the same.

837
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:09,290
It really does.

838
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,120
Cheers!

839
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:25,450
Park Ji Na.

840
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:27,250
What is this?

841
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:35,080
Ji Na. Leave!

842
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:26,100


843
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:30,520
 The tower crane suddenly fell over and the road is now in chaos. 

844
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,560
 That when you open him up, you might discover his lungs and liver are damaged, too. 

845
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,020
 Aren't you avoiding the patient because of it? 

846
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:37,820
 That I want to focus on patients I can cure, 

847
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:39,240
 is that really something to be blamed for? 

848
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:43,760
 If we just get a little crazy now, this patient will be able to go home. 

849
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,620
 Come back! Please! 

850
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:48,460
 So professor, about the sinkhole yesterday... 

851
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:51,640
 Something is happening with the strata.
