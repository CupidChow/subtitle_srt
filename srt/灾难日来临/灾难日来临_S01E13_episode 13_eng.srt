1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,490
  The earthquake seen from the inside and the earthquake seen from the outside are different. 

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,430
 The more time we drag, the death count keeps rising. 

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:10,350
  Disaster Medical Assistance Team (DMAT). Let's start the DMAT. 

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,650
  Hold on, hold on! 

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,190
 I... want to live. 

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:24,020
 Get your head straight. I'll definitely save you. I promise. 

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,520
 If you couldn't save him, you could have just told us. 

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:35,040
  You are a butcher!
  A human butcher.  

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,280
 They're going to be at a relative's... At a relative's. 

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,060
 What should we do with our daughter? 
I said what should we do with our daughter? 

11
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,130
 I'm sorry...for not saving you... 

12
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,530
 It's right that a person like me shouldn't be a doctor. 

13
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,520
 Don't leave Doctor.
 If you aren't going to be a doctor, then who will? 

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,100
 So please don't go. 

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,160
Hold on tight.

16
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,290
I said hold on tight.

17
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,210
I did.

18
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,310
 

19
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:41,250


20
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,560
Don't do it please.

21
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,760
Why? 
-I don't like it when a man touches  my hair.

22
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,550
Man?

23
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,720
So I'm a man to you.

24
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,740
Then, are you a woman?

25
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,150
If there's a female as tall as you, they should go to the Korea National Training Center.

26
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,070
Why? Are you afraid?

27
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,780
If I say I'm not, then I would by lying.

28
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,790
No one will say anything. They don't even know you ran out.

29
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:41,390
The minute we pass that door, I have to fight again.

30
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,200
The burden of dealing with a person's life... fear.

31
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,240
Even the tragic feeling of losing a patient...

32
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,240
Do you have the confidence to win?

33
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,690
I have to fight to know that.

34
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:01,220
But did Ji Won really say that to you... a dead corpse?

35
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,730
I did add to it a little,

36
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,390
but that's what it seemed like to my ears.

37
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,590
Really? Then, I'll just believe in them.

38
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,850
Yes, let's try to have strength.

39
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:30,580
That unlucky DMAT... I felt uneasy after I came back to the hospital. Ah, this is all Dr. Eun So Yool's fault.

40
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,820
Ah, why did I have to meet her there of all places?

41
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,790
If you do it once, it's not that bad.

42
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,390
You said you didn't want to do it earlier. 
You are going back and forth.

43
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:42,600
I'm an intern, but you're a fellow.
 A fellow with lots of experience.

44
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,490
That's right. You should acknowledge that.

45
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,560
But are you praising me or insulting me right now?

46
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,880
Why are you like this, this fellow? You're being cheap. Of course, it was a compliment.

47
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,790
Yes, well...anyways, the outside is dangerous. It's dangerous.

48
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:02,140
Doctor Lee, where did you go? We've been looking for you for quite a while.

49
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,600
Doctor Lee, it has been a while! I thought that you were trapped inside that room and weren't going to come out.

50
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,700
From rumors, I heard that you only had conversations with bugs...

51
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:15,490
Doctor, they're going to increase the DMAT team. The captain in charge is going to be Professor Han.

52
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,830
Really? That's good.

53
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,560
Do you have the chart of Captain Choi's daughter?

54
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,670
The previous hospital's CT scanner was working so we did one and brought it with us.

55
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,970
Put it up. 
 Yes.

56
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,260
It's Takayasu Arteritis.
 

57
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:51,040
The blood vessel is very weakened. And the cardiac arteries are inflamed... it seems like it's stenosed.

58
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,000
That's why everybody is hesitant. Did you find out the cause of the sepsis?

59
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,170
We sent a blood culture, but the results didn't come out yet. So, we are just giving her Vancomycin.

60
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:01,950
Okay, a DIC patient can get acute kidney failure. Who is monitoring her?
 

61
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,490
Chief Kang.

62
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,750
-Dr. An.
-Yes?

63
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,930
Captain Choi's daughter, make sure you do the dressing well on her legs. And if something is weird, call Chief Kang.

64
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,400
Yes.

65
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,830
Stay and organize this.

66
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,760
Let's go Woo Sung.
-Yes.

67
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,970
Leave.

68
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,570
I said leave.

69
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:52,050
If you're not going to help my daughter, stop giving false hope and just leave.

70
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,850
I'm a quack.

71
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,070
It's my first time seeing your daughter's illness as a doctor,

72
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,530
and I know why the other doctors are saying they can't do it.

73
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:14,210
I understand. Since I understand you now, don't explain and just go.

74
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,780
Sir.

75
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,710
Her leg got cut-

76
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,570
How is the scene?

77
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,800
It's okay.

78
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,600
I'm sorry. You guys are busy but I left my position.

79
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,070
Why would you say something like that? What could be more important than your own child?

80
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:56,050
Anyhow, Soo Young's leg...

81
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,700
Since she's saved, she's okay, right? She can live, right?

82
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,680
Captain, they said they can't do anything after laying her down like this?

83
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,610
The doctor that I trusted even said that he's a quack and he surrendered.

84
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,290
Save her.

85
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:30,000
Save her. Do whatever you've got to do and save her!!

86
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,060
How can I save her?

87
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,090
You're a doctor, so you must know.

88
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,840
I don't know that's why I'm like this.

89
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,370
You have a great excuse...

90
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:47,910
You told me you'll save them no matter what so I should just rescue them and bring them to you. But now, you're running away?

91
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:52,730
Right, you were always like this.
Today as well, since you can't do anything,

92
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:58,300
you always ordered people below you...
In front of me, you pretend to be conceited, pretend to be nice.... pretend to be an older brother!

93
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:08,310
Save one more person. You have strength so your punches hurt.

94
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,470
You still don't understand your brother?

95
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,910
Brother?

96
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,780
You shouldn't also add to the trouble.

97
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,510
Dr. Lee,

98
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,390
he must want to erase this day from his life.

99
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,440
Yes?

100
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,510
It's me.

101
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,000
What is it that you're coming to my room?

102
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,100
Um...I was wondering if you might have any books or documents.

103
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,840
Takayasu Arteritis.

104
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,800
You... still haven't come to your senses?

105
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,260
Those hitters just don't choose to walk on four balls..

106
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,630
If they get hit, it's home run. And it's because they get hit accurately, they avoid it.

107
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:23,480
I'm doing this so I won't be hit. Do you have any or not?

108
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,770
I don't have any.

109
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:31,280
It's a diagnosis that I've only seen in textbooks. I should know about it, so I can decide whether to give up or give it a try.

110
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,470
Stop it. The Director is targeting you.

111
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,690
Why would he to a peon like me?

112
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,190
Since his nephew died.

113
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,210
Right.

114
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,380
I don't have anything to say.

115
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:57,000
You go out to DMAT and physically be careful and just follow my orders.

116
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,260
I guess that's the right thing to do...trying my best.

117
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:11,200
If you don't want to make another patient like Ji Won, listen to me.

118
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,490
This isn't a request, but an order.

119
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:30,910
Wow, you organized it for every robot surgery case, by every cancer type.

120
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:38,170
Stomach cancer has the most. Spleen cancer, liver cancer, bile duct cancer, esophageal cancer...

121
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,870
You didn't just become a recognized robot surgeon for nothing.

122
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:46,270
I really don't want you to become the hospital director's sacrifice.

123
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:50,740
Your skills, your hands are such a waste.

124
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,430
Takayasu's Disease.

125
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,670
Oh, you are awake?

126
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,970
Are you hurt anywhere? What about your head? Is it okay?

127
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,150
It's a relief.

128
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,810
What is?

129
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,540
That you're here.

130
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,380
I was so scared... by myself.

131
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,020
I'm sorry, Dong Ha.

132
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:07,440
You found me. You worried a lot, right?

133
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,740
My Dong Ha is all grown up now.

134
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,060
I am only 7 years old. I'm still a child.

135
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,020
No, you're not a child.

136
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:22,040
Sleep some more.
Close your eyes, your eyes.

137
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:44,510
Tomorrow, let's send off Ji Won.

138
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,030
We can't even take him far,

139
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,790
and we can't leave him like that either.

140
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:57,820
The roads are a mess so even if it takes a while;

141
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:03,330
with an ambulance, they said that we can at least get to the crematorium.

142
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,730
Let's send him off now.

143
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,320
Where are you going?

144
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,390
We need to send him off with some things.

145
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,910
Chairman!

146
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,810
Aren't you the top chairman?

147
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,540
Lawyer Seo?

148
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,340
Yes, but...

149
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,600
Are you okay, Chairman?

150
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,900
It's my mother.

151
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:56,340
It seems like she's going to have an exacerbation of her asthma again, so I came to the hospital...

152
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,980
I see that your mother was all still alive...

153
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:06,780
but I.... Ji Won

154
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,920
Ji Won died.

155
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,040
Excuse me?

156
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:27,220


157
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:53,430
Doctor, where are you going?

158
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,730
Why? You thought I was going to run away?

159
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,000
Ah, I couldn't find you anywhere.

160
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,860
Motorbike was still here and I've been looking for you for awhile.

161
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,400
Do you know where Eun So Yool?

162
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,800
To rest her eyes, in the psychiatric lecture hall.

163
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,820
Why?

164
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,700
If it's PTSD, then I should get treatment.

165
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,600
When going out as DMAT and it happens again, I would be so embarrassed to death.

166
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,860
Doctor, you seem to be normal now.

167
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:26,030
Jung Ddol Mi, don't misunderstand. I didn't come back because of you. Ok?

168
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:32,190
Ji Won, I think he said something like this to me;

169
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:35,280
"Don't get hurt and fall because of me".

170
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,560
To make him feel worthwhile for being on this earth.

171
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,760
After that, I came to my senses.

172
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,200
So, I didn't return because of you.

173
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,720
Ok, I got you. You didn't come back because of me but because of Ji Won.

174
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,790
I said I got you.

175
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:58,490
Even though Eun So Yool is sleeping, I need to go bother her.

176
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,860
All the test results... It's all correct: PTSD.

177
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,720
Treat me.

178
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:14,570
You suddenly became a different person. You seem like a person who lived their whole life before.

179
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:19,410
Even if they say that the doctor's profession was created from the curse of God,

180
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:24,110
I want to let people live long with their families.

181
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:27,090
Just like you said, that seemed more like me.

182
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,170
Someone even went to Busan and returned to a battle-field like place because of me.

183
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:36,690
She even went all the way up to the rooftop carrying a patient.

184
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,530
If I fall down like this,

185
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:43,230
what will I become to that woman?

186
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,110
I want to do well while in DMAT.

187
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:49,400
First of all, SSRI and anxiolytic drugs...
 

188
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,080
Well, I will prescribe various drugs. So, intake it and keep some as emergency meds.

189
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,900
If your symptoms show up at the scene, take it right away. You'll get better.

190
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,470
Ok.

191
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:01,370
Let's do EMDR therapy immediately.
 

192
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,450
You will find a peace of mind more easily

193
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,790
and the pain related to your negative memories will disappear.

194
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,340
Yes.

195
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,460
Follow the moving light.

196
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:14,900
And like that, you're facing your negative memories.

197
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,600
When was it that you felt the most miserable?

198
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,390
A car accident happened when I was at the wheel.

199
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,430
When father died while he was next to me.

200
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,650
What kind of feeling did you feel?

201
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,850
I wanted to take him out

202
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:37,290
but I was stuck in the car, too, and couldn't move.

203
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:44,610
I was incapable, lethargic and useless.

204
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,910
Did your father resent you?

205
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,200
No.

206
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,400
What about now? Now, do you regret that you survived?

207
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,490
No.

208
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,090
I think it's a good thing that I survived like this.

209
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,420
 Don't go, Doctor. 

210
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,700
 If you go now, that means you're quitting as a doctor. 

211
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,350
 Doctor, 

212
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,230
 if you don't become a doctor, then who will? 

213
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,070
 So don't leave. 

214
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,940
♫Do you know?♫

215
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,580
♫I can’t wait to know♫

216
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:20,820
♫It is painful, not love, I’m scared♫

217
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,410
♫Even when I try to stop these feelings♫

218
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,470
♫Even when I try to hide these feelings again♫

219
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,370
Don't leave.
♫You come by my side ♫

220
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,670
Don't leave.
♫and stay with me♫

221
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:42,750
♫Thank you, even if my world hurts me as if breaking down♫

222
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:47,800
♫The person who always save me♫

223
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:53,730
♫ is only you♫

224
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:08,360


225
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,030
Where are you going?

226
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,100
What do you mean?

227
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,190
It's daylight, so I've to go to work and save people.

228
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:41,030
Are you really... We don't know if our own daughter is going to die or not

229
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,750
and you're going to save other people?

230
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,500
Will she survive if I stay here?

231
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,900
If she would, then I would stay here hundreds of thousands of times.

232
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,030
There's nothing I can do for her

233
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,550
and my heart aches the more I look at her.

234
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,030
Whether you die and go to hell, become a fire fighter.

235
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,680
So, you can extinguish the flames of hell.

236
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,900
Don't worry. If you die, you will go to Cheongdam.

237
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:12,980
Captain, leave the rescue site to us and you stay here.

238
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,100
You have to take care of So Yeon.

239
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,520
Looking at her feels as if I'm in hell more.

240
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,240
Let's go!

241
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,360
 Let's go quickly. Let's go. 

242
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,810
Why?

243
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,590
The sun's up.

244
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,260
The sun is up.

245
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:01,790
I should go and see patients.

246
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:05,790
Do something about the bathrooms, it's so stinky that I can't even go near it.

247
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,380
It's about to be a hotbed for diseases.

248
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:12,080
The remaining water had exploded and leaked out.

249
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,260
I should at least ask the firefighters to give us some lake water

250
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,490
but my mouth won't open because I feel so sorry.

251
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,570
Is it really hard?

252
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,810
So Yeon? Choi Il Sub's daughter?

253
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,580
She doesn't even complain once. It's really difficult.

254
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,600
But since I don't know,

255
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,500
use the antibiotics well and please get a hold of the sepsis.

256
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,560
I came to request for that before I leave with DMAT.

257
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,480
You're going out with  Prof. Han in charge?

258
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,200
I know that he was chosen as the captain.

259
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,150
Aigoo... you'll clash against him a lot.

260
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,680
Even if we clash a lot, we're still both doctors.

261
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,100
He's not even saying anything wrong, he's just different from me.

262
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,980
I think the Hospital Director is planning something.

263
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,550
Be careful.

264
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,400
Yes.

265
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,600
I'm really causing so many people to worry.

266
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,210
I'm sorry.

267
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,810
Ok, let's see.

268
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,670
Why are you like that, sister?

269
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,380
It's nothing.

270
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,790
Are the antibiotics not working? Her fever hasn't gone down much.

271
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,800
It's looks like that.

272
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,980
Your Highness-like Kim Hyun Sook, please look after her.

273
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,430
I...have to go to throw this out.

274
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,150
Wait..

275
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,200
This.

276
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,350
 This dark chocolate is good for your heart. 

277
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,620
My stomach hurts.

278
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,360
Oh, yes. I'll give you painkillers right away.

279
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,390
Mister,

280
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:04,270
I'm 15 years old.

281
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:42,140
 Mirae Hospital, Mirae Hospital. A fire has been discovered. 

282
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,350
 Can you dispatch some people? 

283
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,530
A fire? They want us to move again? 
   Mirae Hospital, Mirae Hospital! Due to a fire... 

284
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:51,050
We can't because it's too much.
   - Can you dispatch..? 

285
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,300
What are you doing? I couldn't find this no matter how much I searched...

286
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,560
It's because I don't know how to use a walkie-talkie.

287
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:02,060
Yes, this is Mirae Hospital. Please repeat what you said.

288
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,740
 Yes, this is the fire department. 

289
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,700
 Can you dispatch towards a fire site? 

290
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,470
Yes. Where are you?

291
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:12,160
What are you going to do with the location, huh? Why are you causing problems?

292
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:16,360
Be quiet and go find Dr. Lee or Chief Kang.

293
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,780
Now, now. Everyone pay attention.

294
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:32,770
Before leaving, I'm going to say this one more time.

295
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,710
They're saying it's a fire site.

296
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:37,460
Your safety comes first.

297
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:43,060
Also, overdoing it because you want to save someone...

298
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,080
is strictly forbidden.

299
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,600
All medical treatment needs my authorization to be carried out.

300
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,850
Do you understand?
-Yes.

301
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,660
You should never get hurt.

302
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,970
I understand.

303
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:57,000
Ok, let's go.

304
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:23,300
We will leave then.

305
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,690
Stop! Wait...

306
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,490
Take these.

307
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,020
Thank you.

308
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,320
You know what to do if your symptoms show up, right?

309
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,700
I'll test it out... whether you are a quack or not.

310
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:54,030
Nothing would go wrong, right?

311
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:57,390
Dr. Lee must do well.

312
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,230
I was able to block Lee Hae Sung's reinstatement,

313
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:06,150
and I'm able to see the end of his career as a doctor too...

314
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,870
My brother-in-law is the problem.

315
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,570
Yes.

316
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:20,850
Aigoo! Lawyer, what are you doing here?

317
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,040
Did you get hurt?

318
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,600
No, no. It's just my mother.

319
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,460
What happened?

320
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,990
She has asthma.

321
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:32,750
I don't even have emergency medication.
And I also think she will have a seizure.

322
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,650
I'll tell the ER...

323
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,310
to take care of her well.

324
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,490
Thank you.

325
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,290
Have a seat.
- Yes.

326
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:44,630
After the earthquake occurred, everything is a disaster.

327
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:47,450
No secretary can be seen.

328
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,610
Have it.

329
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:51,730
This is the supplied coffee. It's quite good.

330
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,640
The original taste is also quite unique.

331
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,820
Nothing like this has come into our office yet,

332
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,830
some things must be different.

333
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:00,430
Don't you think they gave it to us, so that we won't sleep and just work?

334
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,900
This place needs to be more crowded with patients to do that.

335
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:08,140
When the earthquake subsides,

336
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,450
there are going to be many problems you need to fix so

337
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:13,070
I'll request beforehand.

338
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,950
I...

339
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:18,320
I was with the Chairman last night for a short period of time.

340
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,630
Oh yeah?

341
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:26,560
You must've heard then, our Ji Won...

342
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:31,060
By any chance,

343
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,040
no lawsuit is being filed?

344
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,580
Against Lee Hae Sung?

345
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,460
I mean that..

346
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:45,260
He said that he wanted to give back to society the entirety of Mirae Hospital as well as the Group and Foundation.

347
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:49,760
Because it all became useless after Jiwon's death.

348
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,450
That he wants children like Jiwon to get proper treatment.

349
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:00,290
In accordance with the earthquake recovery timing, he wanted to readjust his will.

350
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:10,740
I know how much effort the Chairman has put into the Hospital's growth but

351
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,740
I thought this is too one-sided.

352
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:18,570
I was wondering if perhaps the family members should at least try to try to dissuade the Chairman.

353
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:27,830
The reason I'm telling you this, I want to be appointed for society restoration.

354
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:31,940
You can just accept it as my desire to continue being the corporate lawyer.

355
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,620
Then goodbye.

356
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,480
Society restoration?

357
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:52,300
With whose permission?

358
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,160
Brother.

359
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,800
Brother!

360
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:12,240
 Danger: Entry prohibited 

361
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,450
How can I send you off?

362
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:49,910
You were so young.

363
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,100
Where is the exact location?

364
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,020
You know the villa on the hill?

365
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,750
What? An aftershock occurred again?

366
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,960
We can't seem to figure out whether it's an aftershock but...

367
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,510
They went back to get their belongings, so a landslide has resulted.

368
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:16,170
Coordinate properly with the police so people don't near

369
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,550
these dangerous places.

370
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,510
Sung Bin, connect me to the police chief.

371
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,870
Oh, Ok.

372
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:25,580
Because these are people who have lost everything, they won't understand.

373
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:28,910
The fact that they're alive should be enough for them.

374
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:31,440
Director, I'll say this once more.

375
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,820
Saving lives comes first.

376
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,920
Simply speaking, there's nothing to salvage even if you spray it down with water

377
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,040
since everything is already destroyed.

378
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,470
Tell all of the firefighters in the Seoul district once more.

379
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,300
Yes, I'll do it that way.

380
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,280
Yes.

381
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,240
Brother-in-law is running late.

382
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,990
Did he go somewhere?

383
00:32:55,990 --> 00:33:00,600
He went to the house to get some things to include for when we cremate Jiwon,

384
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,020
for when we send him off.

385
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,860
Not the seal?

386
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:09,170
What? Why would he go to get that?

387
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,920
It's nothing.

388
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:18,220
Hey, can you ask the fire fighters to stop by the house to check up on him?

389
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:22,260
Noona, I know your uneasy heart but differentiate between our private and personal lives please!

390
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,080
Why are you getting angry?

391
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,690
I just said it because I was frustrated.

392
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:27,890
I'm sorry.

393
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:30,620
This won't do. I'll have to go.

394
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:34,160
Sister, just stay here, you'll just cross each other on the roads.

395
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,670
No, I have things I need to get, too.

396
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:38,400
I'll be back.
- No!

397
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,830
Just stay...

398
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,180
So it's not the seal?

399
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,360
  Chief, we succeeded in the fire control. 

400
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,820
  It is finished. 

401
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,560
  A person is need of rescue found. A person is need of rescue found. 

402
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,360
There's a swimming pool nearby, so don't be so frugal and just spray it everywhere.

403
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,670
 Yes. 

404
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:58,280
We discovered someone on the third floor, but

405
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,100
he has severe burns and his condition isn't good.

406
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,010
The building might collapse at any time so be careful.

407
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:06,140
And ask the medical team to get here quickly, please!

408
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,390
I got you, bastard.

409
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:10,630
Firefighter Yong, why is there fire here?

410
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:14,500
They came back to take the household appliances and started a fire because it was cold at night.

411
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,280
There must have been gas, so it had blown up.

412
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,150
Go and see if there are people that need help.

413
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,660
I got you.

414
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,060
Hey!!

415
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,130
There are people down here.

416
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:32,040
  We are reporting from Yeonggwang district. Yeonggwang district fire control finished. 

417
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,640
What do you mean fire control?

418
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:37,330
Captain, didn't I clearly order you to put saving lives as the first priority?

419
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:38,880
What fire control?

420
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,330
I clearly instructed them as well.

421
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,860
Hey! What's going on?!!

422
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,030
What fire control?

423
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:49,240
There was a report that a person is inside and it's impossible to enter without controlling the fire. End.

424
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:53,410
So, I understand the heart of saving one or two people, but

425
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:56,660
why don't you know that you can save 10 or 20 more people with that oil?

426
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,390
Because I feel bad for even that one person.

427
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,800
Are you getting caught up in your own emotions

428
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,050
that you're going against your superior's orders?

429
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:06,250
This is obviously against orders.

430
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,280
Reveal your identity!

431
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,990
Yeonggwang district Chief firefighter, Choi Il Sub.

432
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:13,240
It's you again?

433
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,670
Yes, it's me again.

434
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:18,160
If you're going to punish me, then I'll accept the punishment. However, I'll just say one thing.

435
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,650
Just as the police can't just stay still and watch a thief, the firefighters here are not people that can ignore a fire after seeing it.

436
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:26,910
And don't tell us to rescue people in need that the hospital ignores,

437
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:30,160
I would rather you call a funeral director. That would be a better option. The end!

438
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,130
Hey, hello, it's not that...

439
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,730
Hey, Captain Choi! Ah!

440
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:50,050
There will be a lot of burn patients so make sure to pack plenty of saline and gauze.

441
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,500
Yes, Brother.

442
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,200
Hey, Lee Hae Sung.

443
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,790
I mean, I must confirm something.

444
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:01,800
From now on,  you're not part of our hospital staff.

445
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,420
So, you've to ask for Prof. Han's permission to do anything.

446
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,410
Don't splatter your crap onto us.

447
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:10,700
Shut up!

448
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,950
We will return now, that's the end.

449
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:15,050
Where are the patients?

450
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:18,400
There are a total of 4

451
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,960
and the patient inside the building has the most severe burns out of the 4.

452
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,230
You go there, Dr. Lee.

453
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,980
Yes. Dr. Jung Ddol Mi and Hyun Sook, let's go.
-Yes!

454
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:28,880
We left one person under the building debris until you got here.

455
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,710
Debris?

456
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:33,240
Are you saying that a patient is still under all the debris?

457
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,970
Yes. It's dangerous if we just pull him out.

458
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,270
Go and have a look.

459
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:40,710
What about safety measures? Are you sure it's safe?

460
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:44,610
I don't know, I can't guarantee anything but it was fine when we went back and forth.

461
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,660
Medical staff going in like this is reckless. Safety has to be assured first.

462
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,780
We're working in there right now, so are you saying we're reckless?

463
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:55,140
I can't say you guys aren't.

464
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,430
That kind of mindset will make a secondary accident.

465
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:00,600
Either bring that patient here or we give up on that patient.

466
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:06,030
We worked so hard to save the patient, is it that easy to say give up?

467
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:11,920
Chief, you said that when these people come,

468
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,100
we'll be able to save people and we waited until now.

469
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,550
Where is the patient? I'll go.

470
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,470
Nurse Park!

471
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,410
If it wasn't dangerous, then why would we come out in the first place?

472
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:22,480
Did you forget already to only do medical treatment with my permission?

473
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,150
I have to see the patient so I can get your permission or not to do anything.

474
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:28,270
Where is it? The patient.

475
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:31,680
Ki Woong, take her inside.

476
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,160
Please follow me.

477
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,170
Use a helmet. Give her a helmet, Ki Woong.
-Yes.

478
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,170
 Seriously. 

479
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:41,600
Dr. Yoo, go follow her.

480
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,980
I'm going?

481
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,770
I'll go then.

482
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,400
What about other patients?

483
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,830
He has an airway burn, so I can't put it in.

484
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:18,850
Doctor, how will you treat the patient when you're having such a hard time?

485
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,630
Wait a minute! Wait a minute.  It's okay.

486
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:25,730
It will be okay soon. I'll do it in a minute.

487
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:27,520
We have to do a tracheostomy.

488
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,180
His condition is serious.They aren't 2nd degree burns, they're 3rd degree burns.

489
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,570
The total body surface burned is over 70%.

490
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:33,850
Wait a minute.

491
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:35,990
Ayo!! Seriously!!

492
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:38,150
Why is this happening?

493
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:41,100
Just why?!!!

494
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:55,720
Please. Please. Please. Please.

495
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,170
Doctor!! Don't do it. Wait a minute.

496
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,540
It will end.

497
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,330
Please don't do it.

498
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,730
It's okay, Doctor. It will be okay.

499
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,700
It's okay, Doctor.

500
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,930
It's okay, Doctor. It's okay.

501
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:26,030
Why am I like this?

502
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,360
You're a little sick, that's all.

503
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,150
It's okay, Doctor.

504
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:33,870
It's okay. It's okay.

505
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,290
Jung Mi,

506
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,370
I got this from Eun So Yool.

507
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:50,410
I'll go and get some water.

508
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:52,110
Don't go.

509
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,100
We're giving up on this patient.

510
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,880
Jung Dol Mi, call the ambulance.

511
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,390
We're not giving up.

512
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:23,010
It was decided that you guys will follow my lead, so listen.

513
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:27,010
I will follow your orders if it is an order to save him, but I can't follow this order.

514
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:30,560
Lee Hae Sung, he has an airway burn.

515
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,270
Intubation is impossible.

516
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:34,760
Sister, please prepare the tracheostomy.

517
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,310
Yes.

518
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:41,180
The burn is severe. A tracheostomy will also be hard.

519
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,620
His skin has no strength so it will crumble.

520
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,090
You haven't tried yet.

521
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:50,370
If the tracheostomy works, then he will breathe. 
If it fails, we can give up then.

522
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:52,090
Jung Ddol Mi, disinfect.

523
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:53,130
Yes.

524
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:06,940
Sister, give the me scalpel.
- Yes.

525
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,500
Mosquito forceps.

526
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,300
Retractor.

527
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,630
-Give me the tube.
-Yes.

528
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,770
Hey, Dr. Noh. Did you hear about it?

529
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:04,720
What? Hear what?

530
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,690
I saved that patient; I pulled him out of the building.

531
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:10,330
You did a good job. I've to take the stretcher, so...

532
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,980
Hey, listen..

533
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:15,130
But a rebar had been stuck here.

534
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:18,730
When I looked at the location, it was just past above the subclavian artery.

535
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:21,260
I don't have time, so move.
-I mean, Ouch it hurts.

536
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:24,880
If the rebar went thru, there would have been a lot of bleeding.  They don't even know anything...

537
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,270
Hey, I was talking... This guy...

538
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:29,210
Please save the patients first!

539
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:35,270
Be careful, careful.

540
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,770
Be careful.

541
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,610
Hey.

542
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:42,980
What is this?

543
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,880
Did you save this patient?

544
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,780
What?

545
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:51,010
When I was cutting the rebar with the hydraulic shear, you stole my helmet and was crouched in the back hiding.

546
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,350
Did you see it?

547
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,220
I'm sorry.

548
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,380
It's a relief that I had experience with operating a hydraulic shear.

549
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,340
What about the vitals?

550
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,840
He seems okay, so we must move him quick.

551
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,230
Firefighter Yong, don't go to Mirae Hospital and Yoodae Hospital.

552
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:21,210
It's full of doctors who say it isn't possible to do anything.

553
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:23,210
What did you say just now?

554
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,860
Did I say anything wrong?

555
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,590
We saved this patient, risking our lives.

556
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:32,240
You guys only pick whoever you want to pick and then only save them.

557
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:36,650
On top of that, you whine about assuring your safety in this chaos right now.

558
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:39,880
Would you send your team members to a dangerous place?

559
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,710
I'm the same, too.

560
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:44,400
We're people that came out to save other people. Don't talk recklessly.

561
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,900
We're risking our lives and putting everything out there.

562
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,740
Do you know how scary it is in there? In that dark place?

563
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:54,510
Hey, Doctor, we've been rescuing buried people in there for the past 3 days.

564
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:56,500
Hydraulic shear...

565
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:02,590
  This is the government. Answer. Yeonggwang, Yeonggwang. 

566
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:04,220
Yes, this is Yeonggwang District Firefighter.

567
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:07,350
  A wounded person has been found due to a forklift accident on a Yeonggwang crossroad. 

568
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:09,920
  Order to rescue. Order to rescue. 

569
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,350
I got you.

570
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,890
Ki Woong and Woo Sung, come with me. Young Seob and Sang Yeob-

571
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:18,130
Board the patients and hurry up.

572
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:19,920
Who's going from the DMAT team?

573
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,100
We will all go.

574
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:27,750
Why can't I go?

575
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,290
It's my house over there.

576
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:32,780
Because of the earthquake, there was a landslide.

577
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,480
No one can go in.

578
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,130
What?

579
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,600
Yes, this Mirae hospital's Chief Kang.

580
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,320
 It's the police. 

581
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:49,050
 This person here said she is President of Mirae Hospital and to made a call to the hospital. 

582
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:51,460
Yes, yes. I'll request it of you please.

583
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:54,290
 Chief Kang, this is President Lee. 

584
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:56,430
Yes, President Lee.

585
00:44:56,430 --> 00:45:00,140
 Did my husband come to the hospital? 

586
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,840
No, I didn't see him.

587
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,190
Then, can you please look for him.

588
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,980
He said he was coming home, but

589
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:10,560
after waiting for so long at the hospital and then coming home...

590
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,010
There was a landslide at my house.

591
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:15,560
I understand!

592
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,930
Please wait a for a bit.

593
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,990
So it's like this?

594
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:39,390
Society restoration...

595
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:45,830
Brother...

596
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:50,630
In Mirae Hospital, advancing in the United States...

597
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:55,490
That wasn't easy but I, Park Gun, accomplished it.

598
00:45:55,490 --> 00:46:02,390
After raising a bio-industry and advancing Korea's KOSDAQ,

599
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:04,790
I, Park Gun...

600
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:07,200
I accomplished it.

601
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,130
After trying everything...

602
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:13,280
How Mirae Hospital...

603
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,540
How I raised Mirae Hospital...

604
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,130
You don't know.

605
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:25,030
How you're just the body...

606
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,610
How dare you move!

607
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:34,550
You want to kick me out now that it's all over?

608
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,160
Who said you can come in?!!

609
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,980
I'm sorry, but it was urgent.

610
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,470
President Lee's husband didn't come here, right?

611
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,660
Why are you asking me that? I don't know!!

612
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:52,350
It seems that he has disappeared due to a landslide near the house.

613
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:53,560
I think you'll have to go down and....

614
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,160
Wait, wait, wait!

615
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,510
I didn't hear earlier, what did you say?

616
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:01,040
Chairman Lee seems to have gone missing.

617
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,960
I'm sorry.

618
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:09,780
Take this.

619
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,140
This is hospital's Park Gun.

620
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,980
 Gun, it's me. 

621
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,350
 Brother-in-law isn't at the hospital?
- No, he's not. 

622
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:18,820
He's not where Ji Won is either.

623
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:22,500
Ah... what should I do? What should I do?

624
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:27,140
Due to a landslide, I think that he's trapped inside the home.

625
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:32,140
 Send the doctors so he can be treated as soon as he is rescued. 

626
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:36,580
Noona, is brother-in-law even alive?

627
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,690
 I don't know. 

628
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:41,170
 What should I do? 

629
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:43,490
 If something happens to him, too... 

630
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:45,230
 Gun. 

631
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:49,170
DMAT is outside right now so I'll send them over.

632
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:51,010
Yes.

633
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:52,400
DMAT team...

634
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,550
They said that they're going over to the area but-

635
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:04,230
Professor Han...Professor Han has to do well.

636
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,170
 Is someone in there? 

637
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:14,990
 This is the Rescue team, are you in there? 

638
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:17,070
 If there is a person, then make some noise. 

639
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:18,810
 Are you in there?!! 

640
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,250
It seems that there's more damage than I expected.

641
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,880
We will go up first.
-Yea?Okay.

642
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,140
You two go up and do the rescue first.

643
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:46,350
Ki Woong, DMAT team will be here soon, so take them up too.
-Yes.

644
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,990
Keep this in mind... time is of the essence for a buried patient.

645
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:50,520
Yes!!

646
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,900
Hey, Lee Woo Sung.

647
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,090
Yes?

648
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:00,330
What's wrong with your leg?

649
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:03,800
It's okay. I just sprained it a little bit.

650
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,470
Take it easy, take it easy.

651
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:06,920
Yes.

652
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:26,920
There was a landslide due to the aftershock in the western part of Seoul.

653
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:30,210
They say that there's a buried person, so be prepared in advance.

654
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:33,170
Shouldn't we go to scene and see the patient ourselves?

655
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:35,140
It's due to safety.

656
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,660
You take your safety really seriously, don't you?

657
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:41,430
If you go up there, you will see our headquarters tent, you can standby there.

658
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:43,580
Safely.

659
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,070
Work hard.

660
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:47,990
Let me help you.

661
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:50,030
It's okay.

662
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:52,380
Dr. An.

663
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:53,880
- Yes?
- Here.

664
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,380
Dr. An, give one to me.

665
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:03,480
Really? Thank you, Sister.

666
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:06,030
Sister?

667
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:07,970
You're fooling around.

668
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:14,550
It's 3rd and 5th floor, you forgot, right?

669
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:18,850
We can just go carefully poking tree branches in along the way.

670
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:21,700
It's wide anyway so be gentle. We have to spend the night here anyway.

671
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:24,440
-What about the search dogs?
-They're on the way.

672
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,870
- Work hard  
 - I understand.

673
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:27,990
Call me if anything is wrong.

674
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,820
Chief!

675
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:33,840
Where should we leave our equipment?

676
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:37,210
You can just place it inside the tent over there.

677
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:40,050
Professor Han. Ji Na.

678
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:43,700
What should I do about him? I'm sure he's in there.

679
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:48,090
They won't even let me go near the house saying it's dangerous. What do I do?

680
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:51,380
Are you sure he was at home?
- I'm definitely sure.

681
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:55,470
Ji Na, please save your uncle.

682
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:03,290
That person? Why is he here? Why is he going around?

683
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:05,230
Tell him to go away!
-Calm down, President.

684
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:08,950
Don't be like this, Aunt.
You shouldn't be doing this to a doctor who came to save people.

685
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:10,970
Save what life?

686
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:14,820
He... Didn't you see what he did to my Ji Won?

687
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:19,020
Don't even lay a finger on my husband, do you hear me?

688
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:21,360
Not even a finger!

689
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,960
Her fever that dropped is rising again.

690
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,580
Should we try changing the antibiotics?

691
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:37,970
Check the diagnosis charts again, we need to fix her sepsis.

692
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:41,130
If not, we won't even be able to get a chance.

693
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:45,700
Aigoo... If the sepsis is also severe, then it's 100% death. 
 - Yoo Myun Hyun!

694
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:46,840
Yes.

695
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,710
Doctor Yoo, why are you a doctor?

696
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:52,180
So you can say "it's impossible" or "there's no chance"?

697
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:57,400
I was only trying to tell you that we should look at patients with a chance of living since there are so many patients.

698
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,580
I don't know if I made a huge mistake or not,

699
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:05,200
since you want it, I'll find the antibiotics that match her perfectly and give them to you.

700
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,640
Pathetic guy...

701
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:19,360
Have strength. You're still young, you have the power to overcome it.

702
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:22,600
You can't go so unfairly like this.

703
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:25,210
Hmm?

704
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:33,630
He's alive.

705
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:41,390
We've just rescued a victim. He was buried under debris but thankfully, he's breathing since his airways are secure.

706
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:44,020
  The debris might collapse so proceed carefully. 

707
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,830
 I understand. Please send something to move the patient with. 

708
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:51,280
All the other patients seem to be getting released.

709
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,140
Because of you, my mother is staying in a private room.

710
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:58,820
Even if we tell them to be discharged, people won't do it. Because they know there's hardship even if they go out.

711
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:04,020
I don't think what I told you earlier was good news.

712
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:06,340
Our chairman is an incredible person though.

713
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:11,940
Unfortunately, our chairman got swept up in a landslide

714
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:14,390
and I'm not sure how the situation will turn out.

715
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:17,680
Is that true?

716
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,040
It's the missing person, missing person.

717
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,320
Yes.

718
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:26,070
Aigoo, honey.

719
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:29,900
Aigoo, honey, Come to your senses.

720
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:33,720
Honey, honey.

721
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,680
Aigoo, what is this?

722
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,870
Honey!  Honey, come to your senses.

723
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:41,830
Honey.

724
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:45,210
 Aigoo, what kind of day is this? What should I do? 

725
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:47,990
Thankfully, no dirt went inside his mouth.

726
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:50,700
His blood pressure is low, 70/50. Heart rate is 130bpm.

727
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,420
Miss Hyun Sook, please give me the portable ultrasound.

728
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,650
 Yes. 

729
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:57,290
Do you know where you are at?

730
00:54:57,290 --> 00:55:00,870
President, come to your senses.

731
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:06,160
Oh!

732
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,540
His pupils are uneven.

733
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,060
One second.

734
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:22,910
Seeing that his pupils are uneven and the back of the ear is sunken, it's subdural hemorrhage.

735
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:24,870
Move, don't touch my husband.

736
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:28,530
He's in danger. We need to save him somehow.

737
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:32,640
Ji Won died, so despicably! He can't leave like that, too...

738
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:37,070
Prof. Han, please save him.

739
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:39,770
He has bleeding in his abdomen as well. Let's quickly move him to the hospital.

740
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:43,040
If you leave like this, even though you save him, he will either be in a vegetative state or brain dead.

741
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,300
It's priority to get rid of the hematoma and lower the intracranial pressure.

742
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:49,230
What can be done here? What can you do here?

743
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:51,760
What are you doing? We must move him to the hospital quickly, it's urgent.

744
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,820
The roads to the hospital are a mess, so it would take over an hour. We need to remove the hematoma

745
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,320
so he can live.

746
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,060
There is no method. No method.

747
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,520
Do you have a circular saw?

748
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,340
I don't have a circular saw, but I have an electrical drill.

749
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:06,340
Bring those.

750
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:10,720
What are you going to do with that?
No, don't even touch him.

751
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,990
 Ki Woong! Ki Woong! 

752
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:16,430
What are you going to do with those trembling hands of yours?

753
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:21,290
My hands don't tremble anymore. I'm fine now. I got better after taking medication.

754
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:24,290
Don't do it. You'll never be able to hear praises.

755
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:28,150
I didn't come out here to hear praises. I want to save him.

756
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:33,590
I also promised Ji Won that I would save his father who got hurt because of him.

757
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:38,910
You're being excessive because of your guilt due to Yoo Ji Won. That's being selfish.

758
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:42,910
On top of that, you've never made a hole in someone's head before.

759
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:47,770
Yes, I haven't. But if we leave him like this, he will die.  That is 100% definite.

760
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:49,500
I'm sorry, Hyung.

761
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:51,810
Please don't do it.

762
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:56,260
Seeing the uneven pupils, it's definitely a blood clot that's collected.

763
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:59,180
It's probably below the surface where it's dented.

764
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,350
Honey.

765
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:06,520
Prof. Han, move him from my husband.

766
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,290
Aunt...
-Move him.

767
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:13,780
Your husband will die. If I do something, a chance will appear.

768
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:16,800
Let me the best I can until the end.

769
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:20,340
That.. what are you going to do with that?

770
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:25,240
It's called diagnostic craniotomy. We're going to drill into the skull and remove the blood that is causing pressure to the brain.

771
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,580
Don't touch him. I'll sue you.

772
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:32,170
Sue me then. However, I'll save this patient.

773
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:37,440
Prof. Han, there isn't another method? Huh?
Prof. Han, you can do it.

774
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,400
We have no other choice but to move him to the hospital.

775
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:43,070
Then, will he live? Can he be saved?

776
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:46,100
Uh...he'll die on the way there.

777
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:54,320
Jung Dol Mi, disinfect this patient's head. Park Ji Na, disinfectant.

778
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:15,260
So, let me ask you a few questions.

779
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:20,550
Without getting his will personally fixed,

780
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:26,050
would it be effective to say that you are going to get it fixed by a corporate lawyer?

781
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:33,030
It is mostly acknowledged if one is entrusted to carry out the will.

782
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:34,690
Have you been entrusted with it?

783
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:38,350
No, I only received references to it.

784
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:42,350
You only heard references to it...

785
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:46,950
What happens if the lawyer can't remember that one conversation?

786
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:49,430
It would become a conversation that never happened-

787
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:55,170
Director, by any chance...

788
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:11,030
Scissors.

789
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:21,380
Scalpel.

790
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:33,660
This is the last question. The law against leakage of secret information is criminal code 317, right?

791
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:37,120
What are you saying right now?

792
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:41,620
3 years of imprisonment and over 10 years of license suspension.

793
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:45,440
Ah, you are also included in that clause as well, right?

794
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,300
Are you perhaps... me?

795
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:51,020
I told you I'm just asking.

796
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:56,820
I don't remember what Lawyer Seo said already.

797
00:59:56,820 --> 01:00:02,130
I'm just starting to think that you're not going to remember that conversation with the Chairman either.

798
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:14,920
It's done.

799
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:20,770
It's a success, right? You took the blood out properly.

800
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:31,550


801
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:34,510
It seems like it's coming back to normal.

802
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:36,850
Now, let's move him.

803
01:00:56,690 --> 01:01:00,400
 ♫ If the day that I dreamed of comes ♫ 

804
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:06,510
 ♫ If it turns to that day like a miracle ♫ 

805
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:11,270
 ♫ The whole world will shine again ♫ 

806
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:16,290
 ♫ The day that I had desperately hoped for ♫ 

807
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:19,380
  The President's husband is currently on his way to the hospital. 

808
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:22,450
 There are times when not doing anything is the best. 

809
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:24,160
  Just imitate the act of doing the operation. 

810
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,070
 Are you telling me to do a fake surgery? 

811
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:28,320
  Don't act as if you're trying. 

812
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,260
 You're just making a show since she's about to die. 

813
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:32,690
 Dr. An Dae Gil, get a surgery room. 

814
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:34,500
 You said you haven't tried that before. 

815
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:39,020
  Just like the time when you performed surgery for Ji Won... 
 This, really! 

816
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:41,260
  You promised that you would just close him up. But what's the reason? 

817
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:45,440
 I did not abandon my pride as a doctor to sacrifice a life for my ambition. 

818
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,450
  Doctor Lee Hae Sung 

819
01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:53,830
  If he knew about your medical malpractice, how would it turn out?
