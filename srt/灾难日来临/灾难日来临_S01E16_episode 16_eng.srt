1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,160
 Yeonggwang district fire control finished. 
-What do you mean fire control? 

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,780
 Didn't I clearly order you to put saving lives as the first priority? 

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,570
 There was a report that a person is inside and it's impossible to enter without controlling the fire. End. 

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,920
 I'm requesting this for the last time.
-Choice and concentration, okay? 

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,220
 Please put out the fire. 

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,830
 We're just going without putting out the fire? 

7
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:19,520
 Citizens, please just wait a bit. This Goo Jae Hyuk will rebuild everything as new. 

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,260
 Dr. Lee Hae Sung, you know what PTSD is right? 

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,860
 You made a hole in the patient's head, with that shaking hand. 

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,490
  If you keep coming out this way, I will blow the whistle. 

11
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,900
  I caused a medical malpractice and it was lead by the Hospital Director. 

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,890
  You know that I wanted to go back to you. 

13
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,030
 My tastes are right. Don't think about returning to me. 

14
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:46,050
 Like what you said, I'll forget you. I'll try. 

15
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,600
Yes.

16
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,400
Prof. Han?

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,310
Yes.

18
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,570
I'm Mirae Group's corporate lawyer.

19
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,460
Why are you looking for me...?

20
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,350
Regarding the President Yong Woo's incident, Chairman Park Gun has

21
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,840
sued you and Lee Hae Sung.

22
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,880
Sued?

23
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,610
What do you mean by medical malpractice?

24
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,520
 

25
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,250
How is he? Is he going to be okay?

26
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,140
I think he's paralyzed.

27
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,310
Once the equipment becomes restored and we run tests, we will know.

28
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,370
But seeing that he isn't gaining consciousness,

29
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,100
I definitely think that a problem has occurred.

30
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,800
What am I supposed to do? What should I do?

31
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,280
Lee Hae Sung, who fearlessly performed decompressive craniotomy on the scene and Ha Woo Jin, who approved that,

32
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,300
those two both conspired. By changing the operating surgeon, they performed the surgery. I can't... forgive them.

33
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,170
It's not about that, it's just that this person...

34
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,270
Will he come back? Will he be better?

35
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,950
Noona, I performed neurosurgery for 30 years.

36
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,350
I'm sorry to say this, but brother-in-law, restoration is impossible.

37
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:13,090
I think that Ha Woo Jin and Lee Hae Sung made an attempt to become our family's enemy.

38
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,400
I can never forgive them.

39
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,530
Honey, please open your eyes.

40
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,670
You can't be leaving me behind, Honey.

41
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,830
The hospital's lawyer visited me.

42
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,810
Already? That person is really quick.

43
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,700
Suing while the patient is being treated is,

44
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,810
From a common sense point of view, I don't understand this.

45
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,910
And the fact that it's from a Hospital Director to one doctor.

46
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:51,660
Until the documents get processed and a trial occurs, it will take much time.

47
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,020
So, you must hurry.

48
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:59,890
Perhaps... are you certain that the patient won't be restored?

49
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:05,100
How can that be? He's my brother-in-law. I will make sure that he gets up.

50
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,880
You're saying something different from what you said before.

51
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,080
When was the time when you told me to just pretend to find the bleeding area?

52
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,840
Did I say that? I don't remember.

53
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,410
What's your reason for doing this?

54
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,240
In order for you both to not hold a scalpel with any concern,

55
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,900
I thought that this was the best method. If it gets judged a real malpractice,

56
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,230
it's possible to take the scalpel away from Lee Hae Sung forever.

57
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,530
There was never a time where I grabbed the scalpel without any concern.

58
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:37,980
The sense of responsibility that comes with the fact that someone's life is in my hands... I may have held it with an oppressive feeling.

59
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:43,730
It doesn't matter. You just need to know that if you get off my boat, it's an open sea.

60
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:48,790
Do you want me to surrender?

61
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,050
If I told you to do so, will you do it?

62
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:57,700
Dr. Han, a fight should be fought with a similar opponent.

63
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,700
Of the same class and similar skills.

64
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,750
Do you understand?

65
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,420
Oh, thanks. 
-Have some more.

66
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,660
Ah, I see that you can't really eat spicy foods.

67
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,310
Sued?

68
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,730
Yes, that's what I heard.

69
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,440
Tying Dr. Han and Dr. Lee into a package?

70
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,720
The patient isn't even awake yet...

71
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,240
Since I didn't allow the voting to proceed with the quorum issue,

72
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,340
I think that's why he's acting this way.

73
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,180
Does that make sense?

74
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,630
How does he know what will happen to a patient that's being treated that he is suing now?

75
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,670
Let's just say that Doctor Lee was originally his bait.

76
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,650
But why Dr. Han, too?

77
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,040
Exclusion... because he think that he has been influenced by me.

78
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,310
What do you mean by influence? What's so bad about working together to save someone's life?

79
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:55,200
What to do? While you are with me, you will all be filed into a lawsuit.

80
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,150
Jung Ddol Mi, do you have some money at your house?

81
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,700
Yes, it's not like we don't have anything.

82
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,410
An Dae Gil will be okay as his father owns buildings.

83
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,830
Brother, you can still joke at this kind of time?

84
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:10,190
I'm fired from this hospital. And my license will come and go.

85
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:13,820
If you put a mouse on a trap,

86
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,310
the mouse will bite the cat for his dear life.

87
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,830
If he starts pestering Dr. Han, who acted because he wanted to save a life,

88
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,660
I won't stay still.

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,580
Yes.

90
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,100
Why?

91
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:59,170
Chairman will be suing both of us.

92
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,150
Ji Na must have told you.

93
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,830
Aren't you going to do anything?

94
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,900
I would be lying if I said so.

95
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,570
If possible, go to the Hospital Director and apologize.

96
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,580
What?

97
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,420
I'm saying that you don't need to create trouble for yourself.

98
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:25,380
This is a fight between the Hospital Director and I. Since I caused this problem, it's right for me to put an end to it.

99
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,670
I don't think that's right.

100
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,950
Chairman wouldn't want to lose you, Prof. Han.

101
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:35,420
The robot surgery was an achievement by the hospital as a whole.

102
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:40,080
This lawsuit is most likely a warning for you to separate from me.

103
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,300
So, Prof. Han, stay out of it.

104
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,950
Is that what you want?

105
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,020
It's because I'm sorry.

106
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:51,440
The Chairman will take your license away as well.

107
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,860
So, you stay out of it.

108
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,000
I don't want to do that though.

109
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,970
You have to.

110
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,720
I'm a doctor, too, you punk.

111
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,890
If it's a sin for a doctor to save a person's life, that's abnormal and weird.

112
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:12,860
In a disaster situation, we can't provide the best treatment that I have dreamed of.

113
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:18,200
You and I are doctors. That's all.

114
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:27,640


115
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,400
Is the Chairman sick or something?

116
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,540
Just like a total enemy, he's trying to take away your license.

117
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,300
He's trying to get a committee to get your mother forcefully discharged.

118
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,030
Does he not tie you up in a package with Dr. Han?

119
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,940
I don't mind dying, but

120
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,180
if I drag Prof. Han, too, then

121
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:09,320
I really can't forgive him. I must save him, Patient Yoo Won Tak.

122
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:14,910
You must. That way, you and Dr. Han will be safe.

123
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,100
You think I will be safe?

124
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,240
Of course.

125
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,590
The Director will do whatever it takes to destroy me.

126
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,450
That way, he will protect his own pride.

127
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,420
Then what's better to do?

128
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:35,350
It's already a war anyways. I guess I'll have to combat it.

129
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,560
Aren't you going to regret it?

130
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,200
I wasn't wrong, so why?

131
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,480
But, a little.

132
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,090
A little?

133
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:50,920
Sometimes I think, "Why am I doing this?"

134
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,570
I wonder why I'm living so difficultly.

135
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,190
That's why, there are times when I want to just walk away.

136
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,360
It's hard.

137
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,890
After the earthquake, there are so many things that aren't working and the patients are multiplying in numbers.

138
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:14,480
But, I also gain strength.

139
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,000
I am gaining my supporters one by one.

140
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,130
And you.

141
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,720
How am I your strength?

142
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,680
Yes, I know.

143
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,240
Hey, are you okay? Did you get hurt?

144
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:34,580
A person who is lively in the surgery room, is so unsteady outside.

145
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:38,080
It's because I haven't eaten.

146
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,250
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,840
Why are you sorry, Nurse Park?

148
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:58,000
Just... if my uncle was moved to another hospital from the scene, then this wouldn't have happened.

149
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,320
I'm about to go crazy because even providing treatment is hard. It's mountain on top of mountains.

150
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:11,710
The Hospital Director is probably frustrated that things aren't going the way he wants.

151
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:15,000
Hospital, doctors, and the patients as well.

152
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,090
Ddol Mi,

153
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:38,070
get up. It's more than 3 hours.

154
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,700
Has it already been 3 hours?

155
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,380
Hey, don't tell anyone.

156
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,710
Give me some fluids. I'm not feeling well.

157
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,800
Isn't it because you overworked yourself?

158
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,160
Is it a body ache? A cold? Overexertion?

159
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,130
You have a fever.

160
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:08,050
As a doctor, you should take care of yourself.  If not, then who will take care of the patients?

161
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:12,260
It seems like you treat patients by lecturing them.

162
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,150
Be quiet and stay still. I'll bring fluids.

163
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:40,780
 Poodle Hae Sung 

164
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:57,110


165
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:18,300
Aigoo, how can you fall asleep when it hasn't even been 30 seconds?

166
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,120
Are you sleeping for real?

167
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,890
He must be.

168
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:34,770
He's smiling. Are you that happy when you see me?

169
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,580
You saw them?

170
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,260
You really look like a poodle.

171
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,930
You must close your mouth while you sleep or a fly will go in.

172
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,430
It's really hard, right?

173
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:15,110
We are all having a hard time, but it seems like you are having an extra hard time.

174
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,190
Bark, bark.

175
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,070
First, we must ascertain the victims with partially and completely destroyed houses as soon as possible.

176
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:26,170
We need a plan to provide temporary container housing. The weather is getting much colder.

177
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,540
We can't just let people sleep in school gymnasiums and playfields.

178
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,100
More than that, financial issues are most problematic.

179
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,610
Because of a financial paralysis, like this, we might end up with financial bankruptcy.

180
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,300
What do you mean by national bankruptcy?

181
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,390
Because of the earthquake, the Yeouido pipe conduit has a crack.

182
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,200
It has been filled with the Han River water.

183
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,400
 Therefore, there's an all-stop status for all international financial institutions that are in Yeouido. 

184
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,920
Of course, for the business's overseas remittance, but also approval and payment.

185
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,560
Since we can't proceed with anything, to the point of national bankrupt-

186
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,670
How can you tell me those things now?!

187
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,900
What about recovery measures?

188
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,120
The robot did go in and found the cause of the crack.

189
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,940
Hyperbaric welding has to been done personally by a human.

190
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,900
We need to remove the water first, so that the electricity and gas...

191
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,440
and those operators can work.

192
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,620
Then, you can start welding and take out the water.

193
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,590
That... there's a bit of a problem.

194
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:24,100
Why? What is it now?
-We've a problem, Sir.

195
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,770
I know, so what is it?

196
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:29,170
Stuff like cement, rebars, and H beams that were supposed to be coming in from overseas;

197
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:32,830
due to the earthquake, online transactions have been paralyzed. So, we couldn't provide payment.

198
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,860
I think they are going to cancel the contract.

199
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,500
What do you mean by cancel the contract? What kind of nonsense is that?

200
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,830
Is it because of the utility conduits?

201
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,020
We should have banks in the region as well!

202
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:47,960
Since we made a deal with the bank headquarters, that is not possible.

203
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,440
It's Yeonggwang district's fire department jurisdiction, right?

204
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,540
Why are you doing this? Please move aside. I'm sorry.

205
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,110
You guys aren't firefighters!!

206
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:12,150
You are thieves and robbers!

207
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:16,580
He did that and blocked the road last time. Does he have a psychiatric problem?

208
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,520
Why are you doing this?

209
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,200
You blocked the road last time, too. Why- What is your reason for doing this?

210
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,960
My store has become a heap of ashes. A heap of ashes!

211
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:39,480
I'm sorry. We want to extinguish the fire, too, but we have a situation...

212
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,450
Situation? What situation?

213
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,490
When you receive salary from the taxes that I pay,

214
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,530
I requested that you extinguish the fire, but you make excuses.

215
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:53,200
Pension and house mortgage! It's a store that I poured everything into.

216
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:59,260
Only debt remains and I'm broke.

217
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,800
 It's because of you guys. 

218
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,150
That's why.

219
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,980
Hey...
-I'm going to kill all of you!

220
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,120
Hey, hey.... that... it's dangerous.

221
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,640
While helping others, why won't you help me?

222
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,050
Put it down. Put- I said put it down. It's dangerous!

223
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,820
Let go I said.
-I'm going to kill all of you.

224
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,680
I said let go. It's dangerous!

225
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,940
Chief!

226
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,560
Aish, his wrist!

227
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,860
It's bleeding a lot, we must take you to a hospital.

228
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:29,570
It's all finished! It's all finished. What do you want me to do at this age?

229
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:33,110
You should think of eating and living, but holding a knife... This person!

230
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:36,550
Should we hand him over to the police?

231
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:40,230
Aigoo, how can we hand him to the police? Just send him off.

232
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,690
Just go for now, but next time I'll hand you over to police.

233
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,170
You need to go to the hospital quickly.

234
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,220
Hey, Ki Woong.

235
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,530
That. 
- Ah, yes.

236
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,890
Did you get hurt?

237
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,860
Doctor!!
-Yeah, what is it?

238
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,210
Dr. Lee!

239
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,750
Hey, what are you doing?

240
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,430
Why?
-Here.

241
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,970
Chief!

242
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,040
Let me have a look.

243
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,530
How did it happened?

244
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,060
The scar is deep and long because it was cut by a knife.

245
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,650
Knife?

246
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:41,730
Nurse On, I'm requesting an x-ray. 
 - Yes, Doctor.

247
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,300
This way.

248
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,800
Please get a tetanus shot and suture ready.

249
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,330
Lee Hae Sung.

250
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,590
What did you just call me just now?

251
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,230
Dr. Lee Hae Sung.

252
00:17:55,230 --> 00:18:01,550
Ah, you already know. As per hospital protocol, you can't touch any needles.

253
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,350
It must be treated right away.

254
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,040
Outsider, you should just stay quiet.

255
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,650
Outsider? 
 - Yes.

256
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,240
Then who will do the suture?

257
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,100
In the x-ray, the bone is fine.

258
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,660
And luckily, the artery has been avoided.

259
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,470
You also got a tetanus shot, so that's a relief.

260
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:23,550
But, what exactly happened?

261
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,400
Ah, well... somehow it happened.

262
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,620
But why is he doing it and not you?

263
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:37,360
Ah, Dr. Yoo fits in the top 5 in Mirae Hospital for his suturing. Don't worry.

264
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,400
I'm not the 5th.

265
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,470
Chief, this... you need to tell us who did this to you.

266
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,910
You know that we need to leave medical records.

267
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:52,010
Aigoo... I need to go back to the scene, so let's quickly do it.

268
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:55,510
Chief, you can't leave with your arm like this.

269
00:18:55,510 --> 00:19:00,930
If you don't treat it correctly, you can suffer from infection and you can get a big scar.

270
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:04,670
Use this as an excuse to rest.

271
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:07,830
Aigoo, let's do that. Even if I go back to the scene,

272
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:10,600
there are people throwing water at us and cursing anyways

273
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:21,630
Hi.
-Hi!

274
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,920
Hi.

275
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,260
Hi.

276
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:36,070
What is with them? Don't they know who I am?

277
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,840
They are medical staff sent by the government.

278
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,580
I told them several times to greet you when they see you.

279
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,130
It seems like we've become lodgers after offering up our home.

280
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,980
Make sure you keep an eye on them.

281
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,840
Because they are people who may leave without taking responsibility.

282
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,800
These punks don't even know their senior.

283
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,500
Ah, Politician!

284
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,170
Aigoo! In all of Korea,

285
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,510
our busiest politician. What are you doing here?

286
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:01,750
Wow. Everytime I see you, you run the hospital.

287
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,520
Seeing you work hard, it's great to see. I respect you!

288
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,870
But you came to see Chief Kang, right?

289
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:11,800
No, no! You don't need to do that. I came for several reasons. I also have other work.

290
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,640
Other things? 
 - Yes.

291
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,580
Well, I guess since we became a base for disaster, the government frequently...

292
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,960
There's nothing wrong if you come in and out of the hospital.

293
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,800
Frequently? 
 - Yes.

294
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,420
Ah, I... this Director, really.

295
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:32,010
Ah, this hospital... with the bulldozer, just!

296
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,800
Chairman,

297
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:42,400
with a golden badge, coming here frequently with the Minister's car is all work for the government. Okay?!

298
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,300
Of course, let's...

299
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,440
Then, you should be careful of what you say!

300
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,910
Minister, what I'm trying to say...

301
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:56,570
The image of this hospital that I pictured is quite different from others.

302
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:00,920
A hospital more luxurious and comfortable than any hotel,

303
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,640
a paradise for all cancer patients.

304
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,610
But after it has become a base for disaster, that image is nowhere to be found.

305
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,100
It seems that the hospital is being controlled by the government, by the government.

306
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:16,620
I know. That's why, the nation is grateful towards Mirae Hospital and you, Director.

307
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,750
It's not enough to be grateful, Politician.

308
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,940
Then.. what else....

309
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,020
Promise.

310
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,100
Promise? 
-Yes, promise.

311
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,290
I respect and honor those who uphold their promises.

312
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:36,300
More so, if it's a politician who will lead the future of this nation.

313
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:49,580
Are you asking us to go in there?

314
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,450
I know it's a difficult request, but we don't have a solution at this time.

315
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:57,700
Aren't we able to clearly see the true picture of the inside structure of the Yeouido pipe utility conduit?

316
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,820
Electrical, gas and telecom lines are so complicatedly entangled.

317
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,910
It's useless if a person who doesn't know anything goes inside there.

318
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,910
Yeonggwang Fire Department is the answer.

319
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,290
Even if we were to say that we were to do underwater welding there,

320
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:11,380
if we wanted to pull the water out we'd have to drain it from inside the water supply.

321
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,590
That area has to be full of water for the drainage pump to work by pressure.

322
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,090
Yes.

323
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,360
What you're thinking is right.

324
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,150
Someone must operate the drainage pump.

325
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:25,110
If something goes wrong, it can break due to water pressure.

326
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:28,970
Sacrifice can follow.

327
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,360
I can't do that. I won't. No...

328
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,200
Saying to your children that you might even die,

329
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,970
"Go inside and die..." Who would say that to them?

330
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,230
I know it's hard. I'm very aware.

331
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:45,110
No, Minister. No, I can't do that. You are saying that so easily...

332
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:47,700
I- I won't. I won't. 
 - Chief Choi.

333
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,650
The nation is in danger of bankruptcy.

334
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,560
All these businesses can't make a payment overseas.

335
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,690
The claims and lawsuits... we're right before insolvency.

336
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,360
There isn't one place, the National Assembly or broadcast stations, that's operating properly.

337
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,240
Of all places, the most important place, Yeouido's pipe uitility conduit is blocked.

338
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,400
If we don't take care of this problem now,

339
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,600
not just Seoul,

340
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,440
but all of Korea will not be able to sustain life.

341
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,140
Due to a sudden event, I know that you must have been flustered,

342
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:23,480
but you have to make a courageous decision.

343
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,620
This is what you call patriotism.

344
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,190
This is something that not anyone can do.

345
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,880
Give it some thought.

346
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:04,120
Our Sa Eun, may she recover her health.

347
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,430
Although she has a great disability,

348
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,530
without losing courage,

349
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:12,680
help her to a great life in the world.

350
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,800
My husband, the one who leads this family,

351
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,540
so that he won't get hurt from his head to his feet,

352
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,770
please watch over him.

353
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:26,810
I pray this in Jesus Christ's name, Amen.

354
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,740
Honey.

355
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,960
Oh my, did you get hurt?

356
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,620
Did you get hurt a lot? How did you get hurt?

357
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,540
I'm okay. I won't die, so don't worry.

358
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:41,990
I don't know. I told you to be careful.

359
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:45,100
That's why I told you to quit being a firefighter.

360
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,280
If you keep doing this, then I'll misunderstand.

361
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,160
That you really, really love me. I can think that?

362
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,780
This person...

363
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,490
I didn't die. It's okay.

364
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:57,090
If you die?! If you die?

365
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:59,930
If I die, then your fortune will be greater.

366
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:02,240
Aigoo, your words will become seeds. 
 - Ah, alright.

367
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,090
Aigoo, Seriously.

368
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:06,950
It's okay.

369
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:11,940
So Yoon, you've to stay alive.

370
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:16,200
They say it's mountains over mountains.

371
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:20,210
After the surgery is over...

372
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,370
Why?

373
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,860
What is it?

374
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,720
The hospital's fee.

375
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,560
The hospital fee?

376
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,470
The hospital business department came to see me,

377
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,810
that we have to make the interim payment.

378
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,710
But we're here because of the earthquake.

379
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:41,070
That's for her legs.

380
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:44,090
But Takayasu's Arteritis has nothing to do with that.

381
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:47,380
Will the nation pay on behalf of the other disaster patients?

382
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,420
They're being watchful of everyone.

383
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,350
Well, it has to be one or two people..

384
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:56,250
Everyone is worried that they perhaps won't do it.

385
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,660
Well, it has to be one or two people... They say it's 100,000 people.

386
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,110
I heard the hospital is going broke

387
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:08,280
because they didn't receive the funds from the government in a timely fashion.

388
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:12,320
There are some places that went to the point of bankruptcy.

389
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,520
They're afraid that patients won't pay.

390
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,490
It seems that they're pressuring patients every hour.

391
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,190
Just once?

392
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:24,720
We will figure it out, so don't worry.

393
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,170
How?

394
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,950
She's this sick, do you think they will kick us out?

395
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:36,080
Don't worry, so go in.

396
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,540
I'm leaving. Go in.

397
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,150
Go in already.

398
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,690
Eat your food properly.

399
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,480
 What's the matter? 

400
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,230
 Is that a bribe?
-Eh? Bribe? 

401
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,520
 Hah, why are you like this? Seriously. 

402
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,580
 Bribe is given by lower people to higher ups. 

403
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,220
 This kind of thing is called a gift, a "token of gratitude." 

404
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:42,480
 The Minister is giving it to you directly so you can take it. It's okay.  

405
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,700
 Chief, fighting! 

406
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,930
Ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand, hundred thousand, million, ten million.

407
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,300
$10,000!

408
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,910
This...

409
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,300
Ah, that man. Such big money like this, to me...

410
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,930
 Someone must operate the drainage pump. 

411
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:15,900
  If something goes wrong, the pipe conduit can break due to water pressure. 

412
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,600
  Sacrifice might follow. 

413
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,740
Ja Hyuk!

414
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,620
What are you doing?!

415
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:36,810
Oh, you're here?

416
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:39,780
What's going on? You even come to the rooftop?

417
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,530
Is a helicopter coming to pick you up?

418
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:44,930
No. I just wanted to see far away from the rooftop.

419
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:48,670
To think about "how I should change Seoul".

420
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,910
It's miserable, right?

421
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:53,180
We always thought of disasters as other people's problems.

422
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,940
I think we are being punished.

423
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,550
You're right.

424
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:00,170
But, crisis can soon be an opportunity.

425
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,660
Disaster is a national crisis, but

426
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:05,630
to this Goo Ja Hyuk, it can become an opportunity.

427
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,790
Opportunity? What kind of opportunity?

428
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,300
Business?

429
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,530
If not, then politics?

430
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,940
No, it's not simply business or politics.

431
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,970
In 1394, when the capital was moved to Hanyang (later to become Seoul),

432
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:22,820
the opportunity to make Seoul into the world's best city.

433
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,950
Your ambition is quite great.

434
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:30,620
The emergency center will soon have a change to a trauma center.

435
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,240
Really?

436
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,570
I've been thinking about it ever since I proposed a base for disaster.

437
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:38,540
And it has been your dream for a while, too.

438
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,590
Ja Hyuk,

439
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:44,110
do you know how thankful I'm right now, right?
-Oh yea?

440
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:53,130
It's not much, but I'm treating you.

441
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:56,920
Thank you, it's been a while since the earthquake happened.

442
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:09,290


443
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,870
Doctor Yoo.

444
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,150
Working hard to take care of his patients without flaw,

445
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:25,890
isn't Professor Han amazing?

446
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:29,310
Ah, yes. I respect him, too.

447
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:33,900
Since patients are the real owners of Mirae Group.

448
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,220
And even if it was me, I would do the same.

449
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,920
- Doctor Yoo. 
 - Yes, Director?

450
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,730
Just like you gave us critical information last time,

451
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:48,110
could I ask your help in finding that something for Doctor Lee?

452
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,030
Of something?

453
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:53,600
Then, I will give you the Prof. Han's spot or

454
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,320
I may give you something of a bigger spot than that.

455
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,200
Is that true?

456
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,270
You don't perhaps think that a doctor grows just by skill, right?

457
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,920
Aigoo, of course. Even I know that much.

458
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,560
When a man wants to have a social life, the fact that he has to choose a good line,

459
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,070
I know that much.

460
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,820
Do you want to grab my rope?

461
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:16,660
Of course, I want to hold it and I don't want to let it go.

462
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,640
Thank you.

463
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,790
Are you okay?

464
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,040
Ah, thank you.

465
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,470
You have to be careful.

466
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,360
Mom,

467
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,390
that nurse is pretty.

468
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:53,760
I think she's the prettiest in this hospital. Her eyes are nice, too.

469
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,350
Ah, but I really hate when nice people turn bad.

470
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,200
Wake up from your dream, man.

471
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,630
Pretty women have nasty personalities.

472
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,200
How are you here....

473
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:08,720
What happened? Did you get hurt?
-No, no. I'm fine.

474
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,560
Your brother told me to take some rest for a few days, it's best for me.

475
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,460
How is your mom?

476
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,720
Well, the same.

477
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,550
She survived the earthquake well. One day, it would be great to see her open her eyes.

478
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:24,010
If that happens, I have nothing else to wish for.

479
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:26,420
What about your leg? Can you walk?

480
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:30,640
Ah, they said that the inflammation was severe, but soon, I can be discharged.

481
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,130
When you can rest, rest. While paying respect to your mother.

482
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:35,130
And looking at pretty women.

483
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:39,560
But, you... underwater welding.

484
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,660
Yes.

485
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,630
Nevermind.

486
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,470
Do I have to go underwater welding?

487
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:47,330
No, no.

488
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,830
Rest.

489
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,620
Rest.

490
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:55,690
Crazy person, crazy, crazy...

491
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,920
How can I ask him to...

492
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,900
Doctor, why are you running like this?

493
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,550
A patient has emerged, so I have to go out with the DMAT team.

494
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,460
Emerged, not found?

495
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,540
Just like the Electric Corp employee last time?

496
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,230
Is it serious?

497
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,090
That.. I don't know yet...

498
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:15,910
- Let's go.  
 - Okay.

499
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,400
There was a large fire in the center of Yongkak street.

500
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,560
They said that they extinguished the fire, so you just have to go inside.

501
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,840
And also, call the rescue team to the scene.

502
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,420
Ah, Chief Choi already left.

503
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,830
Let's go quickly.

504
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,810
Nurse Kim, you filled the emergency bags, right?

505
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,690
I'll take care of it, you guys go ahead.

506
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:35,050
They said there are buried patients, so Dr. An Dae Gil, pack the portable ultrasound.

507
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:36,580
Yes!
-Oh.

508
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,340
I got them, let's go.

509
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,390
No, Sunbae, you aren't on our team, so why?

510
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:42,670
Ah, this is consideration for you. How can I send you alone?

511
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:45,000
There are only two patients, so Dr. Yoo, you don't need to go.

512
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,460
Ah, Chief. Besides Dr. Han, they are all outsiders.

513
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,870
Ah, I would be worried. I can't leave it to them.

514
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,570
Mirae Hospital also has a reputation.

515
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:55,720
I'm here, too. Isn't an intern a human, too?

516
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,260
Yes, an intern isn't human.

517
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,080
What did you just say?

518
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,640
We don't have time to be doing this.

519
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,900
Go run, Intern An Dae Gil.

520
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,090
Intern has to go in that car.

521
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:10,170
Ok, you're so dead.

522
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,330
I'm sorry but please look after my patient.

523
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:15,480
Because it's a situation where we can't leave that room unattended.

524
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,230
Ok.

525
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,000
You're like this becaue of the lawsuit, right?

526
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,970
Yes, but

527
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:25,490
because there are people who don't want his revival.

528
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,440
What are you talking about?

529
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,390
It's nothing. Since my patient is special, please do take care of him properly.

530
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:36,650
I will try to request for a helicopter and hospital that can perform neurosurgery for Yoo Young Tak.

531
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:38,680
That's the best we can do.

532
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,360
You must be careful too, Prof. Han.

533
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,040
DMAT can take away both of your doctor's license.

534
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,110
Don't do any secret procedure from the Director

535
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,550
I got you, I'll be back.

536
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:19,140
Wow, I am someone who is unaffected even when I took a rocky boat at the coastal waters of Haeundae.

537
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,660
But whenever I ride this ambulance, I get nauseous.

538
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,530
When will the roads get better?

539
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:27,180
Because a normal 10 minute ride takes an hour.

540
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,330
It takes too long for a patient to get to the hospital.

541
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,750
That's why...

542
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:34,110
We go out with DMAT to treat them on the scene.

543
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,840
But if Dr. Lee Hae Sung tries to perform surgery even though everyone stops him...

544
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,530
The Hospital Director will jump up and down. He'll go crazy. That can't be.

545
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:48,320
What is there that you can do, An Dae Gil?

546
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:51,070
What? Did I say something wrong?

547
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,800
Am I wrong?

548
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,060
I'm sorry.

549
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,170
Yes,

550
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:01,560
In Seoul or anywhere in the vicinity,

551
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,750
I"m requesting for a hospital that can offer CT scans and neurosurgery.

552
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,010
And a helicopter.

553
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:07,840
 After figuring out the situation, 

554
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,190
 we will call back to this hospital. The end. 

555
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,980
Yes, I request you this.

556
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,570
You must.

557
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:46,200
 Did you come here because you're worried about the patient? 

558
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,630
Yes, of course.

559
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,660
He must get up soon.

560
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,650
My sister's status is like hell.

561
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:03,320
Since you sued Prof. Han and Dr. Lee,

562
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,070
if perhaps the patient recovers,

563
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,820
I wondered if you would be uncomfortable.

564
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,020
Hey, what...

565
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,580
How can you say such a scary thing, Chief Kang?

566
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,890
I'm a doctor, too, Doctor.

567
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:17,080
What kind of doctor wouldn't want a patient to recover? On top of that, he's my relative.

568
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,520
I am quite offended.

569
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,870
I'm sorry.

570
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,290
Over there.

571
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:35,010
What about the ultrasound? 
 - Huh?

572
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:37,910
Hey, Dae Gil, you need to take this. This, too!

573
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:45,400
It's dangerous!
-Hide!!

574
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:53,530
Take cover! Take cover!

575
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,140
It's dangerous!

576
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,960
Are you okay?

577
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,370
If you are hurt, tell me because the doctors are here.

578
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,900
Okay Line 1!

579
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,730
You and Chang Woo go

580
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:06,880
and take care of the electrical unit!

581
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,010
Patient, do you know where you're at?

582
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:10,520
Patient, come to your senses.

583
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,230
Patient!

584
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,660
It's all ended.

585
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,170
What is this?

586
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:39,270
Hey, I think something just fell.

587
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:40,580
Was it a human?

588
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,960
Let's go look.

589
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,630
It's dangerous everyone, stay hidden.

590
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:48,650
Ayi... come in the car.

591
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:50,750
What are you doing, Dr. Yoo?
-What?

592
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,810
Everyone is debriefing; are you going to keep hiding?

593
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:55,790
Yes.. I wasn't hiding.. I was looking for...

594
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:57,520
You go ahead, Soo Yoo.

595
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,320
I'll be there soon!

596
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,940
Dr. Yoo and Dr. Go, go examine the patients together. And check if they can be transported to the hospital.

597
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,820
Yes, don't worry. You must follow me.

598
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,400
Where.. where is the patient?

599
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,340
The patient... You can follow him.

600
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,500
Ah. Let's go.

601
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,540
It's this way.

602
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,440
Nurse Kim, this way.

603
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,750
Also, there was a person who committed suicide. He fell into the middle area of the buiding.

604
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,560
We are rescuing him.

605
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,910
But it's a dangerous place.

606
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,160
Suicide?
-Yes.

607
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,240
 Chief. 
-Wait a minute.

608
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,880
Yes, how's the situation?

609
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,360
  He does have consciousness. 

610
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,970
 His leg has an open fracture and the bleeding is coming out like a fountain. 

611
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:34,810
Like a fountain?

612
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,230
Then, isn't his artery ripped?

613
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:38,110
Give me the walkie-talkie.

614
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,620
This is DMAT team's Lee Hae Sung, I'll go over there

615
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,850
To stop the patient from bleeding, tie his legs.

616
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,840
How's the patient's vitals?

617
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,480
Blood pressure 70/40. Heart rate 130.

618
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,150
He is still conscious but it's quickly fading.

619
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,590
His pupils are okay.

620
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:03,690
The leg does have an open fracture.

621
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:07,110
One leg is okay.

622
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:09,080
Give me a walkie-talkie.

623
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,730
The patient's condition is not good.

624
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:22,450
Due to an open fracture, it seems like his tibial artery has ripped.

625
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:25,250
The hemorrhage is severe that if we don't transport him now,

626
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,420
his life is in danger.

627
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,580
Ask the hospital. We will be moving him now.

628
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:34,360
We are controlling the fire. And we are also rescuing people.

629
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,820
1, 2 
 1, 2

630
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:41,610
Please prepare the ultrasound. Chief, the stretcher. 
 - Yes, yes.

631
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,620
1, 2, 3.

632
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,430
This person...

633
00:41:56,430 --> 00:42:01,260
Why? you know him?
-This is the person who cut Chief's hand.
-Eh?

634
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:06,910
When the fallen building caught fire, we didn't extinguish the fire when he asked. The headquarters asked us to focus on rescuing people.

635
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:13,350
Still, how can he jump off like that.

636
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:19,500
How is the wound?

637
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,990
It's not good. 
 - Dr. Lee, the ultrasound.

638
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:25,550
Ah, give it to me. 
 - Gauze.

639
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:29,440
Nurse Park, there's no time. Give me the screen for the ultrasound

640
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:38,190
Fortunately, it seems like there is no internal bleeding.

641
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:41,980
Oh, the blood pressure keeps dropping. 60/40. The heart rate is over 140.

642
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:45,030
You are giving him full drip, right?

643
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:50,340
Patient, get a hold of yourself. Patient!

644
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:54,650
Captain... Die... lived...

645
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,460
This is excessive bleeding. He can get a hemorrhagic shock like this.

646
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:05,250
Were you able to recruit a hospital? We need to move him immediately. 
 - In Yoo Dae Hospital closed and Citizen Hospital also closed.

647
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:10,190
Mirae Hospital has a surgery room, but no one to perform it.

648
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:13,860
Yes? Me?

649
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,740
I can't.

650
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:19,810
But why can't you do it? Why would Mirae Hospital representative doctor say that he can't perform surgery?

651
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:24,410
- Anyway, it'll be hard for me. 
 - Professor Han, why are you like this?

652
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:28,020
Then, you can do the surgery Dr. Lee.

653
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,960
That...I can't either.

654
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,060
What are we gonna do if both of you can't do it?

655
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:37,620
Professor Han, you have to do it. Is there something between you and the hospital?

656
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:41,630
Anyway, it'll be really hard.

657
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:47,510
It's cardiac arrest! 
-  Defibrillator, hurry!

658
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:50,880
Epinephrine.

659
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:54,010
Charge to 200 joules!

660
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,740
Move. 
1,2,3.

661
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:07,970
- It returned! 
 - Ambu.

662
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:15,140
We can't go to a hospital like this. His bleeding is too severe that he'll die on the way. Let's move him to that animal hospital.

663
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:19,030
- What? 
 The animal hospital is also a hospital, they should be able to do something. Hurry and move him.

664
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:21,110
Lee Hae Sung, what are you planning to do over there?

665
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:25,320
He'll die on the way there! We should do whatever we can!

666
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:29,330
 Let's move him .
- Guys, let's move him.

667
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:32,900
Patient rescue... we succeeded. I did it!

668
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:35,250
I... Quickly transport him to the hospital!

669
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:39,030
Ki Woong, go to Mirae Hospital. They have room there.

670
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:41,180
They have a surgery room, but there's no surgeons.

671
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:45,410
This patient doesn't need any surgery, but where is that patient going?

672
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:47,880
Animal hospital. 
 - Animal Hosp-

673
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,040
Why is a person going to an animal hospital?

674
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:53,990
Well- he said that he's performing surgery.

675
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:59,380
His breathing has returned.

676
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:02,210
There should be animal anesthesia meds, go find them.

677
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:07,060
I will also try to find surgical equipment. 
 - Ah, it's all over there.

678
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,260
Doctor, I found the anesthesia.

679
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:33,280
Wait! Wait!

680
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,890
What are you doing right now? You're not planning to do surgery right here, are you Professor Han?

681
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:41,140
Oh.. 
-No! Stop everything!

682
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,290
What are you doing? Hurry and move him to a hospital!

683
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:47,020
This is a patient who even had a cardiac arrest. With excessive bleeding, he will die on the way there.

684
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:51,040
Since you can't do surgery at the hospital, so you're going to do the surgery here?

685
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:55,440
Since you still have a license, can you act like this outside? Aren't you really crazy over surgery?!

686
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,670
Those words come out of your mouth even after looking at this patient? 
 - With excessive bleeding, a person's life goes in and out.

687
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:06,050
What can this hospital do?
 Professor Han, are you just going to watch?

688
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:11,980
I agree that he'll die on the way.  Although this place doesn't have everything, I believe that this is the best for this patient.

689
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:16,460
Prof. Han, did you forget why you were assigned as DMAT's leader?

690
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:22,830
You were appointed to stop Dr. Lee Hae Sung. You are caught in a lawsuit, what are you trying to do?

691
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:26,220
I'm tired of lawsuits. 
 - But?

692
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:29,720
I hate seeing a patient die in front of me more.

693
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:35,380
Won't you regret it?
- Before saying those, think of this patient as your family member.

694
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:41,840
Why would I care about this patient's family? I'm busy trying to feed and keep my family alive.

695
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:45,060
If not, stay out.
-Yes, I'll stay out.

696
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:51,090
Ok, thank you so much Dr. Yoo.
-Just wait and watch.

697
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,260
Not me.

698
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,970
Why? You're not going to do the surgery?

699
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:07,560
I can't do it. I have a situation.

700
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:11,310
Professor Han, why are you like this?

701
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:15,180
You were like this last time, too. Why do you keep on saying that you can't do it?

702
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:21,070
I have an illness.

703
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:29,990
Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.

704
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,780
I knew it was gonna come some time.

705
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:43,850
But I didn't know it would come this suddenly.

706
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:53,130
I can't see properly, that's why I've been avoiding surgery.
 That's the reason why I let him do the surgery last time.

707
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:59,160
What to do... I didn't even know...

708
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:07,190
The patient is in danger. If the hospital finds out about my eyes, the Hospital Director will use that in the lawsuit.

709
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:11,720
Then, I don't know what will happen to both Hae Sung and me.

710
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:14,370
Why are you only saying that now?

711
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:17,310
I didn't know this day would come this quickly... Now,

712
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:21,300
Lee Hae Sung and Jung Ddol Mi, you definitely have to save the patient.

713
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,890
Nurse Park, scalpel.

714
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:42,960
I found it.

715
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,480
Clamp.

716
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:58,480
The blood pressure is rising. The rhythm is also okay. 
 - Give me the seal for the blood vessel.

717
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,580
I came after sending Ji Won.

718
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:10,580
You have to open your eyes. What am I supposed to do by myself?

719
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:15,480
He will open his eyes.  He will for sure.

720
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:19,310
Exactly, why can't you do surgery on his head?

721
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:24,000
Because of the earthquake, all the equipment for the surgery has been destroyed.

722
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,560
To be fixed, an engineer has arrive. But right now...

723
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:32,460
Um, so...

724
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:35,990
We're looking for a way to transfer him. 
 - Chief Kang, I request of you.

725
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:40,650
If something happens to him, no one knows what will happen to this hospital.

726
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:43,830
Yes, the President must recover.

727
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:46,570
That way, many people can live.

728
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:50,320
  Yeonggwang headquarters, Mirae Hospital, come out. 

729
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:55,900
  Mirae Hospital, we have recruited a helicopter and hospital for the patient. 

730
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,250
 Mirae Hospital, come out. 

731
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:03,660
-  Mirae Hospital?   
 - Yes, this is Mirae Hospital. Please speak.

732
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:10,170
  We have recruited a helicopter and hospital for the patient. I want to know if you are able to transport the patient. 

733
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:13,800
  Mirae Hospital-- 

734
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:23,160
With whose permission....

735
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:38,580


736
00:50:57,990 --> 00:50:59,680
- Jung Ddol Mi. 
 - Yes.

737
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:03,770
- Did something happen? 
 - Uh, what? Did I make a mistake?

738
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:06,970
Suturing the blood vessel is hard, but you are doing well.

739
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:12,610
Really? I'm hearing a compliment after a long time.

740
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:20,340
- You're making fun of me again. 
 - No, you're really doing well, Doctor Jung Ddol Mi.

741
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:23,660
Oh, thank you.

742
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:27,730
- End! This patient is saved, right? 
 - Yeah.

743
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:33,170
As long as we control the infection, we should be okay since we have to do another surgery anyways.

744
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:37,380
Let's suture him up temporarily and send him. Me, from the top. You, from the bottom.

745
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:38,600
Yep.

746
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:52,350
He came straight from the scene?

747
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:53,890
Yes.

748
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:05,390
What is it?

749
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:07,050
This is a patient that had a cardiac arrest.

750
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:09,390
So are you going into surgery right now?

751
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:11,850
The general surgery is complete. The orthopedic surgeon just needs to do it.

752
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:16,260
The general surgery was completed? Where? Who performed it?

753
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,050
It's an open fracture.

754
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:25,350
If it's a general surgery, surgery of the artery?

755
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,300
Yes.

756
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,260
Lee Hae Sung again?

757
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:35,560
No, I did it.

758
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:39,430
Professor Han? Really?

759
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:42,510
Yes, I did it.

760
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:46,760
This surgery is impossible.

761
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,260
Send him to another hospital.

762
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:49,930
This is too much, seriously.

763
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:55,010
The patient's current situation with a surgery will cause a larger infection and blood poisoning.

764
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:57,640
If he does die, who will take responsibility for what happens afterwards?

765
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:01,350
Director, isn't it important that we saved him?

766
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:05,930
Responsibility for later problems, responsibility for later problems. Please stop weighing a patient's life.

767
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:09,220
I heard that comment many times before.

768
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:12,930
Doesn't Lee Hae Sung hold the copyright to that?

769
00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:16,140
Fine.

770
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:20,260
Then like Doctor Lee Hae Sung, Doctor Han Woo Jin, too,

771
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:22,640
will you put your doctor's license on the line?

772
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,720
Chairman.

773
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:28,800
Well, if that's the case, I can give it some thought.

774
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,720
I'll do that. I'll renounce my medical license.

775
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,470
Professor Han.

776
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,180
It seems like you have confidence.

777
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,430
Please move aside.

778
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:43,640
Even if I move aside, the orthopedics department won't accept this patient.

779
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,300
Will they try to treat what someone else started?

780
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:51,350
So, take him back and go to another hospital. 
 - Room 8. The orthopedic surgeons said that they'll do it.

781
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:54,760
What is this, Nurse An? Did you explain it properly?

782
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:58,350
Yes, I did explain it properly regarding the patient's condition. They said they would do it.

783
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:02,680
In the scene, they hastily performed the surgery. Did you properly explain it to them, Nurse An?

784
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,430
Yes.

785
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:09,010
And I'm Nurse Yong, not Nurse An.

786
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:12,720
Please move aside, Chairman.

787
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:23,970
Altogether, they are trying to insult me.

788
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:27,140
I'm the director.

789
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,260
Soo Wong.

790
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:41,260
You're here?

791
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:42,930
What are you doing here?

792
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:44,760
What?

793
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,300
Here?

794
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,800
Where is this?

795
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:55,470
I was on my way somewhere.

796
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:59,470
Do you have any worries?

797
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:02,050
Worries? What worries?

798
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:07,470
Just... wondering if the person, who jumped off the building because we didn't extinguish the fire okay?

799
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,960
Soo Yoon keeps coming in front of my eyes.

800
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:15,100
What about you?

801
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,930
If you're hurt, you need to tell us right away.

802
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:22,430
Because of you, you know how hard everyone else has to work?

803
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:23,720
I'm sorry.

804
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:28,890
Ah! I was going to ask about the surgery of that patient.

805
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:30,390
I'm going.

806
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:43,100


807
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,350
How's the patient?

808
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:49,640
That... How's the patient?

809
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,010
Are you family?

810
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:53,430
No, we saved him.

811
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:56,970
You don't have to worry. The patient survived.

812
00:55:57,930 --> 00:56:00,310
That's a big relief.

813
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:02,720
But, what about any disabilities?

814
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,640
They said that we won't have to worry about that either. According to the words of the general surgeon that performed with us.

815
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:10,470
Aigoo. Aigoo. Thank you. Aigoo, thank you. Thank you.

816
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:14,640
You shouldn't thank me, you should thank Professor Han Woo Jin.

817
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,390
Excuse me?

818
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:19,970
Doctor Dong Hyeon, where is Professor Han Woo Jin?

819
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:24,180
- Professor Han! Professor Han! 
 - Yes, Supervisor.

820
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:31,050
Did your patient really have a surgery at an animal hospital?

821
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:34,510
Yes.

822
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:39,800
Since the orthopedics called us, I told him that we shouldn't do it because it's obvious without even looking.

823
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:44,430
But wow, seeing what you did, there was nothing for me to do.

824
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:52,010
I was blown away. How did you perform blood vessel sealing so well in an animal hospital that had no electricity?

825
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,640
Somehow it ended up that way, thank you for your compliment.

826
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:59,970
No, but are you in a war with the Hospital Director?

827
00:56:59,970 --> 00:57:00,890
Why would you say...

828
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:05,850
I heard the Hospital Director made a lawsuit concerning the Chairwoman's husband, including you.

829
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:10,890
At a time like this, this is like playing a gamble with your doctor's license.

830
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:15,460
Don't you know me? I won't move a step if I don't have confidence.

831
00:57:16,050 --> 00:57:19,510
Why did you tell the Chairman that you did the surgery?

832
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:23,430
- What are you going to do if something happens to you? 
 - Then what about you?

833
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:29,300
He's trying to suspend your license. Will you be okay?

834
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:32,520
Anyhow, I won't be able to hold the scalpel.

835
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,930
But you, you can't.

836
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:38,100
Hyung.

837
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:46,010
If it wasn't for that kind of Hospital Director, you would have flown far away with wings.

838
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:51,010
You need to survive until the end. You can't lose to the Hospital Director.

839
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:53,010
If something goes wrong,

840
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:56,510
you will be blamed for everything. Then what about you?

841
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:59,100
You're going to give up being a doctor because of your eyes?

842
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:02,140
There must be a way.

843
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:05,100
There is a possibility.

844
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:09,010
Because you're the best doctor I know.

845
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,220
I wanted to be a doctor.

846
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:13,760
What are you talking about?

847
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,760
I thought that we were just going on different paths.

848
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:22,510
With the perfect treatment, treating many patients.

849
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:25,000
That's the path of a real doctor.

850
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:30,300
But I abandoned it. My conscience, too. The patients, too.

851
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:34,720
Choosing those who I really need to save.

852
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:38,790
I threw away patients that wouldn't raise my surgery's success.

853
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:44,800
As a doctor, I ran towards the goal but it was a pile of trash.

854
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:49,390
At that moment, I arrived and realized it was too late.

855
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:53,250
I don't want to do it anyhow. It's disgusting.

856
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:57,090
There's no perfect place in this world.

857
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:00,390
Because we're not God.

858
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:11,430
Have you told the crew?

859
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,220
I think I gave you plenty of time.

860
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:23,140
Ah.. It isn't easy to say you go and die to people who are like my younger brothers and family members.

861
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:27,350
Then, this nation... is it okay for it to become bankrupt?

862
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:31,190
If it's difficult for you to tell the guardians, should I do it myself?

863
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:34,470
When you expressed complaint and dissatisfaction, you were immediate.

864
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:38,140
Even though I told you many times that this will save the nation, you don't even move.

865
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:42,720
Being a firefighter is a job you have to do to get paid?

866
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:46,050
Minister... 
 - Did you abandon your mission?

867
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:48,760
Yish!

868
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:52,470
Does this make sense to you?!

869
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:58,550
I don't have a mission. You have a mission, so you give this and make someone feel like dog poop?

870
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:02,350
Yes, we don't have nationalistic pride. We didn't eat, sleep, or wash and only have the sin of saving people.

871
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:05,800
We only ate what was given and not extinguish fires as told by you.

872
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:10,140
To those who have families and children, do I go tell them to die?!

873
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:13,510
Would that come out so easily from your mouth?

874
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:17,640
What do you want me to do?

875
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:20,760
In a highway like maze,

876
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:24,970
should I send someone who doesn't know what he is doing and make him suffer instead?

877
01:00:24,970 --> 01:00:29,850


878
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:39,600
 ♫When the day we dreamed of come, and like a miracle that day comes ♫ 

879
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:44,530
 ♫ the entire world will shine too ♫ 

880
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:48,430
 ♫ the day we looked for safety ♫ 

881
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:52,510
  Prof. Han has problems with his eyes. 

882
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:53,930
 Why not someone else? Why me? 

883
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:56,180
  I can become your eyes. 

884
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:59,580
 You will be in my memory, always.  

885
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:00,390
 Dad! 

886
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:05,100
 My daughter is working so hard, how can I just play around. 

887
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:09,760
 Father, how did this happen?
-Coming all the way to Seoul and getting hurt like this,  it's my fault. 

888
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,800
 I'll be doing this surgery. 

889
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:12,640
 Excuse me? 

890
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,810
 What are you doing here? Aren't you going to do surgery on my father? 

891
01:01:15,810 --> 01:01:18,470
 I can't do the surgery on your father. 

892
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:21,890
 The nation will never forget your sacrifice! 

893
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:24,100
 Why are you going into the Yeoido pipeline? 

894
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:26,970
 In these situations, the captain is the one that goes. 

895
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:29,050
 They said if anything goes wrong, then you can die. 

896
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:32,720
  I can't go to a firefighter's funeral. I will never go!
