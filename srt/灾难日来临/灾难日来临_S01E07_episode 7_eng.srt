1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:05,010
  It's an earthquake... In Seoul.  

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,710
  No! 

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,260
  You're alive, right? 

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,680
  You have to be alive.  

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,330
  They are in here! People are... 

6
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:18,730
  The building is collapsing! Watch out!
- Do you think we bring patients here for you to clean up the corpses? 

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,260
  Do something, do something. 
 -There is nothing we can do. 

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,820
  Move him to another hospital. 

9
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,110
  Platelets. Share them. 

10
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,350
  This is the moment to decide. It's the moment where we have to decide between the two. 

11
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,920
  To give it to the patient in the ICU without even a hesitation,  

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,560
 is it because that person is a VIP? 

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,910
  I heard you're going to the blood bank right now.  

14
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,350
  The outside is much more dangerous than what you're thinking. 

15
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,580
  Doctor Lee... 

16
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,690
  What are we to do if you just leave us here like this and go, Doctor Lee?! 

17
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,510
 No... 

18
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,690
  I'll get you out... 

19
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,730
Die!

20
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,000
 Episode 7 

21
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,370
Why do you have this?

22
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,010
Where did you get this?!

23
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,780
He's stable now.

24
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,150
It would've been dangerous if we weren't able to do the platelet transfusion.

25
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,670
Even so, there are only 8 packs left so we need to transfer the patient as quickly as possible.

26
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,290
Yes, we should do that.

27
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,250
Lee Hae Sung went to get blood?

28
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,080
Yes. But it will be hard.

29
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,160
It will be fine if he doesn't return.

30
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,070
What? What do you mean...?

31
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:09,470
I'm saying it isn't bad to shut down the hospital.

32
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:13,140
Not that I want something to happen to Lee Hae Sung.

33
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,660
Should I try waking him up slowly?

34
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:20,570
No, let him sleep more. Only complications will happen if he wakes up and starts talking nonsense.

35
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:24,930
There are only three people in this hospital who knows about the minister.

36
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,130
You have to take care of him very well.

37
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,870
Yes.

38
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:33,750
Don't forget that you have the responsibility to save this man.

39
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,690
This isn't good. His condition isn't getting better even with the blood transfusions.

40
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,610
I should've stolen the platelet earlier no matter what.

41
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,950
Ah, go make a fuss over there. My head hurts.

42
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,760
What? Make a fuss?

43
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,850
Hey, you intern.

44
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,740
If you went to school with me,

45
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,040
you would've only been able to say three words to me.

46
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,630
"What kind of bread should I buy?" "I bought the bread." "Here's the change. Don't hit me."

47
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,230
I heard if it's Jung Ddol Mi from Nampodong, Busan, rumors spread all the way to Daejung.

48
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:27,170
I guess you didn't hear them yet? I'll think of it as you not knowing anything and

49
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,600
I'll give you one more chance. 
- Don't give me that look.

50
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,830
I'm in the middle of a blood transfusion.
 - Hey.

51
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,250
How dare you carelessly hold your senior's hand?

52
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,570
Go over there and do whatever you want Nampodong imperialist senior.

53
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:43,460
That's right. You should bow down to your senior and be respectful.

54
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:48,180
You. Get it together.

55
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,290
Hey, are you sure she's a Pastor doctor?

56
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:59,330
She's as small as a cherry tomato. She thinks she's some kind of thug.

57
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,930
Doctor An, are you really feeling bad?

58
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:06,500
Then would I not feel bad? It hasn't even been long since we've met and she's already holding me by the collar.

59
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,850
Why would the doctor from Busan act like that?

60
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:11,870
Huh?

61
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,610
Because you seem easy?

62
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,470
I don't know.

63
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,490
It's because she wants to get close. It's her way of affection.

64
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,150
If we get close one more time... Aigoo.

65
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:28,470
It's an unknown place. It would still be uncomfortable to get close to the nurses.

66
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,290
That's why she sent an SOS to you.

67
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:36,730
"It's hard, right? It's hard for me, too. Let's get close."

68
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,990
I heard you signed a treatment guarantee, and you're even giving him a blood transfusion.

69
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,950
Doctor An, you're an okay man.

70
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,210
You heard, right?

71
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,730
What are you doing, Busan doctor?

72
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,780
Aigoo, please drop the honorifics. It isn't our first time and

73
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,550
I'm your junior who took the test way after you.

74
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,810
Still.

75
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:39,060
Doctor An is more soft-hearted than he looks. Please take care of him.

76
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:44,890
That's true, but the Orthopedics department has a lot of manly men.

77
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:49,090
I've gotten a bit rough since I've rolled around there.

78
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,770
Although I'm a bit different than how I look.

79
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,350
He's very late.

80
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,210
Doctor Lee?

81
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:04,930
I saw on the way here. Seoul

82
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:08,170
is as if it's been completely hit by a bomb.

83
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:12,290
I know, right. I hope nothing will happen.

84
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:18,320
What about resting when Doctor Lee is not here? You have to regain your health so you can take care of the patients.

85
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:24,480
I should, but he told me I have to save that patient before he left.

86
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,990
Lee Hae Sung is reckless, isn't he?

87
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,150
Yes. He's a really weird person.

88
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,790
I've never seen someone like him...

89
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:40,960
It's hard to believe that he went outside to save a patient who has no blood connection with him.

90
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,310
Isn't he a bit on the mental side?

91
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,370
I-It's this, right?

92
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,770
What happened? 
 -Hae Sung! Lee Hae Sung!

93
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,420
 Untie this for now. 

94
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,700
Yes.

95
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,270
Doctor, get the stretcher.

96
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,990
I got it.

97
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,480
What happened to him?

98
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,970
Doctor...Doctor Lee.

99
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,070
Pull yourself together.

100
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,510
Pull yourself together, Lee Hae Sung!

101
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,900
Doctor, wait..

102
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,970
Doctor...

103
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,670
Doctor, wait a minute.

104
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,920
Hurry up with the stretcher!

105
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,160
Stethoscope and auscultation. 
 - I'll go get it.

106
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,900
Portable.

107
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:48,800
Hyun Sook, give Jung Min Chul 8 packs of platelet from the  blood box and give the rest to the blood bank.

108
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,670
Okay, I understand. Give it to me.

109
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,740
Doctor Jang, here you go.

110
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,340
We need a portable x-ray.
 - Yes, coming.

111
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,280
Please call Director Kang and Professor Han, too. Quickly.

112
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,280
  I got it! 

113
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:10,560
E-Excuse me, Doctor. By any chance, do you know Bon Na Ri?

114
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,990
Na Ri? Yes. Who are you?

115
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:21,050
I'm her father. By any chance, my daughter isn't gravely injured, right?

116
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:24,030
Yes, you're her dad. Na Ri is fine, don't worry.

117
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:27,150
Aigoo, thank you. Thank you.

118
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,830
Aigoo, Na Ri...

119
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,920
What? Doctor Lee?

120
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,560
Yes, he's in the emergency room now. Go look.

121
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,260
I'll stay in the ICU, Team Leader.

122
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,560
Okay, I'll leave you to it.

123
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,420
He came injured?

124
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,160
Yes. Team Leader Kang Joo Ran just went down.

125
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,040
What about the blood? Did he get it?

126
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,740
Yes. He brought various types packed fully in a box.

127
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,460
That bastard...

128
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,450
Doctor Yoo, don't leave your position and protect the patient. 
 -Yes, Professor.

129
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:06,100
I'm going crazy. Does it make sense that he brought the blood at a time like this?

130
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,430
You know, the heavens help whoever it-

131
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,410
Ah, stop already.

132
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,640
How is it? What is it?

133
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:26,110
His vitals are fine. I took an x-ray and his bones aren't broken or anything. It's just a bit ripped.

134
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,690
His pupils are fine, but the CT is broken so we skipped that.

135
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,020
You did well.

136
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,980
He doesn't have a fracture.

137
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,920
His muscles and skin are a bit torn. He has hemorrhage, too.

138
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,410
But it's not deep.
 - Then why is he unconscious? Did you put him to sleep?

139
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,910
It's not that...but it seems like he fainted.

140
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,880
His wound isn't deep. Let's give him a tetanus shot first.

141
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,240
Tetanus?

142
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,190
His injury won't kill him, but he's in extreme risk for tetanus.

143
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,250
We have to tear off the part we can't see.

144
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,560
Who ordered it?

145
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,740
Wouldn't it be already too late if I prepared it after I received the order?

146
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,120
Everyone go back to what you were all doing. I'll do the suture.

147
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,650
You will?

148
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,040
Why? Am I not allowed to do it?

149
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,030
The hospital director is looking for Doctor Han and Doctor Kang.

150
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,890
-Us? 
 -Us?

151
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,040
I don't think it's anything serious. Just contact me if there is a problem.

152
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,820
Yes.

153
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,040
Let's go, Doctor Han.

154
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,260
Can you do it?

155
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,480
Even if I lived my entire life looking at bones, I can do a suture.

156
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,720
Even if I look like this, I'm still a doctor.

157
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:56,170
Oh, Na Ri! My Na Ri.

158
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:01,270
Are you not seriously injured?

159
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:05,290
 Only my leg... But it doesn't hurt.  

160
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:11,400
I didn't even think of here. I was busy searching

161
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,940
for you in every subway.

162
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:23,230
Aigoo... But why did that doctor have it? That cross necklace.

163
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:27,260
 The oppa who saved me in the subway 

164
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,250
  got hurt a lot because of me. 

165
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:36,090
  When the doctor left to get the blood to save that oppa, 

166
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:39,140
  I gave it to him so it could protect him. 

167
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:50,450
Ah, is that so? Then did I make my Na Ri's life savior like that?

168
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,330
 W-why? Did something go wrong? 

169
00:13:53,330 --> 00:14:01,040
Oh, it's nothing. It's nothing. What should I do about this...what should I do?

170
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:10,060
Anyway, it's a relief you're fine. Oh, Na Ri. Aigoo, my child.

171
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:15,640
The big number of patients and now Doctor Lee Hae Sung. Isn't this too much?

172
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,400
This is different than the plan you said.

173
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,440
I'm sorry. I thought it would be better to take care of urgent patient matters.

174
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,240
When the power goes out, they're the ones we need to get rid of.

175
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,410
The government is going to supply us. If we just endure until then-

176
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:37,010
What about enduring? What are we going to do after the government supplies us?

177
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:42,500
Director. 
 -Team Leader Kang and Doctor Han,

178
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,520
do you know what's important for the long-term?

179
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,820
Isn't it about looking a few steps ahead?

180
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:57,310
That's important, too; but it's deciding what to tell the public and what to hide.

181
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:06,240
What good will it do us if people find out that we have blood supply?

182
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,590
You know how the medical community is like in our country, Chief Kang.

183
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:14,800
It's obvious that they'll ask us for our medical records.

184
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,800
Who will pay for hospital bills when the records were destroyed? We're going to shut the hospital down.

185
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:25,170
Then Doctor Kang's dreams, Doctor Han's dreams, and my dreams will all collapse.

186
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:29,890
It's better to throw out something that doesn't help us.

187
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:38,360
People only believe what they can see.  Chief Kang,

188
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,340
just keep this in mind; we just need to endure until the power goes out.

189
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:49,690
Chief, we're doctors. Shouldn't we not be like this?

190
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,070
If the hospital closes its doors, then where will the patients go?

191
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,650
The hospital has to live, too.

192
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:59,460
I'm doing this so I can protect our coworkers' jobs and the future of this hospital.

193
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,390
We need to shut down the hospital.

194
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:07,400
Minister Seok is the most important thing to us. Minister Seok.

195
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:16,540


196
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:35,630
 He's handsome and wow, his jawline looks like a piece of art. 

197
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:40,140
  Oh my, I'm crazy. What are you thinking about, Jung Ddolmi? 

198
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:59,360
Wow, he's more fit than I thought.

199
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:12,430
He has some 6-packs, too...

200
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,610
What are you doing? Hey!

201
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:26,600
You're not going to give me a suture? If you just leave after touching me like that, it's sexual harassment.

202
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,770
I'm doing the anesthesia.

203
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:22,430
Hey, why are you trembling? Aren't you going to stitch it properly?

204
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,000
Hey, it's crooked.

205
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,760
Stitch it prettily, prett-

206
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,260
Ah, seriously.

207
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:47,710
♫  Do you know? I don't know since when, ♫

208
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:54,890
♫  but your smile relaxes me  ♫

209
00:18:54,890 --> 00:19:02,310
♫  Even if rain pours down and turns in to heartbreaking tears of rain  ♫

210
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:08,670
Hey!
♫  Even if the whole world changes  ♫

211
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,940
Hey, where are you going? I'm crying right now.

212
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:14,450
What do you it's crying? 
 - Hey, look. It's crying.

213
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,890
Hey, is it that hard for you to stitch it in a straight line?

214
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,030
Oh, I don't know. I don't know. It's something I don't know about.

215
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:24,030
♫   I'm scared  ♫

216
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,850
♫   Even when I try to stop these feelings  ♫

217
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:30,750
♫  Even when I try to hide these feelings again  ♫

218
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,330
Did he leave? 
 ♫   You come by my side  ♫

219
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:39,680
♫  and stay with me. Thank you  ♫

220
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:45,420
♫  Even if my world hurts me as if breaking down  ♫

221
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,220
♫  you always save me  ♫

222
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:53,950
  Take responsibility. Take responsibility! 

223
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:59,890
♫  Even if the past makes us suffer again  ♫

224
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:05,110
♫  You're someone who always be by my side  ♫

225
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:09,410
♫  I only have you  ♫

226
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,010
I'm out of my mind.

227
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,460
Why did I hurry up and just stitch him up?

228
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,710
What the heck is this situation?

229
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:24,930
Ah, I'm so embarrassed. How am I going to live now?

230
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,400
His platelet count is getting better.

231
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,620
His vitals are improving, too.

232
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,990
Even when I gave him heat transfusions, his vitals kept dropping low. But thanks to you-

233
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:49,150
I didn't do anything. It was just his luck to live.

234
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:52,010
As soon as his condition gets better, let's do the second surgery.

235
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,440
Yes. Ah,

236
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,010
I heard you almost got in big trouble.

237
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:59,330
Yea. It was very spectacular and cool.

238
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:03,700
That ride was very real.

239
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,680
My jumps were a bit lacking.

240
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,510
Maybe the speed wasn't enough.

241
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,580
Doctor An, you know, right? Speed.

242
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,130
Oh, yes. I know speed.

243
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,720
I guess you also gave blood.

244
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:22,940
My blood type is an O, and matched when we cross-checked. Doctor Jung Ddol Mi also gave blood.

245
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,400
Is that so?

246
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,780
Is that why her hand trembled?

247
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,890
Who...? 
 -No, it's nothing.

248
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,110
We're all done, right? I'm leaving.

249
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:36,680
Ah, there's someone waiting for you outside. He says he has to meet you.

250
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,080
Who?

251
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,970
I heard you looked for me.

252
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,380
Ah, yes. Doctor.

253
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,170
I... I... I committed a huge sin.

254
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,730
I really didn't know anything

255
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:00,790
and I kind of lost my mind in searching for my daughter in case something happened to her.

256
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:05,060
You're my Na Ri's life savior's... life savior.

257
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:08,970
I almost killed you, Doctor.

258
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:13,380
Um...I'll pay for my crimes. Hand me over to the police.

259
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,440
What did you do to me?

260
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:24,070
Doctor, do you not remember?

261
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:28,990
That...when you were behind...I hit you with a bat from behind-

262
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,810
Ah, ah!

263
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:36,190
Thanks to you, I had a deep sleep without being mindful of others.

264
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,440
What?

265
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,540
You brought me here safely and took care of the blood from my wound very well.

266
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,590
Thanks to you, I slept very well.

267
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,340
Thank you.

268
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,520
Ah, that. Doctor, um-

269
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,680
This isn't it.

270
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,220
  Mom! 

271
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,830
  Mom! 

272
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,770
  Dong Ha! 

273
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,230
  Mom! 

274
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,240
  Dong Ha! 

275
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,210
  Mom! 

276
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:29,260
  Mom!
 -Dong Ha! 

277
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,760
  Mom! 

278
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,890
  Mom! 

279
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,270
  Dong Ha! 

280
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,880
I'm sorry.

281
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,580
Dong Ha, mom is sorry.

282
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,290
Mom is sorry. Mom is sorry...

283
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,890
Wait, you can't block us. We have something to do here.

284
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:56,330
Again? Do know know what situation we're in right now?

285
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,090
  Seriously, what are you doing?! 

286
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:00,220
 I'm talking right now, this person really... 

287
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:03,580
Stop, stop! Stop! Everyone, stop.

288
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:10,230
I'm Choi Il Sub, the captain of Yeonggwang rescue team. Please cooperate with us.

289
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,730
How are you asking a favor when you just barged in like this?

290
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:14,320
This is a hospital.

291
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,230
I know.

292
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:20,610
But the firefighters aren't in good circumstances, and there was an order for Mirae Hospital to be a place for us all to stay.

293
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,680
I thought you were informed about that.

294
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,810
This is the first time I'm hearing this.

295
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,590
Since you might not have heard, can you confirm it?

296
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,100
Did you hear about this?

297
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,900
No, I heard this for the first time.

298
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,600
You heard, right?

299
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,480
The hospital is not in a position to have a place for the firefighters to stay.

300
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,200
Please get out right now.

301
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:45,310
We follow the guidelines, so-

302
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,770
  Hello, Director! 

303
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,020
Congressman Goo Ja Hyuk, what brings you here?

304
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:55,210
It's a relief you're fine. 
 -Ah, yes.

305
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:58,310
Aigoo, because of the disaster...

306
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,190
I should have came earlier and told you.

307
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:06,890
It took a long time since I walked.

308
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,830
Aigoo, our firefighter.

309
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:11,730
You working hard. How hard has it been...?

310
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:14,440
You all are working hard. You all are tired, aren't you? You all are working really hard.

311
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,270
I'm Goo Ja Hyuk.

312
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,250
Making this a place for the firefighters, I made that order.

313
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,680
Orders?

314
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,260
Why would you?

315
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,710
Ah...I guess you don't know yet.

316
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,880
I became a minister. Minister for Special Affairs.

317
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,890
A person in charge for the disaster management.

318
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:38,600
So please open Mirae Hospital as a base for the firefighters.

319
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,300
But still, isn't it one-sided decision?

320
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,260
It is one-sided. The earthquake occurred unilaterally, too.

321
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,950
It's the nation's state of disaster emergency. Help out the firefighter, please.

322
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:50,410
I can't. The hospital is not in a good state right now.

323
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,150
Help the firefighters.

324
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:07,300
That's how the problem of Minister Seok of Health and Welfare Ministry can be solved.

325
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:12,890
How did you know?

326
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,730
Is it Team Leader Kang?

327
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:18,050
I haven't been able to contact Team Leader Kang after the earthquake.

328
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,470
Isn't what I'm going to do

329
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:25,310
more important than how I know?

330
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:29,600
I ask you this favor.

331
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,710
Huh?

332
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,400
Ja Hyuk!

333
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,630
Joo Ran. Joo Ran.

334
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,610
Chief Kang!

335
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,890
What do you mean approve for this place to be a base for the firefighters?

336
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,620
As a general manager, this situation,

337
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,570
what do you think about that?

338
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,100
An gas tanker is coming.

339
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,600
At the construction site in Suwon Branch, I ordered them to come with their heavy equipment.

340
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,600
Gas tanker?

341
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,490
Yes, but we can only get it if you agree to having the hospital as a base for the firefighters.

342
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:07,150
There's more amount than the hospital's tanks need.

343
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:10,060
Director, there are other support departments from the government that are coming.

344
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,470
Accept using the hospital as a base and receive help from the government.

345
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,800
That's nonsense.

346
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,290
We're holding up when we should be shutting down the hospital.

347
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,020
I can't!

348
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,150
The electricity and water are the lifelines for the patients.

349
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,390
We can't make a deal with the patients' lives on the line.

350
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,210
Isn't that right, Team Leader Kang?

351
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,400
They're really going to come, right?

352
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,670
They have to come. Can you promise?

353
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:35,870
Has there ever been a time where I didn't keep a promise with you?

354
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:39,790
What are you two doing right now?

355
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:42,680
I'm the director of disaster measures.

356
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,960
You promised to give me control of the hospital.

357
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,020
Team Leader Kang, were you planning to do this from the beginning?

358
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,790
The rescue team doesn't have much to work with.

359
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:53,320
They're going to leave soon after they talk to the fire department HQ.

360
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,590
Chief Kang, you're very optimistic.

361
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,320
Look over there!

362
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,050
The fire department team didn't get proper support from the government, so

363
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:02,060
they're trying to stay here.

364
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,950
Government support? Trusting that itself is a gamble!

365
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:07,660
I still want to believe it! 
 -Believe what?!

366
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,560
Is this the first time the government lied to us?

367
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,420
What are you believing in? 
 -We have to believe it. What else can we do, Director?

368
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,860
Do you really think the government would take this case to the worst scenario?

369
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,840
Because of that decision, the worst situation could arise.

370
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,490
Now, now, now, now, don't fight and calm down.

371
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,900
Director, just a minute.

372
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,460
Just a minute.

373
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:42,810
If you can't believe my promises as a member of Congress or as a minister,

374
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:46,800
I will give you a definite answer on something else, not only the government support.

375
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:52,180
The patient that you really want to save

376
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,060
without getting hurt,

377
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,840
I'll move him to another hospital.

378
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:04,730
Director Park Gun,

379
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:09,450
this isn't something you as a Hospital Director should be hesitating about.

380
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,600
  For me, getting the disaster settled is most important.
 - I understand. Please help us. 

381
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,960
 Please. 

382
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,840
Oh, Reporter Baek! You were alive.

383
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,360
How did you know to come?

384
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,920
You're the hottest news. Of course, I came.

385
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,160
No, no, no. Today, it's Director Park Gun.

386
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,190
Our amazing Director.

387
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:38,490
You're being excessive. 
 -Hey, do an interview. A long one, okay?

388
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:39,800
Do it now, do it now.

389
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,910
Director, you're doing a good cause.

390
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:45,220
Everyone gather here.

391
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,040
Everyone, let's all work hard and fight out this disaster!

392
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,600
Fighting, everyone. Fighting!

393
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:59,690


394
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,070
It's a relief you're safe. I worried a lot about you.

395
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,990
Are you okay?

396
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:14,860
Gas tanker... I did well, right?

397
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,540
Was I like a prince charming?

398
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,750
Ja Hyuk, what do I do?

399
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,330
Why are you like that? Is something the matter?

400
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,120
I lost Dong Ha.

401
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,720
What?

402
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,220
How? Where?

403
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,660
At the supermarket's parking lot when the earthquake happened.

404
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,250
  Mom! Mom! 

405
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:46,750
  Dong Ha, hold on tight! Dong Ha! 

406
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:55,660
The cars are all tangled and the fire is coming up from here and there.

407
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,450
Everything is shaking...

408
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,060
I couldn't find him even if  I wanted to.

409
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,960
Then...then how can you be like this here? You have to go out and find him. Survey the situation-

410
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,440
If I wanted to, I would have ran out hundreds of times.

411
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:12,010
But if I go out, where and how can I find him?

412
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:15,320
Do I just wander around aimlessly in circles?

413
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:22,150
If I leave, Director is going to shut the hospital down.

414
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,970
All the patients are dying,

415
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,580
so how can I go?

416
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,970
Joo Ran.

417
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,740
I feel like I'm really going to go crazy.

418
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:42,030
Am I a mother?

419
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:44,220
Am I a doctor?

420
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:50,560
I have been protecting this hospital by pushing my worries about my son to one side,

421
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,640
but we don't even have a transfer plan, and more and more patients keep coming.

422
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,860
I really want to run away from here.

423
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:09,220
Dong Ha will be fine.

424
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,870
Ja Hyuk, please find our Dong Ha.

425
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,870
You have to find him.

426
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:19,370
I will find him. I promise.

427
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,800
Excuse me, where is the bathroom?

428
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,530
You just have to go out and it's on your right.

429
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:41,620
 Thank you, thank you. 

430
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,850
 Yes, thank you. 

431
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:56,010
I think we have to wash up. Where can we go to wash up?

432
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:58,300
The hospital cut off the water supply, so we use the water from the water tank.

433
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,440
There's a water supply restriction in the afternoon for one hour.

434
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,780
It's also not enough amount for washing.

435
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:06,410
For now, use these.

436
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,070
Thank you.

437
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,310
That's probably not going to be enough.

438
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:15,910
Oh...the smell. It's foul.

439
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,570
Oh, hey! Hey!

440
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:39,460
Oh, no! You got hurt, didn't you?

441
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,570
Are you okay? Huh?

442
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:45,930
What should I do?
- Why? Are the stitches coming undone?

443
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,830
Should I stitch it again?

444
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,090
Hey!

445
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:52,120
It seems fine.

446
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,840
Let me just see-
- Hey!

447
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,970
Hey! What are you doing right now?

448
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,460
Now you're just revealing it in the open.

449
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,450
Doctor!

450
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,550
Why? You're going to poke at it again?

451
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:06,740
You made my chest cry. What are you going to do about it?

452
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,640
Where is the iron?

453
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,370
I'll press down on it firmly and straighten it out.

454
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:14,240
I thought you were a pastor, but you even do leather crafting, eh?

455
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,910
You're doing all sorts of things.

456
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,320
What?

457
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:28,120
It's true that I can't suture well

458
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,550
and I'm really sorry.

459
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:35,090
I was worried...

460
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:38,780
In case it really did burst...I...was really worried.

461
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,070
Are you pissed?

462
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:44,040
It's fine.

463
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,420
Hey. I just said it so you could laugh since you seemed tired.

464
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,060
It's fine. I don't hold grudges.

465
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,750
By the way, you should go out. The firefighters came and are looking for a place to stay.

466
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:57,000
Firefighters are looking for somewhere to stay?

467
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,840
Oh, hey, hey!

468
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,160
 

469
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,010
   Be careful of the ropes! Ropes!
 - Okay! 

470
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:23,930
  Do it correctly.  

471
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:26,080
  Don't do that. 

472
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,990
Woo Sung! When you're taping, use this.
 - Okay.

473
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:31,250
Tape it 45 degrees below the eye level.
- Okay.

474
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:53,550
Assistant Oh, what are those? I'll just have two of these.

475
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,580
Yes.

476
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,330
Woo Sung.

477
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,260
Here.

478
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:22,450
It's not enough, but I got it when the water was running. Use it when you wash.

479
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,740
What about mom?

480
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,630
She's fine. Room 502.

481
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,580
Go and greet her.

482
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:37,760
After hearing about the Hangang Mirae Hospital collapsing, 
do you know how worried I...

483
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:41,450
Be safe.

484
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:43,410
You can't ever get hurt.

485
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,360
Mom will open her eyes, so until then-

486
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,770
Don't act as my older brother

487
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,630
just because you brought me this.

488
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,850
Keep up the hard work.

489
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:19,490
How much does it hurt?  You're suffering a lot.

490
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:21,930
I'm just thankful I'm alive.

491
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,990
Your mind is very optimistic.

492
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:26,080
What is the government doing?

493
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,470
We've been starving all day.

494
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:31,720
All they give to the patients are a few spoonfuls of leftover noodles.

495
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,490
Are they joking?

496
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,860
I'm sorry.

497
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:41,500
Since I've heard fresh voices from the site, I will return and do my best.

498
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,200
Minister, next schedule...
 - Oh, yes.

499
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,320
Hopefully, the government is like him.

500
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:52,000
 They're not the same as him. They're probably just sitting at their desks changing the number of deaths. 

501
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,150
Please be fine.

502
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:06,890
You should knock before coming in.

503
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:10,500
Having the hospital as a base, don't you know how dangerous that is?

504
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,820
Leave. Just say it until there.

505
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:17,620
I've heard all of what you're going to say from the hospital director already.

506
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,170
Both of you are alike.

507
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:21,510
Team Leader Kang.

508
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:24,730
You aren't the only who is worried about that, I'm worried, too.

509
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,710
It's a decision made at the end of that worry.

510
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,830
Respect it.

511
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:35,450
Your optimistic views can put the hospital in danger more.

512
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:36,880
I will hold you responsible for this.

513
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:40,680
Hold me responsible. When that time comes.

514
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:16,570
Do you know how scared I was after hearing that the Hangang Mirae hospital collapsed?

515
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:22,870
Hyung says you will definitely wake up.

516
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:30,810
He said you'll wake up soon so he told me not to get hurt.

517
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:35,140
I won't get hurt so

518
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:40,580
you have to wake up. Hm?

519
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,110
Aigoo.
 - Thank you for your effort.

520
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:52,400
Aigoo, Busan lady. We meet again.

521
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,140
Oh? Ajusshi, you are quite charming when you are like this.

522
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,940
If you just grow some hair, then you'll be perfect.

523
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,760
Forget that. What brings you here?

524
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,380
Ah, the blue light came on over there.

525
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:08,760
Ah, thank you, thank you. Hey, she said it's charged. Take good care of it.

526
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,840
Yes.

527
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,930
Do you perhaps have some more?

528
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,320
What if we do, what are you going to do with it?

529
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,350
Wouldn't it be beneficial if the hospital and the fire department are able to keep in touch?

530
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:21,020
The hospital can know right away when if they send a helicopter because of the power supply.

531
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,850
Oh, that's right. You're smart. Hyung Suk!

532
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:26,750
If there is an extra radio at the pumping station, give it to her.

533
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:30,690
I will also give you a pair of walk-talkies, so use these at the hospital, too. Use these for short-distances.

534
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:33,640
Wow, thank you! I'll use this.

535
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:38,880
This lady. You don't say complete nonsense. I bet adults really like you.

536
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:44,510
Right? As expected, you recognize at first glance. Tall and dumb kids don't really know.

537
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,910
Tall kids are dumb.

538
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:49,730
Right?
- Yeah, they come to me after they go bald.

539
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:52,020
Here you go. 
 -Thank you.

540
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,010
Work hard. Work hard.

541
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:56,800
Work hard.

542
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,570
Um...

543
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:39,120
The floor is slippery.

544
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,960
Hey, the curtain fell. What do we do?

545
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,870
We can just put it up again.

546
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:47,790
Hey, follow me.

547
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:49,850
Am I a patient?

548
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,900
Quickly follow me.

549
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:21,600
I don't to see it. Seriously.

550
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,090
Hey! Come here. 
- Yes.

551
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:32,500
When I was getting the suture done, I slept really well.

552
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,290
Oh my!

553
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:39,330
Exactly 3 hours. Sleep 3 hours and work like crazy for 30 hours.

554
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:45,710
What? 
 -I'm giving you 3 hours to sleep. Sleep here and

555
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:51,030
if you're hungry,

556
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,540
eat one of these and go to sleep.

557
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,250
Oh.

558
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:59,610
  Eat these. 
 -All of them are for me? 

559
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:02,910
  Yes. I don't really like sweet things. 

560
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:10,140
  Don't be shy.  

561
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:16,980
  It's okay if you just tell me honestly. I understand. Just tell me you want to give me everything. 

562
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:21,820
This...is the same as what Intern An Dae Gil gave me last time.

563
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,110
By any chance, did you give it to Intern An Dae Gil?

564
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:27,700
Yeah.

565
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:34,500
Then...what you gave to An Dae Gil at first came to me and

566
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:41,490
I didn't even know that so I asked you to eat with me...and you just ate it silently.

567
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:44,140
Sleep well.

568
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:48,250
By the way... even if you come to the surgery department, I think you'll do well.

569
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:49,600
What?

570
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:55,250
Are you deaf? Even if you came to the surgery department, I think you can do well.

571
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:18,360
It's sweet.

572
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:31,500
Why am I going through this trouble in Seoul?

573
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,670
I can't even eat

574
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:42,670
and I can't even sleep. I can't even wash up properly.

575
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:49,680
I think my body is starting to stink.

576
00:45:54,920 --> 00:46:02,330
Mom...Dad...I'm doing well.

577
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:05,940
Don't worry.

578
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:26,540
Oh, his mother was pretty. His younger brother is quite handsome, too.

579
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:31,140
I feel like I've seen him somewhere.

580
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:38,350
Even back then, he was tall. What did he eat by himself that he grew that tall...

581
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:19,000
Doctor Lee Hae Sung's hand resembles yours.

582
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:31,720
Don't worry. Doctor Lee is doing well. He's passionate and he only looks at the patients.

583
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:42,650


584
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,380
  Father... 

585
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:21,310
  Father! 

586
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:31,050
  Father! 

587
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:35,520
  Please! Please! 

588
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:42,730
  Save me. Please...I'm here, I'm here. 
 -I'll save you quickly. 

589
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,820
But...

590
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:31,170
we opened the subway door and got out, but it's dark everywhere.

591
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:35,620
These people didn't know where and which way to go, they were crying and it was so crazy.

592
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:37,500
But who am I?

593
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:41,370
I've been calling the subway at Yeonggwang my home ever since it was being built.

594
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:46,510
I came all the way on my first time, and I know all the routes even with my eyes closed. That's right!

595
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:48,890
Oh, yeah?

596
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:51,560
You must have brought them all here.

597
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:55,160
I did.  And all the people that got hurt in the subway,

598
00:49:55,160 --> 00:50:00,560
Picking up a grandmother who dropped her dentures on the route.

599
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:04,870
Because the subway at Yeonggwang was a transfer station, if it weren't for me, those people

600
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:07,120
may have gone to the grim reaper.

601
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:11,990
You're a savior.
 - On the radio, they said there is a TV broadcast.

602
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:15,020
Someone turn on the hospital television.

603
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:18,090
Can you find the remote controller?

604
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:33,230
 

605
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,800
If you're tired, you should sleep.

606
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,800
I'm fine. I heard the gas tanker is coming.

607
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,910
Yes. Soon.

608
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:10,040
Wow, is it thanks to the fiancée who has power and money?

609
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:13,710
Seeing that you have the energy to say nonsense, it seems you don't need to rest.

610
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:16,200
Thank you.

611
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:20,560
Still, you can't just go to the blood center recklessly and come back injured.

612
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,270
We already don't have an abundance of doctors.

613
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:25,520
And even less of skillful doctors.

614
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,990
Seriously, this guy...

615
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:30,100
Come out. The news is coming on.

616
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,760
News?

617
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,310
 65% of the Hangang Bridge has been partially and completely destroyed 

618
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:40,440
 that it is impossible to use, and the safety for the rest of the bridge has not been checked. 

619
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:45,200
 The root of international affairs building collapsed, and the municipal office in Seoul is on fire. 

620
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,200
 It is as if we are watching a scene of the Korean War. 

621
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:54,990
  I can't believe that this is the Seoul we're living in right now. 

622
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:59,840
  Even in these circumstances, rescue teams are still putting their efforts to restore Seoul. 

623
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:05,790
 In the case of Yeonggwang district, the region with the most damage, the hospital and fire department are working together. 

624
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:06,980
 Reporter Bang Myung Gyun 

625
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:09,610
  You will hear the interview with Hospital Director Park Gun 

626
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:13,170
 who agreed to let Yeonggwang district firefighters stay at the hospital. 

627
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:17,750
Director.

628
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:20,940
Oh!

629
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:23,990
Turn up the volume.

630
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:29,550
 However, we don't know when the power and water supply of Mirae Hospital will be cut off. 

631
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:34,390
 I'm worried that there might be a depletion of resources in the hospital, and 

632
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:40,530
that we might have to shut down the hospital, and that we might lose patients.

633
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:45,560
I said, "As a doctor, my heart is torn with sorrow."

634
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:48,320
 My heart is torn with sorrow. 

635
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,700
How is it? The editing is done well, right?

636
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,280
Ah, yes. It was done well.

637
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,480
There's an impact.

638
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:02,360
I think the tear drop at the end was the highlight.

639
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,710
 Excuse me.  Excuse me. 

640
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:07,970
  Doctor, please save my mother. 
 - Yes?! 

641
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:44,260


642
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,200
  Painkillers! 

643
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:01,480
By any chance, do you know where Doctor Lee Hae Sung is?

644
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:05,480
No. I just came back from sleeping so I don't know.

645
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,680
Where could he be? He wasn't even in the emergency ro-

646
00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:17,740
Ah...by any chance, if you see him, can you tell him that I'm looking for him.

647
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:19,610
Yes.

648
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:22,730
Speaking of the devil, there he is.

649
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:26,680
You should've woken me up if you came by while I was sleeping. Why did you just leave after giving me your white coat?

650
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:30,360
Thanks to you, I slept well.

651
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,140
Thanks for taking care of my mom.

652
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:34,560
It's a given, so why are you thanking me?

653
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,500
I should go check on patients.

654
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,590
Yes, you should.

655
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:38,980
I think his condition is fine to do the second surgery.

656
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:41,740
Let's do the surgery as soon as the sun comes up tomorrow.

657
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:44,250
The patient's condition is fine,

658
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:46,520
but I don't think your condition is okay.

659
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:51,540
I told you to sleep 3 hours so why did you come out already? You really don't listen.

660
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:54,180
Look who's talking.

661
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:56,900
You obviously caught a cold. Sneezing everywhere like that.

662
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:59,790
It's because you took off your white coat.

663
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:06,090
Why would you concern yourself over that?

664
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:08,310
It's fine. Just go and rest.

665
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:10,800
Even when hydraulic shovels get crushed and the oil leaks,

666
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:14,950
they go to a repair store. What are you, a machine? So foolish.

667
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:16,470
You are really concerned.

668
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:18,610
I'm not worrying-
 - I said I'm okay.

669
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:20,670
I'm saying I'm not fine. I'm not.

670
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:24,310
It doesn't matter that you're not fine because I'm fine.

671
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:25,570
No, it's fine.

672
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:29,810
You're also going to sleep for 3 hours and work hard for 30.

673
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:32,070
That's the way to save more patients.

674
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:33,870
I got it.

675
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:37,000
Instead, if something happens, call me right away. Don't bother Professor Han.

676
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,560
I'll take care of my own work so you should just sleep.

677
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:43,440
But wait- 
 - Shh.

678
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:49,660
If your chest starts bleeding, I'll ask Professor Han Woo Jin.

679
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:51,100
I'll ask him to stitch it up again.

680
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,720
Hey, wait.

681
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,690
Once again, I'm sorry.

682
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:59,880
Hey, my chest is fine. Ah, seriously.

683
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,570
Hey, before-

684
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:16,840
Do I smell?

685
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,500
I didn't wash that's why..

686
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,840
No, it's not that.

687
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,920
The smell of pheromones.

688
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,000
What?

689
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,980
This is the brother's pheromones smell.

690
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,850
I smell?

691
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:38,380
Yes. You smell like Brother.

692
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:47,290
  No! No! 

693
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:49,930
  The building is collapsing! 

694
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:31,040
When you leave... What?

695
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,640
When we go out tomorrow? Why? Is something wrong?

696
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:37,950
Just now, the Gwanan rescue team came to share equipment.

697
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:39,740
Oh, is there something useful there?

698
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:42,480
More than that...

699
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,690
What?

700
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:46,800
There was. 
 -What?

701
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:50,190
A boy wearing a green T-shirt in the Yeonggwang supermarket.

702
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:52,770
Ah, Song Dong Ha!

703
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:09,040
  8 people were sent... 

704
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:20,010
It's a picture of someone who died?

705
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:21,440
Yes.

706
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,730
The kid is too young that there was no way to find out if it's your child.

707
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:30,220
We were at the parking lot of the Yeonggwang mart.

708
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:31,910
Are you certain?

709
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:35,080
They say he was found under a car in the parking lot of Yeonggwang mart.

710
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:39,290
Green T-shirt and around the age of 7.

711
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:44,710
It's not going to be.

712
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:47,900
There's no way.

713
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:50,200
It's not going to be our Dong Ha.

714
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:56,080
You have to see if it's your child. That's the only way we can move the corpse.

715
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:22,720
♫  Thank you. Even though this world is full of pain like it's going to collapse  ♫

716
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:29,060
♫  You are the only one who will always save me  ♫

717
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:31,930
♫   Thank you  ♫

718
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:35,830
  Please think of it as a patient transfer plan and a corpse disposal. 

719
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:37,570
  I think the gas tanker is going to be a little late. 

720
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:40,410
 How long can the hospital sustain? 

721
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:41,380
 Half a day. 

722
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:43,240
 I think patient Jung Min Chul has a hemorrhage. 

723
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:46,030
  You're going to do surgery at a time like this? 

724
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:52,560
 It's an earthquake again, isn't it?  I'm asking if the the hospital's power is going to be cut off!

725
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,020
  Doctor! Blood! 

726
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,660
 How are you going to do this reckless surgery in this situation? 

727
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:58,370
 The medical community will look down on you. 

728
01:02:58,370 --> 01:03:02,300
  Not doing anything with the patient in front of us, 

729
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:05,520
 to me, that's a humiliation, Hyung!
