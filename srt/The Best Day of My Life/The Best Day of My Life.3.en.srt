[Episode 3]

3
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,460
Why are there two Director Jiang?

4
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,300
Which one shall I hug?

5
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,420
This one.

6
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,340
Next.

7
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,420
Come on. Your turn.

8
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,100
Well done.

9
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,740
Come on, Xu.

10
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:23,980
Turn it.

11
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,380
How much did Xu Mu drink?

12
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,260
A glass of beer.

13
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,700
Oh, Director Jiang.

14
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,740
Right place,

15
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,380
right time.

16
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,540
Try something exciting.

17
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,860
Truth or Dare,

18
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,900
pick one.

19
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,740
Truth.

20
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,500
Wow.

21
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,300
You do it.

22
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,380
Ask a good question.

23
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,540
We've never known any gossip

24
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,420
about Director Jiang.

25
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,300
Do you have a crush on someone?

26
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,020
Do you?

27
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:55,620
No idea.

28
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:00,620
Yes.

29
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,580
Who? Who is that?

30
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,100
That's another question.

31
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,260
It's wise of you, Director Jiang.

32
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,020
I answered two questions just now.

33
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,340
You were being honest.

34
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,740
You know what?

35
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,260
When you share a flat,

36
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,100
you have to get a good roommate.

37
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,900
Every day when I'm home,

38
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,020
I think I was back somewhere

39
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:41,780
like a card-room

40
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:42,780
or karaoke bar.

41
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,740
Anyway, it's just not a home.

42
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,940
You're miserable.

43
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,100
Luckily, my roommates are kind.

44
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,340
You're indeed lucky.

45
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,700
That terrible place...

46
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,420
I don't even want to go back there.

47
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,780
I would rather sleep on the street.

48
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,460
Zhao Yusi is so nice.

49
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,900
You're awake?

50
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,300
Why are you here?

51
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:15,660
Totally forget it?

52
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,780
Why do I feel I have amnesia?

53
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,220
I can't remember anything.

54
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,940
Get dressed.

55
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,460
I'll drive you home.

56
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:29,420
Hey.

57
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,620
I...

58
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,340
Did I get changed myself?

59
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:43,940
No.

60
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,220
What on earth happened last night?

61
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,500
After my conversation with Zhao Yusi.

62
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,500
Blow me off.

63
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,660
See if I can recall something.

64
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:11,740
For example,

65
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,420
who got me changed?

66
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,500
Don't get a headache.

67
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,380
My phone is dead.

68
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,100
May I use your cable?

69
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,500
Mm.

70
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,740
Why is he

71
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,380
so cold?

72
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,380
Did I offend him last night?

73
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,500
Oh, forget it.

74
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,780
Not until I recall something.

75
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,860
Oh, no. I just remembered.

76
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,940
If you can't drive, let me do it.

77
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,860
You can't do such a small thing.

78
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:02,780
But anyway,

79
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,260
if you weren't that sharp-tongued,

80
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,700
rigorous,

81
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,300
or bad-tempered,

82
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:10,820
you were actually...

83
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,580
A nice guy.

84
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,900
What do I do? I complained about him.

85
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,100
Sorry

86
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,100
for last night.

87
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,780
I shouldn't have complained.

88
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,500
I swear.

89
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,900
I won't do that again.

90
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:29,540
No.

91
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,340
I won't drink anymore.

92
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,460
People swear with three fingers.

[Awake Until Moonset]

94
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,180
I'm not drunk.

95
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,420
Don't try to get my address

96
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,700
out of my mouth.

97
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,980
Oh, bed.

98
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,540
You look great.

99
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,540
It's mine.

100
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,980
Oh, I feel bad in the clothes.

101
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,220
Excuse me.

102
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,940
[I picked this.]
Could you please get me a waitress?

103
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,300
Mm.

104
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,260
Room 804.

105
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,620
[Awake Until Moonset, I picked this.]
Good for you, Mu.

106
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,660
Mu, you keep such a low profile.

107
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,780
Mu, I really admire you.

108
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,220
Your memory is back?

109
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,620
Sorry

110
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,860
for last night.

111
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,260
I was drunk.

112
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,300
I didn't know what I was doing.

113
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,300
I know.

114
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:39,660
And then?

115
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,700
That's all?

116
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,140
What else do you want?

117
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,540
Compensation?

118
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,540
No. I want nothing.

119
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,700
Director Jiang, drive safe.

120
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,180
Tomorrow morning in the office,

121
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,060
you'll see your boyfriend Director Jiang.

122
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:05,820
Happy?

123
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,700
Don't make fun of me.

124
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,580
You know it's an accident.

125
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,460
Oh, it isn't.

126
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,420
It's trouble.

127
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,620
I don't think you can fix it.

128
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,220
When you go to work tomorrow,

129
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,580
your colleagues will ask you.

130
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,540
How about

131
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,020
you prepare some wedding candy

132
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,140
and give it to them?

133
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,180
Song Niannian.

134
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,420
Come on.

135
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,780
As far as I see,

136
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,060
it happened anyway.

137
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,620
Just let it be.

138
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,780
So far, you haven't lost anything.

139
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,980
How could you be
so proud of doing nothing?

140
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,340
That's my ability.

141
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,220
You don't understand.

142
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,260
You kept it really secret.

143
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,460
You didn't even tell me.

144
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,300
You're secretly in love
with Director Jiang,

145
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:51,740
aren't you?

146
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:52,860
- No.
- So,

147
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,300
when the dinner was over,

148
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,860
Director Jiang drove you home

149
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,220
just to take you away

150
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,220
and confess his love to you.

151
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,580
It's not true. He just...

152
00:08:59,580 --> 00:08:59,860
It is.

153
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,700
You took a photo and posted it.

154
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,660
I even commented.

155
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,300
That's not true, Mr. Liao. I...

156
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,420
Morning,

157
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,020
Director Jiang.

158
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:06,620
Morning,

159
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,140
Mr. He.

160
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,940
Good morning.

161
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,500
Umm...

162
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,140
Xu.

163
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,140
You don't sit here today.

164
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,100
Sit next to Director Jiang
for the report thing.

165
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,380
Then you can brief him more clearly,

166
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:15,940
right?

167
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,500
Mr. He,

168
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,140
you...

169
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,100
OK.

170
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,260
Fine.

171
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,500
Oh, no.

172
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:50,900
Sorry.

173
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,500
I...

174
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,300
I didn't turn on the vibration.

175
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,140
My bad.

176
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,340
So much for this.

177
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,540
Do you have anything else to say?

178
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:10,820
Let's end it.

179
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,900
The meeting took too long.

180
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,500
She was holding.

181
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,540
Xu Mu.

182
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,420
What about them?

183
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,980
Taking another elevator.

184
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,660
Because of the posted photo,

185
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,340
they think we're a couple.

186
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,500
They didn't believe my explanation.

187
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,300
As long as they see us stay together,

188
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,140
they'll gossip.

189
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,860
These days, let's try
not to stay in one space.

190
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,660
When they're no longer interested,

191
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:49,900
I guess...

192
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,420
Let's go.

193
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,180
Mm.

194
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,180
Sorry.

195
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,460
Shall I

196
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,940
buy you some coffee?

197
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:22,980
As my apology.

198
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,220
Hello. What would you like?

199
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,740
I'll pay.

200
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:37,940
You go take a seat.

201
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:38,980
Don't wait here.

202
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:39,500
OK.

203
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,740
It'll be served later.

204
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,220
Xu Mu?

205
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,140
You're here alone?

206
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,100
None of your business.

207
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,420
Two americanos.

208
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,420
Don't be so aggressive.

209
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,260
I just met you here.

210
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,340
I don't need to go for you.

211
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:04,660
Oh.

212
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,100
Here's the thing.

213
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:05,980
In a couple of days,

214
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,980
I'm getting married.

215
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,780
We're old classmates, huh?

216
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:09,700
We'll have a party

217
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,260
to get together.

218
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,380
Saturday afternoon.

219
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,420
Remember to come.

220
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,100
Congrats.

221
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,900
Marriage beyond ethical boundaries.

222
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,780
You're the first couple I've ever seen.

223
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,660
Quite unusual.

224
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,020
I won't go.

225
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,460
I knew it.

226
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,460
My girlfriend is right.

227
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,420
She said you wouldn't go.

228
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,620
Because you thought
you weren't as good as her.

229
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,860
Are you telling some joke?

230
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,020
It's OK.

231
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,540
I understand you have excess pride.

232
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,820
After all, when you look at a lady

233
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:35,860
prettier and richer,

234
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,140
you feel self-abased.

235
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:42,660
I've changed my mind.

236
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:43,900
I'll go.

237
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,300
I'll show you

238
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,860
how "self-abased" I am.

239
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,540
OK.

240
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,980
Bring your boyfriend.

241
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,900
Or when you see us in love,

242
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,740
you'll be pathetic.

243
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,860
That's not your concern.

244
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:54,700
Hey.

245
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,980
Isn't this your new boyfriend?

246
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,980
I'm Xu Mu's ex-boyfriend.

247
00:12:59,180 --> 00:12:59,940
Kind of your senior.

248
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,020
Good.

249
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,380
You get a high-quality man.

250
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:05,820
Hello.

251
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,380
I'm Jiang Zhou.

252
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,300
Hello.

253
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,380
I'm too busy with my wedding

254
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,100
to work out.

255
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:15,940
Oh.

256
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,300
Do bring your boyfriend.

257
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,700
We're old classmates.

258
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,060
For my wedding,

259
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,540
I want him as my best man.

260
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,460
Then for our wedding,

261
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,340
what will you give us?

262
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,740
I'm not a mister.

263
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,340
Anything but money.

264
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,340
I'm not short of money.

265
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,980
I don't need you as my best man.

266
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,420
But...

267
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,140
We need a flower boy.

268
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:37,940
That's good.

269
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,020
It's at least a boy.

270
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,220
When he left,

271
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:43,980
he went all gray.

272
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,380
He asked for that.

273
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,820
What will you do about the party?

274
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,780
I'll think of a way.

275
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:51,900
Anyway,

276
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,060
I can't let him show off.

277
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,100
I have an idea to get us what we want.

278
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,460
Are you interested?

279
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,580
My family are coming back to China.

280
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,780
There's a welcoming dinner.

281
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,740
It has nothing to do with you, actually.

282
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,020
But Chen Xi told them

283
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,780
that I was in love with you.

284
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,500
They ordered me to take you there.

285
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,620
Chen Xi will be there, too.

286
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,660
How childish she is!

287
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,580
Why did she tell them?

288
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,460
So,

289
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,660
I'll go to the party with you.

290
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,380
You'll go to the dinner with me.

291
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:26,700
Win-win.

292
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,940
When everything is over,

293
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,700
we can explain it to them.

294
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,180
Hello, Chief.

295
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,980
I'll send you an address.

296
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,220
Get ready and go there.

297
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,580
Don't do anything else.

298
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,020
Just be there and make the writer happy.

299
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,700
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

300
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,620
What writer?

301
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,940
Song Jinxin

302
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:00,860
of Limited Romance.

303
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,780
How about you send someone else?

304
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,940
If I go, it's not going to work out.

305
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,300
Stop gibbering.

306
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,460
Are you trying to slack off?

307
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,140
Just go there.

308
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,580
I'm in the middle of something.

309
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,620
Don't upset me.

310
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,210
[Film & Television Agency Contract
of Limited Romance]

311
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,700
Don't tell me

312
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,980
you're here to negotiate

313
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,260
on my copyright of film and television.

314
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:35,620
Miss Song,

315
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,300
you got it.

316
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,700
I don't want to talk.

317
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,860
When you fooled me,
did you see this coming?

318
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,460
Song... Miss Song.

319
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,780
What dissatisfies you?

320
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,660
Is it the price?

321
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:55,540
Mm...

322
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,980
Not the price thing.

323
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,940
It's just because

324
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,420
I care about my novels.

325
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,780
I prefer to leave it

326
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,540
to a more sincere company.

327
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:06,940
Oh.

328
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,140
It makes sense.

329
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,260
Come on, Miss Song.

330
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,620
We haven't started to talk yet.

331
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,020
How do you know we're not sincere?

332
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,860
Whatever Miss Song says

333
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,780
is the law of the land.

334
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,620
Don't interrupt.

335
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,580
He's childish.

336
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,460
Miss Song,

337
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,180
what do you think is sincerity?

338
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,500
In my opinion,

339
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,180
as we can afford,

340
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,500
we will give you

341
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,300
anything you want.

342
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,460
I'll think about it.

343
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,940
Before I make a decision,

344
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,420
if I have any problems,

345
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,180
may I ask this...?

346
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,100
Oh.

347
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,700
He's...

348
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:47,860
He is

349
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,220
Shen...

350
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:48,940
Shen...

351
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,740
Shen Yi.

352
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,580
He has the name of your character.

353
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:55,940
Shen Yi.

354
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,740
Then,

355
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,500
Then,

356
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,540
sorry to trouble you.

357
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:00,900
Come on.

358
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,900
It's not trouble.

359
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,460
Rest assured.

360
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,780
He'll take care of the follow-up work.

361
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,500
I'll text you his number soon.

362
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,780
OK, then.

363
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,660
Do you have a problem, Shen?

364
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,620
Don't forget.

365
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,740
You're still an intern.

366
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,180
I can fire you anytime.

367
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,580
I have no objection.

368
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,060
He has no problem.

369
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,140
OK.

370
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:31,940
I should go.

371
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,700
You nearly screwed it.

372
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,220
Fire me anytime?

373
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,180
I would only love it.

374
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,660
You know what?

375
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,980
I had to work for three months

376
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,940
to get my band cards released

377
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,940
for my research stuff.

378
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,300
Or why would I bear this?

379
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,100
For your guidance dog,

380
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,100
just bear it.

381
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:08,620
Hello.

382
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,420
Who's that?

383
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:10,780
It's me.

384
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,460
I'm just calling to remind you.

385
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,940
Save my contact

386
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,220
and keep your phone on 24 hours a day.

387
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,780
Otherwise, I will tell

388
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:18,780
Mr. Zhao.

389
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,540
Hey, Song...

390
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,220
Who's that?

391
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,540
Song Niannian. Who else could it be?

392
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,220
No way.

393
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,100
Go have dinner with me

394
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,700
to calm me down.

395
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,500
I have to work.

396
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,220
Fine.

397
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,100
You're a workaholic.

398
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,780
How about tomorrow?

399
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,220
Still no.

400
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,500
I have things to do.

401
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,700
You aren't available tomorrow?

402
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,540
But it's Saturday.

403
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,260
Not the work thing.

404
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,580
I'll go out for dinner.

405
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,540
In this case,

406
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,580
take me with you.

407
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,100
I know all your friends, anyway.

408
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,620
Not this one.

409
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,100
Really?

410
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,220
You have a friend

411
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,060
that I don't know?

412
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,620
Quite mysterious.

413
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:08,780
Humph.

414
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,340
I've arrived.

415
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,740
I'll arrive in ten minutes.

416
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,580
I should get in.

417
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,380
See you in there.

418
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,780
Wish you a happy wedding.

419
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,620
Thank you.

420
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,500
I heard

421
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,700
you even invited Xu Mu.

422
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,420
I'd say

423
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,860
it's generous of you.

424
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,380
If I were you,

425
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,860
I wouldn't take any present

426
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,300
from my husband's ex-girlfriend.

427
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,100
We're old classmates.

428
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,260
And it's just a dinner.

429
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,860
Come on.

430
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,100
Oh.

431
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,540
There you are, Xu Mu.

432
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,540
Xu Mu is also invited?

433
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,780
I think

434
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:03,020
Bei and Xu Mu are quite alike.

435
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,820
They like similar bags.

436
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,500
Sorry.

437
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,700
My limited edition Chanel
is in maintenance.

438
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,660
Otherwise,

439
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,340
I wouldn't use the same bag.

440
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,220
Your bag

441
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,660
is a style of last year, huh?

442
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,580
I'm not interested

443
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,500
in outdated stuff.

444
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:23,780
Hey.

445
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,300
Where's your new boyfriend?

446
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,420
Why didn't he come with you?

447
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:27,940
He's held up.

448
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:28,980
He'll be here soon.

449
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,420
Why do you come separately?

450
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,260
Sun Zhe told me

451
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,300
you had been single

452
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,220
these years.

453
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,260
It's hard to get a boyfriend, huh?

454
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,140
Not everyone is as excellent as you.

455
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,540
I hear

456
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,580
you're working for Like's planning dept.

457
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,380
Like doesn't recruit casually.

458
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,780
Come on.

459
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,220
The result of the interview isn't out.

460
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,900
And I did poorly in the written test.

461
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,740
I was only number three.

462
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,940
You call that "poorly"?

463
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,300
Hundreds of guys took that interview.

464
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,620
That's right.

465
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,100
Oh.

466
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,820
Xu Mu,

467
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,740
where do you work now?

468
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:02,380
Oh.

469
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,260
Shangxin.

470
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,620
Shangxin?

471
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,540
Oh, I remember it has
a small planning dept.

472
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,660
After I join Like,

473
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,580
I'll see if I can recommend you.

474
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,660
Director Jiang?

475
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,140
And you are...?

476
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:19,820
Oh.

477
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:20,980
I'm Luo Bei.

478
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,420
We met in the interview.

479
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,700
I was number three in the written test.

480
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,580
Hi.

481
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:26,860
You know each other?

482
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,140
This is Director Jiang of Like.

483
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,260
Let me introduce him.

484
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,540
I parked a bit far away.

485
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,300
So, I'm late.

486
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,380
It's OK.

487
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,460
You...

488
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,300
I'm her boyfriend.

489
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:42,860
Oh.

490
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,300
Well,

491
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,100
let's not stand here.

492
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,660
Director Jiang,

493
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,340
take your seat.

494
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,500
Don't bother.

495
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,260
I'm just here

496
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,300
to give a red packet.

497
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,220
Wish you

498
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,380
a long life together.

499
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:55,900
We have things to do

500
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,660
and you eat without us.

501
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:58,780
Excuse me.

502
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,300
Let's go.

503
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:01,980
Oh, Director Jiang.

504
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,820
My interview...

505
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,740
If I remember correctly,

506
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,340
the result was out yesterday.

507
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,100
We usually email those who pass it.

508
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,060
Such a thick packet.

509
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,660
Returning good for evil?

510
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:36,900
Only this?

511
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,500
Thanks for today.

512
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,140
It's a messy afternoon.

513
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,300
And those terrible people.

514
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:51,820
It's OK.

515
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,740
Not as terrible as you say it is.

516
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,980
You're indeed a superior.

517
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:57,820
You've seen

518
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,140
all kinds of people and things.

519
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,100
What did you like about him?

520
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:05,580
Who?

521
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,540
Sun Zhe?

522
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,100
When I met Sun Zhe,

523
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,220
he was nice to me.

524
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,860
He talked sweetly

525
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,220
and let me do whatever I wanted.

526
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,420
But as we got along, I realized

527
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,980
he only talked sweetly

528
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,300
without doing anything.

529
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,780
On rainy days,

530
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,620
I called him and asked me to pick me up.

531
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,620
But he wouldn't do that.

532
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,900
People sometimes get the wrong guy.

533
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,060
It's a good thing

534
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,460
that you broke up.

535
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,340
So, now I think

536
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,580
if someone loves you,

537
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,540
he will not do nothing.

538
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,220
In love, one can't help

539
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,540
giving the other all the best things.

540
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,340
People have to get along.

541
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,140
Time is the best test of love.

542
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,500
I told you about my love experience.

543
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,300
What about you?

544
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,900
Now, we're allies.

545
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,260
Don't keep anything from me.

546
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:02,820
I have none.

547
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,180
You're lying. I don't believe that.

548
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,100
You must have had one.

549
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,220
You just don't want to tell me.

550
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,380
Really trouble?

551
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,860
I was just kidding.

552
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,020
You went to see Sun Zhe, fine.

553
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,180
Why do you have to see Xie Shi's family?

554
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,660
Trouble, indeed.

555
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,660
But not that terrible.

556
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,820
He and I are cooperating.

557
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,780
It's a mutual agreement.

558
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,980
About tomorrow's dinner,

559
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,020
Xie Shi said

560
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,140
it would be just a meal.

561
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,340
I don't think

562
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,460
anything would...

563
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,340
Would it?

564
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,700
A01, huh?

565
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,580
I'll serve it.

566
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,260
By then,

567
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,900
Chen Xi will give you a hard time.

568
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,420
If Xie Shi is too weak

569
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,820
to defend you...

570
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,500
Mu,

571
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,140
I think your love relationship...

572
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,220
Song Niannian?

573
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,140
Shen Yi?

574
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,260
What are you doing here?

575
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:53,340
I...

576
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,500
A part-time job at the weekend?

577
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,500
Hello.

578
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,500
I'm Xu Mu.

579
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,420
I'm from your high school.

580
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,300
Hi.

581
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,260
I'm Shen Yi.

582
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,220
Just now, I heard you say

583
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,580
you and...

584
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,900
Xie Shi?

585
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,860
It's none of your business.

586
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,020
Put the coffee here.

587
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,140
I...

588
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:15,780
Just put it here.

589
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,260
Thank you.

590
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,860
Yi, come over.

591
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,700
Coming.

592
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,060
There, huh?

593
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,100
Yes.

594
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,060
Hey.

595
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,780
Don't be so rude to him.

596
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,380
He has a part-time job at the weekend.

597
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,380
Maybe he really has a problem with living.

598
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,100
We were classmates, after all.

599
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,380
You have a point.

600
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,460
In his company,

601
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,420
he seems

602
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,580
to be disliked.

603
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,620
He's pathetic, indeed.

604
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,220
Ouch.

605
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,060
I'm sorry.

606
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,060
Let me wipe it.

607
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:54,500
I'm sorry.

608
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,620
So sorry.

609
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,220
Let me get you another cup.

610
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,380
[A Week]

611
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,460
In your high school,
you shared a desk with a Mu...

612
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:14,620
Xu Mu.

613
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:15,700
What?

614
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,340
Are you in love with her?

615
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,460
Did my aunt tell you that?

616
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,620
You know what?

617
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,220
Come to the cafe now.

618
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,300
Song Niannian is slandering you
of being too weak

619
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:29,940
in front of your girl.

620
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,340
What if she dumps you?

621
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,220
Mm?

622
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,260
What a coincidence.

623
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,860
You're also here for coffee?

624
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,580
No.

625
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,460
Xie Shi?

626
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:55,940
Yes.

627
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,980
I got him here.

628
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,860
How dare you speak ill of Xie Shi

629
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,700
in front of his girl?

630
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,140
You eavesdropped?

631
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,580
She's my best friend.

632
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,780
What would I not dare to say?

633
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,340
Besides,

634
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,300
when did I speak ill of Xie Shi?

635
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,860
I'm not even going to respond.

636
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:18,900
Xie Shi,

637
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,140
what would you like?

638
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:20,780
I often come.

639
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,380
I can recommend some.

640
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:22,780
Humph.

641
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,900
What's so funny?

642
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,820
This cafe is his.

643
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,100
Didn't you see the name?

644
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,740
A Week Cafe.
[*Same pronunciation of "Yi" & "Zhou"]

645
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:32,780
Oh.

646
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,940
Does "a week"

647
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,780
mean a Jiang Zhou?

648
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,900
Think of my name.

649
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,420
You?

650
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,020
You're a waiter.

651
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,700
Don't interrupt.

652
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,740
I'm asking Xie Shi.

653
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,540
I don't care who you are.

654
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,620
Thank you, Mr. Xia, for the free coffee.

655
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,020
And the VIP card.

656
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,180
You can come often.

657
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,420
Do what you have to do.

658
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,580
He seems reassuring.

659
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,820
I'll let you go to the dinner.

660
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,300
I guess Xie Shi can take care of you.

661
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,020
What do you mean, "guess"?

662
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,420
He will take good care of you.

663
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,100
Xie Shi is

664
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,020
a very reliable boyfriend.

665
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,060
I assure you, with my integrity.

666
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,100
Do you even have integrity?

667
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,660
Take care of me

668
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,900
before you assure with your integrity.

669
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,460
Who would take care of you?

670
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:34,900
Hey.

671
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,500

So slow.

707
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,740
I'm calling to tell you

708
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,300
I'm done fooling...

709
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:00,580
No.

710
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,500
I'm done thinking.

711
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,340
Let's sign the contract.

712
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,940
She said she would sign the contract.

713
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,820
Shen Yi was so shocked.

714
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,420
He thought I was fooling him again.

715
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,660
After I signed it, he kept asking me

716
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,020
if there was any trap.

717
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,220
Because you fooled him all the time.

718
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,460
When you were so nice,

719
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,420
who would accept that?

00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,540
It's true

721
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,780
that we have a private problem.

722
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,780
But he was there for work
whenever I wanted him.

723
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,580
He had a good attitude.

724
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,300
So, I signed it.

725
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,820
But Mr. Zhao...

726
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,060
He was absurd.

727
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,300
In front of me, he lied to take credit.

728
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,460
Shen Yi is so poor.

729
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,820
He doesn't even have fifty yuan.

730
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,660
But Mr. Zhao still bullies him.

731
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,100
You're more bark than bite.

732
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,700
You and Shen Yi don't like each other.

733
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,380
But when he's bullied,

734
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,620
you stand up for him.

735
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,420
I'm just being righteous.

736
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:55,500
Fine.

737
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,780
Let's not talk about this.

738
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,620
Why are you awake so late?

739
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,780
It's nearly the morning.

740
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,420
You're awake, too.

741
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,220
I'm thinking

742
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,020
I'll see Xie Shi's family tomorrow.

743
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,420
I'm too nervous to sleep.

744
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,460
It's always hard for the first time.

745
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,340
Don't be nervous.

746
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,420
Get to sleep early.

00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,780

feel unfit,
