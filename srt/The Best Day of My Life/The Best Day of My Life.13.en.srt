00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,980
April 18 won't do, either.

191
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,060
I'll be the best man that day.

192
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,020
May 1.

193
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,220
May 3.

194
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,860
None of these dates will do.

195
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,860
How about

196
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,660
we don't get married?

197
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,820
Are you regretting it, Niannian?

198
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,540
Hey, you promised me.

199
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,540
You can't regret it.

200
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,500
Come on.

201
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,620
I'm not finished.

202
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,180
Be patient.

203
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:56,940
Sit down.

204
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,300
My point is

205
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,660
let's not hold weddings.

206
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,100
We can travel to get married.

207
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,500
Then we don't need
to care about others' conflict

208
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,020
or pick a good date.

209
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,060
Just make the two of us happy.

210
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,620
You freaked me out.

211
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,940
I thought you would regret it.

212
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,300
Why would I?

213
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,180
By then, we will

214
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,100
see the Northern Lights in Iceland

215
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,740
and take photos in Lake Geneva.

216
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,540
What do you say?

217
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,820
We will make a vow in the church,

218
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,860
ride a horse on the grassland,

219
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,500
and have babies.

220
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,820
Have a lot of babies.

221
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,620
Who would do that?

222
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:33,860
You.

223
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,460
Anyone who wants babies can have them.

224
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,300
I'm not fed up with my free life yet.

225
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,180
I don't care.

226
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:40,540
Come on.

227
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,420
Where do you want to go?

228
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,260
I'll write them down.

229
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,340
There must be flowers.

230
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,100
Does your father not live here?

231
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,060
No.

232
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,220
Before my mother died,
he had seldom come back.

233
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,900
Except for the Spring Festival.

234
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,900
Not to mention after her death.

235
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,500
But I regularly have it cleaned.

236
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,380
Is Fangping back?

237
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,380
Hi, Granny.

238
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,260
It's not my father.

239
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,340
It's me.

240
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,260
Oh, Xie Shi.

241
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,660
You're back in China?

242
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,660
Your father said

243
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,020
you were abroad with your aunt.

244
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,940
How's your aunt?

245
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,860
Is everything OK?

246
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:29,860
Everything's good.

247
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,380
Who's this?

248
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,500
This is my wife.

249
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,020
Hi, Granny.

250
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,940
I'm Xu Mu.

251
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,220
You're married?

252
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,420
Last time I saw you,

253
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,900
you were in high school.

254
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,740
How time flies!

255
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,940
You've been married.

256
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,780
You gradually

257
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,860
live a good life, don't you?

258
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,860
Now, you have a job and a wife.

259
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,900
If your mother knew it,

260
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,180
she would be so happy.

261
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:05,940
All right.

262
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,380
I'll leave you alone.

263
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,460
I should go.

264
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,260
Bye,

265
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,020
Granny.

266
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,940
Bye, Granny.

267
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,540
Come on.

268
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,020
Let's go pack Mum's stuff.

269
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,900
Only this little stuff?

270
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,140
Most of the valuable things

271
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,220
were sold by him.

272
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,860
What is left

273
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,660
is something worthless.

274
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,100
Is this an album?

275
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,540
Can I have a look?

276
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,380
Mum looked gorgeous when she was young.

277
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,020
Why do I not see you?

278
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,500
I don't like taking photos.

279
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,980
Weird boy.

280
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,300
Xie Shi.

281
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:24,900
Granny.

282
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:25,860
Come in, please.

283
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,100
I steamed it just now.

284
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,060
I thought you didn't have dinner,

285
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,460
so I brought you some.

286
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,820
Thanks, Granny.

287
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,620
Looking at the photos?

288
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,420
Oh.

289
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,140
many of his mother's photos

290
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,540
were taken by me.

291
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,660
Look at this one.

292
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,460
One month after she gave birth,

293
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,020
she wanted to take a walk.

294
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,380
I walked with her

295
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,620
and took this photo in the park.

296
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,700
And this one.

297
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,380
I'm impressed most.

298
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,860
I accompanied Xie Shi

299
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,580
and his mother to Jiangbei Hospital

300
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,340
and I took the photo there.

301
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,420
Xie Shi, do you remember?

302
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:02,780
Yes.

303
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,580
I went to buy something.

304
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,900
I was away when the photo was taken.

305
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,420
Xie Shi,

306
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,300
this is my favorite cake in childhood.

307
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,740
Why does this street look so familiar?

308
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,260
The back of the girl...

309
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,420
Oh, I wondered why you looked familiar.

310
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,780
I met you at that time.

311
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,260
It was Xie Shi's birthday.

312
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,140
We wanted to buy him a cake,

313
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,980
but didn't find a bakery.

314
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,420
Then we met you.

315
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,100
You need immediate treatment.

316
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,060
Hi, girl.

317
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,020
Where did you buy this cake?

318
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,500
On East Street.

319
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,500
But it's far and you need a taxi.

320
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,860
If you go now, it may be closed.

321
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,740
Too bad.

322
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,220
How about we buy one next time?

323
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,700
He doesn't care, anyway.

324
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,860
He has a birthday every year.

325
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,020
Thank you, then.

326
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,340
I'm sick.

327
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,020
I can't celebrate

328
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,580
too many of his birthdays.

329
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:04,860
Madam.

330
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,620
This cake...

331
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,540
You take it.

332
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:11,420
But...

333
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,700
I've been eating sweet food recently.

334
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,100
My mother said I put on weight.

335
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,300
Take it as your son's birthday.

336
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,900
Wish him a happy birthday.

337
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,660
This is inappropriate.

338
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,340
No, no.

339
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,580
Just take it, Madam.

340
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,540
Bye, Madam. Bye, Granny.

341
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,580
Thank you,

342
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,180
young girl!

343
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,100
Oh.

344
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,300
She's really a nice girl.

345
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,860
How about I take a photo of you?

346
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,180
Stand there.

347
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,740
I found it a pity

348
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,260
that my mother didn't see you.

349
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,540
Now, the pity is gone.

350
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,500
You'll have no more regrets,

351
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,340
Xie Shi.

352
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,260
All your dreams

353
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,820
will come true one by one.

354
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:05,820
Thank you.

355
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,660
Niannian?

356
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,700
What are you doing here?

357
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,260
Mu.

358
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,260
What happened?

359
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,580
You look aggrieved.

360
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,220
Did Shen Yi bully you?

361
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,500
Let's get in and talk.

362
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,740
I won't talk to Shen Yi these days.

363
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,940
He lost a bet to me

364
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,020
and now he denies it.

365
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,420
What's the stake?

366
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,620
How the wedding photos will be taken.

367
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,780
Now, he's regretted it.

368
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,340
I'm so pissed off.

369
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,700
He just doesn't love me.

370
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,500
It must be that case.

371
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,860
Maybe

372
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,180
it's not true.

373
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,100
It is.

374
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,420
He hasn't called me even once.

375
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,580
He just doesn't care about me.

376
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,620
Mu,

377
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,340
anyway,

378
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,500
I'll live here these days.

379
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,540
You must not expel me.

380
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,300
Fine. I won't.

381
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,940
Stay as long as you want.

382
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,220
Don't play with the phone, lying.

383
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,580
It's bad for your eyes.

384
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,340
What are you reading?

385
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:50,940
I'd like to read it, too.

386
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,340
It's boring.

387
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,660
How An Economy Grows And Why It Crashes.

388
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,700
If one day you have to go to an island

389
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,460
with only three things,

390
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,780
what will you take?

391
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,420
I will take...

392
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,540
Water.

393
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,020
Food.

394
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,540
And a knife.

395
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,140
What about me?

396
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,980
Your waiting for me at home

397
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,980
is my motivation to survive.

398
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,500
Mu,

399
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,660
I want to sleep with you.

400
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,340
OK.

401
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,420
I'll be right there.

402
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:54,860
Mm.

403
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,940
If I don't close the door again,

404
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,580
I'll go sleep with Magic Cube.

405
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,020
Is it sweet?

406
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:20,500
Mm.

407
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,780
What are you making?

408
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:28,580
Mu,

409
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,820
let me taste it.

410
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:30,620
Mm.

411
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:36,740
It's so sour.

412
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:37,940
Sour?

413
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,420
Mu,

414
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,420
let's go buy some strawberries.

415
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,540
It's too sour.

416
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,300
Come on.

417
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,300
What if Song Niannian wants you?

418
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,100
I came out after she fell asleep.

419
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,220
We're a couple.

420
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,820
But it feels like we have an affair.

421
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,780
We stay together every day.

422
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,700
But I feel I haven't
seen you for a long time.

423
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,380
This is exaggerated.

424
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,540
You didn't miss me at all.

425
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,260
Only I was enduring this alone.

426
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:25,980
I missed you.

427
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,300
Why would I not?

428
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,500
I missed you all the time.

429
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,100
Mu?

430
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,300
We can't keep doing this.

431
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,140
Where's Shen Yi?

432
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,380
I tried so hard to persuade her to come.

433
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,060
Can you just apologize to her,

434
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,060
make her happy,

435
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:53,660
and get her home?

436
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,740
I called her, but she didn't answer.

437
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,300
Look. She's blocked me.

438
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,340
I wanted to make her happy,

439
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,380
but I just couldn't.

440
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:04,980
Be sincere.

441
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,140
Apologize for your mistake.

442
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:06,860
That's right.

443
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,060
It's easy to make Niannian happy.

444
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,020
Go ahead.

445
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:09,620
Come on.

446
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,380
What are you doing here?

447
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,580
To apologize to you.

448
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,420
What wrong have you done?

449
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,900
I shouldn't have regretted it.

450
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,660
I promise I'll do
whatever you ask me to.

451
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,540
I'll all listen to you.

452
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,380
Are you sure?

453
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:45,820
Yes.

454
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:46,700
I'll listen to you.

455
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,500
Fine.

456
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,700
For the sake of Mu and Xie Shi,

457
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,060
I'll forgive you.

458
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,100
Let's go home, then.

459
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,260
What would you like for dinner?

460
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:06,860
I'll cook.

461
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,260
Finally, it's just you and me.

462
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,380
When you have time, tell Shen Yi

463
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,620
not to annoy Niannian.

464
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:14,700
I will.

465
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,140
I'll tell him someday.

466
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,980
Call him now.

467
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,220
What if someday

468
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,380
he annoys Niannian again

469
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,340
and she comes to us?

470
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,500
Then we'll sleep separately again.

471
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,500
Don't worry about them.

472
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,260
It's OK.

473
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,060
We'll ignore them.

474
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,020
We won't bother.

475
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,100
Finally, we're all alone.

476
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,020
Let's talk

477
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,260
about our business.

478
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,100
What business?

479
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,700
Something

480
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,300
I haven't managed to do.

481
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:02,900
Don't touch me.

482
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,900
Your hand is cold, Shen Yi.

483
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,140
Come on.

484
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:05,740
Niannian,

485
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,860
you forgave me, didn't you?

486
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,940
I didn't go back on my word.

487
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,300
I just tried to negotiate.

488
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,060
We take wedding photos
once in a lifetime.

489
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,780
I want you to wear

490
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,900
the prettiest dresses

491
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,980
and have a wonderful sense of ritual.

492
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,300
Then our best moments

493
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,340
can be recorded.

494
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,620
I don't just want

495
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,540
casual wedding photos.

496
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,300
I'm serious.

497
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,580
Come on.

498
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,180
I forgave you a long time ago.

499
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,820
I don't hold your hand

500
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,940
because it's really cold.

501
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:42,740
It's no longer cold.

502
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:44,500
Here.

503
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,180
I know you want to give me the best.

504
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,180
I shouldn't have left in a fit of anger.

505
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,420
How about

506
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,180
we take photos the way you want?

507
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,300
Don't bother about me.

508
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,220
We'll do it your way.

509
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,100
Oh, no.

510
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,180
We'll do it your way

511
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:03,980
and make you handsome.

512
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:04,860
Ignore me.

513
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,580
Do it your way.

514
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,060
Your way.

515
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,020
No need.

516
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:08,620
When you're happy, I'm happy, too.

517
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,300
- Do it your way.
- Your way.

Yes.

532
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,340
Starting this year,

533
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,700
let's come here every winter.

534
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:03,460
Love you.

535
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,300
No problem.

536
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,300
I love you.

537
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,460
That's not right.

538
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,020
You should say, "I love you, too."

539
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:13,820
No.

540
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:14,900
I love you

541
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,740
the way you are,

542
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,620
not because you love me first.

543
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,620
So, I'll always say "I love you"

544
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,020
instead of "I love you, too."

545
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,010
[We're married.]

546
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,060
Come on.

547
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,700
Wish you

548
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,780
- a happy Spring Festival!
- Happy Spring Festival!

549
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,500
Presents.

550
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,180
So early?

551
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,180
It's not early.

552
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,660
The Administrative Dept just announced

553
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,340
the vacation would start
half a day earlier the day after tomorrow.

554
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,580
Yeah!

555
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,580
Yeah!

556
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,860
I'll check if my ticket can be changed.

557
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:29,580
Xu.

558
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,740
You like macadamia nuts, huh?

559
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,220
Here. Take one more.

560
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,300
One is for you

561
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,260
and the other for Director Jiang.

562
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,580
Thanks, Mr. Liao.

563
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,220
Mu,

564
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,500
how will you spend this Spring Festival

565
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,500
with Director Jiang?

566
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,900
We...

567
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,060
What?

568
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,380
You'll celebrate it separately?

569
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:49,980
Yes.

570
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,460
We agreed to do this.

571
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,780
We can't have Aunt alone.

572
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,660
My parents want me home, though.

573
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,420
So,

574
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,460
we'll go back to our family separately.

575
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,420
Fine.

576
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,380
Shen Yi and I don't want to separate.

577
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,580
So, we'll get my parents here.

578
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,060
You'll take away
two of my mother's mahjong partners.

579
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,660
She'll cry.

580
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,380
My mother had the surgery this year.

581
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,140
I'll be worried if she isn't with me.

582
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,100
Niannian.

583
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,060
I'll say no more.

584
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:16,900
Shen Yi is here to pick me up.

585
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:17,780
Bye-bye.

586
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:18,940
OK.

587
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,860
Do what you have to do.

588
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,620
When I'm back in my hometown,

589
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,380
I can't have you
shell macadamia nuts for me.

590
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,100
Sounds like your parents are harsh.

591
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,020
I just feel

592
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,780
since we got married,

593
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,460
we've never been separated for so long.

594
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,620
We have no choice.

595
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,340
Just bear it.

596
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,100
If you give me a little reward,

597
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,500
I'll be able to bear it.

598
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,700

Oh.

630
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:15,620
You're back, Mu.

631
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:16,980
So early.

632
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,860
Come on.

633
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,220
How come you're back so early?

634
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,500
Lunch isn't ready yet.

635
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:27,580
I'm not hungry.

636
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,700
Go take some rest there.

637
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:29,660
OK.

638
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,060
Look.

639
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,700
I'm shelling

640
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,260
your favorite macadamia nuts.

641
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:35,740
Have some.

642
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:37,700
Dad,

643
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,340
I had too many nuts yesterday.

644
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,380
I'll hold off on that.

645
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:42,980
You shelled them?

646
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:46,940
Oh.

647
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,180
Xie spoils you too much.

648
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,980
Then, I'll go help your mother.

649
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,620
Eat whatever you want.

650
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,140
Mm.

651
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,300
How's it?

652
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,820
I'm making soup.

653
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:06,900
I'm home.

654
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,620
What are you doing?

655
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,820
Going out.

656
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,220
When Aunt arrives,

657
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,100
we'll go out for shopping.

658
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,500
Where's Magic Cube? Let me see.

659
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,780

00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,860
So adorable.

661
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,060
What are you talking about?

662
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,340
You look so happy.

663
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:24,900
Oh.

664
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,260
Xie Shi.

665
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,020
Mum.

666
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,060
Mm.

667
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,340
Is everything ready

668
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,540
for your Spring Festival with your aunt?

669
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,820
Yes.

670
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,780
Have you made dumplings?

671
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:37,780
Not yet.

672
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,140
We'll buy some frozen dumplings.

673
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:40,860
Oh.

674
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,460
That's not good.

675
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,420
What filling do you like?

676
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,540
I'll make some for you

677
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,180
and have Mu take them back.

678
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,540
I'm not picky.

679
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,420
Any filling will do, Mum.

680
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:50,460
Mum,

681
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,780
the cabbage.

682
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:52,780
Well,

683
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,460
I'll make some with different fillings.

684
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,780
You eat them

685
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,140
and see which tastes best.

686
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,380
Mum,

687
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,700
he isn't that picky.

688
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:00,620
He just...

689
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:00,980
Ow.

690
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:01,740
I...

691
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,900
I'm making some soup.

692
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,500
I'll say no more.

693
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,100
Take it back.

694
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,740
Oh, no.

695
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,020
Is my soup OK?

696
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,900
My mother has changed.

697
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,260
Now, she only cares
about her son-in-law.

698
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,100
Her daughter is a poor little girl

699
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,460
that no one cares for.

700
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,580
Then I'll tell her

701
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,820
I want the cabbage filling.

702
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,340
That's more like it.

703
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,340
What's your plan for the festival?

704
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,460
Today, I'll go to the fair
with my parents.

705
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,420
Then...

706
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,300
Tomorrow, we'll do the cleaning.

707
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,180
On the New Year's Eve,
we'll watch the gala.

708
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,940
From the first to the fourth day
of the new year,

709
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,180
we'll visit our relatives

710
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:36,820
and friends.

711
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,380
On the fifth day,

712
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,380
the annual primary school reunion.

713
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,620
Such a full schedule.

714
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,380
What about the sixth day?

715
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,300
On the sixth day,

716
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,460
I'll do something important.

717
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:47,580
What is it?

718
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,500
Go home

719
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,580
to see my husband.

720
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,060
OK.

721
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,340

I'll go have lunch.

727

I'll say no more.
