[Episode 1]

2
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,280
Right here?

3
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:45,880
Yes.

4
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,560
This is a street quick fire.

5
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,200
Just some simple questions.

6
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,480
You'll get a little gift.

7
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,240
Here we go.

8
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,640
What's your favorite color?

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,400
Blue.

10
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,400
What's your favorite fruit?

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,560
Orange.

12
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,520
Sweet orange.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,080
What's your favorite movie?

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,680
About Time.

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,480
One last question.

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,720
If you meet the one
you've secretly loved for a long time,

17
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,040
what will be your first words?

18
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,360
For a long time?

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,960
I have a poor memory.

20
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,200
I don't think I'll remember him.

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,440
Thank you.

22
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,520
Have a nice day.

23
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:16,880
Thanks.

24
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm in a hurry.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,640
I have to go.

26
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,080
Bye-bye.

27
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:21,880
Bye-bye.

28
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:24,960
Excuse me.

29
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,920
This is a street quick fire.

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,480
Just some simple questions.

31
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,720
You'll get a little gift.

32
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:30,480
Mm.

33
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,280
No problem.

34
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,920
What's your favorite color?

35
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,200
Dark blue.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,920
What's your favorite fruit?

37
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,320
Orange.

38
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,280
What's your favorite movie?

39
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,440
About Time by Richard Curtis.

40
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,160
One last question.

41
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,520
If you meet the one
you've secretly loved for a long time,

42
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,600
what will be your first words?

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I don't think

44
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,240
she still remembers me.

45
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,640
Thanks for joining us.

46
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,320
Your gift.

47
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,800
They make such a perfect match.

48
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:04,880
That's right.

49
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,200
Like a romantic drama.

50
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,920
If only they meet each other!

51
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,560
Mm.

52
00:02:48,070 --> 00:03:01,740
[The Best Day of My Life]
[Directed by Youyi Zuo]

53
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,520
You've heard about me.

54
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,520
I think I need

55
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,160
to tell you something personally.

56
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,240
As I've planned,

57
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,360
we'll get married soon.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,280
We're no longer young, after all.

59
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,280
You don't have a flat, right?

60
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,280
After we're married,

61
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,360
we can live in my flat

62
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,160
within the second ring road.

63
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,720
Considering our income,

64
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,560
we can save some money
after paying the mortgage.

65
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,240
Then, the baby thing.

66
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,200
I am

67
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,080
gentle and thoughtful.

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,640
I believe

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,360
I will be a good father.

70
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:37,720
Ouch.

71
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:38,840
Oh.

72
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,160
Sorry, sir.

73
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,520
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,400
What is your problem?

75
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:41,960
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,040
Be careful, will you?

77
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,280
Is it something you can touch?

78
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,080
Sorry, sir.

79
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,760
How annoying!

80
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,240
Come on.

81
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,320
I'm terribly sorry.

82
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,760
You don't wear glasses.

83
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,440
You don't have myopia, do you?

84
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,400
That's heritable.

85
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,360
I have high myopia.

86
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,880
If you also do,

87
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,240
our child will have high myopia, too.

88
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:13,960
I...

89
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,960
I do have myopia.

90
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,760
And...

91
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,320
It's high.

92
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,600
I fail to see

93
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,440
you're gentle or thoughtful.

94
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,680
I have work to do.

95
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,240
I should go.

96
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:24,960
Enjoy the food.

97
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,920
I hope

98
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,440
we will not see anymore.

99
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,440
Is your hand OK?

100
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,800
I'll buy ice cubes.

101
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,680
Ice your hand

102
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,680
in case you have a blister.

103
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,480
It's OK.

104
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,360
I'll flush it with water.

105
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:45,960
Excuse me.

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,800
Some ice cubes, please.

107
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,320
Thank you.

108
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:47,920
OK.

109
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,240
Thank you.

110
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,040
You're back so unexpectedly.

111
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,320
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

112
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,480
I could have picked you up.

113
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,880
You've just been back, too.

114
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,120
You may have a lot of things to do.

115
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,640
What can I do?

116
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,400
Just have a battle of wits
with my father.

117
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,920
Is your aunt back with you?

118
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,560
Not yet.

119
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,320
A lot of projects will move forward.

120
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,440
What about your cat?

121
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,240
Magic Cube.

122
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,200
Is it back?

123
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,400
It's back, too.

124
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,840
It's sleeping in there.

125
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,040
How long will you stay?

126
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,640
I applied for a transfer.

127
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,040
I'm not leaving.

128
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,280
You're not leaving?

129
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,280
Come on.

130
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,240
Let's have dinner.

131
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,800
What?

132
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,960
It fell through again?

133
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,280
Come on.

134
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,200
How many blind dates have you had?

135
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,920
Mum, keep your voice down.

136
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,120
I told you I didn't want a blind date.

137
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,560
But you insisted on arranging it.

138
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,760
I'm not to blame.

139
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,120
Then who's to blame?

140
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,720
My friends have grandchildren.

141
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,160
But I don't even have a son-in-law.

142
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,200
Who do you think is to blame?

143
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:49,880
Mum.

144
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,960
Mum, Niannian wants me.

145
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,440
I'll hang up.

146
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,880
If I remember correctly,

147
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,320
that was your sixth blind date, huh?

148
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,760
Did that unfaithful man hurt you

149
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,920
and traumatize you?

150
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,520
In your eyes, am I

151
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,640
a hopeless romantic that misses

152
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,280
the man who cheated on her?

153
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,480
No, of course.

154
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,520
But you met a lot of blind date guys.

155
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,880
Does none of them satisfy you?

156
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
Getting a boyfriend isn't like shopping

157
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,040
where we only need cost-effectiveness

158
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,080
instead of affections.

159
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,400
They have no affection for me, either.

160
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,520
They just think I'm suitable.

161
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,600
Oh.

162
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,280
After graduation, people only

163
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,960
care about whether they fit each other.

164
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,040
They seldom get together for love.

165
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,360
Speaking of love,

166
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,320
it's the purest in school life.

167
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,880
Do you remember
the boy in our high school?

168
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,040
What's his name again?

169
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,480
Do you like him?

170
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,080
Which boy?

171
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,320
Why such an old story?

172
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,040
He shared one desk with you.

173
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,260
By the way,

174
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,240
will you rest for some days
or work immediately?

175
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,200
I'm going to work tomorrow.

176
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:58,960
So soon?

177
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,680
Your boss is harsh.

178
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,000
He doesn't even give you a break.

179
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,760
I volunteered.

180
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,760
I knew it.

181
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,360
Never mind.

182
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,560
We're just two extremes.

183
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,160
If you were my father's son,

184
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,280
he couldn't be too happy.

185
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,200
He asked me to work
in his company in a couple of days.

186
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,560
I guess my good days will be over.

187
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,200
Just go as you're told.

188
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,840
I'll go pay the bill.

189
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,160
Excuse me.

190
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:29,760
Bill.

191
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:31,600
Oh.

192
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,920
Xie Shi.

193
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,640
This is ancient history.

194
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,960
I don't even remember
what he looks like.

195
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,480
Even if he stands in front of me,
I may not recognize him.

196
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,320
What are you looking at?

197
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,040
Oh, nothing.

198
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,320
That guy just looks familiar.

199
00:07:59,240 --> 00:07:59,960
Come on.

200
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,440
Let's drink.

201
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,040
What's the smell?

202
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,480
The wine spilled over the sofa.

203
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,560
I wiped it.

204
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,960
I thought it was my blanket.

205
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,960
The two blankets have different colors.

206
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,680
If you want to use mine, do it.

207
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,680
It's just a blanket.

208
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,720
Seriously?

209
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,360
[Group Leader Liao]
Tomorrow's project meeting is important.

210
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,320
Don't be late, guys.

211
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,200
Come early for preparations.

212
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,720
[Zhao Yusi]
Copy.

213
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,400
Yes.

214
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,480
[Qin Xiaoke]

215
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,080
[Xu Mu]
OK.

216
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,440
Oh, no.

217
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,240
Oh, no.

218
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:37,920
Come on.

219
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,320
Why?

220
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,120
You freaked me out.

221
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,400
This.

222
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,040
Print it again.

223
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,720
Proposal?

224
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,960
Mr. Liao checked it yesterday.

225
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,400
It's OK.

226
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:43,760
Don't bother me.

227
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,560
No.

228
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,320
Here.

229
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,000
SimHei, 10.5.

230
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,520
Got it?

231
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,520
Come on.

232
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,680
We had a project meeting
with their company last year.

233
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,760
You were absent.

234
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,400
At the meeting, they found

235
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,800
a wrong punctuation in the PPT.

236
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:56,880
So embarrassed...

237
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,720
I don't want
to experience it again, anyway.

238
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,040
I hear now they have

239
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,720
a new...

240
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,720
Director Jiang.

241
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,440
He's notoriously conscientious.

242
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,320
And he's super professional.

243
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,880
Don't treat him in the ordinary way.

244
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,360
Hurry.

245
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:07,720
Fine.

246
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,360
I'll modify it.

247
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,240
What time is it?

248
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,360
Eight to ten.

249
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,200
Still chatting?

250
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,720
Take this. You'll need it.

251
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,720
Air conditioner.

252
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,280
Check.

253
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,160

Mouse.

257
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,000
Mouse.

258
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,800
It's in your hand.

259
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,120
I'm testing if you can see it.

260
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,200
All right.

261
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,960
Everything is ready.

262
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,920
Do a good job.

263
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,440
Why do I feel

264
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,200
Mr. Liao isn't acting
like his usual self?

265
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,280
They're in.

266
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,280
There they are.

267
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,920
Hi, Director Jiang.

268
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:00,800
This way.

269
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,520
Xie Shi?

270
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,960
Everybody, quiet.

271
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,320
This is

272
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,840
our new transfer student,

273
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,680
Xie Shi.

274
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,440
I want you to get along

275
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
very well with him.

276
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,720
Hi, everyone.

277
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,920
I'm Xie Shi.

278
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,540
The man at the end

279
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,860
is Director Jiang

280
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:31,780
you talked about?

281
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,620
That's him.

282
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,420
Like is the world's biggest platform

283
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,300
of life service e-commerce.

284
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,820

285
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,620

00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,380
have passed the one million mark.

287
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,500
During our cooperation last year,

288
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,260
the Star Landlord Program in October

289
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,740
had twenty million views online.

290
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,620
So, this summer,

291
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,460
we'll still invite some stars
to help design the program.

292
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,060
What's more,

293
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,460
we'll also invite

294
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,460
some fans

295
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,180
to stay together with the stars.

296
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,860
Who would not want a candlelight dinner

297
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,060
with his favorite star?

298
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,660
Right?

299
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,020
The Star Landlord Program
got some achievements.

300
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,380
But...

301
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,060
But since last year,

302
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,420
there have been too many
similar marketing proposals.

303
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:19,620
I expect

304
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,740
to hear new marketing plans this year.

305
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,100
Mr. Liao.

306
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,580
Mm.

307
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,900
What do you think
is the age group of Like?

308
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,420
We had a data analysis about it.

309
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,300
Based on the data from last year,

310
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,260
the age group of Like

311
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,620
is basically under 35.

312
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,420
Customers of 26 to 30 years old

313
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,940
have the most searches
and the highest conversion rate.

314
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,220
So,

315
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,660
this section of society

316
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,340
will be our promising target customers.

Is anyone here
between 26 to 30 years old?

318
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,180
Do you think what Mr. Liao just said

319
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,660
can meet your requirements?

[Proposal 2]

321

Actually,

322
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,620
we have

323
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,260
a plan B.

Deep bundling with variety shows.

326
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,380
and have the stars live in our homestay.

327
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,260
Last year, we sponsored The Next Journey.

328
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,260
The results weren't great.

329
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,740
On Middle Lakeside Road,

330
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,780
another cafe will open this month.

331
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,460
Two osmanthus trees are at the door

332
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,580
that complement
the color of their takeaway cups.

333
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,740
The day before yesterday,

334
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,140
a bakery was open downstairs.

335
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,780
In its doorway, there is

336
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,540
a huge bunny toy.

337
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:46,820
That is...

338
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:47,900
This.

339
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,340
At the weekend,
we love to visit trending spots.

340
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,300
People of my age

341
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,220
want to photograph
anything new and pretty

342
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,820
and share it in all kinds of ways.

343
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,100
So,

344
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,460
we have

345
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,380
a plan C

346
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,620
to explore Like's social features.

347

Encourage people
to live in a distinctive homestay

348
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,380
and make it a way of life.

349
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,620
Compared to the first two plans,

350
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,060
I'm personally

351
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,180
more interested in this.

352
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,060
So, umm...

354
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,420
Miss Xu, please

355
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,540
make your plan C

356
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,820
more specific.

357
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,540
Director Jiang.

358
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,540
I'll go get the car.

359
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,500
Director Jiang,
I have a personal question.

360
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,500
Umm...

361
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,860
You...

362
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,460
Do you know Xie Shi?

363
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,860
When I saw you at the meeting,

364
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,780
I thought you looked
like my high school classmate.

365
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,300
So, I'm here to ask you.

366
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,780
Do you think I'm him?

367
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,660
I don't think so.

368
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,620
With a closer look,

369
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,780
you're more handsome than him.

370
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,180
I didn't see you clearly just now.

371
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,260
High school classmate?

372
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,860
This is ancient history.

373
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,620
You don't remember what he looks like.

374
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,580
So, you can't recognize him.

375
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,780
Why does it sound so familiar?

376
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,940
Do you have a photo of Jiang Zhou?

377
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,740
Show it to me.

378
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,060
I didn't get any from the Internet.

379
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:48,900
Hey.

380
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,940
They look really alike.

381
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,140
Jiang Zhou

382
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,060
is like a long-lost twin brother

383
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,660
of Xie Shi.

384
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,860
It's just coincidental, I think.

385
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,500
You haven't seen him for ten years.

386
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,780
People change.

387
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,540
The old me

388
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,500
in my high school photo

389
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,460
isn't what I look like now.

390
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,940
Xie Shi must have changed, too.

391
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,980
Maybe he's even bald.

392
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,660
You can't recognize him at a glance.

393
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,580
They just look alike.

394
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,500
It makes sense.

395
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,660
But...

396
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,700
But what?

397
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,980
If you're really curious...

398
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,900
You'll have a meeting
at his company tomorrow, right?

399
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,260
Take a photo of him.

400
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,460
I'll ask about him for you.

401
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:31,660
OK.

402
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,780
That's my full thought
about this project.

403
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,300
My colleague Zhao Yusi

404
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,420
will add some data details.

405
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,700
Excuse me.

406
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,300
I'll be right back.

407
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,070
[It's what he looks like.]

408
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,700
Isn't that Director Jiang?

409
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:23,780
Frozen?

410
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,700
Get her to turn it off.

411
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,020
Director Jiang,

412
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,460
I...

413
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,180
I'll go...

414
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:31,980
I'll go get her back.

415
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,220
Xu Mu.

416
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,460
Terrible news.

417
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,500
To present the data,
I wanted to log out on your WeChat.

418
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,260
But I clicked it.

419
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,300
What?

420
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,540
Director Jiang's photo
is still on the screen.

421
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,580
He doesn't allow me to log it out.

422
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,620
He wants you to...

423
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,580
Oh, no.

424
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,260
How shall I explain this?

425
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,980
Does she have a secret crush
on Director Jiang?

426
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,140
Xu Mu,

427
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,580
are you getting in?

428
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,180
Yes.

429
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,020
I planned to tell you who inspired me

430
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,660
when the presentation was over.

431
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,100
But you saw it ahead of my schedule.

432
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,180
You've got an idea?

433
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:32,580
That's right.

434
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,500
Xu Mu

435
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,540
is very clever.

436
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,820
She has many good ideas.

437
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,780
She must have a new proposal.

438
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,260
Tell us about it.

439
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,380
As is known to all,

440
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,700
Like has the homestay
of different themes.

441
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,020
Last year, I lived
in a homestay of anime.

442
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,460
It was the theme of Black Butler.

443
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,180
So, for different themes,

444
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,700
how about we add
some characteristic decorations

445
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,380
of a matching style?

446
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:57,900
Look.

447
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,820
Doesn't Director Jiang

448
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,940
look like Sebastian

449
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,620
in Black Butler?

450
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,060
I watched that.

451
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,340
Sebastian, the all-round butler.

452
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,100
The greatest of all time.

453
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:10,980
The greatest.

454
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,900
If we decorate the rooms perfectly,

455
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,740
the guests will not only experience

456
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,300
our high-end homestay service

457
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,500
but also dress up and take photos

458
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,380
to immerse themselves
in a different world.

459
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,340
The moment I saw Director Jiang,

460
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,980
this idea struck me.

461
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,100
Without a full plan,

462
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,100
I didn't mean to tell you.

463
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,140
I wanted my friend to check it

464
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,380
and then make a proposal.

465
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,540
Unexpectedly,

466
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,500
it was exposed.

467
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,980
Sorry for the trouble.

468
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,020
Then, stick to the proposal

469
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,100
and move forward.

470
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,260
OK.

471
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:47,980
Umm...

472
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,220
Thank you, everybody.

473
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,180
Thank you, Director Jiang.

474
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,660
Thank you, Mr. He.

475
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,780
Our team

476
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,340
has some other cases to handle.

477
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,460
We can't stay, then.

478
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,060
Well, I'll have Xu stay.

479
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,300
She'll invite you to dinner,

480
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:01,940
all right?

481
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,140
We should go.

482
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,260
Come on.

483
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,620
Mr... Mr. Liao.

484
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,420
Do a good job.

485
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,260
It's your job, too.

486
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,380
Hey, Mr. Liao.

487
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,620
It's late.

488
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,860
Shall I invite you to dinner?

489
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,940
I won't go.

490
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,060
I have a dog.

491
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:22,860
I have to go back and feed it.

492
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,180
I think I'm available.

493
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,460
You're not.

494
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,180
I'm occupied, too.

495
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,340
I have spreadsheets to do.

496
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,460
I have to work on my PPT.

497
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,740
So do I.

498
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,180
Since everybody is busy,

499
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:35,460
Director...

500
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:35,780
I'm available.

501
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,020
Let's go.

502
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:51,820
Here's your pork.

503
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,060
Didn't you say

504
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,140
I was Sebastian

505
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:58,820
who could do anything?

506
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,300
Director Jiang,

507
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,060
you have such a good memory.

508
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:22,580
Miss Xu,

509
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,340
don't catch a cold.

510
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,660
No, thanks.

511
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,620
You wear too little.

512
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,180
We'll work together for a long time.

513
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,220
Don't get everybody else sick.

514
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,380
Well...

515
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,740
Thanks for caring, Director Jiang.

516
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,740
You're a lefty?

517
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,140
Director Jiang,

518
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,020
are you left-handed?

519
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,500
I use both hands.

520
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:06,860
Director Jiang,

521
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,100
can I play a game with you?

522
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:09,940
What game?

523
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:10,700
Very simple.

524
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,020
I ask and you answer.

525
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,340
But you must be quick

526
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,260
instead of thinking.

527
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:19,380
OK.

528
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,660
How old are you?

529
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:25,780
Twenty-eight.

530
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,260
What's your favorite fruit?

531
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:27,820
Orange.

532
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:28,740
Nationality?

533
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,420
I'm Chinese.

534
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,500
Favorite animal?

535
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:30,900
Cat.

536
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:31,780
Where's your high school?

537
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:32,900
In California.

538
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,780
Are you the only child?

539
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:34,900
Yes.

540
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,860
Do you have cousins?

541
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:36,780
Have you changed your name?

542
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,500
Why don't you just ask
for my ID card number?

543
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,180
Sorry.

544
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,660
I have to take this.

545
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,220
Go ahead.

546
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:46,860
Don't mind me.

547
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,220
This is ancient history.

548
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,500
I don't even remember
what he looks like.

549
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,740
Even if he stands in front of me,
I may not recognize him.

550
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,260
High school classmate?

551
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,540
This is ancient history.

552
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,100
You don't even remember
what he looks like.

553
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,740
So, you can't recognize him.

554
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,140
It's really you.

555
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:21,980
He's so good at pretending.

556
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,980
I asked him to his face.

557
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,340
But he still gets along with me
as if he didn't know me.

558
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,220
What is that word again?

559
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,620
Scheming.

560
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,740
He's absolutely scheming.

561
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,020
He was even worse in high school.

562
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,980
He wasn't reasonable at all.

563
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,020
Oh.

564
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,940
I heard you complain about him.

565
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:46,580
But sadly, he's your client now.

566
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,300
Such a terrible destiny.

567
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,460
These are our routes

568
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,300
to inspect the spots.

569
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,020
Look, Director Jiang.

570
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,580
We'll do this in groups.

571
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,940
How about we start tomorrow?

572
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,380
You don't need to go with us.

573
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,340
