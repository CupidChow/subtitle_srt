3
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:48,780
What?

4
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,460
You're so serious.

5
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,780
My mother is recovering very well.

6
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:54,980
She's back home for recuperation.

7
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,540
She's back home?

8
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,300
When I visited her in the hospital,
she said she would stay for a while.

9
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,900
She can't help worrying

10
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,580
about the plants
she keeps on her balcony.

11
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,260
I'll ask my mother
to accompany her more.

12
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,020
Mm.

13
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,620
We...

14
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,340
What?

15
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,500
Having another anniversary?

16
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,620
We decided to get married.

17
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,580
So soon.

18
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,220
It's not a long time.

19
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,460
Shen Yi,

20
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,500
good for you.

21
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,060
That's not true.

22
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,740
I'm way too good.

23
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,460
Right, Niannian?

24
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,500
Don't show off.

25
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,500
This time,

26
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,500
when my mother was in hospital,

27
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,540
I realized

28
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,340
Shen Yi wasn't the same as me.

29
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,820
He is calmer,

30
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,940
more patient,

31
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,900
and better-tempered.

32
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,540
We click and balance each other.

33
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,740
We can be friends and partners.

34
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,940
We can also be a family

35
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,780
and depend on each other.

36
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,900
I think

37
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,220
if I don't marry him,

38
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,340
that'd be my biggest regret in life.

39
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,500
So, I proposed to him.

40
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,820
So, I accepted it.

41
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,460
You know what?

42
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,180
He was so moved

43
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,780
that he got all snotty.

44
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:17,860
He cried.

45
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,980
You stained my lipstick.

46
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,380
Who got all snotty?

47
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,260

00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,020
I'll wait here for you.

194
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,180
I believe I'll catch you.

195
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,060
Hey, son.

196
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,980
I've finally seen you.

197
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,060
I gave you some money, didn't I?

198
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,700
That's not enough.

199
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,220
You just gave me a little money.

200
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,060
I used it up over one night.

201
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,860
One night?

202
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,380
You gambled again?

203
00:14:59,100 --> 00:14:59,580
Son,

204
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,980
this is the last time.

205
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:02,900
I promise.

206
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,500
Give me some money

207
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,500
and I'll earn a lot more.

208
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:07,940
Then I'll stop

209
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,500
and live my retirement life.

210
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,140
I won't bother you again.

211
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,380
I won't believe you.

212
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:14,740
You want money.

213
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:15,660
Impossible.

214
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,060
Why did he hang up on me?

215
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,380
Impossible?

216
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,660
I'm your father!

217
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,940
I raised you.

218
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,060
How come you don't give me the money?

219
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,100
Raised me?

220
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,980
Did you raise me for even one day?

221
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:35,940
Fine.

222
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,020
I didn't raise you.

223
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:39,860
Your mother

224
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,580
raised you, didn't she?

225
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,220
Why do you have it?

226
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:46,540
If you want it,

227
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,420
give me the money.

228
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,860
Threatening me with my mother's stuff.

229
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,900
How ungrateful you are!

230
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,740
Stop gibbering!

231
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,060
Give me the money.

232
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,620
You care so much for your mother.

233
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,860
Pay some money for it.

234
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,180
It's not that I won't give it to you.

235
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,300
This is the last time.

236
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,020
That's right.

237
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,380
This is my good son.

238
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,060
No password.

239
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,820
Give my mother's stuff to me.

240
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,700
Give it to me.

241
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,020
Don't dawdle.

242
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,340
Hello, Aunt.

243
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,900
Are you available now?

244
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,260
Oh. I'm on a business trip.

245
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,020
What's up?

246
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,180
Miss me?

247
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,340
You guessed right.

248
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,980
We'll talk when you're back.

249
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,540
Why then?

250
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,340
Say it now.

251
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,660
What do you want me for?

252
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,140
Nothing, actually.

253
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:19,860
Today,

254
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,420
I saw Xie Shi's father.

255
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,740
But the two of them

256
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,220
didn't get along very well.

257
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,460
So,

258
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,580
I want to know

259
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,660
what happened to them.

260
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,100
Aunt?

261
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,660
Xie Shi's father is a terrible man.

262
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,140
Just gamble, Xie Fangping!

263
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,180
All you know is gambling!

264
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,020
None of your business!

265
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,100
You keep yelling every day!

266
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:48,740
Stop yelling!

267
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,220
Get out!

268
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,780
Xie Shi's father

269
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,380
was just bad-tempered in the beginning.

270
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,900
He kept quarreling
with Xie Shi's mother.

271
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,300
When Xie Shi grew up,

272
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,340
his father got worse.

273
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,300
He did violence.

274
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,620
Luckily, at that time,

275
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,900
Xie Shi grew up.

276
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,460
He could protect his mother.

277
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,180
Then he had to be beaten, too.

278
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,660
How dare you push me?

279
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,180
I warn the two of you!

280
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,420
Leave me alone!

281
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,180
You bad boy.

282
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,140
How dare you defend her!

283
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,180
How dare you!

284
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:18,940
How dare you!

285
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:19,780
How dare you!

286
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,860
Xie Shi fought back

287
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,420
and called the police.

288
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,420
But his father wouldn't listen.

289
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,380
He abused them harder and harder.

290
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,780
Once,

291
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,700
by accident,

292
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,100
he broke Xie Shi's right wrist.

293
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,380
At that time, his mother was sick.

294
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,660
No one took care of him.

295
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,740
Xie Shi was so proud

296
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,380
that he forced himself

297
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,220
to learn to use his left hand

298
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,660
and take care of his mother and himself.

299
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,380
But before his wrist recovered,

300
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,660
his mother passed away.

301
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,140
I thought he could
use his left hand since little.

302
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,300
Using his left hand
instead of the right one

303
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,820
was a huge change for him.

304
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,620
He hates to change.

305
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,660
But everything wasn't what he expected.

306
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,740
He was forced
to change schools constantly

307
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,140
and adapt to new situations.

308
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,500
He's developed this character

309
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,140
because of all that happened.

310
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,340
But Xie Shi has been this good.

311
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,100
I'm quite satisfied.

312
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,180
OK.

313
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,620

it wasn't that serious.

337
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,740
Maybe God favored me

338
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,420
and wanted me to experience

When we talk about the origin,

No one wants
to go back to the origin alone.

504
