3
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,100
Ever since I got Xie Shi
as my fake boyfriend,

4
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,180
my mom stopped keeping an eye on me.

5
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,300
Yesterday she even told me

6
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,140
she was going
on a trip with her besties.

7
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,340
She asked me which tour group
she should sign up for.

8
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,140
Thank God.

9
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,540
Your mother finally set you free,

10
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,420
and herself as well.

11
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,020
Yeah.

12
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,740
So, how are you
getting along with Xie Shi?

13
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,500
You didn't fight, did you?

14
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:08,700
Not bad.

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:13,860
This one

16
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,140
has an interesting slogan.

17
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,060
This one's got a nice package.

18
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:16,540
Which one?

19
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:17,900
What is there to hesitate about?

20
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:19,460
Let's take both.

21
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:20,540
It's on me.

22
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:21,300
Let's go.

23
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,140
You can date as you want.

24
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,460
But why do you have to live together?

25
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,900
If Xu Mu keeps a tight rein on you,

26
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,260
how am I supposed
to hang out at your house?

27
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,540
You can hang out with Song Niannian.

28
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,060
Her?

29
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,100
I'm not going to her.

30
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,220
But to be honest,

31
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,980
it's hard to imagine you
in a relationship.

32
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,540
Because to me,

33
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,220
you don't look like
you enjoy hanging out with girls.

34
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,820
What do you call Xu Mu?

35
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,420
Honey?

36
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,660
Baby?

37
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:58,940
So curious?

38
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,900
Why don't you start a relationship?

39
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,900
Of course I'm curious
since it's your first relationship.

40
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,540
I only pay for the necessary stuff.

41
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,820
Who pays decides.

42
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,740
I wonder when my dad
will let me use my card again.

43
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,020
With my salary,

44
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,220
I'm barely remaining alive.

45
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,260
This is something necessary, right?

46
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,500
Oh, what a coincidence.

47
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,860
You guys are also shopping.

48
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,500
Can you cook?

49
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,100
So many vegetables.

50

They are mine.

51
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,820

52
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:47,580
Can you eat them all?

53
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,180
So many snacks.

54
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:49,820

It's fine.

72
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,100

77

191
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:17,980
I can drink.

192
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,500
Did you forget what you were like

193
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,420
the last time you drank?

194
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,140
Why would you say that?

195
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,380
You two, enough.

196
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,540
You need to stop it.

197
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,140
Will you let us eat or not?

198
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,060
I'm glad I have a girlfriend.

199
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,940
This doesn't hurt me.

200
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,340
Let'e eat.

201
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,580
Let's eat.

202
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,180
Come on.

203
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,340
This is nice.

204
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,180
The food.

205
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,180
I have

206
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,420
never seen a girl around Jiang Zhou.

207
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:51,940
Come on, tell us.

208
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,140
How did you win him over?

209
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,100
My mother pushed too hard.

210
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,380
My mother

211
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,820
set us up.

212
00:08:59,180 --> 00:08:59,740
The two of us met

213
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,700
on a blind date.

214
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,060
What do you like about Jiang Zhou?

215
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,700
I like

216
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:08,900
that he cooks.

217
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:09,860
You see?

218
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,660
He cooks.

219
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:12,900
This is

220
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,820
really a thing that girls like.

221
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,420
Of course.

222
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,140
I can't cook.

223
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,020
Jiang Zhou.

224
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,100
What about you?

225
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,420
You never talked about

226
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,420
your type.

227
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:20,860
Right.

228
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,180
What do you like about Xu Mu?

229
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,140
I like

230
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,660
that she eats.

231
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,060
That is particularly lovely indeed.

232
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,020
Yes, it's a blessing.

233
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,780
A good appetite is a blessing.

234
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,580
It's a blessing.

235
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:36,980
Blessing.

236
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,740
Come on.

237
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,500
Come. Cheers.

238
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,820
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

239
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,300
Try the dishes.

240
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,420
Don't drink too much.

241
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,020
Enjoy the food.

242
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,020
Jiang Zhou, we'll leave then.

243
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,300
Okay.

244
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:47,780
Bye.

245
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,140
- Bye.
- Bye.

246
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:49,380
See you.

247
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,860
Mu, Mu.

248
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:56,940
Do you still remember

249
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,140
the Bowan Sea
we've always wanted to go to?

250
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,300
My friend organised
an event for couples there.

251
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,300
He wants us to join as support.

252
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,420
And it's free.

253
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,700
He said he'd set us up
with two hot guys.

254
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:20,940
Did you say yes?

255
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,340
Of course, I did.

256
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:27,700
Then

257
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,260
should I tell Xie Shi about it?

258
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,060
The two of you

259
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,820
are close enough
to check each other's schedules now?

260
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,060
No.

261
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,660
I just don't feel good about it.

262
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,580
Saturday, right?

263
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,220
I'll tell Xie Shi about it.

264
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,300
Mosquito repellent.

265
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:49,900
Thank you.

266
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:52,740
Niannian just...

267
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,740
I heard it.

268
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,300
Bowan Sea.

269
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,660
I think I heard them
talking about it at work today.

270
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,340
I guess they'll attend, too.

271
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,260
So popular?

272
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,820
Will a lot of people go?

273
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,340
People from your company

274
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,340
don't know we are a couple, do they?

275
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,740
Now,

276
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,300
I don't think
anyone doesn't know about it.

277
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,940
How could I have forgotten that?

278
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,140
Never mind.

279
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,100
I'll tell Niannian I can't make it.

280
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,340
There is a solution though.

281
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:30,940
I can go with you.

282
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,940
Sorry to trouble you.

283
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,740
Are you doing anything tomorrow?

284
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,620
I think
I have a clear schedule tomorrow.

285
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,100
I can go.

286
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,340
What about the other guy?

287
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,540
I'll come up with something.

288
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,220
Okay.

289
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,060
Thank you.

290
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,140
If I knew it was you,

291
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,020
I wouldn't have come.

292
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,820
You thought I wanted to come?

293
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,020
I'm doing this for Xie Shi.

294
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,180
You will be all alone and pathetic.

295
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,060
It's like you're isolated by others.

296
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,500
Then I'd rather be isolated.

297
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,860
Maybe you two should call a truce.

298
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,740
Let's buy something
from the store first.

299
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,460
Come, Niannian.

300
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,060
No need.

301
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,700
Did you move the supermarket here?

302
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,020
I did some searching last night.

303
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,460
It's pretty far away from us.

304
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,580
So I prepared these in advance.

305
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,580
The second half of the road
is more mountainous.

306
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,220
Take the motion sickness pills first.

307
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:55,860
Wait.

308
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:56,940
What about me?

309
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,460
I got you this.

310
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:05,820
Come on.

311
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,140
Are you my friend or not,

312
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,220
preparing me this?

313
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:14,740
Here.

314
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,100

341
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,100
are you here to participate in
the Bowan Sea couples offline activity?

342
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:54,940
Yes.

343
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,020
I ran it through the system.

344
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:02,220
The organisers have assigned you
two queen rooms.

345
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,980
The race clothes are in the rooms.

346
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,060
Here are your room cards.

347
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:06,820
Have a good time.

348
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:07,540
Thank you.

349
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,620
Let's go.

350
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,460
Come on.

351
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,420
What are you waiting for?

352
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,660
This is nice.

353
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,980
Xu Mu and Xie Shi are a couple.

354
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,900
You two share a room.

355
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,060
As for the other room,

356
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,380
I will share it with Song Niannian.

357
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,580
Who wants to live with you?

358
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,580
In your dreams.

359
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,380
I'm not doing it.

360
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,300
We only have two rooms.

361
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,340
You can't let Xie Shi and Xu Mu
live separately, can you?

362
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,740
You need to stop being a third wheel.

363
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,660
I've got it all figured out.

364
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,660
You sleep on the bed.

365
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,460
I bunk on the floor.

366
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,340
That should be fine.

367
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,740
No.

368
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,020
I understand why Song Niannian said no.

369
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,500
But why did you say no?

370
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,780
It's Xu Mu's problem,

371
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,700
or yours?

372
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,180
Enough.

373
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,740
Two girls share one room.

374
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:00,980
I'll share the other one with you.

375
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,620
It's settled.

376
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,700
There's a game later.

377
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,020
See you in fifteen minutes.

378
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,500

Thank you.

586
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,220
Your breakfast is way too substantial.

587
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,580
This is all I have.

588
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,820
Those two aren't here yet?

589
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,220
Eat while you wait.

590
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,820
Aren't you the girl
who won the games yesterday?

591
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:33,980
You're...

592
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,420
I was at the event yesterday.

593
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,780
I saw you and your boyfriend.

594
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,780
Where's your boyfriend?

595
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,220
Upstairs.

596
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,020
May I have your contact?

597
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,580
You came to this activity.

598
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,380
I assume you knew this is for couples.

599
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,340
Now you say these things.

600
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,860
Aren't you afraid
your girlfriends will find out?

601
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,220
Afraid of her?

602
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,060
I pay for what she eats and wears.

603
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,500
I even got her her job.

604
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,500
What can she do if she finds out?

605
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,460
Exactly.

606
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,220
Why pays gets to decide nowadays.

607
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,460
You're quite loyal.

608
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,340
Who knows
what your boyfriend's doing out there?

609
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,500
I know that better than you do.

610
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,820
What are you two doing?

611
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,660
Get your hand off of her.

612
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,540
Animals don't understand people.

613
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:26,500
It's normal.

614
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,340
What did you say?

615
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,660
So boring.

616
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,460
Let's go.

617
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,740
Stop.

618
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:40,940
What now?

619
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,380
You bumped into my girlfriend.

620
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:44,900
Apologise.

621
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,820
Are you done now?

622
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,700
Are you...

623
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:52,780
It hurts.

624
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,100
Show some respect.

625
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,820
You don't know how to be loyal.

626
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,540
I suppose you know how to apologise.

627
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,820
If you don't want your girlfriend

628
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,260
to see you like this,

629
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,980
I suggest you apologise now.

630
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,260
I'm sorry. Satisfied?

631
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,260
He deserves it.

632
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,780
I can't believe him.

633
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,180
He cheats on his girlfriend

634
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,540
and tries to take all men down with him.

635
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,500
But there are a lot of people
like that in real life.

636
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,260
Not everyone can dodge that.

637
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,740
Let's just hope we can find out sooner

638
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,460
and stop before it's too late.

639
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,460
Why are you sounding
more and more like Xie Shi now?

640
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,820
What do you mean?

641
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,420
I don't think so.

642
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,580
We won't have this view once we go back.

643
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,060
I will have to write.

644
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:42,900
Mu,

645
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,500
I feel a sudden pain in my head.

646
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,260
I need you to feel it.

647
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,220
Isn't my head burning?

648
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,300
Can I go back

649
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,620
and ask to take a few days off

650
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,780
and postpone my deadlines?

651
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,100
Give up.

652
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:54,940
You are fine.

653
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,260
I don't want to go back, either.

654
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,540
I regret
missing the high school spring trip

655
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,780
because I was too lazy
and didn't like the sun.

656
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,580
If I could go back to that time,

657
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,860
I'd be the first one out.

658
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,100
I regret not bringing my swimming suit.

659
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,180
Even if I can't swim.

660
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,580
It was a waste of good opportunities.

661
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,260
What about you?

662
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,660
What do you regret?

663
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,820
I regret not having punched
those two cheating men.

664
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,180
I regret nothing.

665
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,340
You are boring.

666
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,860
What about feeling sorry?

667
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:34,540
Anything?

668
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:37,660
Yeah.

669
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,620
Plenty of them.

670
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,260
That's right.

671
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,300
It would be strange not to have any.

672
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,180
I changed my major behind my dad's back.

673
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,340
I didn't major in finance.

674
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,340
I'm so sorry for that.

675
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,140
What kind of feeling sorry is that?

676
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,820
That's unfilial.

677
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,100
Hey, you.

678
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,460
I'm being honest.

679
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,340
You've been driving for most of the day.

680
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,460
Don't worry about my suitcase.

681
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,300
I'm fine.

682
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:24,980
I'm not tired.

683
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,380
You should get some rest.

684
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,340
A trip out cost me half of my life.

685
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,300
I have to sleep for two days
to make it up.

686
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:35,860
You can't.

687
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,140
Tomorrow is Monday.

688
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,900
How did you wake up so early?

689
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,100
I haven't even started sleeping yet.

690
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,940
I don't want to, either.

691
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,580
But last night I had a dream
about a very good man.

692
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,740
Perfect body. Very intelligent.

693
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,180
A generous and gentle man.

694
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,580
You must have been
dreaming about Xie Shi.

695
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,940
It was not him.

696
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,540
How could I dream about him?

697
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,660
He's kind of different

698
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,580
from the man I dreamed of.

699
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:01,700
Hey.

700
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,500
But I think
I went into his room last night.

701
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,500
I forgot when.

702
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,180
I hate my brain.

703
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,020
Three o'clock in the morning.

704
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,940
You didn't go to work?

705
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,340
What

706
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,340
did you hear?

707
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,420
I heard you say your husband was great.

708
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,420
Perfect body.
Very intelligent and gentle.

709
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:24,900
It's just a dream.

710
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,060
Just pretend you didn't hear it.

711
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:31,780
Oh?

712
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,540
You made me breakfast?

713
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,660
No.

714
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:37,660
Mine.

715
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,660
Can you eat two servings for yourself?

716
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,620
I'll save the rest for lunch.

717
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,500
You can have your husband cook for you.

718
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,180
He is so perfect.

719
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,460
I'm sure he cooks better.

720
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,780
Why are you comparing with him suddenly?

721
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,060
Men's competitive attitude is weird.

722
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,620
In that case,

723
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,420
you can show him your proposal.

724
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,540
I won't do it.

725
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,060
After all,
I'm not as intelligent as him.

726
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,060
I may not understand it

727
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,220
and accidentally eliminate you.

728
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,460
Oh, no.

729
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,020
I was just kidding.

730
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,380
You still have to read the proposal.

731
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,820
If you don't understand, who does?

732
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,460
It was just a dream.

733
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,220
I promise I'll never do it again.

734
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,780
You still need
to go through the proposal.

735
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,420
Just take a look.

736
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,260
If you refuse,

737
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,380
I'll go to work with you.

738
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,100
