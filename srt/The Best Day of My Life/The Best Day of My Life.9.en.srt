When I say something ominous,

192
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,860
and what kind of people

193
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,820
would be your readers?

194
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,460
Not you, anyway.

195
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,700
You're a reader of labor laws.

196
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,980
I can never write a novel

197
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,180
where an employee is squeezed.

198
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,820
What do you mean?

199
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,780
Song Jinxin,

200
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,180
don't flatter yourself

201
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,340
just because of your terrible novels!

202
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,460
Believe it or not,

203
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,420
in this play,

204
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,820
I'll have you replaced immediately

205
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,060
and you'll be fired!

206
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,580
Don't yell at her!

207
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,900
Believe it or not, I'll have you fired!

208
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,340
Shen Yi,

209
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,820
you have the guts, huh?

210
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,980
You think you own this company?

211
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,420
Check this first.

212
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,140
You abused your privileges

213
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,340
and profited from them.

214
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,660
Check carefully.

215
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,180
It's not a slander, is it?

216
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,380
Good for you.

217
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,620
You slander your superior.

218
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,580
Not only Song Jinxin...

219
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:32,860
I want the both of you

220
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,860
leave right away!

221
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,260
What is going on here?

222
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,140
Assistant Zhang?

223
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,220
To what do I owe the pleasure?

224
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,060
Mr. Shen called

225
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,300
but couldn't get through.

226
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,260
He sent me to check up here.

227
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,180
He called me?

228
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,420
Let me check.

229
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:54,820
He didn't.

230
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:55,980
Not you.

231
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:56,980
Not me?

232
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,700
Who could it be?

233
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,260
Oh.

234
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,220
Did you realize Shen Yi
had the chairman's family name?

235
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,980
Ah? Can he be...?

236
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,180
Isn't it obvious?

237
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,060
Oh, my God.

238
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,860
Shen Yi is really his father's son?

239
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:18,780
Oh, no.

240
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,180
He's really the chairman's son?

241
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,420
Indeed.

242
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,780
You didn't see that.
Mr. Zhao looked green.

243
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,620
You really experienced

244
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,620
the scene in the TV drama.

245
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,980
Isn't it always the plot?

246
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,500
To help his girl,

247
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,140
the hero revealed his identity
regardless of danger.

248
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:37,820
Song Niannian,

249
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,340
you have materials for your next novel.

250
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,300
At that time, I was a little bit moved.

251
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,100
But...

252
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,180
The more I thought of it,
the angrier I got.

253
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,020
So, all the time, I was

254
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,420
experiencing life with him.

255
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,300
He didn't mean it.

256
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,540
Maybe he didn't
get a chance to tell you.

257
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,900
I think he was just being impersonal.

258
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,940
He took me as an outsider.

259
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,580
Answer me one thing,

260
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,140
Song Niannian.

261
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,860
if one day I become a super-rich guy,

262
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,900
what will you do?

263
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,460
I'll certainly stick to you

264
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,380
and never let you go.

265
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,580
What about Shen Yi?

266
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,660
I don't know.

267
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,060
Maybe

268
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,100
he isn't just a friend.

269
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,460
So you expect him
to be absolutely honest.

270
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,220
Anyway,

271
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,580
I won't forgive him these days.

272
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,020
Then...

273
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,300
Then I'll see.

274
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,540
Mr. Zhang, you're famous for being noble

275
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,500
and you hate commercial things.

276
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,660
This time, you not only
cooperate with Like,

277
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,060
but also make your appearance.

278
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,700
You'll hold your exhibition
in Like's homestay

279
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,980
for the next three years.

280
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,900
Could you tell us the reason?

281
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,860
The reason is simple.

282
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,340
A friend I've known
for a while invited me.

283
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,260
Then, I came.

284
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,220
It must be a very important friend.

285
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,420
Mr. Zhang,

286
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,700
have you had any ideas

287
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,740
for what you're going to paint?

288
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:27,660
All right.

289
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,860
Let's get started.

290
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:16,820
Mr. Zhang,

291
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,300
why do you name this painting

292
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,660
"Spring"?

293
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,540
The change of four seasons

294
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,540
has negligible effects on me.

295
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,020
In the past dozen years,

296
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,460
my life has been in winter

297
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,900
instead of other seasons.

298
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:40,620
So, I usually

299
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,100
paint the spring

300
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,620
with superficial green.

301
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,540
Until

302
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,940
a rainy day last month,

303
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,780
I went to a cafe for some coffee

304
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,580
and didn't take an umbrella.

305
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,940
Someone gave me her umbrella.

306
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,500
I watched her rush
into the blurred crowd in the rain.

307
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,180
Until then did I realize

308
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,100
there could be

309
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,020
other colors in spring.

310
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:07,900
That girl

311
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,340
changed my opinion about spring

312
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,260
and even the world.

313
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,100
Her appearance

314
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,900
brought spring to my gray life.

315
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,060
This painting

316
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,460
was made for her.

317
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,260
So, it's "Spring".

318
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,660
Oh, Mr. Zhang.

319
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,460
That painting is quite poetic.

320
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,700
I feel lost in it.

321
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,660
Reporters have been praising you.

322
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,700
Mr. Liao,

323
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,500
you flatter me.

324
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,340
You...

325
00:14:59,340 --> 00:14:59,860
Mr. Liao.

326
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:00,900
Mr. Liao.

327
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,900
A reporter wants to interview you.

328
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,020
OK. Then...

329
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:04,660
Mr. Zhang,

330
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,220
I'll have Xu talk with you.

331
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,860
I've got something to handle.

332
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,620
Umm, Xiaoke,

333
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,380
pack Mr. Zhang's things for him.

334
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,980
Off the stage, I took
many photos and videos.

335
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,660
I'll send them to you later.

336
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,460
Shall I

337
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,140
invite you to dinner?

338
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,580
To thank you.

339
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,060
OK.

340
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:26,860
What's going on?

341
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,660
You look happy.

342
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,700
Mr. Zhang invited me to dinner.

343
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,420
A free meal certainly makes me happy.

344
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,420
Mr. Zhang is our partner.

345
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,060
How could we have him pay the bill?

346
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,260
The treat is on us.

347
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,500
Just now, I asked Mr. He
to reserve a restaurant.

348
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,820
Everybody will go there.

349
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,020
I'm here

350
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,380
to invite Mr. Zhang.

351
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,020
Hope you'll go.

352
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,980
When a free meal is offered,

353
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,300
you don't need to pay.

354
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:52,780
Mr. Zhang,

355
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,300
join us.

356
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:54,580
OK.

357
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:02,900
Well,

358
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,580
at this dinner

359
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,180
paid by Director Jiang,

360
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,820
let me say something simple.

361
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,540
First, I'd like to thank Director Jiang

362
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,940
for bringing us together.

363
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:12,900
Then,

364
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,820
I'd like to thank Mr. Zhang Yao

365
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,540
for joining us in this exhibition.

366
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:19,380
Nice.

367
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,020
So, let me propose this.

368
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,460
As we share happiness together,

369
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,220
let's drink together.

370
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,100
Cheers.

371
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,100
Come on.

372
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,620
Cheers.

373
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,740
Director Jiang is so thoughtful.

374
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,380
Mu lives a really happy life.

375
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,380
Eat it.

376
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:36,620
Mr. Zhang,

377
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,060
thank you.

378
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,540
Thanks to your artworks.

379
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,940
[Mum]

380
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,020
My mother is checking in on me again.

381
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,820
I told her we were
having dinner together.

382
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,620
Mm.

383
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,460
You guys eat.

384
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,140
Excuse us.

385
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:57,980
Come on.

386
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,500
Mum.

387
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,340
Xie Shi and I are eating with a client.

388
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,620
What do you want us for?

389
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,380
Nothing.

390
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,380
The vine in your grandmother's house

391
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,540
has fruited.

392
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,180
She keeps some big grapes for you.

393
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:27,700
In a couple of days,

394
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,340
I'll send them to you.

395
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,540
Xie, do you eat grapes?

396
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,340
Yes.

397
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,180
Thanks, Mrs. Song.

398
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,900
Did you see that sweet look

399
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,260
from Director Jiang?

400
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,180
Wow.

401
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,060
What?

402
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,020
You're jealous?

403
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,020
Too bad.

404
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,460
He only spoils Mu.

405
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,420
And you...

406
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,220
Just get stuffed.

407
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,100
The charm of Director Jiang

408
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,340
is known to everyone,

409
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:51,780
isn't it?

410
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,660
Our Xu Mu is a wonderful girl, too.

411
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,380
I picked her at first sight.

412
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,300
Our companies are
kind of bound by marriage.

413
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,420
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

414
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,300
Come on.

415
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:06,660
Enjoy the food.

416
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,380
One more thing.

417
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,060
When you have a vacation someday,

418
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,620
come visit us.

419
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,300
Your father

420
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,100
always wants to see him.

421
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,540
I'll spare some time to visit you.

422
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,060
OK.

423
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,100
Fine.

424
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,180
I have nothing more to say.

425
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:21,980
You go back

426
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,780
to eat with your client.

427
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,260
OK.

428
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,020
Bye, Mum.

429
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,100
Bye-bye.

430
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,340
It freaked me out.

431
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,300
We nearly gave ourselves away.

432
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,620
But anyway,

433
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,340
you act more naturally.

434
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,620
Then you need an acting class

435
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:38,460
for more practice.

436
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,620
What kind of man do you like?

437
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,780
Why do you suddenly ask this?

438
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,340
I...

439
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,740
I like that kind of man

440
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,740
with a talent.

441
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,660
Painting?

442
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,220
That's OK.

443
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,620
A painter has a good temperament.

444
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,060
In high school, I learned to paint.

445
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,220
I won a prize, too.

446
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,100
You?

447
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,180
We were in the same high school.

448
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,900
How do I not know?

449
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,060
There's a total tonnage
of what you don't know.

450
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,020
You must be lying.

451
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,100
If you don't believe me, ask my aunt.

452
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,740
In this way, I'll really ask her.

453
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,100
What's wrong, Niannian?

454
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,140
What's up?

455
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,860
He's only patient enough
for one message, huh?

456
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,660
Shen Yi isn't the only man in the world.

457
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,220
Why does she really ignore me?

458
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,580
How about she doesn't
talk to me ever again?

459
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,260
I won't talk to him again.

460
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,820
I don't believe this.

461
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,460
How can I not live without her?

462
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,020
If I talk to him again, I'll be...

463
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,060
- A dog!
- A dog!

464
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,060
I'll block her now.

465
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:13,940
Oh, no.

466
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,260
I'm calling her.

467
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,860
Then hang up.

468
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,540
You don't want to see her, anyway.

469
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,500
Mu,

470
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,500
what do I do?

471
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,820
Shen Yi is calling me.

472
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:24,860
Hang it up.

473
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,100
You don't want to talk to him, do you?

474
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,820
- Song Niannian.
- Shen Yi.

475
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,380
- Let's meet.
- Let's meet.

476
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,420
What's going on there?

477
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,420
I saw a dog go out.

478
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,980
So did I.

479
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,660
- What is it?
- What is it?

480
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,580
You start.

481
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,300
You've ignored me for 23 hours.

482
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,580
I can't fall asleep.

483
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,700
I can't write the codes.

484
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,060
All I can think about is you.

485
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,180
But I didn't dare to come to you.

486
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,020
I never thought

487
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,620
I would love someone this much.

488
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,460
My father always complains
of my one-line thinking.

489
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,860
Because I can only focus
on one thing since little.

490
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,260
When I was at school,

491
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,380
as long as I played too much,

492
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,740
my grades would drop.

493
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,100
My father could catch me all the time.

494
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,060
Because I realized the results belatedly.

495
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,660
Just like now.

496
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,940
When you were away,

497
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,140
I suddenly realized...

498
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,860
I think

499
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,300
I'm in love with you.

500
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,660
When I ignored you,
why did you not come to me?

501
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,420
I wasn't really angry.

502
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,980
I texted you, but you didn't reply.

503
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,820
If I had gone to you,

504
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,740
I'm afraid you would

505
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,380
hate me.

506
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,460

are a couple.

568
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,140
Only in name.

569
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,740
What's your point?

570
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,900
I've made my point clearly.

571
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:06,540
I...

572
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,940
I like Xu Mu.

573
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,260
I'm so tired.

574
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,300
When I was making a call out there,

575
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,340
what were you two talking about?

576
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,940
He looked happy when he came back.

577
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,020
I think

578
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,460
before Xu Mu falls in love

579
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,380
with you or anyone else,

580
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,500
I have the right
to like her and pursue her.

581
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,660
Nothing.

582
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,740
If you're hungry, I'll cook.

583
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:46,820
What would you like to eat?

584
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,900
Can I have some porkchop soup?

585
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,380
I want it.

586
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:51,460
OK.

607
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,380
I'm starving.

608
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,900
Let's order some drinks first.

609
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,180
How about you get a seat somewhere?

610
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,340
I'll buy some and catch up.

611
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,140
No. I'll buy something to eat.

612
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,540
I'll stay with you.

613
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,020
Xu Mu,

614
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:39,900
you go get a seat.

615
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,460
What do you like to drink?

616
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,060
I'll order for you.

617
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:41,780
Fine.

618
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,140
I'd like a bottle of juice.

619
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,060
Mm. OK.

620
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:51,660
Xu Mu?

621
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,220
I'm Xie Shi's friend.

622
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,420
You can call me Qiao Nan.

623
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,740
Shen Yi showed me your photo.

624
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,740
I thought I got the wrong guy.

625
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,780
But it's really you.

626
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,660
Hello.

627
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,940
Shen Yi?

628
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,100
Oh, he's my cousin.

629
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,740
He told me

630
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,780
you'd take charge of the follow-up, huh?

631
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,820
I guess we'll meet often.

632
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,500
My time is up.

633
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,500
I have an appointment

634
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,340
with the boss.

635
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,900
I'll ask Shen Yi to arrange a dinner

636
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,980
when we can dine together

637
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,620
and know each other.

638
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,460
OK.

639
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,060
Bye-bye.

640
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,740
Did you see Qiao Nan
who was just back in China?

641
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:32,980
No.

642
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,500
But I heard she is
Director Jiang's family friend.

643
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,580
They're from similar families

644
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,540
and they grew up together.

645
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,660
She's also his ex-girlfriend, I think.

646
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,580
Oh, she is?

647
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,940
Then, Xu...

648
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,740
Still in the mood for work?

649
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,420
If I were you,

650
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,300
I'd go back and check on my boyfriend.

651
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,620
You look confused.

652
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,180
Director Jiang didn't tell you, did he?

653
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,060
Our business is not your concern.

654
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,100
My friend abroad told me

655
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,940
She and Director Jiang  were
always together when they were abroad.

656
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,700
In a foreign country,

657
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,140
when they stayed all alone,

658
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,980
it was easy to develop feelings.

659
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,540
And Qiao Nan has a rich family.

660
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,220
She's pretty and capable.

661
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,380
She's such a confidante.

662
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,860
What kind of man would not like her?

663
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,980
She is Director Jiang's family friend.

664
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,860
They're from similar families

665
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,820
and they grew up together.

666
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,500
She's also his ex-girlfriend, I think.

667
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,580
She and Director Jiang  were
always together when they were abroad.

668
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,780
In a foreign country,

669
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,700
when they stayed all alone,

670
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,420
it was easy to develop feelings.

671
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,140
I know

672
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,540
I have no right to ask.

673
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,300
But we pretend to be a couple.

674
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,980
If someone asks me about Qiao Nan

675
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,740
and I have no idea,

676
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,100
isn't it inappropriate?

677
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,940
So, you and Qiao Nan...

678
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,580
No, no.

679
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,060
Today, Fang Jingjing said
you and Qiao Nan...

680
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,900
Still inappropriate.

681
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,700
Fang Jingjing isn't trustworthy.

682
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,980
Magic Cube,

683
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,580
do you think I should ask?

684
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,300
Forget it.

685
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,140
I'll just ask.

686
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,900
You're back?

687
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,660
Why are you still awake?

688
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,220
I'm waiting for you.

689
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,140
I have something to ask you.

690
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:58,380
Umm...

691
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,340
Hello.

692
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,220
Hello.

693
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,260
This is Qiao Nan.

694
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,900
Sorry to disturb you.

695
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,060
I called Xie Shi, but he didn't answer.

696
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,180
So, I asked Shen Yi for your contact.

697
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,100
Is Xie Shi there?

698
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,060
Yes.

699
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,380
How can I help you?

700
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,140
Can you put him on the phone?

701
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,420
I have something to tell him.

702
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:29,580
Qiao Nan.

703
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,180
She wants you.

704
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:35,940
Hello.

705
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:38,900
Mm.

706
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,540
OK. I get it.

707
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,500
I'll be right there.

708
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:43,980
I have to go out.

709
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,140
You go to bed early.

710
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,300
She asked Xie Shi out so late?

711
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,140
Why does it sound so weird?

712
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,780
He didn't explain anything

713
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,660
and you didn't ask?

714
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,340
We're not a real couple.

715
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,940
It'd be weird if he explained it.

716
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,100
That's no reason to ask him.

717
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,060
It makes sense.

718
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,380
But I think

719
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,900
she knows you're Xie Shi's girlfriend.

720
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,740
Or she wouldn't have called you.

721
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,340
Niannian,

722
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,100
time to go to bed.

723
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,340
Your man is rushing you.

724
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,300
Go to bed.

725
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,100
Fine.

726
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,700
Call me if you need anything.

727
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,580
I can hear.

728
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,380
OK.

729
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:28,940
