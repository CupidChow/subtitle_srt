[The Best Day of My Life]

2
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,860
[Episode 8]

3
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,460
Since when are you
interested in illustration?

4
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,140
As you know,

5
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,140
Like's new promotion period is coming.

6
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,420
We want to avoid the entertainers

7
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,980
and do marketing with illustrators.

8
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,900
I mean, illustration is
kind of popular right now.

9
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,420
But the plan is not yet completed.

10
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,340
Therefore,

11
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,700
I want to find more material.

12
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:11,780
Okay.

13
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,020
Good idea.

14
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,700
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

15
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,650
[Zhang Yao]

16
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,540
Let's talk about

17
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,460
some ideas for this event.

18
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,260
Xu Mu mentioned last time

19
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,260
that we didn't have
to work with celebrities.

20
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,340
We can find another way.

21
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,580
Such as the latest popular figures

22
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,740
and hot trend.

23
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,860
Maybe there's something
that fits in well with the homestay.

24
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,860
The two brands can cooperate.

25
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,620
Like the most talked about
illustration exhibition recently.

26
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,460
Illustration is popular right now.

27
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,660
Are there any illustrators who are

28
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,060
popular,

29
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,380
meanwhile, fit with

30
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,020
the concept of the homestay?

31
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,500
I think

32
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,460
Zhang Yao is a good option.

33
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,820
He became famous at a young age.

34
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,540
[Zhang Yao]
I followed him in high school.

35
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,460
At that time,

36
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,700
he didn't have many fans yet.

37
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,820
But now he is the lead of the industry.

38
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,860
Last time he mentioned
holding an illustration exhibition.

39
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,580
It was trending before it even happened.

40
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,900
Oh, speaking of trending,

41
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,700
it just came to me.

42
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,740
I know this guy.

43
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:21,900
But he seems

44
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,660
to never have appeared in public.

45
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,580
Is it possible

46
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,500
that he doesn't like such things?

47
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,060
This Zhang Yao is

48
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,540
the top of his game.

49
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,140
Right.

50
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,220
But this time,

51
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,140
our budget...

52
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,700
It's...

53
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,180
Xu Mu,

54
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,460
I thought you knew Zhang Yao in person.

55
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,020
It turns out you are
just fans and idols.

56
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,900
If Zhang Yao is a no-go,

57
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,860
is there anyone else

58
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,180
that suits

59
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,100
our concept?

60
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,260
Mr. Liao,

61
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,860
there's a joint exhibition
going on right now.

62
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,740
Through my friend,
I can contact Luo Xiaoxiao,

63
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,380
Illustrator Luo.

64
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,700
I just asked around.

65
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,820
It's within our budget.

66
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,220
He's a typical commercial illustrator.

67
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,900
His painting style is
very similar to Zhang Yao's.

68
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,740
Although he is not as famous,

69
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,420
because of his frequent appearances,

70
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,500
his fans are mostly female.

71
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,900
He suits our concept, too.

72
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,620
This'll work.

73
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,340
In that case,

74
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,020
contact Luo Xiaoxiao first.

75
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:16,780
Xu,

76
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,980
take Jingjing,

77
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,820
Xiaoke,

78
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,740
and Yusi.

79
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,660
You go together.

80
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,060
Okay?

81
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,100
Sure.

82
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:22,700
Good.

83
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:25,940
Xu Mu,

84
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,060
take care of the rest.

85
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,060
My friend came to pick me up.

86
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,780
See you.

87
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,740
I don't know what's wrong with her.

88
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,780
"My friend came to pick me up."

89
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,340
All right.

90
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,660
Let's take a cab, too.

91
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,940
Otherwise, there'll be a line later.

92
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,100
Go ahead.

93
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,020
Take this.

94
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,260
My colleagues and I will use one.

95
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,180
The rain is too heavy.

96
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:04,940
Don't get wet.

97
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,020
Then...

98
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,020
how do I return it to you?

99
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,020
It's nothing. It's just an umbrella.

100
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,460
If you insist,

101
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,420
give it to the next person
who doesn't have an umbrella.

102
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:17,820
Xu Mu,

103
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:18,820
the cab is here.

104
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,540
Oh, coming.

105
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,500
Careful.

106
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,340
Miss Song.

107
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,580
Oh, yes?

108
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:52,700
If

109
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,700
you feel

110
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,460
the love scene isn't sweet enough,

111
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,700
I can go back tonight to...

112
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,460
This is good.

113
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,020
It's great.

114
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,660
I was right about you.

115
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,380
Miss Song,

116
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,980
from the moment I laid eyes on you,

117
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,100
I just knew this script

118
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,580
had to be written by you.

119
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:08,540
Ah.

120
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,740
This month,

121
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,860
I'll take the new script
to the director and the actors.

122
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,780
I believe

123
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,180
they will feel the same way I do.

124
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,860
Is there anything
you want to be adjusted?

125
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:19,740
Perfect.

126
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,260
Especially when the female lead

127
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,860
tricked the male lead to go to her home.

128
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,980
The writing is particularly delicate.

129
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,900
It's relaxing

130
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,900
and sweet at the same time.

131
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,220
I'm sure

132
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,780
there will be pink bubbles
all over the screen.

133
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,340
Ah, that scene.

134
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,100
Is it,

135
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,900
Miss Song, your personal experience?

136
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,700
No way.

137
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,140
It's not.

138
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,500
It was

139
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,980
my friend's story.

140
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,180
Just kidding.

141
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,180
Miss Song,

142
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,780
for the next couple of episodes,

143
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,260
stick to this feeling and style.

144
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,500
I believe

145
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,260
everyone will be looking forward to it.

146
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,060
You mean

147
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,980
you put what happened
between you and Shen Yi

148
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,580
into your script,

149
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,860
and the producer loved it?

150
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,220
I was in a hurry.

151
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,660
I had no choice.

152
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,060
Song Niannian,

153
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,060
you finally found your inspiration.

154
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,540
Don't laugh at me.

155
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,380
I have two new drafts due on Thursday.

156
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,780
Do you have any juicy love stories?

157
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,060
Give me some inspiration.

158
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,340
I don't.

159
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,140
Xu Mu.

160
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,460
Coming.

161
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:35,900
I need to go.

162
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,620
Sex over friends.

163
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,820
I don't believe without Shen Yi,

164
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,980
I can't write it.

165
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:49,860
Ridiculous.

166
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,740
Yusi,

167
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,020
how is the progress on the contract

168
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,060
with Luo Xiaoxiao?

169
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,020
No contract.

170
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,980
Luo Xiaoxiao blew us off.

171
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,300
He said he wasn't coming.

172
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:08,940
When did this happen?

173
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,820
How did I not know?

174
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,780
He contacted me this morning.

175
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,460
I don't know

176
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,660
why he didn't contact you.

177
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,820
We had a deal last time.

178
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,660
He just changed his mind like that.

179
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,420
Why are you so upset
this early in the morning?

180
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,260
What's wrong?

181
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,260
Luo Xiaoxiao is not coming?

182
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,340
Xu Mu,

183
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,580
didn't I tell you
to take care of the rest?

184
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,580
How did you deal with it?

185
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,140
I wonder whose fault it really is.

186
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,700
What did you say?

187
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,300
Good morning.

188
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:41,660
Mr. Liao,

189
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,860
Luo Xiaoxiao is not coming.

190
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,860
What do we do?

191
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,460
What?

192
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:48,300
Wait.

193

00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,460
I almost forgot what I came for.

383
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,500
[Project Proposal]
This is the plan we made for your event.

384
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,140
Please take a look.

385
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,780
Like's idea has always
been the customers...

386
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,180
No need.

387
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,660
I believe in you.

388
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:58,620
Well...

389
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,260
To our cooperation.

390
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,980
Did you forget your keys?

391
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,500
What key do I have?

392
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,540
You can make me one if you want.

393
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,620
What are you doing here?

394
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,420
Nothing.

395
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,620
Just a lot of insomnia lately.

396
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,740
I dream when I'm asleep.

397
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,020
About what?

398
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,700
I dream...

399
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,180
Just dreams.

400
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,820
I just want to stay here for a second.

401
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,520
I love your hair. I loved your sign.
Lily, I love you.

402
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,180
Xie Shi.

403
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,260
How do you think
they're so sure of each other?

404
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,020
They'd even die for each other?

405
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,860
How did you know Xu Mu was the one?

406
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,180
Is she your type?

407
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,540
Right.

408
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,740
Based on the way you're in love now,

409
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,700
she probably is.

410
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,620
Why don't you focus on yourself first?

411
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,460
I don't need to.

412
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,220
I...

413
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,820
I'm sure I'll love someone

414
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,820
who has a sense of justice

415
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,500
and can hang out with me.

416
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,380
When we're together,

417
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,540
life becomes interesting.

418
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,140
She'll make me feel happy.

419
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,460
Although sometimes we quarrel and argue,

420
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,180
we won't really be angry.

421
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,820
So specific.

422
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,860
Why do I feel like you know this person

423
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,940
before that becomes your type?

424
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:44,750
[A Week]

425
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,660
Song Niannian?

426
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,940
Emergency.

427
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,820
You came to find me?

428
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,780
Right, yes.

429
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,580
Can you hang out with me tonight?

430
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,020
Just eat and sit together.

431
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,100
We presuppose countless romances,

432
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,260
in the hope of creating love.

433
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,220
But they all ended in failure.

434
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,500
Until one day

435
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,580
when there are no flowers,

436
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,700
no fireworks,

437
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,780
or candles.

438
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,500
Nothing was ready.

439
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,220
And I was caught off guard.

440
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,540
For the first time in my life,
my heart flipped.

441
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,540
The end.

442
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,820
Miss Song,

443
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,620
after reading it, it's like

444
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,140
we fall in love ourselves.

445
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,140
Let's come up with something good.

446
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,420
It's going to be a hit.

447
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,860
The scenes just feel

448
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,180
so real.

449
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,980
A lot of detail in there are

450
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,260
amazingly real.

451
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,580
By the way,

452
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,500
Miss Song,

453
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,380
have you recently

454
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,620
fallen in love?

455
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,300
How is it possible?

456
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,020
Then you must have a crush.

457
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,220
No, no.

458
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,820
Did you find a new illustrator?

459
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,860
I spent a lot of time with Mr. Luo.

460
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,420
He finally has an interest

461
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,740
in cooperating with us.

462
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,740
I think since Mr. Luo

463
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,220
blew us off once,

464
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,660
there can be a second and a third time.

465
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:53,980
So I

466
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,780
found a new illustrator.

467
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,740
Is your illustrator on the same level
as Luo Xiaoxiao?

468
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,380
If not,

469
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,100
it's better not to show us.

470
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,620
Zhang Yao.

471
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,100
What?

472
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,380
I said

473
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,220
I contacted Zhang Yao.

474
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,340
And

475
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,780
he has agreed.

476
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,700
How is it possible?

477
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,580
How could Zhang Yao be contacted?

478
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,820
Any messages I send him

479
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,940
went unresponded.

480
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,140
I don't know.

481
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,020
You must be lying.

482
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:30,780
Mr. Liao,

483
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,340
I'm talking to Xu Mu about work.

484
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,820
Good attitude.

485
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:34,580
Come on.

486
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,660
Let's just stop what we're doing,

487
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,300
and talk about

488
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,140
our cooperation with Mr. Zhang Yao.

489
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,420
This cooperation
is very important to us.

490
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,420
First,

491
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,940
that'll be Zhang Yao's
first public appearance.

492
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,260
So in addition to the promotion,

493
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,020
we still need him to paint

494
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,420
at the press conference.

495
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,460
He can decide what he wants to paint.

496
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:54,620
So Xu,

497
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,220
get in touch with Mr. Zhang Yao

498
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,620
and go through the procedures

499
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,380
with him.

500
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,780
Yeah, sure. No problem.

501
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,100
Good.

502
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:01,860
Okay.

503
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,860
Go back to your work.

504
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,180
Anything else you need?

505
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,220
Nothing.

506
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,860
[Zhang Yao]
For our project this time, Shangxin

507
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,940
helped us find

508
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,340
the famous illustrator, Zhang Yao.

509
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,220
Zhang Yao has always

510
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,020
kept a low profile.

511
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,620
He rarely shows up in public.

512
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,740
Shangxin inviting him this time is

513
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,300
a huge benefit to us.

514
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,060
I heard Zhang Yao was persuaded by Xu.

515
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,460
Miss Xu is so good at it.

516
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,100
I have a date tonight.

517
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,060
Might be home a little late.

518
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:01,660
Don't wait up.

519
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:06,980
Okay.

520
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,220
Therefore,

521
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,820
what do you think of our process?

522
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,020
Does allowing you
to choose what to paint

523
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:15,820
feel more free?

524
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,340
Pretty good.

525
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,540
I can do whatever you want.

526
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,540
You're too nice.

527
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,900
If only all our partners were like you.

528
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,820
My job would

529
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,260
be so much easier to do.

530
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,340
Why did you

531
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,340
stop sending me private messages?

532
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,860
Too busy at work.

533
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,780
Later,

534
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,860
I found

535
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,060
that you had more and more followers,

536
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,260
and got better and better.

537
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,700
I thought they might be like me

538
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,300
or care about you even more than I do.

539
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,700
So I stopped sending messages.

540
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,860
After you,

541
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,500
I do have a lot of people
who care about me.

542
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,820
But...

543
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,220
It feels different.

544
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,580
I'm not very good with the camera.

545
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,420
I worry I'll suck
on the press conference.

546
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,780
I have an idea.

547
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,100
Zhang Yao,

548
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:18,500
look at me.

549
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,900
Look at my phone camera.

550
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,020
Think of me as a reporter on set.

551
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,860
Let's try it.

552
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:29,780
Mr. Zhang,

553
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,780
why do you like illustration?

554
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,940
Would you like to share it with us?

555
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,220
Because

556
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,980
I'm boring.

557
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,740
I have no friends

558
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,820
or talent.

559
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,900
My only hobby is

560
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,580
to paint.

561
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,340
And

562
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,500
I've been doing it ever since.

563
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,260
Xu Mu?

564
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,740
Hello?

565
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,340
Director Jiang.

566
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,460
Are you having dinner with Xu Mu?

567
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,740
No.

568
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:18,780
What's wrong?

569
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,100
Nothing.

570
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,180
I saw

571
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,340
her having dinner with a man.

572
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,740
If it isn't you,

573
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,220
I won't go over there.

574
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,420
This time,

575
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,700
I remembered to bring my umbrella.

576
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,140
It's my turn to forget.

577
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,300
It seems

578
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,700
that umbrella I had before

579
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,300
already met someone in need.

580
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:46,940
Let me take you back.

581
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,540
No need.

582
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,340
A friend who happens to be nearby

583
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,020
will be here soon.

584
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,140
I'll just take his car.

585
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:56,780
All right.

586
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,420
Then

587
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,700
I'll see you next time.

588
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,380
Okay.

589
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,100
I'm glad you were around.

590
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,260
I could get a ride home.

591
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,580
Did you eat around here, too?

592
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,660
I was meeting some friends.

593
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,420
You

594
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,380
didn't bring your umbrella?

595
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,420
I lent my umbrella to someone else.

596
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:22,860
You know what?

597
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,540
What a coincidence!

598
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,420
The guy I lent my umbrella to is

599
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,340
the illustrator we invited this time.

600
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,300
The one you just had dinner with?

601
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,100
Did you see us?

602
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:33,980
Yeah, that's him.

603
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,420
Zhang Yao.

604
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,860
You knew each other before?

605
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,540
Not exactly.

606
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,860
I loved his paintings in college.

607
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,980
I was just a quiet little fan.

608
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,580
I used to send him private messages.

609
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,260
Were you interested
in his paintings or him?

610
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,940
His paintings, of course.

611
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,820
But I didn't think he was a boy.

612
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,660
Quite handsome, too.

613
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,220
I always thought he was a girl.

614
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,580
Had dinner with Zhang Yao?

615
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,580
Good for you, Mu.

616
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,980
I had several novels published before,

617
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,060
when I really wanted his paintings
to be the cover.

618
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,140
But he is way out of my league.

619
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,500
What's he like?

620
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,340
Is he different from his paintings?

621
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,860
No.

622
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,500
He is just like

623
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,660
his painting.

624
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,340
Very warm and kind.

625
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,220
Easy to get along with.

626
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,780
I even want to meet him more now.

627
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,940
I'll introduce you when I get a chance.

628
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,460
And the script
you wrote by watching Shen Yi,

629
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,300
how's it going?

630
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,540
Handed in.

631
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,100
Everyone liked it.

632
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,220
All liked it?

633
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,660
Do you like it?

634
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,660
Why does it feel like
the villain Shen Yi is about to win?

635
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,100
It's my work. Of course, I like it.

636
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:49,020
The rumour is
that when authors create their roles,

637
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,260
they are actually creating

638
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,100
their subconscious type.

639
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,340
You've been writing
by watching Shen Yi all day.

640
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:55,980
What do you think

641
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,780
your role feel like?

642
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,100
Shen Yi.

643
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,300
Let's change one.

644
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,780
This one is boring.

645
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:22,820
Oh boy!

646
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,820
Song Niannian,

647
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,140
are you insane?

648
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,220
This kind of dream will

649
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,260
only do you harm.

650
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,940
I guess I'm really
not thinking straight.

651
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,420
Finally cleared my head.

652
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,180
Nothing can't be fixed by shopping.

653
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,900
You may not even realise it.

654
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,820
Having an interest in someone
is wanting to see him.

655
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,300
Sometimes you even dream about him.

656
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,300
Anything else?

657
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,780
You can find out the rest.

658
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,140
People behave differently.

659
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,740
Okay.

660
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,960
[Shen Yi]

661
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,220
What's up?

662
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:47,980
Why did you

663
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,300
pick up so fast?

664
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,300
What do you want?

665
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,580
Uhh...

666
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,380
A new movie is on.

667
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,300
I watched its promotion. It looked fun.

668
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,180
I wonder if you'd like

669
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,540
to watch it together.

670
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,020
A movie?

671
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,380
But I am actually

672
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,580
quite busy lately.

673
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,540
Then forget it.

674
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,660
Go on with your work.

675
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,660
Hey, don't hang up.

676
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,100
I have a lot to do,
but I can find some time.

677
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,140
When is it?

678
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:21,660
This afternoon.

679
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,180
What's up?

680
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,140
Which one is better?
The left or the right one?

681
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,100
Are you going to a party?

682
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,340
What party?

683
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,660
Just going to the movies with Shen Yi.

684
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,300
It's because I

685
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,060
really like the movie.

686
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,500
And it's similar

687
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,420
to the novel my company is

688
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,340
about to write.

689
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,140
Shen Yi's paying.

690
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,100
I don't see why not.

691
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,700
Do you need to dress up
to go to the movies with him?

692
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,940
I'm not dressing up.

693
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,060
I'm afraid he'll laugh at me

694
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,620
if I go in a T-shirt.

695
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:03,900
Any way,

696
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:04,860
which one looks better?

697
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:10,940
What about these two?

698
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,300
The blue one?

699
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,100
The blue one.

700
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,620
Help me choose one.

701
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,780
I've already sent you the photos.

702
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,660
I have to go.

703
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,180
Why is Shen Yi choosing clothes as well?

704
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,860
Don't you think

705
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,260
they are a little weird?

706
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,940
Nothing is weird when it's those two.

707
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,940
Which one do you think is better?

708
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,900
They all look the same to me.

709
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,180
Which one did you choose
for Song Niannian?

710
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,180
A blue shirt.

711
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,940
