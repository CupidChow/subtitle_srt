[Episode 10]

3
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,460
Hurry up.

4
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,220
Move. Move.

5
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:50,900
Come on.

6
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,700
Move that way.

7
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:52,660
Stay busy.

8
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,500
Hurry up.

9
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,980
Don't touch the painting.

10
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,020
Be careful.

11
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,460
Hang the painting at the door

12
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,380
so that everybody can see it.

13
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:58,980
OK.

14
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,900
Put this painting in the back.

15
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,020
The rest of the paintings
stick where they are.

16
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:03,740
Go back to work.

17
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:04,340
OK.

18
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,500
It's not done yet.

19
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,900
Mr. Zhang, why are you here so early?

20
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,260
It's my first exhibition in a homestay.

21
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,580
I'm here early to check around.

22
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,740
Looks like

23
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,020
everything's good.

24
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,220
Thanks.

25
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,460
Not at all.

26
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,780
It's just our job.

27
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,380
There you are, Director Jiang.

28
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,460
Hi, Qiao Nan.

29
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,660
Let me show you around.

30
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,380
Don't bother.

31
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,140
Do what you need to do.

32
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,580
Thank you, Mr. Liao.

33
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,780
We'll go around by ourselves.

34
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:38,540
OK.

35
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,500
Come in, please.

36
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:42,540
Be careful.

37
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,140
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,380
Did he hit you?

39
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,620
I'm fine.

40
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,380
Don't be nervous.

41
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,180
I was freaked out.

42
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:49,700
Are you really OK?

43
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,220
Yes.

44
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,180
Are we going there?

45
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,380
I'm really sorry, Mr. Zhang.

46
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,140
Let's get to work.

47
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,460
Oh, Mr. Zhang.

48
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,860
Have you thought

49
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,580
about the location
of your first exhibition?

50
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,460
I thought

51
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,500
of an art gallery

52
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,500
or a park.

53
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,220
I didn't expect to have it
in a homestay.

54
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,940
It's kind of fun.

55
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:17,620
Xu Mu.

56
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,500
Xu Mu.

57
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,820
Qin Xiaoke wanted to ask you something,

58
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,980
Mr. Zhang, please excuse me.

59
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:24,940
Go ahead.

60
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,220
What's wrong?

61
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,500
Mu,

62
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,780
a worker broke the leg of the easel.

63
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:36,980
It can't stand.

64
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,540
This part.

65
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,580
Let me check.

66
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,540
Go tell the workers

67
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,140
to be careful.

68
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,060
I'll leave it to you.

69
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,180
Let's go.

70
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,340
Oh,

71
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,580
you left your coat
in my place last time you came.

72
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,500
I'll bring it to you next time we meet.

73
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:53,860
Mm.

74
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:00,860
Hey, Xu Mu.

75
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,940
Xu Mu.

76
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,500
What's wrong?

77
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,260
I prepared some extra easels.

78
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,460
Let's have this one replaced.

79
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,660
I'll go look for it.

80
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,260
Did Qiao Nan also work
in the headquarters abroad?

81
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,340
Mm.

82
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,700
She worked there
for a longer time than me.

83
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,740
Oh, I see.

84
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,500
What's wrong?

85
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,140
It's just...

86
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,380
You and...

87
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,740
I have to take this.

88
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,100
Go ahead.

89
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,140
Hello. What's up?

90
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,300
Something went wrong
in the homestay for the exhibition.

91
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,260
You need to go.

92
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,700
OK.

93
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,940
What was your question?

94
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,020
Nothing.

95
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,300
Drive me home and get to work.

96
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,220
Why do you suddenly want to camp?

97
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,540
Come on.

98
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,460
Tell them.

99
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,500
Today is

100
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,500
the anniversary of...

101
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,860
Our 15th day.

102
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,420
To celebrate this big day,

103
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,300
we decided to invite

104
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,060
our best friends.

105
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,180
That is...

106
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,420
You guys.

107
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,340
Even an old couple

108
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,700
don't show off as much as you.

109
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,660
It's his first relationship.

110
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,660
We can understand.

111
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,820
You blockhead.

112
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,580
You have no idea.

113
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,420
This is a sense of ritual.

114
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,060
Am I right, sweety?

115
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,140
Yes.

116
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,700
Sweety, let's go get something to eat.

117
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,540
Xie Shi?

118
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,700
Nan.

119
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,660
You're also here.

120
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,460
What are you doing here?

121
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,900
I'm just back in China.

122
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,940
I'm here to play with my friends

123
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,580
in case I have no time
after I start to work.

124
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,740
Join us, then.

125
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,700
I've bought a lot of things.

126
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,660
Sit with us.

127
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,580
OK.

128
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,620
Come on. Let's have fun together.

129
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,820
My mother asked me to buy you dinner.

130
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,060
You sent her to the hospital

131
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,700
and stayed by her side all night long.

132
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,340
Tell her not to say thank you

133
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,700
and she should stay healthy.

134
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,500
When I was just back in China,
she took care of me.

135
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:23,940
When she's sick,

136
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,620
I should look after her.

137
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,980
That won't do.

138
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:27,940
If you don't go,

139
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,980
my mother will complain about me.

140
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,740
Are they

141
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,660
always so close?

142
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,380
They grew up together.

143
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:47,820
Childhood sweethearts.

144
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,980
"Childhood sweethearts"

145
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,780
sound quite intimate.

146
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,780
Come on, sweety.

147
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,580
Here. Have a taste.

148
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:00,820
Thanks.

149
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,580
Thank you.

150
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,460
See how I roasted it.

151
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:06,980
How does it taste?

152
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,940
Nicole makes you impressive enough.

153
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,780
You don't need to cook well.

154
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:16,940
How does it taste, Xu Mu?

155
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,180
This taste...

156
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,660
Way too awful.

157
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,220
Sweety, they mock me.

158
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,420
Come on.

159
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,260
Don't make fun of him.

160
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,180
Don't bully my man.

161
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,780
It's pretty normal that he can't cook.

162
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,700
That's right.

163
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:33,820
All right.

164
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,020
Shen Yi made terrible food.

165
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,540
Taste what Xie Shi roasted.

166
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,740
You know how well he can cook.

167
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,500
When he was studying abroad,

168
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,820
everyone in his dormitory

169
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,700
lived on him.

170
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,140
There was even a chat group,

171
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,340
named Chef Jiang's Cooking Class.

172
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,380
Jiang Zhou was the head of the group.

173
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,580
Those like me who couldn't cook

174
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,660
kept learning to cook

175
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,900
from Chef Jiang.

176
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,220
Is that true,

177
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:01,740
Chef Jiang?

178
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:04,420
You taste it.

179
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:04,820
Go ahead.

180
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,100
I remember

181
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,020
Qiao Nan cooked well, too.

182
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,500
Overseas students of my major

183
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,460
often went to her dorm for food.

184
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,540
This is ancient history.

185
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,260
Don't bring it up.

186
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,820
Come on. Let's drink.

187
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,260
Come on.

188
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:17,820
Cheers.

189
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,620
Cheers.

190
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,060
Can you drink?

191
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,060
It's OK.

192
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:25,860
Drink no more.

193
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:27,980
It's cold at night.

194
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,980
When you drink more,
you'll feel colder.

195
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,180
It's OK.

196
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,740
I'll go get you a blanket.

197
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,620
I remember

198
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,260
Xie Shi taught Qiao Nan to cook, huh?

199
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,060
Because of that,

200
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,780
I shipped them.

201
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:56,940
I think

202
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,500
the two of you

203
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,460
are just like the childhood sweethearts

204
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,580
and the perfect couple

205
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,540
as in the novels.

206
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,500
To be honest,

207
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,780
I shipped them, too.

208
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,300
You must be drunk.

209
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,580
What are you talking about?

210
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,060
His girlfriend is here.

211
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,180
Just kidding.

212
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,820
When we sit together, we just talk

213
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,740
for old times' sake.

214
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,700
Xu Mu, you don't mind, huh?

215
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,300
I don't.

216
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,700
See? Xu Mu is OK with it.

217
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,900
I once read Xie Shi's diary.

218
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,540
He wrote,

219
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,780
he loved someone for a long time.

220
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,660
But his love confession

221
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,340
was rejected.

222
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,060
You don't know that, do you?

223
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,060
I do.

224
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,500
Stop it.

225
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,580
Sorry.

226
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,180
He's drunk.

227
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,460
You must be lying.

228
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,820
I don't believe it.

229
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,060
Why would I lie?

230
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,340
When he comes, I'll ask him.

231
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,660
Thanks.

232
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,180
Xie Shi,

233
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,420
did you write in your diary

234
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,220
that you loved someone for a long time?

235
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,540
But your love confession was rejected.

236
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:08,820
Yes.

237
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,180
You should have told me earlier.

238
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,580
I thought you made it up.

239
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,740
Why would I?

240
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,260
Let's drink.

241
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,060
Come on.

242
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,060
Cheers.

243
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,180
We'll go, Xie Shi.

244
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,460
We're going.

245
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:28,860
Bye-bye.

246
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:29,660
Bye-bye.

247
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,500
Bye-bye.

248
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:32,540
Mu,

249
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,860
I'll have Shen Yi sleep with Xie Shi.

250
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,740
Don't worry.

251
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,500
Aren't they a couple?

252
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,140
Why don't they live together?

253
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,700
They're a couple.

254
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,660
I just miss Mu

255
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,860
and I want to sleep with her.

256
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,020
Xie Shi,

257
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,260
lend your girlfriend to me.

258
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,140
You don't have a problem, huh?

259
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,620
It'll take your silence as a yes.

260
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,100
Miss Qiao,

261
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,220
do you have a problem?

262
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,380
No.

263
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,580
You go to bed early.

264
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,180
Mu, let's go.

265
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:15,740
OK.

266
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:17,940
Wait.

267
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,540
Wait a minute.

268
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,580
I have a problem.

269
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,580
I don't want to sleep with Xie Shi.

270
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,740
I want you,

271
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,140
sweety.

272
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,740
You're drunk.

273
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,820
No.

274
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,300
You're drunk.

275
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,340
I can't take care of you.

276
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,140
Have Xie Shi take care of you.

277
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,500
He's best at taking care of people.

278
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,060
Can you take good care of me,

279
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,660
Shi?

280
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,100
Don't be crazy.

281
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,860
You'll live with me tonight.

282
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,060
It's your luck.

283
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,060
What is wrong with you today?

284
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,220
Nothing.

285
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,180
Why?

286
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,820
Don't deny it.

287
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,460
I can tell if you're happy.

288
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:08,820
What happened?

289
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,540
Do you remember I told you

290
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,620
Qiao Nan called Xie Shi and got him out?

291
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,060
He didn't come back all night.

292
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,500
He was at Qiao Nan's place.

293
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,580
Today, they said

294
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,660
Xie Shi loved someone for a long time.

295
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,380
Xie Shi admitted that.

296
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,100
They all looked at Qiao Nan.

297
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,420
Mu,

298
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,700
do you like Xie Shi?

299
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,180
No.

300
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,380
I just...

301
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,100
I...

302
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,380
If you don't like him,

303
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,700
his business has nothing to do with you.

304
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,580
If he likes someone, he will tell you.

305
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,420
When your agreement is due,
you just terminate it.

306
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,460
I often tease you.

307
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,700
But...

308
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,420
I don't want such jokes

309
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,500
to cloud your judgment.

310
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,660
I get it.

311
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,900
I must have stayed
with him for too long.

312
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,820
I'm getting more confused

313
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,780
about whether I am
his fake or real girlfriend.

314
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,580
When I'm on a business trip,

315
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,020
I'll think about it these days.

316
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,940
[Xie Shi: I've arrived.
How's your work?]

317
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,300
Eleven of you, right?

318
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,100
That's right.

319
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,380
Hello.

320
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,580
Why so quickly?

321
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,140
Were you

322
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:53,980
waiting for a call?

323
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,620
No.

324
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,260
I was just playing with the phone.

325
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,500
You've arrived, huh?

326
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:00,740
Stay safe.

327
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,180
Lock the door at night.

328
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,780
How do you know we've arrived?

329
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,380
Qiao Nan just told me.

330
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,140
This week, something came up

331
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,740
and I couldn't go with you.

332
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,100
If you need anything, tell Qiao Nan.

333
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:18,820
Mm.

334
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,500
OK.

335
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,740
I'll go check in.

336
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:22,660
OK.

337
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,740
You've come so early.

338
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,300
I took the early train.

339
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:31,460
Let's go.

340
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,260
Let me carry it for you.

341
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,260
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

342
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:35,660
It's OK.

343
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,860
Hello, sir.

344
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,660
Hello, madam.

345
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,740
Do you have a reservation?

346
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,100
Xu Mu.

347
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,500
What time is tomorrow's exhibition?

348
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,580
At half past nine.

349
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,180
Oh, no.

350
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,060
At half past ten.

351
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,020
You can get more sleep.

352
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,780
It's the wrong room.

353
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,260
The one next door.

354
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:06,900
I'm sorry.

355
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,460
I saw it wrongly.

356
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,780
Thanks, Mr. Zhang.

357
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:10,620
You're welcome.

358
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:11,980
Go to bed early.

359
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,660
OK.

360
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,060
Thanks, Mr. Zhang.

361
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,300
This is the last stop

362
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,460
of the itinerant exhibition.

363
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,500
We're going back tomorrow.

364
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,500
You have a good rest today.

365
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,900
So do you. Thanks.

366
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,140
Mr. Zhang, what's up?

367
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,700
It's been cold lately.

368
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,420
The homestay exhibition
is in the mountains.

369
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,020
You'll easily get cold
when running about.

370
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,580
I got you some medicine
to prevent colds.

371
00:15:59,260 --> 00:15:59,980
Thanks, Mr. Zhang.

372
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,300
I have something about work

373
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,500
to talk about with you.

374
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,660
Oh, OK.

375
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,340
Come on in.

376
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:05,940
Let's sit and talk.

377
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,260
Sit anywhere you want.

378
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,180
It's not actually about work.

379
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,420
I actually want to paint the cityscape,

380
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:30,940
but...

381
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,500
I'm not familiar with Jiangbei.

382
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,100
Can you show me around?

383
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,620
Do I really have a cold?

384
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,180
Why is the water shaking?

385
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:49,700
- Earthquake!
- Earthquake!

386
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:50,780
Hey, wait.

387
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,340
The corridor must be crowded.

388
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,340
We live on the 28th floor.

389
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,020
Let's hide now.

390
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,700
At 15:28, 20 November, Beijing time,

391
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,620
a 3.2 earthquake
happened in Nanying County

392
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,300
at 165 degrees east
and 18 degrees north.

393
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,620
No casualties have been reported.

394
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,940
But Nanying County
is remote and mountainous.

395
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,540
Mountain roads may collapse.

396
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,620
We'll follow up
on the specific situation.

Please redial later.

Why do I think it's still quaking?

403
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:53,620
Why?

404
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,260
Does the bath

405
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,580
give me a high blood sugar?

406
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,220
Oh, Mr. Liao.

407
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,260
Don't be nervous.

408
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,180
The quake has stopped.

409
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,540
What happened?

410
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,740
Stay calm.

411
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,980
An earthquake happened somewhere else

412
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,060
and this region was affected.

413
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,980
Please wait in the hall.

414
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,940
It won't quake again.

415
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,380
OK?

416
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,300
Are you sure?

417
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,060
Yes, yes.

418
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,220
Stay calm.

419
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:09,980
Thanks.

Director Jiang,

422
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,140
why did you come all the way here?

423
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:14,940
Where's Xu Mu?

424
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:16,860
Where's she?

425
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:17,820
Call...

426
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,580
Call her.

427
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,100
It can't get through.

428
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:22,900
Hey, Xu Mu.

429
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,580
Where are you?

430
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,020
Oh, you're fine.

431
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,420
OK.

432
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:29,820
She's fine.

433
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,020
She's in the room with Zhang Yao.

434
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,020
It's not quaking, is it?

435
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,900
No, I think.

436
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,420
Have you arrived?

437
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,220
Did you see my cousin?

438
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,180
Her mother knows about the earthquake.

439
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:58,940
The anxiety is killing them.

440
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,220
I saw her.

441
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:02,820
Xie Shi.

442
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,660
What happened?

443
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,540
When I got out, I twisted my ankle.

444
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:09,780
Go to the hospital.

445
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,140
Be careful.

446
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,020
Drive her to the hospital.

00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,620
Be careful.

453
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,100
Zhang Yao adores Xu Mu, huh?

454
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,300
I saw them together several times.

455
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,700
When the earthquake happened,

456
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,580
they were staying in one room.

457
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,260
Why do you not

458
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,500
go back with them tomorrow morning?

459
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,420

We can't interfere too much.

557

You didn't see how Mu looked.

She said she was OK,

560
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,060
but she looked really depressed.

561
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,420
I don't know how to make her happy.

Never mind.

00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,140
It's no use telling you this.

00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,180
You spend more time
accompanying her, then.

Don't be so upset.

00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:48,820
Smile.

573
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,060
So fake.

574
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,260
I don't want to be upset.

575
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:56,900
How about this?

576
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,940
Let me show you something.

577
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,060
You'll cheer up.

578
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,340
Come.

579
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,420
Let's go.

580
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,860
What?

581
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,900
You wear too little.

582
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,860
If you go out like this,
you'll have a cold.

583
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,820
It's thick.

584
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,660
No way. It's not thick enough.

585
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:23,780
This one is good.

586
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,580
It's warm.

587
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,980
But I look so bad in it.

588
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,060
Can I not wear it?

589
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,300
You can't.

590
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:30,980
You don't look bad.

591
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,540
You can suspect my morals,

592
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,980
but you can't suspect
my taste in clothes.

593
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,340
You look adorable.

594
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,460
Here we go.

595
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,020
What's this?

596
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,580
The second-generation
upgraded bracelet of Nicole.

597
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,860
You can test it for me.

598
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,980
Why do you want me to test it

599
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,780
instead of yourself?

600
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,220
In this way, you will
be involved in its research.

601
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:54,860
You know what?

602
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,940
You're Nicole's potential customer.

603
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,100
Fine.

604
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,660
I might as well forgive you.

605
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:02,980
Listen.

606
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,660
Nicole not only has basic functions

607
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,740
but also the heart-rate detection

608
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,420
and the recognition of traffic lights.

609
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:12,060
Real-time updates will
go to Nicole's database.

610
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,260
Now, Nicole isn't what it used to be.

611
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:15,820
What?

612
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,020
Your boyfriend is awesome, isn't he?

613
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,340
Are you OK?

614
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,580
