00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,060
Just take a look.

00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:47,900
If you refuse,

5
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,020
I'll go to work with you.

00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,020
Morning, Mrs. Jiang.

8
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,740
So early?

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,020
Walking Director Jiang to work?

10
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,140
Director Jiang,

11
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,140
what a nice life you have!

12
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:11,860
Right.

13
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,020

walking him out.

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,860
You...

16

Oh.

17
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,740
We're here to meet Director Jiang
for a meeting later.

18
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,740
We didn't know

19
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,700
that you were here, too.

20
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,900
Director Jiang also
didn't say you would come.

21
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:28,820
It's fine.

22
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,220
Just be yourself.

23
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,540
Everyone has worked hard.

24
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,540

Sure thing, Mrs. Jiang.

27

Rest assured.

00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,340
Shangxin was

46
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,580
rejected by Mr. Zhen.

He forced...

48
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,340
He recommended this one.

49

He wants to cooperate with this company

50
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,580
instead of Shangxin.

51
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,500

they wouldn't be
considering cooperation with us.

00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,180
that they didn't even bother

to go through our proposal.

61

We did a good job on that proposal.

63
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,340
Exactly.

Why wouldn't they even take a look?

67

In that case,

68
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,060
you can show him

But this is just so sudden.

00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,140
Mr. Liao,

82
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,300
it's possible that we got eliminated

83
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,700
because of me.

84
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,740

Hey, I can't talk.

Are you hungry?

Are you in the mood for a hot meal?

95
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,340
Look at the colour.

96
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,340
Look at the dishes.

97
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,500
Look at them being together.

98
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,380
They are perfect
in colour, aroma, and taste.

99
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,220
And they are nutritive.

in the face of the truth now is

You don't believe me?

106

about the proposal thing today.

111
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,020
You were eliminated

inside of my company.

What's wrong?

117
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,100
I'm sorry.

118
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,060
I shouldn't have assumed
you did it on purpose

119
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,340
without asking you first.

120
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,500
Don't be sorry.

121
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,700
I also should have told you first.

122
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,780
It's like you said before.

123
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,580

It is

00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,740
I've read the script.

139
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,620
The main plot is
very complete and wonderful.

140
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,100
But,

141
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,380
as for the love part,

142
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,140
it's still a little immature.

143
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,380
We're a love story, after all.

144
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:34,860
Besides,

00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,340
have you ever been in love?

149
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,660
I have.

150
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,460
I've dated all kinds of men.

My relationships are very sweet.

153
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,140
Then Miss Song can combine
your own experience

00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,660
into it.

155
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,500
Try to make the love part

156
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,260
even more perfect.

157
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,460
Try to

158
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,140
make the story more vivid,

159
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,580
giving people
a feeling of being in love.

160
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,300
We'll talk about it then.

161
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,020
All right?

162
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:10,780
That's for today then.

163
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,500
When did you date so many people
behind my back?

164
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,580
You've never been
in love with a character?

165
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,140
Younger and older characters.

166
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,180
Emperors,

00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:27,580
bodyguards,

168
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,180
and celebrities.

169
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:28,820
I've been in love with them all.

170
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,060
There's no one I can't win over.

171
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,380
I'm talking about people.

172
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,740
Real people.

173
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,140
Ah.

174
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,260
What can I do then?

175
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,340
Admit that I've never been in love

176
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,540
and can't write it?

177
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,660
Well, go on dates now.

178
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,220
At our age,

179
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,660
it's perfect to fall in love.

180
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,980
Easy for you to say.

181
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,780
Fall for whom?

182
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,780
I'm surrounded by writers and authors

183
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,540
who have always been single like me.

184
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,460
People who write romance
never fall in love.

185
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,820
Who would've believed it?

186
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,740
People with love experience
may not be able to write romance.

187
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,460
Because the fantasy
is destroyed by experience,

188
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,780
we'll have less room to improvise.

189
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,500
And always dating
these perfect men makes

190
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,300
people more demanding
of their boyfriends.

191
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,540
We hope to have
a perfect relationship even more.

192
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,900
But look at in the real world,

193
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,940
what relationships are like.

194
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,220
But relationships in the real world
can be beautiful, too.

195
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,540
You can't generalise it.

196
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,340
Don't you want to

197
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,500
feel it?

198
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,580
You really don't want to?

199
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,620
Ah.

200
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,540
I

201
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,340
don't care.

202
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,460
I don't need it.

203
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,860
Growing up,

204
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,180
there was never a boy

205
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,380
who was willing to date me.

206
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,180
That's because they are narrow-minded.

207
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,940
You can't practice.

208
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,980
Maybe you can learn the theory.

209
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,140
Go and watch some romantic drama

210
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,660
to feel someone else's love first.

211
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,780
[Yes, I have no regrets]

212
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,500
Ah!

213
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,380
Shen Yi, what's wrong with you?

214
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,420
It's scary at night.

215
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,700
You know it's the night.

216
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,860
Shops are closed.

217
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,460
What?

218
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,420
Your meeting with the producer
didn't go well?

219
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,180
Shen Yi.

220
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,700
What do you think

221
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,860
of me?

222
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,500
What do you mean?

223
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,900
If you're a boy,

224
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,580
will you like me?

225
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,260
What do you mean if?

226
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,460
Song Niannian, you explain to me.

227
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,500
If I'm a boy...

228
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,140
I think I can be attractive.

229
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,260
There were boys
who were interested in me.

230
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,300
But we all ended up being friends.

231
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,780
If I ever fell in love once,

232
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,660
today I wouldn't have

233
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,660
been accused of being bad
at writing love stories.

234
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,180
Song Niannian,

235
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,820
you have always been single?

236
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,380
Actually,

237
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,020
I think

238
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,980
experience is important,

239
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,580
but it's not absolute.

240
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,460
You can also choose
to consult some experienced people.

241
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,780
It's also a shortcut.

242
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:51,780
Right.

243
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,940
Experienced people.

244
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,300
Yes.

245
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,180
Then I'll go talk to Xie Shi.

246
00:10:59,220 --> 00:10:59,940
Him?

247
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,940
He never fell in love before
just like you.

248
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,620
Talking to Xie Shi?

249
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,780
Then who can I ask?

250
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,700
You?

251
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,460
Yeah.

252
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,740
Love partly stems from worship.

253
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,060
And the best relationship
grows from mutual adoration.

254
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,460
If you like someone,

255
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,260
try to adore him first.

256
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:39,780
Shen Yi,

257
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,060
why don't you come down first?

258
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,700
I worry you might fall.

259
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,660
Song Niannian,
don't interrupt me when I'm talking.

260
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,420
I've been listening to you talk
for half an hour.

261
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,900
It seems now

262
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,460
I might as well go home and watch
two more episodes of Korean dramas.

263
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,300
Hey, wait, wait.

264
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,420
What's wrong now?

265
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,580
I have another quick fix.

266
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,340
Does it have to be like this?

267
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,900
Of course.

268
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,740
Love is all about

269
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,540
moments.

270
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,260
You just have to experience

271
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,060
what lovers have.

272
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,100
Moments.

273
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,100
Feel it with your heart,

274
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,940
and you will definitely find it.

275
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,780
We don't have to dress like this.

276
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,860
Couples must wear matching outfits once.

277
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,900
♪You seem to have universal gravity♪

278
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,620
You prefer this side?

279
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,540
Let's take another one.

280
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,460
Are you sure
this isn't a kindergarten uniform?

281

♪I wish it wasn't just a dream♪

283
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,820
Song Niannian,

284
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,980
you may question my character.

285
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,580
But you can't doubt my taste in fashion.

286
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,740
Isn't this nice?

287
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,660
You don't have to wear it.

288
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,100
A guy who just fell in love will

289
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,340
take his girl to a haunted house once.

290
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,540
When the girl is scared,

291
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,380
he'll stretch out his broad arms

292
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,820
to make his girl feel safe.

293
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:27,940
It doesn't count.

294
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,700
Couples must take a trip
to no destination.

295
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,100
This way.

296
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,740
This way.

297
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,060
I just saw the street sign.

298
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:36,900
This way.

299
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:37,900
No, no.

300
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,940
I looked. This way.

301
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,260
I told you it was this way.

302
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,700
I'm going this way.

303
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,020
If you want to go, just go.

304
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,260
Of course,

305
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,420
the boy will take
beautiful pictures of his girl

306
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,700
on their trip.

307
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,460
Very beautiful.

308
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:55,820
Are we done?

309
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,580
Done.

310
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,860
Look at this picture.

311
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,500
The scene.

312
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,100
The sea.

313
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,300
Shen Yi.

314
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,500
Isn't it nice?

315
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:08,660
Shen Yi!

316
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:09,140
Wait.

317
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:09,700
Wait.

318
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,700
Isn't it nice?

319
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,220
No, look.

320
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,580
Isn't it nice?

321
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,900
It's so pretty.

322
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,580
Didn't you call yourself
an experienced person?

323
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,020
Why is it so different
from what you said?

324
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,540
I didn't feel any joy from love,

325
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,420
only anger.

326
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,420
Theoretically, it should have worked.

327
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,140
Can it be the fault of

328
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,020
people...

329
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:36,780
Forget it.

330
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,140
I'll do some searching online.

331
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,220
[Things couples do.

00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,060
Shen Yi,

336
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,500
how dare you lie to me?

337
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,860
It's my first time, too.

338
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,740
We are the same.

339
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,540
I must go.

340
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:00,780
Stop there.

341
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,060
Don't go.

342
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,340
Our last project

343
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,340
went well.

344
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,220
Although Like didn't choose us
to cooperate

345
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,100
for the following projects,

346
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:08,580
we

347
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,100
still have many small projects.

348
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,460
I'm afraid we will be too busy,

349
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,620
so I asked our boss

350
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,860
to get more people.

351
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,620
These guys here all offered to help.

352
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,060
Welcome. Let's welcome them.

353
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,180
Isn't that Fang Jingjing?

354
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,420
I thought she and Xu Mu
didn't get along.

355
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,420
Why did she come to our group?

356
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,060
She thought she could participate
in Like's projects at first.

357
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,940
But she is just too unlucky.

358
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,860
She just applied,

359
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,020
and the project was gone.

360
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:35,940
What a jinx!

361
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,060
We're all in the same company.

362
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,780
I'm not going to
do all the introductions.

363
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,900
But if any of you want to say hello,

364
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:42,940
just go ahead.

365
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,900
I am very happy to join this group.

366
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,180
Especially,

367
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,980
I get to work with Xu Mu.

368
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,180
I feel very happy.

369
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,060
"I feel very happy."

370
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,060
Hypocrite.

371
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,060
You like Xu?

372
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,580
How about

373
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,660
for the next project,

374
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,740
you and Xu work together?

375
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,740
What do you think?

376
00:15:59,180 --> 00:15:59,900
Thank you, Mr. Liao.

377
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,460
Xu and I will do our best.

378
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,980
Ah, I like your spirit.

379
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:03,500
All right.

380
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,580
Then let's go back to our desks.

381
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,180
That...

382
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:05,540
My man,

383
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,220
you will be over there.

384
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,380
That's your new desk.

385
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,460
There. That way.

386
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:08,940
All right.

387
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,820
Mr. Liao, where do I sit?

388
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,460
I saved a spot for you.

389
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,540
I just noticed that Mr. Liao is

390
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,020
terrifyingly simple.

391
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,100
Look at her.

392
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,180
She must have been dumped
by Director Jiang.

393
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,700
How can you tell?

394
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,300
All subsequent offers were rejected.

395
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,020
What other reason could there be?

396
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,300
You really think
she's capable of anything?

397
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:31,940
Oh no,

398
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:32,860
she is.

399
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,180
In bed I guess.

400
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:36,500
Oh,

401
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,340
aren't you going out
with her this afternoon?

402
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,460
What do you mean with her?

403
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,260
It's her going out with me.

404
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,260
Right.

405
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,700
Xu.

406
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,620
You are there, too.

407
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,420
What?

408
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,220
Am I interrupting something?

409
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:50,700
We...

410
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,900
We were just talking.

411
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,500
Why are you afraid of her?

412
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,700
No need to explain to her.

413
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,020
She has no one to back her now.

414
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,220
But,

415
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,580
it's okay to be dumped.

416
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,820
After all, it's hard
to keep someone that good.

417
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,180
If this one doesn't work,

418
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,060
try another rich man.

419
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,460
We aren't in the same business.

420
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,140
If it's convenient for you,

421
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,540
help me find one.

422
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:15,660
You.

423
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:19,740
Let's go.

424
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:20,780
What are you waiting for?

425
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,580
You don't want to work with me now?

426
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,620
It's okay.

427
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,220
Stop pretending.

428
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,660
This project is mine no matter what.

429
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,260
The project with Like is gone.

430
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,420
I'll be in charge
of this project for sure.

431
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,580
Miss Fang.

432
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,180
Oh, Mr. Zhang.

433
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,020
Long time no see.

434
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,220
You look even younger now.

435
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:45,820
Oh.

436
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,060
Not as stunning as Miss Fang.

437
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,100
Come on.

438
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:49,500
Come in, please.

439
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:49,820
Okay.

440
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,340
Xu Mu
from the Planning Dept of Shangxin.

441
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,300
Ah.

442
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,180
Does your company recruit female workers

443
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,700
based on looks?

444
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,460
You are all so pretty.

445
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,500
Mr. Zhang, you are funny.

446
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,100
Hello.

447
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,420
I'm Li Fan.

448
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,780
You were in charge
of the Like project, weren't you?

449
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:12,940
I've heard of you.

450
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,300
Hello.

451
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,540
The last one got a good result.

452
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,860
So we are thinking about doing one, too.

453
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,700
You know

454
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,380
there is competition
between similar products.

455
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,340
Our project has
to be better than Like's.

456
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,780
We usually do custom work
for our clients.

457
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,500
I made a plan just for you this time.

458
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,220
Mr. Zhang,

459
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,580
you can get a general idea

460
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,620
before we eat.

461
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:34,660
Ah,

462
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,300
Mr. Zhang,

463
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,060
you've had a long day of work.

464
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,100
Let's eat and drink first.

465
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,380
We'll go through the plan afterward.

466
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,220
Right, right.

467
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,140
Drinking well is all that matters.

468
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,980
Let's eat and talk.

469
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,460
Waiter,

470
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,540
serve the dishes.

471
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,140
Mr. Zhang,

472
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,380
you must give me this project.

473
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,300
Don't worry.

474
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:58,540
Here.

475
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,300
Mr. Zhang gives us
so many opportunities.

476
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,540
We must do a good job.

477
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:04,980
We must do it.

478
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,500
One more drink.

479
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,300
I heard from Ding Ding the other day,

480
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,500
that your girlfriend
cares about you very much.

481
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,780
She insisted
on walking you out even in pajamas.

482
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,620
We are so jealous.

483
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,540
We envy you so much.

484
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,460
There must be some kind of trick, right?

485
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,460
How else can your girlfriend
love you so much?

486
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:30,540
Right.

487
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,300
Tell us.

488
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,660
Let's hear it.

489
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,500
Yeah, tell us.

490
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:38,740
It's a secret.

491
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,140
Ah.

492
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,220
You...

493
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:41,980
But,

494
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,100
I saw the promotion Mrs. Jiang did

495
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:44,900
the other day.

496
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,260
It's really nice.

497
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,060
Yeah.

498
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,620
The one they forced us to accept.

499
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,340
What awful plan is that?

500
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,180
This shortcut of theirs

501
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:56,980
won't last long.

502
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,900
I heard the boss already knows about it.

503
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,060
I think we'll replace it in a few days.

504
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,420
How did the boss find out about it?

505
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,540
Director Jiang,

506
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,780
do you know?

507
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,100
You can't wrap a fire in paper.

508
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,820
The secret will

509
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,020
eventually be exposed.

510
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,060
I'll go to the bathroom.

511
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,340
It's basically done.

512
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,780
Xu Mu?

513
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,860
What's she capable of?

514
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,100
She just sits there doing nothing.

515
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,700
Okay, I need to go.

516
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,180
Mr. Zhang is still waiting for me.

517
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,620
Director Jiang?

518
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,940
What are you doing here?

519
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,820
You're...

520
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,900
I'm Xu Mu's colleague.

521
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,140
You rejected our proposal.

522
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,620
We have to find other business.

523
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,060
So we invited some bosses out
to talk about cooperation.

524
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,580
If I'm being honest,

525
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,780
I think you made the right choice.

526
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,940
Xu Mu really does not have the ability.

527
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,940
Miss Xu,

528
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,060
drink some.

529
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,700
Let me have a drink with you.

530
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,300
Ah,

531
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,580
Xu,

532
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,900
No one drinks like you do.

533
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,060
Look at us.

534
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,620
We've got to the bottom of one bottle.

535
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:23,860
Mr. Zhang,

536
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,140
I'm not much of a drinker.

537
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,540
Mr. Zhang,

538
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,340
I'll pour it for you.

539
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:27,700
Here, here.

540
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,500
Go on.

541
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:30,900
Oh,

542
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,260
the rule on our side is

543
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,820
that you need to drink with me
if you pour wine for me.

544
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,180
Mr. Zhang is right.

545
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,260
Come on.

546
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,780
Have a drink with Mr. Zhang.

547
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:44,900
Mr. Zhang,

548
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,780
I'm afraid once I finish this glass,

549
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,620
I'll forget all the plans.

550
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,380
Then I won't be able
to explain it to you.

551
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,020
What did I just say?

552
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,860
Drinking well is all that matters.

553
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,620
You drink this glass of wine,

554
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,700
and we'll have a look at the plan.

555
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,620
Come on,

556
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,500
Xu.

557
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,380
Go on and drink.

558
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,540
Look I've drunk mine.

559
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:22,820
Good.

560
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,620
Bravo.

561
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,900
You're good.

562
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,220
Let's make it two.

563
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:27,740
Have another drink.

564
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:34,460
Here.

565
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,180
Pardon me.

566
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,220
I need to go to the bathroom.

567
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,700
Let Mr. Zhang see your sincerity.

568
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,420
She can't even drink

569
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,100
and has no idea on how to do business.

570
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,660
She isn't of any help
when you take her out.

571
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,060
Director Jiang,

572
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,740
it makes sense for you to dump Xu Mu.

573
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,740
After all,

574
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,340
out with the old, in with the new.

575
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,460
Don't you think so?

576
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,500
Who told you

577
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,780
we broke up?

578
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,260
The...

579
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,220
That promotion...

580
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,980
There are new and old things.

581
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,940
And there is my girlfriend

582
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:11,980
and others.

583
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,300
Excuse me.

584
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,020
What are you doing here?

585
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,260
Talking to colleagues about work.

586
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,620
Oh.

587
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,060
You drank?

588
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:36,780
Just one glass.

589
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,300
There's a strong smell
of alcohol in there.

590
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,460
Miss Xu,

591
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,780
where are you?

592
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,980
Your glass is still full.

594
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,820

♪All the expectations for you turned♪

596
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,820
I didn't get Like's project.

00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,220
Now I can't afford

598
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,380
to lose another one.

599
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,500
If you want to go home,

600
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,060
we'll go home.

Jingjing.

605
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,900
I won't drink so much.

606
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,340
I just had a little too much to drink.

607
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:16,860
Oh boy.

608
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,860
Isn't this Director Jiang?

609
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,140
What brings you here?

610
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:21,380
Come here.

611
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:21,820
Come.

612
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:22,620
Have a seat.

613
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,700
I won't sit down.

614
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,500
I just wanted to say hello.

615
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,540
My girlfriend isn't feeling well.

616
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,580
I'll just take her.

617
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,180
She...

618
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,620
She's your girlfriend?

619
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,180
Oh, Xu.

620
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,380
Miss Xu,

621
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,140
why didn't you say so?

622
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,460
Look what I'm doing here.

623
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:39,740
Well.

624
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,180
Director Jiang,

625
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,620
consider this my apology.

626
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,140
Miss Xu didn't eat much earlier.

627
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,500
Don't you like the dishes?

628
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:46,700
Uhh,

629
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,380
waiter.

630
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,500
Add two more dishes.

631
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,220
No need.

632
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,140
She doesn't like

633
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:52,860
food outside.

634
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,060
Ah,

635
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:56,740
today,

636
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,620
it's my fault.

637
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,020
All this fuss.

638
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,180
Director Jiang,

639
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,420
let's catch up another day

640
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,780
when you have time.

641
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,020
Excuse us.

642
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:07,820
Goodbye.

643
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,180
And you.

644
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,100
Why didn't you tell me?

645
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:23,780
About today,

646
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,660
thank you.

647
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:25,980
If it weren't for you,

648
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,980
I could still be sitting there now.

649
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,420
You were tough in front of me.

650
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,900
Why were you so weak out there?

651
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,500
That's different.

652
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,580
They're Party A.

653
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,260
Am I not your Party A?

654
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,980
You're different.

655
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,540
Drink this.

656
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,460
For your stomach.

657
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,020
Okay.

658
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,260
It is so good.

659
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,740
You're such a good cook.

660
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,060
When I was abroad,

661
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,580
I couldn't get used to the food there.

662
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,820
So I cook myself.

663
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,500
That's how I got better at it.

664
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,260
Indeed,

665
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,180
Talent people are good at everything.

666
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,660
My mom forced me to learn,

667
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,580
and I failed.

668
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,020
You don't have to learn.

669
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,700
You'll do it for the rest of your...

670
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:13,660
Be careful.

671
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,100
I'm fine.

672
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:23,660
By the way,

673
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,300
about your proposal,

674
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,420
I already took care of it.

675
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,220
Our boss knows you were replaced.

676
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,900
All you have to do is wait for news.

677
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,180
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

678
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,780
Don't thank you.

679
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,100
It was yours anyway.

680
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,180
Drink it up.

681
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,300
Okay.

682
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,620
Like

683
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,100
called this morning.

684
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,660
Guess what they say.

685
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,900
Don't be coy about it

686
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,740
The rest of the project

687
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,620
will be ours, too.

688
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,260
So is Xu Mu still in charge?

689
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:10,820
Of course.

690
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,700
Like said Xu did an amazing job.

691
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,500
And this time,
they asked Xu to stay in charge.

692
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,100
They have good taste.

693
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,060
Very good.

694
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:18,700
Mr. Liao,

695
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,180
can I participate in Like's project?

696
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,340
I didn't get the contract last time.

697
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:22,860
It was my fault.

698
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,820
I want to contribute more to the group.

699
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,500
No problem.

700
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:26,780
Isn't it?

701
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,140
Look!

702
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,460
Look at Jingjing's attitude.

703
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,260
What a great work attitude!

704
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,980
Try to learn from her.

705
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,260
Oh, that's great.

706
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,100
Let me tell you something.

707
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,020
At work, never...

708
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,180
Our Mr. Liao is

709
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,540
really simple.

710
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:49,780
[Producer]
Miss Song,

711
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,180
how's the script coming along?

712
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,900
Have you come up with anything?

713
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,620
Very smoothly.

714
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,780
I thought about
my previous relationships.

715
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,660
Now I have endless inspiration.

716
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,500
Rest assured.

717
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,740
It's gonna be so sweet.

718
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,300
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

719
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,340
I just picked him up.

720
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,580
We're almost
at the gate of the community.

721
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:15,860
Okay.

722
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,100
Didi.

723
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:18,700
Didi.

724
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,580
Tata.

725
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,300
Didi.

726
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:32,500
Come.

727
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,220
Come to me.

728
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:34,340
Come on.

729
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,020
Come here!

730
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,300
Don't move.

731
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,180
If you keep pulling,

732
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:40,780
I'll tell your dad.

733
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,460
And he'll give you a lesson.

734
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,900
My dad won't do it.

735
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:46,980
Wait.

736
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:47,980
Stop.

737
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:49,900
Don't.

738
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,340
Stop it.

739
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,740
You tie yourself up.

740
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,180
Oops.

741
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,500
Let go.

742
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,420
Ms...

743
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,460
Who are you?

744
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:03,940
Wrong.

745
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,980
Call me Miss.

746
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,620
Don't cry. Don't cry.

747
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,420
Don't cry.

748
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,220
My boy.

749
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:12,820
Boy.

750
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,420
What happened?

751
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,020
Move.

752
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:16,540
My boy.

753
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,420
What happened?

754
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,300
My boy.

755
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:19,780
Don't cry.

756
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:20,980
What's wrong?

757
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:21,860
Dad,

758
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,340
they bullied me.

759
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:26,700
Shen Yi.

760
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:27,980
You...

761
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,980
You couldn't even pick a kid up right.

762
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,300
What else can you do?

763
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,300
Wait.

764
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,220
It's okay.

765
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:33,820
Stop crying.

766
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,300
Don't cry.

767
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,820
I saw your son
pulled Shen Yi's sweater first.

768
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,700
Miss... Miss Song.

769
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,020
Miss Song.

770
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,140
I don't know

771
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,420
what is the purpose
of you protecting Shen Yi.

772
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:46,500
But...

773
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,540
Isn't that normal for kids to play?

774
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,260
Do you have to argue with a kid?

775
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,260
He's just a kid.

776
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,660
Looks like the rumour was right.

777
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,580
Behind a misbehaved child,
there's a misbehaved parent.

778
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,460
You...

779
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,580
What do you mean?

780
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,180
You...

781
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,540
Who are you calling misbehaved?

782
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,340
Okay.

783
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:10,940
I'm not arguing with you.

784
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:11,500
All right?

785
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,020
This sweater on Shen Yi

786
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,620
is not worth much, is it?

787
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,340
Look,

788
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,340
I'll pay him.

789
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:18,980
All right?

790
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,260
Sixty yuan.

791
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,300
It should be enough.

792
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:30,980
Wait.

793
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,700
No need.

794
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,660
Who do you despise?

795
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,300
Here's two hundred yuan.

796
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,820
For the emotional damage of your kid.

797
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,420
It pisses me off.

798
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,580
What kind of people is he?

799
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,540
It seems no misbehaved child
is innocent.

800
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,340
Is this job that important to you?

801
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,700
Three months without expulsion,

802
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,340
I'll let you use your card again.

803
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,500
Too important.

804
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,540
You're not planning on continuing
working there, are you?

805
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,500
Do they treat you like a colleague?

806
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,740
Picking up the kid on your days off.

807
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,820
They're using you as a babysitter.

808
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,100
It's fine.

809
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,300
It'll be over soon.

810
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,660
In three months,

811
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,700
my father...

812
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,140
If your dad knows you are doing this,

813
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,420
it'll break his heart.

814
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,340
If he knows I'm doing this every day,

815
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,860
maybe he'll look at me differently.

816
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,100
You really are...

817
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,340
You are beyond cure.

818
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:50,900
Shen Yi,

819
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,220
I know for your life,

820
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,860
you need a job.

821
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,100
Or maybe several jobs.

822
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,060
I understand.

823
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,060
But you have to resign tomorrow.

824
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,940
I can help you find a job.

825
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:03,340
No.

826
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,900
But this is where I want to work.

827
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,260
I don't care if they don't pay me.

828
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,300
You...

829
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,140
Forget it.

830
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,300
It's a waste of time talking to you.

831
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,980
Go earn your stupid salary.

832
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,100
What temper is that?

833
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,940
I just don't understand.

834
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,100
Did that company save his life before?

835
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,620
He is just so devoted to the company.

836
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,660
That Zhao was yelling at him.

837
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,220
He didn't even talk back.

838
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,540
You are a freelancer.

839
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,220
You don't know
how hard it is to find a job.

840
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,220
If Shen Yi really fell out with Zhao

841
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:43,980
and got fired,

842
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,740
how do you expect him to live?

843
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,140
Well, I can't stand
to see people being bullied.

844
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,260
You know how he gets bullied.

845
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,780
Why did you say that about him?

846
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,260
I didn't mean to do it.

847
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,900
By the way,

848
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,500
Shen Yi is a grownup.

849
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,660
He won't be that vulnerable, will he?

850
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,300
Song Niannian.

851
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,540
I can't talk to you right now.

852
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,380
I have work to do.

853
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:15,270
[Shen Yi]

854
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:28,780
