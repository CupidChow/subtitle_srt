that Zhou now

However, after the last time,

53
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,660
I know he definitely doesn't prefer
someone like you.

with Jiang Zhou soon.

63
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,660
I thought it was you.

64
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,180
I'm afraid that I confuse you
with someone else.

65
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,020
You used someone else's ticket
to get in as well, didn't you?

66
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,020
Ticket?

67
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,300
It took me

68
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,740
a long time

69
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,060

70
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,340
Here today,

71
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,900
if we can get anyone
to sign contracts with us,

72
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,780
it'll be worth a whole year's salary.

73
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,580
We went on a blind date before.

74
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:26,780
So,

75
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,260
later,

76
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,380
I will introduce some big shots to you.

00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,180
Jiang Zhou from Like,

78
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:32,940
Director Jiang.

79
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,860
You've probably heard of him.

80
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,500
He just came back to China.

81
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,460
Later when this is over,

82
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,540
I can invite him to stay.

83
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,300
Let's have a few more drinks.

84
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,820
Don't bother.

85
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,140
As for such a big shot,

86
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,860
I suggest you keep it for yourself.

87
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,380
My boyfriend is looking for me.

88
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:51,860
I need to go.

89
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,140
Boyfriend?

90
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,900
Who's your boyfriend?

91
00:04:59,180 --> 00:04:59,900
Jiang Zhou.

92
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,180
You didn't see his face.

93
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,500
It felt so good.

94
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,380
I told you
I'm a good judge of character.

95
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,980
I knew it when I saw it.

96
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,580
Xie Shi can't be an ordinary person.

97
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,700
He's a high-quality man.

98
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,780
But you said he was weak
in the cafe before.

99
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,060
I was worried about you then.

100
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,260
Concern leads to confusion.

101
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,300
I was wrong.

102
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,020
I need to go.

103
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,980
Still a little nervous.

104
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:46,900
Hello?

105
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,420
Hello.

106
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,660
I'm Xu Mu's friend.

107
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,180
Earlier,

108
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,780
I saw you guys talking.

109
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,700
Can I borrow you for a few minutes?

110
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:04,740
Sure.

111
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,660
So you are Xu Mu.

112
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,060
Oh my.

113
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,820
You're skinny.

114
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,020
Have you been eating well?

115
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,260
Or maybe working with Shi

116
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,260
is too hard?

117
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,820
He keeps making you work late,
doesn't he?

118
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,460
If Xi hadn't told me he was in love,

119
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,220
he'd still be hiding it from me.

120
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,660
Am I that scary?

121
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,220
Will I be mean to her or anything?

122
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,500
If I'm being honest, he is not

123
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,220
very likable.

124
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,780
All these years,

125
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,940
he has never been close to any girl.

126
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,100
There is just one...

127
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,340
Just one boy named Shen.

128
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,540
I always thought these two were...

129
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,020
Auntie.

130
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,180
I can hear you.

131
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,180
Auntie.

132
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,540
What are you talking about?

133
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,220
I was just talking about you.

134
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,860
I believe you have met Xu Mu.

135
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,660
Mu,

136
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,980
it's been a while.

137
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,340
Zhou,

138
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,820
You and Mu

139
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,020
have been secretly dating
for over a year.

140
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,740
It must be very sweet.

141
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:08,820
You two

142
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,380
have been dating for so long.

143
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,420
Was it
a long-distance relationship before?

144
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,900
I'm curious. Between you two,

145
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,220
who fell in love first?

146
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,660
It's me.

147
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,060
A girl who can make
Jiang Zhou fall in love.

148
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,060
You are special.

149
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,100
Not really.

150
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,420
However,

151
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,260
I just ran into a friend
I haven't seen in a while.

152
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,300
He knows you, too.

153
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,380
He doesn't really know you.

154
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,340
You only met once.

155
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,820
I think it was on a blind date
last month.

156
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,620
Blind date?

157
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,420
I'm sorry,

158
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,180
Mu.

159
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,220
Sometimes words just slip out of me.

160
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,460
Though,

161
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,180
a month ago,

162
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,940
at that time,

163
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,980
Zhou

164
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,620
just came back to China.

165
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,100
Hello, Miss Xu.

166
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,100
We meet again.

167
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,500
How do you do?

168
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,340
And this is...

169
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,980
It was my fault.

170
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,740
Back then,

171
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,020
I failed to give Xu Mu
enough sense of security.

172
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,380
We did spend some time apart.

173
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,100
Probably it was during that time,

174
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,460
you and Xu Mu met.

175
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,820
I was too busy with work,

176
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,220
often ignoring Xu Mu's feelings.

177
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,900
In fact, this time I came back

178
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,700
to get back into Xu Mu's life.

179
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,660
That's right.

180
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,580
That's what men are supposed to do.

181
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,820
How did you two meet each other?

182
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,700
We were high school classmates.

183
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,700
Actually,

184
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,220
the first moment I saw her,

185
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,580
I fell in love with her.

186
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,580
I just never had a chance to tell her.

187
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,380
Right.

188
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,420
You transferred to another school
in high school.

189
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,100
But he had to do it at the time.

190
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,700
Now that the two of you
are back together,

191
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,540
I am so happy for you.

192
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,100
You two must cherish each other.

193
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,700
It's a nice view out here.

194
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,380
It wasn't such a big deal
meeting your families.

195
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,820
Your aunt is nothing like you.

196
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,380
She looks warm and gentle.

197
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,260
Very easy to get along with.

198
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,580
That's to you.

199
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,660
In the eyes of others,

200
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,140
my aunt is a decisive
and independent woman.

201
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,780
Then I guess she likes me
because of you.

202
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,060
Have you lived with your aunt
since you were little?

203
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:06,460
No.

204
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,860
She was often abroad.

205
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,100
She took me with her
when I was in high school.

206
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,460
Oh, right.

207
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,220
So you went abroad with her
when you left our high school?

208
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,340
Yeah.

209
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,140
What about your parents?

210
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,100
Also abroad?

211
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,260
No.

212
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,500
My mom died around that time.

213
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:31,820
It's fine.

214
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,660
It was a long time ago.

215
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,580
Therefore,

216
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,500
you changed your name at that time too.

217
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:41,580
Yes.

218
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,380
I thought

219
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,740
people who live together
would become more and more alike.

220
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,740
You lived with your aunt for so long.

221
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,780
Why is your temper still so...

222
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,740
Special.

223
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,940
You're the director.

224
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,220
Of course, you have a special temper.

225
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,500
Hello,

226
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,300
mom?

227
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,540
Mu,

228
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,620
why didn't you tell me
about your relationship?

229
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,300
I only knew it after someone else
showed me your posts online.

230
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,940
Did you block me?

231
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:18,780
No.

232
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,580
How dare I?

233
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,260
My relationship is complicated.

234
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,260
It's hard to explain now.

235
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,420
What's so hard to explain?

236
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,940
Just bring him back.

237
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,500
Your dad and I want to see him.

238
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,260
If you're not dating anyone,
go on another blind date tomorrow.

239
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,180
Let me tell you something.

240
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,220
Ms. Li from last time
introduced another boy to us.

241
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,060
Mom,

242
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,220
I am now in a relationship.

243
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,820
You could have just said so.

244
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:41,900
I am...

245
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,140
Mom,

246
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:42,780
I'm in a meeting.

247
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,340
I must go.

248
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,500
Let's go.

249
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,060
Xie Shi?

250
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,260
I suddenly thought of a plan

251
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,100
which could solve your problem.

252
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,340
What is it?

253
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,780
I want to be promoted to a higher office
in the company.

254
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,860
But for promotions
among senior management,

255
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,660
abilities are not
the only thing considered.

256
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,940
Stability and dependence
are also considered.

257
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,820
People highly dependent on work

258
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,940
are usually the ones
who are in committed relationships.

259
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,620
I'm very busy at work.

260
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,300
I have no time to meet people

261
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,340
and start a new relationship.

262
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,500
Since you don't want
to go on blind dates,

263
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,260
we share the same needs.

264
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,900
Why don't we sign
a relationship contract

265
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,660
once and for all?

266
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,660
My mom's probably going
to check up on us through video calls.

267
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,420
Then,

268
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,140
I will need you to play along with me.

269
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,780
Don't let her find anything.

270
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,740
Of course.

271
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,140
Oh,

272
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:51,860
by the way,

273
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,700
I need to add another clause
to the contract.

274
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:54,940
During the contract,

275
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,460
if one of us has a crush,

276
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,460
the contract ends.

277
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,540
Okay.

278
00:12:59,340 --> 00:12:59,940
That's it then.

279
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,820
One of you has a crush.

280
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,180
The contract ends.

281
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,020
That is pretty special.

282
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,140
But it sounds good.

283
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,660
Because only in this way,

284
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,300
can we terminate the contract

285
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,620
and solve our problems.

286
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,220
When the contract ends,

287
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,020
I won't need to worry
about dealing with my parents.

288
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,980
The chairman knows
you've nailed the new project.

289
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,580
He gives you back your car

290
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,580
as a reward.

291
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,700
Thanks, Zhang.

292
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,900
Your dad asked me to warn you

293
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,340
not to drive it when you go to work.

294
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,820
You can drive it when you go out.

295
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,180
I got it.

296
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,460
I'm in a good mood today.

297
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,340
Let's go. I'll take you for a ride.

298
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,260
No, no, no.

299
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,780
The chairman is waiting for me
at the office.

300
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,260
Let me give you a ride.

301
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,020
Isn't it faster?

302
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:56,500
Come on.

303
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,500
Come on, you're welcome.

304
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,260
Hey.

305
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,700
Isn't that Shen Yi?

306
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,020
Does Shen Yi also work
as a designated driver?

307
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,860
He seems

308
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,180
to be really in need of money.

309
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,780
Yeah.

310
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,540
Wait.

311
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,180
Don't you need an assistant?

312
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,820
I came to see you today

313
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,860
to ask you

314
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,660
if you'd like to be
my temporary assistant.

315
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,700
In terms of salary,

316
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,380
you can rest assured.

317
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,180
Above the average.

318
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,060
However,

319
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,740
while working as my assistant,

320
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,140
you can't take on other work.

321
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,340
For example,

322
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,380
being a designated driver?

323
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:46,660
Designated driver?

324
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:47,780
Yes.

325
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,460
About your loss of money,

326
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,300
I'll make it up to you in another way.

327
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,420
Your allowance will be used

328
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,340
on your meals.

329
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,980
I asked around.

330
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,340
For writers like me,

331
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,100
that's what they pay their assistants.

332
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,940
You must have been lied to.

333
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,140
It's not that expensive.

334
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,620
You just believed what people said?

335
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,020
Song Niannian,

336
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,220
when did you get so stupid?

337
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,220
You are stupid.

338
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,500
But it's okay.

339
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:22,820
Today,

340
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,580
I'm in a good mood.

341
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,100
Plus you said you'd give me the project.

342
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,260
I'll be your temporary assistant.

343
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,820
For free.

344
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,580
Shen Yi agreed
to be my temporary assistant

345
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,500
without salary.

346
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,660
He also paid the bill
at the cafe last night.

347
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,300
Shen Yi is so poor.

348
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,260
Yet he still refuses my money.

349
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,500
Now I feel

350
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,460
I don't hate him that much.

351
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,900
It's only been a few days.

352
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,940
You're saying good things
about Shen Yi now.

353
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,860
That's not a compliment.

354
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,980
I was just making
an objective assessment.

355
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:02,860
Hey.

356
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,580
Why are you not busy at all today?

357
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,060
How do you have time
to call me during office hours?

358
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,100
I'm out in the field.

359
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,020
Heading back to the office now.

360
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,700
[Shen Yi]
Reimbursement, please.

361
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,100
34.50 yuan in total.

362
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,700
[Yizhou Cafe. Total, 34.5]

363
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,020
Shen Yi.

364
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:28,740
Hello,

365
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:29,900
Niannian?

366
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,660
Where did she go so suddenly?

367
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,020
Hello, mom, what's wrong?

368
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,340
You're dating someone now.

369
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,740
Where's he?

370
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,780
I haven't met him yet.

371
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,700
You didn't lie to me, did you?

372
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,700
How could I lie to you?

373
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,660
He's sitting right next to me right now.

374
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,500
Then put him on the phone.

375
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,820
I'll talk to him.

376
00:16:59,220 --> 00:16:59,660
He...

377
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,380
He can't talk now.

378
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,060
He went...

379
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,660
He went to the bathroom.

380
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,780
Why is he either using the bathroom

381
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,180
or working every time I call you?

382
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:08,900
No way.

383
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,500
When he's done using the bathroom,

384
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,780
ask him to call me back.

385
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,140
Hello?

386
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,140
Hello mom?

387
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:13,660
Mom?

388
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,940
Bad reception here.

389
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,620
I'm hanging up the phone.

390
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,420
Mom...

391
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:19,980
Sir, turn around.

392
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,060
Okay.

393
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,860
Why not answer the phone?

394
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:24,460
Hello.

395
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,820
I'm going to Like on the eighth floor.

396
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,900
Do you have an appointment?

397
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,260
Appointment?

398
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:28,580
Yes.

399
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,500
Don't bother, thank you.

400
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,420
This is an emergency.

401
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,620
[Mom]

402
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,580
Mom,

403
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:47,700
this is Xie Shi.

404
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,180
Hello, madam.

405
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,740
Look, we're together.

406
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,660
Now we've finished the video call.

407
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,620
I guess she believes us now.

408
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,620
But if my mom checks on us again,

409
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,540
I'll send her these videos.

410
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,740
I believe this is called

411
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,660
videos taken by the girlfriend.

412
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,860
My mom won't doubt me then.

413
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,340
That's pretty smart

414
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,700
to make preparations in advance.

415
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,140
I have ways to deal with my mother.

416
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,820
I'm glad I made it this time.

417
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,780
Or she will find out.

418
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:39,740
Here we are.

419
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,340
So soon?

420
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,780
Thank you, Director Jiang.

421
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:48,740
Goodbye.

422
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,540
Drive home safely.

423
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,620
Goodbye.

424
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,580
Who are you guys?

425
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,260
Why did you get into my room?

426
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,660
We were drinking this afternoon.

427
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,900
They drank too much.

428
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:52,820
I guess

429
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,780
they went into the wrong room.

430
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,180
You should have locked the door.

431
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,300
Your friends got into my room
without my permission

432
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,020
and messed up my room.

433
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,940
Now you mean it's my fault?

434
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,260
You're being unreasonable.

435
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,580
You can still live there.

436
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,980
Don't be dramatic.

437
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,500
We agreed at the beginning.

438
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,220
No sleepovers.

439
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,540
You've done it many times before.

440
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,740
I decided to let it go.

441
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,580
But you've really gone too far
this time.

442
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,220
Let me grab my bag.

443
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:24,740
Mom?

444
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,860
What are you doing here?

445
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,180
I thought I'd check on you and Xie.

446
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,180
Here, look.

447
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,740
I got you something to eat.

448
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,700
Get Xie out later.

449
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:34,980
Oh.

450
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,700
What are you guys doing standing here?

451
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,700
Going out?

452
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,140
It's just a trifle matter.

453
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,460
You even called your mother?

454
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,460
It's just we messed up your room.

455
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,820
I'll pay you.

456
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,300
Stop it now.

457
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,060
Why do you talk like that?

458
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,020
You're the one
who made a mess of her room.

459
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,700
How did your parents teach you?

460
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,020
Old woman.

461
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,340
How old am I?

462
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,380
What parents?

463
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,060
You thought I was Xu Mu?

464
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,180
Your whole family

465
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,500
is ridiculous.

466
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,460
Who are you calling ridiculous?

467
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,060
My daughter is nice.

468
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:03,660
But I tell you.

469
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,740
Don't take me as a weak person.

470
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,460
As a kid, when you did something wrong,

471
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,940
didn't your parents
teach you to apologize?

472
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,660
Mom, mom.

473
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,820
Don't be mad.

474
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,340
Stay out of it.

475
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,620
I got this. I got this.

476
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,500
You guys are unbelievable.

477
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,580
As a girl,

478
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,140
look at what you did to this house.

479
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,300
It's like a pigsty.

480
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:17,620
Hello?

481
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,380
You dropped your earphones in my car.

482
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:19,980
Oh.

483
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,620
Sorry.

484
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,420
What's going on over there?

485
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,420
Oh, it's fine.

486
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,020
Maybe you can...

487
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,860
I'll send it up for you.

488
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,220
You're hopeless.

489
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,780
You thought you could scare me?

490
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,620
I'm tired of talking to you.

491
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,540
Move.

492
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,140
Don't go.

493
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,020
You haven't apologized yet.

494
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,380
You are so annoying.

495
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,460
Ah.

496
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,420
Who are you?

497
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,780
I'm Xu Mu's boyfriend.

498
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,820
Talk to me if there's a problem.

499
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,460
Well.

500
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,780
Look at you.

501
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,420
You're not only smart

502
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,740
but also good-looking.

503
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,820
You stood in front of us just now.

504
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,460
I should have taken a picture
for Xu Mu's dad

505
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,300
to show him.

506
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,060
Oh, good boy.

507
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,300
I'm growing fonder of you.

508
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,780
You look so much better
than in the video.

509
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:19,660
Mom,

510
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,780
you talked so much.

511
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,700
Are you thirsty?

512
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:24,980
I'll get you some water.

513
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,660
Well.

514
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,780
Xie is

515
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,340
such a good boy.

516
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:34,900
And you.

517
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,940
Why didn't you tell me about your place?

518
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,940
If Xie hadn't arrived in time,

519
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,860
we might have been bullied

520
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,580
and might be looking

521
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,220
for a place to stay with our stuff.

522
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,980
Mom.

523
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,620
I didn't want you to worry.

524
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,300
Moreover,

525
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,780
my rent is due this month.

526
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,740
I'll find a new place to stay.

527
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,180
Will you look for roommates?

528
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,100
If you meet someone like that again,

529
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,380
what do you do?

530
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,900
Won't you be bullied then?

531
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,060
If you ask me,

532
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,140
if you want to share an apartment,

533
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,740
you need someone like Xie.

534
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,140
Otherwise, I will be worried.

535
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,340
Xie,

536
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,900
what do you think?

537
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:10,900
True.

538
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,700
You have to choose your roommate wisely.

539
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,260
I know.

540
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,300
It's already late
and you're still working?

541
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,220
Thank you.

542
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,340
There's something
I haven't finished yet.

543
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:33,820
Is your mom asleep?

544
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,100
Yeah.

545
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,020
About what happened tonight,

546
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,500
thank you so much.

547
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:40,860
And...

548
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,140
My mom usually goes to bed early.

549
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,580
She has to go to sleep now.

550
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,260
Sorry to trouble you.

551
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:46,940
No need to thank me

552
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:47,980
or feel sorry.

553
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,140
Since she is here,

554
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,260
just spend some time with her.

555
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,020
This homestay is so beautiful.

556
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,100
[Seaside homestay project renderings]

557
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:01,740
Be more specific.

558
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,780
You can also give me some advice.

559
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,500
From the perspective
of a non-professional tourist,

560
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,100
this is a house that many people
would look forward to.

561
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,540
There are two rooms on each floor.

562
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,460
Large area.

563
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,300
Built by the sea.

564
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,780
Away from the crowd.

565
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,140
In addition,

566
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,300
a large terrace

567
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,260
and

568
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,980
a luxury pool.

569
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,660
As for the architectural design,

570
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,100
this is also a very attractive work.

571
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,580
However?

572
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,540
However,

573
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,620
a lot of us can't afford
a place like this.

574
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,940
Our reason for escaping
from urban life is simple.

575
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,540
To relax.

576
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,260
Maybe it's a group of people
sitting around talking.

577
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,860
Or maybe

578
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,340
it's a walk by the sea

579
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,980
and a safe home at night.

580
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,220
I suppose

581
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,340
the purpose of Like is

582
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,980
that the guests can sincerely like

583
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,820
this place
where they stay for a short time.

584
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,740
Why are you looking at me like that?

585
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,740
I wonder why Shangxin only

586
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,540
had you take the lead now?

587
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,500
If you weren't trying to embarrass me

588
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,180
by putting me in charge of the homestay,

589
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,580
I guess

590
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,220
I still don't have the chance now.

591
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,740
That wasn't on purpose.

592
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,780

601

But to find the right house
and the right roommate

602
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,020
is harder than finding a job.

Because you like Magic Cubes?

728
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,060
Do you know Animal Architects?

729
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,380
There's a nonprofit organization
in Los Angeles

730

called Animal Architects.

00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,500

740
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,700
Yes.

741

742
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,700

00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,580

It's a stray cat?

Yes.

752
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,420
