Song Niannian,

5
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,700
you came specially

6
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:55,940
to apologise?

7
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,700
If something happens to him,

8
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,300
the police will also come to me.

00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,740
Okay, that's it.

10
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,940
Song Niannian, remember this.

11
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,020
You're just checking in
to make sure he's okay.

12
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,180
Not to apologise.

13
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,260
Hello, Miss.

14
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:29,700
Sorry,

15
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,820

Song Niannian?

19
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,980
This is my friend.

20
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,020
You can get off work now.

21
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,900
You wanted to see me?

22
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,580
No.

23
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,780
I was passing by.

24
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,260
So I stopped by

25
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,100
to see if Xu Mu was here.

26
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,340
I couldn't get in touch with you.

27
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,980
I charged it and forgot to turn it on.

28
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,620
Why did you call me instead of Xu Mu?

29
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,220
So Xu Mu's not here.

30
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,140
Well, I'll get going.

31
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,500

32
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,460
let me buy you a drink.

33
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,620
What would you like to drink?

34
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:24,460
Here.

35
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,300
Try it.

36
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,300
This isn't on your tab, is it?

37
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,460
I'll pay for it myself later.

38
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:38,940
Song Niannian,

39
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,460
why are you acting so weird today?

40
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,140
Do you have something to say

41
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,820
to me?

42
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,340
I'm not here to apologise.

43
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,420
In fact, I thought about it.

44
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,460
It was my fault, too.

45
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,860
I haven't even thanked you yet.

46
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,860
It's okay. It's okay.

47
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,580
I said that today for your own good.

48

135
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,620
I wasn't even allowed in.

136
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,740
What will you do there?

137
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,420

138
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,740
to our high school's computer room.

139
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,180
I need to go and sign it today.

00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,940

we'll get going then.

00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,860

00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,180
Welcome back.

157
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:19,700
Okay.

158
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,340
The dean doesn't

159
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,140
seem as intimidating as before.

160
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,100
Did Mr. Sun gain weight?

161
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,700
He seems kind of nice now.

162
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,660
I don't think
he was intimidating back then.

163
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,620
For you good students, maybe.

164
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,660
For us,

165
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,420
he was constant pressure,

166
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,380
toughness,

167
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:40,900
and pain.

169
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,340
Where?

170
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,300

171

Do you remember that place?

173
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,100
You used to catch me for being late.

174
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,100
I couldn't be late at all.

175
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:57,620
You needn't

176
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,780
remember such things so clearly.

177
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:02,940

learn functions then.

184
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,220
There was a test

185

where you ranked last in math.

186

187
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,980

00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,260
I am so glad

195
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,620
you could come back.

196
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,060
I remember that year

197
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,260
after you transferred out of school,

198
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,180
we all used you as a role model

199
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
and talked about you in class for years.

200
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,220
I just came back due to a job transfer.

201
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,580
Sorry, I didn't visit you earlier.

202
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,060
It's fine.

203
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,220
Seeing you two today

204
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,780
makes me so happy.

205
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,420
When are you going to get married?

206
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,460
I'm waiting for your wedding.

207
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,180
I remember this all the time.

208
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,900
Sir, how did you know?

209
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,380
Your posts are

210
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,500
no secret to us in the office.

211
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,900
Xu Mu,

212
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,100
you're lucky.

213
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,300
Finding Xu Mu is

214
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,900
my good luck, actually.

215
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,500
Right.

216
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,060
Back then,

217
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,820
you were quite dull in class.

218
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,580
Xu Mu happens

219
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,580
to be very outgoing.

220
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,740
You two complement each other.

221
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,620
Complementation.

222
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,500
It's getting late.

223
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,260
I

224
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,380
need to go to class now.

225
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,500
I'll leave you two

226
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,580
to walk around the campus.

227
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,340
I will give you the invitation
in person.

228
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,900
Let's have a good drink then.

229
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,060
Okay.

230
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:41,700
See you.

231
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:45,980
Oh no.

232
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,820
My reputation at school
is ruined as well.

233
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:49,900
Let's go.

234
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,180
Let's see the classroom.

235
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,700
I can't believe after so many years,

236
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,900
the tables and chairs
didn't change at all.

237
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,820
Let's go inside and have a look.

238
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,020
I'll check if the door's open.

239
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,140
It's a horrible spot to look at now.

240
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,300
Teachers will see everything clearly.

241
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,940
Other spots are no different.

242
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,660
There's a big difference.

243
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,580
Sitting close to teachers is one thing.

244
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,180
I was really stressed out
sitting next to you.

245
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,180
You don't even know what I went through.

246
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,260
For example?

247
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,500
For example,

248
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,700
as soon as I leave my seat after class,

249
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,180
my spot will be taken immediately.

250
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,020
Tell me more about this question.

251
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,060
Ask someone else
if you don't understand.

252
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,180
Please tell me more.

253
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,140
I will understand soon.

254
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,500
Dear classmates,

255
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,060
class is about to begin.

256
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,260
You may not want to go back,

257
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,580
but I'd like to get back to my seat.

258
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,660
Let's go.

259
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,620
My legs are numb from standing there.

260
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,620
Exercise books collected
in each class were

261
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,940
always piled up on my desk.

262
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,580
Because they didn't want
to pile them on yours.

263
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,580
Don't you know
the podium is right in front?

264
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,260
I'd get yelled at all the time
for blocking the blackboard.

265
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:31,980
Xu Mu,

266
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:32,900
lower your head.

267
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,180
You're blocking the blackboard.

268
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,620
I can't read

269
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,580
the bottom line, either.

270
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,060
Please move aside.

271
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,900
Isn't Xie Shi in front of you?

272
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,220
He's too tall.

273
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,460
It's better if you lower your head.

274
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,460
That's why

275
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,060
people by the side of the legendary ones

276
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,220
constantly have a hard time.

277
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,660
I mean physically by the side of
the legendary ones.

278
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,300
I didn't say anything.

279
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,540
By the way

280
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,700
Your spot here is special.

281
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,140
Right after you left,

282
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,340
another legendary person came.

283
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,180
He sat right where you are now.

284
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,220
A boy?

285
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:19,500
Yeah.

286
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,460
His temper was

287
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,380
completely different from yours.

288
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,860
His appearance was

289
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,700
as good as yours.

290
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,700
So,

291
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,260
you sat beside him, too?

292
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,420
How is that possible?

293
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,220
You think everyone gets
to sit in the front row?

294
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,220
Without your halo,

295
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,700
I went to sit in the back.

296
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,780
That's what I was talking
to you about the other day.

297
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,740
It's really interesting.

298
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:45,980
What are you looking at?

299
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,380
The dance looks ordinary.

300
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,420
Nice clothes though.

301
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,060
Song Niannian also has one.

302
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,540
I think this dress

303
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,620
should look good on most girls.

304
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,740
Don't you think?

305
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,420
Yeah, yeah.

306
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:00,940
Wait, what's wrong?

307
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,500
Let's not watch it then.

308
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,460
Let's go to the movies.

309
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,300
Recently,

310
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,380
there's a movie about AI.

311
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,580
I heard it was pretty good.

312
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,300
I watched it. Just so-so.

313
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,100
Not even as good
as Song Niannian's novel.

314
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,860
And its end sucks.

315
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,700
It was all a dream after all.

316
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:14,900
I can forgive the dream thing.

317
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,060
But why add romance
to a science fiction movie?

318
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,420
No movies then.

319
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,220
There's a great
new creative restaurant nearby.

320
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,940
The food sucks.

321
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,780
Song Niannian ate
and cursed for three days.

322
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,180
It's a total fraud.

323
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,940
And the ingredients aren't fresh.

324
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,460
Hey, I'll recommend one for you.

325
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,740
There's a Cantonese restaurant nearby.

326
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,540
Song Niannian had three bowls of soup.

327
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,060
When you're there, just order...

328
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,220
Why am I talking so much today?

329
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,940
Is it because of Song...

330
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,180
It must be
because I spent too much time with her.

331
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:51,980
So tired.

332
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,860
Let's not cook

333
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,540
tonight.

334
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,060
Let's order take-out.

335
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:55,740
What do you want to eat?

336
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,260
Whatever you order for me.

337
00:14:59,300 --> 00:14:59,620
Thank you.

338
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,420
What are you doing here?

339
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,660
No water on the block of the café.

340
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,020
I came to spend the night here.

341
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,820
I hope I'm not
interrupting the two of you.

342
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,420
It's... It's fine.

343
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:24,940
Ordering take-out?

344
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,140
I haven't eaten either.

345
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:27,940
I'm starving.

346
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,380
Let me recommend a shop to you.

347
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:29,940
Particularly delicious.

348
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,700
It's lobster rice.

349
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,620
So tasty.

350
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,300
Let me order it.

351
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,340
Smells great.

352
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,620
Come on, eat.

353
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,380
What do you

354
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,620
usually like to watch at dinner?

355
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,020
TV shows?

356
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,020
Sure.

357
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,580
TV shows, it is.

358
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,060
Okay.

359
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,180
Uhh...

360
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,900
I'll find you a hotel nearby
after dinner.

361
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:56,820
Yes.

362
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,300
It's a new five-star one.

363
00:15:59,180 --> 00:15:59,740
No need.

364
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,660
We are friends.

365
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,820
Why spend money unnecessarily?

366
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:02,460
It's okay.

367
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,540
Comfort is the most important thing.

368
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,740
The fact is
that we don't have any extra rooms.

369
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,940
If you sleep on the couch...

370
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,460
I'll sleep in the guest room.

371
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,020
You two can sleep in the master bedroom.

372
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,580
Don't worry.

373
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,660
I sleep like a baby.

374
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,780
I won't hear anything.

375
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,900
I hope you don't hate me.

376
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,780
No. No.

377
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,020
That's good.

378
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,260
You scared me.

379
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:38,860
Come and eat.

380
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,260
It'll get cold.

381
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:39,780
You enjoy.

382
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,260
What do we do?

383
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,900
Should we just tell Shen Yi directly

384
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,580
that we aren't real?

385
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,020
He had a nickname when he was at school.

386
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:52,940
Loudspeaker Shen.

387
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,300
I got it.

388
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,140
Niannian, Niannian.

389
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:02,940
Emergency.

390
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,820
Song Niannian?

391
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,340
What are you doing here?

392
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,180
Your water's off, too?

393
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,340
I suggest you turn the water
in your head off first.

394
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,340
I'm here to see Mu for...

395
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,940
for business.

396
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,420
Right.

397
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,620
Niannian needs help with the script.

398
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,900
We need to discuss it.

399
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:28,820
Right.

400

Don't you have a love scene to write?

401
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,980
Isn't this a case in point?

402
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,980
Xie Shi is so dull.

403
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,540
I'm sure their relationship is...

404
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,180
It's not sweet.

405
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,340
Why don't you just ask?

406
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,900
Where did you go

407
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:44,740
for your first date?

408
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:46,780
- The company.
- The school.

409
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,100
Come on.

410
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,620
We weren't

411
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,060
officially a couple then.

412
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,340
They asked about our first date.

413
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,820
So when was the first time

414
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,140
you two

415
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,780
kissed?

416
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,580
The day we started our relationship,

417
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,340
before Xu Mu posted it online.

418
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,380
No way.

419
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,420
There's something else
I didn't remember that day?

420
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,300
It was going so fast?

421
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,300
Song Niannian,

422
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,460

423
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,860
Aren't you here looking for inspiration?

424
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,220
I read it on the Internet.

425
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,860
By the way couples hold hands,

426
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,780
you can tell their emotional state.

427
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,220
With your current financial base,

428
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:36,980
you're not fit to watch it.

429
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,900
How do you two usually hold hands?

430
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:39,940
Let me take a look.

431
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,420
Seriously?

432
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,700
This means

433
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,460
the male here is very possessive.

434
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,380
Shen Yi!

435
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,020
It just occurred to me.

436
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,620
I came to see you today actually.

437
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,300
There's a place
I've always wanted to take you.

438
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,580
Where?

439
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,380
You'll find out when you see it.

440
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:20,900
Where to?

441
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:21,660
Let's go.

442
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,780

Finally gone.

445

466

do you have anything to eat?

What's she keeping these for?

490

A grownup girl

491

492
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,260
However busy she is,
she can't eat these.

493

How busy does she have to be to forget?

These things every day.

495
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,300
Isn't she afraid of stomachache?

496
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,540
Is she a child,

What am I doing?

499

Am I feeling sorry for Song Niannian?
