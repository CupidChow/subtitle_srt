[Episode 2]

3
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:49,780
Wait for me.

4
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,420
I'll change the medicine.

5
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,220
Why?

6
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,660
I was too anxious to check it.

7
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,740
Patients with allergies
should use it with caution.

8
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:56,820
When I was in high school,

9
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,580
I fainted due to allergies.

10
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,020
It was serious.

11
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,460
I guess I can't take it.

12
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,100
I'll change it.

13
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,020
Don't go.

14
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,620
Patients with allergies

15
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,940
refer to those people

16
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,620
who easily have an allergic reaction.

17
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,540
You fainted in high school

18
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,180
simply because
you were allergic to peanuts.

19
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,820
You wouldn't have fainted

20
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,260
if you hadn't eaten too many.

21
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,020
Hey, you...

22
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,780
No more pretending, huh?

23
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,260
Had enough fun, Director Jiang?

24
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,740
In the barbecue restaurant,

25
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,580
you said you couldn't recognize me.

26
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,820
Oh, Xie Shi.

27
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,540
This is ancient history.

28
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,780
I don't even remember
what he looks like.

29
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,620
Even if he stands in front of me,
I may not recognize him.

30
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,980
I just blurted it out.

31
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,180
Just because of that,

32
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,620
you fooled me for a couple of days.

33
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,020
How could you be so revengeful?

34
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,220
It depends.

35
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,420
You're as sharp-tongued as before.

36
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,380
You haven't changed at all.

37
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,780
Go have dinner

38
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,700
before you take the medicine.

39
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,620
I won't.

40
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,220
Drive me home.

41
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,100
Won't you be hungry?

42
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,100
I won't.

43
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:00,980
Not at all.

44
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,460
Wait here.

45
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,860
I'll bring my car around.

47
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,900
XY is 0.

48
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,060
X or Y should be 0.

49
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,100
We shared a desk for a long time

50
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,940
and I looked at your face
a million times.

51
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,700
I should have recognized you
at first sight

52
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,100
so that you couldn't fool me.

53
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,340
Good for you.

54
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,140
You reflect on yourself.

55
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,220
You have a good appetite.

56
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,700
You didn't have that in high school.

57
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,700
You got good sleep, though.

58
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,860
In high school,

59
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,740
I studied, ate, and slept every day.

60
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,620
But now, I'm busy working.

61
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,420
And my clients are tough.

62
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,340
Oh, no.

63
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,060
I don't mean you.

64
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,660
I mean someone else.

65
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:30,700
Hey.

66
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,780
Reach out when you can't argue?

67
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,140
Try to hurt your deskmate?

68
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:44,620
Hey.

69
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,980
Remember to tell Mr. Liao

70
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,940
that I can work.

71
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,780
I can take care of the project, too.

72
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:50,980
No need.

73
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,300
Why?

74
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,260
Because I tricked you.

75
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,740
What a man!

76
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,340
I'll go pay the bill.

77
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,020
I caught a cold during work.

78
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,540
Instead of comforting me,

79
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,060
Mr. Liao made me buy Xie Shi a present.

80
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,620
It doesn't make sense at all.

81
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,660
With this excuse,

82
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,180
you'll give the client a present

83
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,420
to bond with him.

84
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:17,780
Why do I feel

85
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,380
you're like a princess
to be married for politics?

86
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:20,900
Don't make fun of me.

87
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,900
Think about what present I should buy.

88
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,020
Let me think about it.

89
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,820
Belt.

90
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,820
Lighter.

91
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,140
In the worst case,

92
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,060
give him an Ultraman

93
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,380
and ask him if he believes in light.

94
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,060
Song Niannian.

95
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,820
Just kidding.

96
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,420
Oh.

97
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,460
What about a tie?

98
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,700
The day you met him,

99
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,780
he was wearing a suit, right?

100
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,780
It goes well with his suit.

101
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,620
Tie...

102
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,620
Is it appropriate?

103
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,140
Will it be too intimate?

104
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,060
It's not the underwear

105
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,180
and it has no special meaning.

106
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,100
Why is it inappropriate?

107
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,620
Let's go.

108
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:00,940
Excuse me.

109
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,700
Which tie is good

110
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,060
for a man about 27 or 28 years old?

111
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,940
Are you picking one for your boyfriend?

112
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,740
Umm, no.

113
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,220
So, your future boyfriend?

114
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,140
No, no.

115
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,100
Just my client.

116
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,220
Don't say that.

117
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,500
It's just a couple thing.

118
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,460
Even if you ask him
to order you as a client,

119
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,620
he would not dare.

120
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,340
Am I right?

121
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,220
Yes.

122
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,500
How about you start to recommend?

123
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,140
OK. Let me see.

124
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,220
What about this one?

125
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,420
OK.

126
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,340
I'll take this.

127
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:34,980
Pack it.

128
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,460
OK.

129
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,260
Write a card for me.

130
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:37,900
Just write,

131
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,580
"To Jiang Zhou".

132
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:39,460
OK.

133
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,100
Thank you.

134
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:40,700
You're welcome.

135
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,420
Zhou.

136
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,940
It's really you.

137
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,460
I thought I got the wrong guy.

138
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,020
Chen Xi?

139
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,420
Yes, it's me.

140
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,900
Zhou,

141
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,740
I just came back a few days ago.

142
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,900
Last night, I asked my mother

143
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,260
when I could see you again.

144
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,020
And now, we meet.

145
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,780
Xie Shi?

146
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,500
Big romance.

147
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,420
Don't you miss me?

148
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,420
It's not a very long time.

149
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,620
Wait.

150
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,500
Looks like

151
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,300
Xie Shi is pestered.

152
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,460
Mu.

153
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,460
I have something to do

154
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,540
and I need to see my editor.

155
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,140
Remember to take the tie.

156
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:30,820
I will.

157
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,020
And...

158
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,580
Tell me if there's some gossip.

159
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,180
Don't think of the gossip.

160
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:36,820
Just go.

161
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,020
I should go.

162
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,540
Will you, Zhou?

163
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,740
Walk around with me.

164
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,100
We seldom meet, anyway.

165
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:47,660
Xu Mu.

166
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:58,620
Oh?

167
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,540
Director Jiang.

168
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,340
What a coincidence.

169
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:01,900
Watched enough, huh?

170
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,060
Zhou,

171
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,300
why did you walk so fast?

172
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,780
I couldn't catch up.

173
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,060
Where have you been?

174
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,580
Didn't you say

175
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,460
you had something
to tell me this afternoon?

176
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,940
Help me.

177
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,220
I don't want to get involved.

178
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,300
Director Jiang,

179
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,980
I think you remember it wrong.

180
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,460
I don't think

181
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,020
we have anything to talk about.

182
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:32,940
You...

183
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,420
Think harder.

184
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,380
Zhou,

185
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,900
is she your colleague?

186
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,460
Why don't you introduce her?

187
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,300
Hello.

188
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,460
Call me Xi.

189
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:47,940
Hi.

190
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,380
We...

191
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,340
We aren't colleagues.

192
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,420
He's just my client.

193
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,660
A normal client.

194
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,380
I have things to do.

195
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,020
I should go.

196
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:56,900
Director Jiang,

197
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,900
how about

198
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,180
you walk around

199
00:07:59,340 --> 00:07:59,980
with your friend Xi?

200
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:00,540
Bye-bye.

201
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,540
Have a nice day.

202
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,220
Enjoy yourselves.

203
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:03,860
Miss,

204
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,740
your boyfriend's tie is packed.

205
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,900
The card is in it, too.

206
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,060
To Jiang Zhou.

207
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,660
Let me tell you some experience.

208
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,940
When you give him this present,

209
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,820
put on some perfume.

210
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,140
Not to mention Jiang Zhou,

211
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,620
you can get any other man.

212
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,020
Madam.

213
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,540
Madam, go back to work.

214
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,660
Don't let me hold you up.

215
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,420
We're in no relationship,

216
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:30,860
seriously.

217
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:31,900
In the company, we...

218
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,420
We're...

219
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,540
We're just...

220
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,020
Help me.

221
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,180
I don't want to get involved.

222
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,060
You go back.

223
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,860
My girlfriend is getting angry.

224
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:53,860
Hey.

225
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,060
You're on purpose, huh?

226
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,860
I just said that for your sake.

227
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,300
Because you said

228
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,820
I was your boyfriend.

229
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,180
Aren't you going to explain this?

230
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,820
Here's the thing.

231
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,020
Mr. Liao asked me to...

232
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,420
You'll explain it here?

233
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,820
Then tell me.

234
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,900
Where do you want to go?

235
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,580
A normal restaurant will do.

236
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:20,540
Mm.

237
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,740
Do you know how expensive
that restaurant is?

238
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:27,900
One single dish

239
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,020
costs over a hundred.

240
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,140
He didn't make you pay anyway.

241
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,300
I was clever enough to skip out.

242
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,980
The result is good, anyway.

243
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,220
Don't bother about the restaurant.

244
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,300
Tell me.

245
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,260
After I left, did anything exciting happen

246
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,700
between Xie Shi and that girl?

247
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,420
Don't tell me

248
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,380
you're calling just for gossip.

249
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,500
I'm not that kind of person.

250
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,660
So,

251
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,580
any gossip?

252
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,020
Song Niannian.

253
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:51,980
Come on.

254
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,340
I'm just curious.

255
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,740
You know me.

256
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,780
Let me tell you something happy.

257
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,620
This afternoon, my editor called me away,

258
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,300
saying a film and television company

259
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,820
would buy my novel.

260
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,140
Again?

261
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,300
Good for you.

262
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,020
Which company?

263
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,740
Its name is...

264
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,020
Dazzle.

265
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,580
Dazzle?

266
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,300
I get you in my company

267
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,820
to make you focus

268
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,700
and work hard.

269
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,420
If you aren't fired in three months,

270
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,020
I'll release your cards.

271
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:20,980
And...

272
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,460
I can't reveal my identity.

273
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,140
I know that.

274
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,540
And your car...

275
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,900
The new guy?

276
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:26,980
Yes.

277
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,540
Hello.

278
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:29,900
Oh,

279
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,300
what's your name again?

280
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,620
Shen Yi.

281
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:33,740
Shen Yi?

282
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,700
Is my name so funny?

283
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,620
You have no idea, bro.

284
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,660
There's a very popular novel

285
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,740
named Limited Romance.

286
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,220
There's a supervillain in it.

287
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,660
His name is Shen Yi.

288
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,980
If you don't believe it,
come and check.

289
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,580
Shen Yi galloped on the grassland.

290
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,780
[Limited Romance]
Arrows came out of nowhere

291
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,620
and shot him like rain.

292
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,780
Shen Yi was shot.

293
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,300
Shot like a sieve,

294
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,540
he was lying there, bleeding.

295
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,820
What on earth is this?

296
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,020
I won't read this kind of book.

297
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,980
Who wrote it?

298
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,660
[Song Jinxin,
Writer of Tingjiang Literature]

299
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,940
Song Jinxin?

300
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:22,660
Hey.

301
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,100
Who are you?

302
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,820
Why did you sweep
the rubbish over to our region?

303
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,900
You swept it over first.

304
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,300
I just returned it.

305
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,100
You don't even concentrate on sweeping.

306
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,140
You're arguing just to argue.

307
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,940
It's you who swept the rubbish over.

308
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,420
Which class are you in?

309
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,260
What is your name?

310
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,420
I'll tell your teacher about it.

311
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,140
Why would I tell you?

312
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,460
Which class are you in?

313
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,780
Hi, director.

314
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,020
Give it back to me.

315
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,580
Song Jinxin?

316
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,660
Not a good name.

317
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,260
It truly is a small world.

318
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,300
[A Week]

319
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:15,620
Mm.

320
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,740
I've seen the person in charge.

321
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,140
I'm going home now.

322
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,060
I'm sorry.

323
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,220
Oh, he's a fan.

324
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,780
Don't you think

325
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,260
I look familiar?

326
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,580
Aren't you...?

327
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,020
Right.

328
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,940
I'm your idol,

329
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,100
Song Jinxin.

330
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,540
Who's your...?

331
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,020
Oh, I recognize you.

332
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,300
I just saw you reading my novel.

333
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,420
Tell me.

334
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,620
Which novel do you like best?

335
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,300
Since when were you fascinated with me?

336
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,180
With my novel.

337
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,980
Maybe

338
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,460
when I was in high school.

339
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,340
When you were in high school?

340
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,660
I just started writing at that time.

341
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,620
Mm.

342
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:20,700
So,

343
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,020
you're a hardcore fan.

344
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,340
Which character do you like best?

345
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,620
I love all the characters.

346
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,700
Especially

347
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,780
some villains.

348
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,860
I think you depicted them perfectly.

349
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,900
How shall I put it?

350
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,060
You depicted them

351
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,580
with great thoughts.

352
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,620
Thanks for that.

353
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,940
We're meant to meet.

354
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,580
I'll give an autograph to you.

355
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,940
Thank you, then.

356
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,700
Write down what I say.

357
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,620
Shen.

358
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,900
Shen.

359
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,740

00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,050
[Shen]

361
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,020
He's really Shen Yi?

362
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,380
Shen Yi in our high school?

363
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,580
Yes.

364
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,660
Who else could be so annoying?

365
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,660
This morning, I found
I was dead in a novel.

366
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,900
And at noon, I met the writer.

367
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,340
Could I be even unluckier?

368
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,380
It's hard to tell.

369
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,580
When I picked up his phone,

370
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,100
he was reading my novel.

371
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,980
She thought I was her hardcore fan

372
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,460
and gave me an autograph.

373
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,100
But I really didn't expect that.

374
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,300
Shen Yi has totally changed.

375
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:26,940
He looks...

376
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,660
She's prettier than before.

377
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,940
But her personality is really...

378
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,060
Awful!

379
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,700
You're meant to meet.

380
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,380
We're enemies!

381
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,780
We're not enemies.

382
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,340
But since she was in high school,

383
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,780
she has been despising me.

384
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,260
I don't know how I offended her.

385
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,820
She tricked me all the time.

386
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,340
How's the cafe going?

387
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,180
Really good.

388
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,260
Maybe in a couple of years,

389
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,820
our cafe will be open

390
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,060
all over the world.

391
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,700
Why is there such a big decline?

392
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,900
Who made this?

393
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,820
Who?

394
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:10,980
Oh.

395
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,180
They're off work.

396
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,420
Hey, check this.

397
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,100
No losses. It's balanced.

398
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,900
If you're too busy, I can get a helper.

399
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,340
Don't bother about the cafe.

400
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,580
Keep using the room on the second floor.

401
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,620
It's your investment, then.

402
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,020
When I work out the AI Guide Dog,

403
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,780
I'll make some money and have dividends.

404
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,500
You'll have some.

405
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,420
But I have to say,

406
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,380
The room on the second floor
is perfect for my research work.

407
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,300
First,

408
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,300
my father can't find me.

409
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,100
Second,

410
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,940
it's free of charge.

411
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,140
In case my father says
I do nothing serious.

412
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,260
I can't make him understand.

413
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,620
He's not to blame, though.

414
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,500
I haven't worked out anything successful.

415
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:53,940
It takes time.

416
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,460
I can wait.

417
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,340
But Nicole can't.

418
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,500
It's just like a bottomless pit.

419
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,660
My little money...

420
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,100
Oops.

421
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,020
It's long gone.

422
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,380
Now, I have no money at all.

423
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,580
Forget it.

424
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,140
I'll just play it by ear.

425
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,660
Shall I take you up to my son's room?

426
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:14,980
Come on.

427
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,740
Everybody,

428
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,180
let me introduce him.

429
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,180
This is

430
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,260
Mr. Xie.

431
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,220
He offers us this room.

432
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,820
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

433
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:26,660
Not at all.

434
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,460
You guys work.

435
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,260
I just look around.

436
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,100
You haven't gone back home again?

437
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,620
Look at your hair.

438
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,140
And you...

439
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,420
Look at your shirt.

440
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,340
When did you change last time?

441
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,100
You just go back home for some rest.

442
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:46,980
Let's go.

443
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,780
We'll wash up before we return.

444
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:49,860
Fine.

445
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,820
We should go.

446
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,380
How does this room look?

447
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,180
Better than I imagined.

448
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,780
When you work it out someday,

449
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,620
your father will be proud of you.

450
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,260
My investment.

451
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:21,780
Take it.

452
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,900
All right. You go back.

453
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:33,740
Text me when you get home.

454
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,300
OK.

455
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,260
At work, Xie Shi upsets me.

456
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,780
At home, my roommate upsets me.

457
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,900
I'll have a nervous breakdown someday.

458
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,100
Then why don't you

459
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,340
move in with me?

460
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,140
Keep me company, then.

461
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,900
I always stay at home alone.

462
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,140
Pitiful, aren't I?

463
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,980
I want to live with you.

464
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,780
But you live far away from my company.

465
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,860
Is that a hint?

466
00:17:59,260 --> 00:17:59,700
Get in the car.

467
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,900
Let's go see a flat near your company.

468
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:02,940
If you pick one,

469
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,900
I'll pay the deposit immediately.

470
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,140
Don't squander your money.

471
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:05,980
Just go home.

472
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,500
Fine.

473
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:08,660
Good night.

474
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,660
Mm. Good night.

475

Off you go.

476
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,900
You'll have a blind date this weekend.

477
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,660
I saw his photo.

478
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,820
A conscientious young man.

479
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,980
I like him.

480
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,500
You're no longer young.

481
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,420
Don't always ignore me.

482
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,740
When no man wants you,

483
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,660
you'll cry.

High school.

488
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,860
We all know that.

489
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,380
Now, everyone in our company

490
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,620
knows about the two of you.

491
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,220
So...

492
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,780
What did Director Jiang
look like in high school?

493
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,820
Any big difference?

494
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,020
Come.

495
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,660
Director Jiang hasn't changed at all.

496
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,820
He was so indifferent
that even a dog stayed far away.

497
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,580
What I suffered from him in high school

498
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,500
is even more than my savings.

499
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,220
Oh.

We were saying

504
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,460
Director Jiang...

505
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,140
You work really hard.

506
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:24,780
Yes.

507
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,420
And you're kind.

508
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,580

00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,900
Mu is pitiful.

516

She suffered in high school

517
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,660
and she suffers now.

00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,220
Director Jiang,

577
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,540
there's some dessert.

578
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,460
Low in sugar.

579
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:34,500
Would you like some?

580
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:35,900
No, thanks.

581
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,940
Hey, who did this?

582
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,420
Who turned off the lights?

583
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,340
Sorry.

584
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:41,900
I'm sorry.

585
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,940
Maybe it's someone's birthday.

586
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,100
Little surprise, you know.

587
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,060
I just asked.

588
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,340
The voltage is too high

589
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,620
and this building is too old.

590
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,780
So, the fuses are blown.

591
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,540
Have them fixed.

592
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,500
They can be fixed, but...

593
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,500
The repair

594
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,740
will take one and a half hours.

595
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,340
One...

596
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,380
Let's do this.

597
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,540
Go buy a cake immediately.

598
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,220
If someone asks,

599
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,020
tell them it's your birthday.

600
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,260
OK?

601
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,660
Where's Xu Mu?

602
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,500
Mu...

603
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,020
I just saw her...

604
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,580
Call her now.

605
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,900
Sorry to have scared you.

606
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,540
Let me apologize first.

607
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,980
This idea...

608
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,620
I had this idea when one day

609
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,180
I came back home very late from work.

610
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,100
I suddenly thought

611
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,420
my pain life kept repeating.

612
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,900
Nothing was new.

613
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,740
I could tell how it would end up.

614
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,900
At that time, I was thinking.

615
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,340
If only every day,

616
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,300
someone would give me a surprise.

617
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:46,940
So,

618
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,460
here in Like,

619
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,620
I want everyone to get his or her surprise.

620
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,940
Everything you've never imagined

621
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,380
may appear today.

622
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,740
Music.

623
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,180
Candle.

624
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,340
Aurora.

625
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,740
The moment the lights went off

626
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,820
was when the surprise was being prepared.

But it will take a while.

636
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,340
Luckily, in our tool cart,

637
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,420
there are projectors and candles
from the last activity.

638
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,260
Xu, without you,

639
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,580
what could we do?

640
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:14,660
Mr. Liao,

641
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,380
you flatter me.

642
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,900
Go explain this to Director Jiang.

643
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,340
OK.

644
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,260
Umm...

645
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,220
Cancel the cake.

646
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,460
But it's being delivered.

647
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,220
I'll claim it, anyway.

648
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:25,940

649
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,140

Everybody,

670
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,700
I have some exciting news.

671
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,140
The discussion on Like's homestay
has been heated.

672
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:29,860
What's more,

673
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,820
Like released an official video.

674
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,300
Have a wild guess

There you go, Yusi.

Five million.

678
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,300
A wild guess, OK?

679
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,060
Such a coward.

680
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:41,500
Come on.

681
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:41,780
Xiaoke,

682
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,500
you guess.

683
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,780
Ten million.

684
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,460
Xu, you guess.

685
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,900
Can it be

686
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:48,940
thirty million?

687
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,780

00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,740
Mr. Liao, buy us dinner.

698
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,020
Let me give a brief talk.

699
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,100
Recently, you've had hard work.

700
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:19,020
Our first publicity was successful.

701
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,980

702
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:21,500

703
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,860
Especially Xu...

704
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,020
She had hard days.

705
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,580
Every day, she worked overtime

706
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,740
and took care of the project.

707
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,620
So, I announce

708
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,540
we'll give Xu

709
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,340
a kebab.

710
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:34,900

00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,340
For the stage,

713
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,380
we'll keep working hard.

714
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:38,820
OK.

715
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,860
Mr. Liao is right.

716
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,020
I think you're thinner from hard work.

717
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:43,900
You should eat more.

718
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,020
I can't complete this project by myself.

719
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,460
Everybody should eat more.

720
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,020
We will.

721
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,020
Come on.

722
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,020
Hey, Mr. Liao.

723
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,020
Why isn't Director Jiang here
for our celebration party?

724
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:53,900
Mr. He informed him.

725
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,740
I guess he's arriving soon.

726
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:55,820
Come on.

727
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,740
Let's drink. Cheers.

728
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,660
Thanks for your hard work.

729
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,420
What's up?

730
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:03,900
Nothing.

731
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:04,780
I just fear you may forget

732
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,420
you have a celebration party to attend.

733
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,100
I remember.

734
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:08,900
I'm on my way.

735
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:10,420
Fine, then.

736
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,300
I'm also arriving.

737
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,180
I'll wait for you at the door.

738
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,300
OK.

739
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:20,220
- Truth!
- Truth!

740
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:20,860
Fine.

741
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,820
Just do it, then.

742
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,740
Ask me some harsh questions.

743
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,500
Oh, wait.

744
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,300
I'll keep some evidence.

745
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,780
OK. Go ahead.

746
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,100
Mr. Liao, have you given
a nickname to any superior?

747
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,620
Yes!

748
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,500
What nickname?

749
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,300
What is it?

750
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,540
TOSB.

751
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,220
The King of Sock Blood.

752
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,780
TOSB for short.

753
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,060
Oh, that's good.

754
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:40,780
I made a video.

755
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,220
Go ahead.

756
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,100
No problem at all.

757
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,020
Whose turn is it?

758
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,860
Let me see.

00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,300

760
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,220
Xu Mu.

761
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,700
You should play truth or dare in turn.

762
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,620
No one can drink all night

763
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,300
instead of playing.

764
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,300
Yeah.

765
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,380
Do it.

766
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:06,300
- Do it!
- Do it!

767
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,180
Then, I'll pick...

768
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,180
Dare.

769
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,180
Oh, Xu Mu.

770
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,220
You think big now.

771
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,380
Suddenly, Xu

772
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,220
become so generous.

773
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:15,580
Xu Mu.

774
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,020
Play something exciting, then.

775
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,700
Later,

776
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,340
you'll go hug the first person

777
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,380
who gets in here, OK?

778
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,500
Exciting!

779
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,900
Let's see who'll come in.

780
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,740
Mm.

781
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:29,900
Oh.

782
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,220
Xu Mu, Xu Mu.

783
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,460
It's good for you.

784
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,300
Too good.

785
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:35,820
Director Jiang.

786
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,460
Director Jiang, here.

787
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,340
What's wrong?

788
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,100
Sit down first.

789
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,020
Explain this.

790
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,780
We were playing Truth or Dare.

791
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,780
It was Xu Mu's turn.

792
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,900
She was punished to hug

793
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,020
the first person who got in.

794
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,540
You're the second.

795
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,860
That's a pity.

796
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,260
Why are there two Director Jiang?

797
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,660
Which one shall I hug?

798
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,180
