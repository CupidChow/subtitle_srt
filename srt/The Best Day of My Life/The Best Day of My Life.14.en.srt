you don't need presents
when you visit your godfather.

00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,860
Your godmother told you last time, huh?

243
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,100
No way.

244
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,220
We need presents when visiting a senior.

245
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,460
Son,

246
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,540
do you want a snack?
I'll buy it for you.

247
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,620
Dad, you actually want it, huh?

248
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,660
That's junk food.

249
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,500
It's bad for your health.

250
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,980
You should set a good example for me.

251
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,220
It makes sense.

252

00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:44,940
Not now.

292
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,100
Xie Shi is quite busy.

293

And we're used to living alone.

294
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,940
We won't be used to having a baby.

00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,700
Having a sensible son like Huanghuang

296
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,740
would be good.

297
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,300
But having a naughty son

298
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,100
would be bad.

299
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,260

303

you will love it.

304
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,820
It's not that we don't love a baby.

305
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,700

306
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,540

what do you usually do?

318
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,460
I read books,

practice calligraphy,

321

Or watching TV?

325
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,020
That's what little kids do.

326
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,020
I'm no longer a little kid.

327
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,980
I won't do that.

328
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,020

Don't worry.

358

Is it OK we don't put him to bed?

359
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,820
He's having a really good sleep.

Don't you think

00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,380
Huanghuang is adorable?

363
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,140
He is.

364
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,500
I always think so.

365
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,380
Actually,

366
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,740
it's not that terrible

367
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,900
to have a kid.

what's your point?

370
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,820
I know.

371
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,420
Because of your father,

372
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,380
you don't want a baby.

373
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,740
But we can think differently.

374

00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:08,500
Wait.

377
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,540
Who told you I didn't want a baby?

378
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,020
I heard that personally.

379
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,700
When?

380
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,180
