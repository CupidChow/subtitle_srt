3
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,860
I'm sure he was confessing his love.

4
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,100
No.

5
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,780
Keep your voice down.

6
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,060
Come on.

7
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:52,820
It's OK.

8
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,780
Shen Yi isn't home.

9
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:54,780
He's gone to his studio.

10
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:55,820
Ah?

11
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,900
He confessed love to you?

12
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,220
Shen Yi?

13
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,740
Why were you so quiet?

14
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,020
Shouldn't you be at your studio?

15
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,100
Not until I'm done cleaning for you.

16
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:06,540
Thanks.

17
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,820
Take a seat and relax.

18
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,140
Then did you accept his confession?

19
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,140
He didn't confess his love.

20
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,500
Nor did I accept anything.

21
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,380
He just invited me to a movie.

22
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,020
Shortly after you broke up,

23
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,100
someone confessed love to your girl.

24
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:41,940
Zhang Yao?

25
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,020
How do you know?

26
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,900
That's the name, I think.

27
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:47,780
I know him.

28
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,300
I've got something to do.

29
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:51,900
I'll hang up.

30
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,100
But...

31
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,100
Xu Mu rejected him.

32
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,340
Why can't you finish it

33

in one breath?

34
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:03,900
Come on.

35
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,660
Niannian said it was
a surprise after bad news.

36
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,540
But why did you break up?

37
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,060
You no longer love each other?

38
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,580
Talk later.

39
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:13,740

Hello.

43
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,860
Does it have to be now?

44
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,100
Can I have Qiao Nan go handle it?

45
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:24,900
Fine.

I'll book tonight's flight ticket.

Mum,

48
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,580
what's up?

49
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,180
I fear you may take things too hard.

50

Young guys like you always say

the best cure for a breakup

52
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,660
is to start another relationship, huh?

53
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,260
So, I recommended some young men.

54
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,460
Go meet them.

I don't want a blind date.

57
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,380
I won't see anyone.

58
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,180
I'm in a hurry for work.

59
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:52,780

00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,500
The one back from abroad.

64
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,180
Director Chiang.

65
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,380
I heard he would
have the engagement party abroad.

66
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,420
Maybe he's gone abroad.

67
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,340
It's so nice to be rich.

68
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:09,780

Xie Shi isn't here.

78
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,340
He's gone abroad.

79
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,340
Come with no worries.

80

Director Chiang.

84
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:43,660
OK.

85
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,940

86
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,460
There you are.

00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,180
Good luck with Shen Yi's career.

93
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,780
Hope Nicole hits the market soon

94
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,580
and help every blind guy.

Cheers.

98

You'll go from inherited wealth
to making it on your own.

99
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,940
But one person is missing.

100

If only Xie Shi were here!

101
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,340
Then we can celebrate it together.

102
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,900
Xie Shi made Nicole possible.

103
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,700
I should tell him in the first place.

104
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,980
How about a video chat with him?

105
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,540
Do it yourself.

106
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,980
Fine.

107
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:07,940
What's wrong?

108
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,500
You look rather depressed today.

109
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,980
Xie Shi seems to be getting engaged.

110
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,740
He's been aboard lately.

111
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:22,900
I asked around.

112
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,380
Qiao Nan is there, too.

113
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,820
My mother asked me
to have blind dates the other day.

114
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,180
I didn't want to go.

115
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,500
But now, I think

116
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,740
it doesn't matter who I marry.

117
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,180
Hey, Xie Shi.

118
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,620
My research on Nicole has succeeded.

119
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,340
Did you see the pictures I sent you?

120
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:43,780
Yes.

121
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:44,980
Congratulations.

122
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,180
When are you coming back?

123
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,540
Are you done with your work there?

124
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,100
Soon.

125
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,700
Why do you still have to work abroad

126
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,900
after you're back in China?

127
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:54,980
Oh.

128
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,180
My father gave back my bank cards.

129
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,820
He asked me to focus on my research.

130
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,860
In a couple of days,
I'll talk with the manufacturer

131
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,060
about mass production of Nicole.

132
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,420
The research wouldn't have gone
this smoothly

133
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,500
without your support.

134
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,820

383
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,820
We're pretty much done here.

384
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,020

385
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,180

What a pity!

401
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,580
I thought Mr. Zhang

402
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,620
would settle down in Jiangbei.

403
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,420
When we were working together,

404
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,180
I asked him.

405
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,860
He said he loved Jiangbei.

406
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,460
An artist is changeable

407
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,820
and unpredictable.

408
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,220
Xu Mu,

409
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,420
do you know the reason?

410
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:03,740
Xu Mu,

411
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,980
I'm on the plane to leave Jiangbei.

412
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,180
I'm going back to Xichuan.

413
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,380
You haven't heard about this place, huh?

414
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,100
It's totally different from Jiangbei.

415
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,460
It makes people oppressed.

416
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,140
But I want to go back for a look.

417
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,460
If you ever need me,

418
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,540
contact me.

419
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:22,820
Like you said,

420
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,620
we're good friends.

421
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,140
OK.

422
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,980
Bon voyage.

423
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:40,780
She left swiftly.

424
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,580
She remained silent at the meeting

425
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,980
and didn't look for materials.

426
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,580
We're all working overtime,

427
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,180
but she left with her bag.

428
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,180
When the proposal is done,

429
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,500
her name will have to be on it.

430
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,460
Why?

431
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,380
Come on.

432
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,060
Ignore her.

433
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,700
If she really doesn't do anything,

434
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,700
I'll tell Mr. Liao about it.

435
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,460
Is the winter promo

436
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,820
the last project of this year?

437
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:04,980
After it's done, can we

438
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,020
take a good rest?

439
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,620
According to our schedule,

440
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,180
that's true.

441
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,300
How about we go on a vacation
in a tropical region

442
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,420
after this project is done?

443
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,020
Sure.

444
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,340
Hey.

445
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,220
Stop it.

446
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,900
Don't think of celebration
before it's done.

447
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:16,540
What?

448
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,980
We're looking to the future.

449
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:18,860
Yeah.

450
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,380
Pick one.

451
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,340
What's up?

452
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,260
Hey, Mrs. Jiang.

453
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,140
I'm Director Jiang's colleague.

454
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,860
He's drunk.

455
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:27,940
Come get him.

456
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,340
I'll send you the address.

457
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:29,900
OK.

458
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,540
I have to go.

459
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,220
Bye-bye.

460
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,620
Be careful on the road.

461
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,180
Mm.

462
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,340
Where's my wife Xu Mu?

463
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,540
Oh.

464
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,140
She's arriving, I guess.

465
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,540
You didn't drink too much.

466
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,300
Why are you drunk?

467
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,500
Mrs. Jiang.

468
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,260
Here.

469
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,260
How much did he drink?

470
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,300
Why is he so drunk?

471
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,340
Not very much.

472
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,020
Take him home.

473
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,220
We offered to get him
a designated driver.

474
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:57,900
He refused.

475
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,460
He insisted on having you here.

476
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,260
Xu Mu.

477
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,460

523

Mr. Liao knew it and talked to her.

524
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,460
She was too embarrassed.
