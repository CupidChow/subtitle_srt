00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,054
It is the 1950s,
following the devastating Korean War.

00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:16,057
Female gukgeuk, or traditional theater,
captures the heart of the public,

3
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:19,602
and many girls dream of becoming princes.

4
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,022
Playing the role of Yoon Jeongnyeon,

5
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,441
a pansori genius
who dives into the world of stars,

6
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,525
is Kim Taeri.

7
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:26,985
Playing the role of Heo Youngseo,

8
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:30,488
an elite trainee skilled at singing,
dancing, and even acting,

9
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:31,948
is Shin Yeeun.

10
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,867
Playing the role of Moon Okgyeong,

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,119
the undisputed Prince of Maeran,
is Jung Eunchae.

12
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,829
Playing the role of Seo Hyerang,

13
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:40,582
the beautiful flower of Maeran,
is Kim Yoonhye.

14
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:41,666
And last but not least

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,587
is the director of all the girls
who dream of becoming princes,

16
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,505
Kang Sobok played by Ra Miran.

17
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:51,051
We want to thank you for your patience

18
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:54,971
as we proudly present

00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,382
There are still a lot of you
who aren't singing from your core

32
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,384
but from your throat.

33
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:35,970
You, Park Chorok.

34
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:39,099
I can see you're out of breath
even from here.

35
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,685
How are you ever going to reach
the audience way at the back?

36
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,688
The play for this joint performance

37
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,108
is notorious for its difficult songs.

38
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,485
Whether you make it or not
will come down to your singing.

39
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,905
Keep in mind what I've taught you

40
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:56,157
and make sure to practice consistently.

41
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,242
Do you understand?

42
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,326
Yes, ma'am.

43
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,704
Let's pick up where we left off.

44
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,086
Are you going to audition
for the joint performance?

45
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,170
No.

46
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,924
Ondal's songs are too difficult for me.

47
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:15,844
They're way too high,
and you need to use aewonseong expertly.

48
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,763
They're not something a trainee can sing.

49
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,766
The only trainees
who have a chance at playing Ondal…

50
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,895
would be Jeongnyeon or Youngseo.

51
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,024
The rest of us
would only make a fool of ourselves.

52
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,951
Hong Jooran!

53
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,036
You haven't…

54
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,790
already decided to audition
with Jeongnyeon, have you?

55
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,750
Not yet.

56
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,044
Then give me a chance.

57
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,839
I'd like you to be my partner.

58
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,090
Uh…

59
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,343
But there must be a lot of people
wanting to audition with you.

60
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,970
I don't need anyone else.

61
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,681
I can only be the best if I'm with you.

62
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,189
Could I have some time to think about it?

63
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,371
-Hey, Jooran.
-Hey.

64
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,542
I was looking all over for you.

65
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,422
We need to start practicing
for the joint performance audition.

66
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,049
We have a lot on our plate.

67
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:39,636
There are a lot of difficult parts
for the young leads in the script.

68
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,138
Mm.

69
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,057
Wait…

70
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,019
Have you partnered up with someone else?

71
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:50,813
Is it Youngseo?

72
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,940
It's not like that.

73
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,401
You haven't, right?

74
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,653
You're auditioning with me, right?

75
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,198
You already read the whole script?

76
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:01,950
Of course.

77
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,743
When I read the script,

78
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:07,205
I thought that Princess Pyeonggang
suited you perfectly.

79
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,207
She's cute and lovable.

80
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,043
As for Ondal…

81
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:15,046
…I'm just worried about his songs
since they're a bit tricky.

82
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,173
You'll do well.

83
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,219
Well, we've got to practice to do well.

84
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,846
Let's start tomorrow morning, okay?

85
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,890
Oh, my goodness, that's hot.

86
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,767
I'll wait for you in the rehearsal room.

87
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,813
You better go to bed early for tomorrow.

88
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,314
Good night.

89
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,964
The Princess and the Fool

90
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,863
Hey, what took you so…

91
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,580
Let's start practicing.

92
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,415
I want to audition with you.

93
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:45,261
I… want to audition with you.

94
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:49,807
Oh, but I'm already waiting for someone.

95
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,809
Jooran's not coming.

96
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,311
I saw her with Youngseo just now.

97
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,192
-Have you read the script?
-Yes.

98
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,610
The scene we're auditioning with

99
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,946
is where young Pyeonggang
and Ondal part ways, right?

100
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,284
What is it?

101
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,953
Oh, it's nothing.

102
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,789
Let's start.

103
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,211
Where are you going?

104
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,921
You haven't given me an answer.

105
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:23,091
I have to go somewhere, so not now.

106
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,801
Hey!

107
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,594
What to do of my dear princess's…

108
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,810
We need to talk.

109
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,020
Talk when we're done.

110
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,230
I said we need to talk.

111
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,482
-Hey, Jeongnyeon.
-Youngseo.

112
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,831
I can't believe this.

113
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,043
I thought you were partnering up with me.

114
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,131
So why are you with Youngseo?

115
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,967
Answer me.

116
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,468
Why?

117
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,805
Why did you partner up with Youngseo
instead of me?

118
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,185
I'm… afraid of you.

119
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,939
Afraid?

120
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:22,900
What do you mean?

121
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,486
What are you so afraid of?

122
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,073
I'm afraid that you might get too immersed
in your character again.

123
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:32,452
When that happens, not only do you end up
devouring your own character,

124
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,288
but also your partner's character
and the whole show.

125
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,290
And the only thing that's left is you.

126
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,167
But…

127
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,336
I can control that now.

128
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,421
Sure.

129
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,090
But you're still learning how.

130
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:49,677
Who knows what's going to set you off
like last time?

131
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,139
You can't fully control yourself yet.

132
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,557
And when that happens,

133
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,186
I can't be as grounded as Hyerang
and save the scene.

134
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,271
So that's why…

135
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,359
you chose Youngseo over me?

136
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,031
Youngseo is stable.

137
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,994
She calculates how to act
with the whole narrative in mind

138
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,996
and doesn't stray from that.

139
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,584
I can rely on her…

140
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,588
but I can't rely on you.

141
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:51,113
-Jeongnyeon…
-I'm a bit tired right now.

142
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,700
Let's talk later.

143
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,622
Hey,

144
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,917
I also want to do well in this audition.

145
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,127
And I can do just as well as Jooran.

146
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,257
I'm also desperate!

147
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:14,262
You and Youngseo aren't the only ones
who want to do well in this audition.

148
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,722
I want it just as much.

149
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,350
I'm not a genius like you,

150
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,936
nor as skillful as Youngseo,

151
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,606
nor do I have any hidden talent
like Jooran.

152
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,149
But I want to do well too.

153
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,945
It's not like
you're giving up on the audition

154
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,446
since you don't have Jooran.

155
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,575
I know you hate me.

156
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,743
And you have every right to do so

157
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,538
because I was so mean to you before.

158
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,708
You might think I'm ridiculous

159
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,711
to ask to audition with you
after all that,

160
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,504
but I still want to.

161
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,757
I want to audition too.

162
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,761
So please give me a chance.

163
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,043
Youngseo is stable.

164
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,128
I can rely on her,

165
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,796
but I can't rely on you.

166
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,925
You and Youngseo aren't the only ones
who want to do well in this audition.

167
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,011
I want it just as much.

168
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,933

00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,277
I know.

182
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,532
Aren't you afraid…

183
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,910
that I'll ruin everything…

184
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,413
like I did with the soldier?

185
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,542
If you partner up with me…

186
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,880
I might ruin your performance too.

187
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,092
But you're working on controlling that.

188
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,469
What if it happens again though?

189
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,638
From what I've seen,

190
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,349
you don't repeat the same mistakes.

191
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,559
And…

192
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,854
your skills improve at a frightening pace.

193
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:14,442
You're always miles ahead
of your past self.

194
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,781
Is that so?

195
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,743
So why are you hung up
on something so stupid?

196
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,411
Why else would I want
to audition with you?

197
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:28,789
Jooran says--

198
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,750
Why would you listen
to someone who rejected you?

199
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,335
She's a fool.

200
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,338
She doesn't even know what she rejected.

201
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,301
But why are you asking me
when you won't audition with me?

202
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,680
You can't partner up with me…

203
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,517
with that kind of voice.

204
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,521
My voice would overpower yours
the moment we sing together.

205
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,939
You think I don't know that?

206
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,233
Wait, what did you say?

207
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,196
Did you just say…

208
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,367
Let's partner up for the audition.

209
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,164
Let's do it.

210
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,209
Wait a minute.

211
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,795
Don't tell me
you've already changed your mind!

212
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:16,962
No!

213
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,840
I'll do it. Let's do it.

214
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,095
Then I'll be counting on you.

215
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,389
Me too.

216
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,684
Me too!

217
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,816
I thought you were going to say no!

218
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,114
Thank you!

219
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,585
Hmm…

220
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,546
My goodness, is this your office?

221
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,382
It's smaller than I expected.

222
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:04,176
Still, your troupe itself
is rather sizable.

223
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,637
I guess Maeran really is quite popular.

224
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,972
What are you doing here?

225
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,016
Didn't you hear?

226
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,060
I'm the representative
for the judging panel.

227
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,605
-What?
-Aren't you going to offer me a seat?

228
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,233
Sure.

229
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:23,696
Aside from me, the panel includes
Professor Min Gyeongsik,

230
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,115
Mr. Kim Jaeseok of Gukmin Manufacturing,

231
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,117
and Assemblyman Jung Ilson.

232
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,245
You're going to judge an audition
that your daughter is a part of?

233
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,830
What are you plotting?

234
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,456
Plotting?

235
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,333
How rude.

236
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,837
I knew
others would misunderstand me like you,

237
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,382
so I even offered not to give a score
for Youngseo's audition.

238
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,552
And I hope you know,

239
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,680
I didn't volunteer to be a judge.

240
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:55,019
Director Jung Namhui was the one
who begged me to be on the panel.

241
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,105
You think I don't know

242
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,734
that you don't approve of
Youngseo joining my troupe?

243
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:06,071
So why are you sticking your nose in now?

244
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:13,287
I know that Gongseon's daughter
is also here at Maeran.

245
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,707
I think her name was Yoon Jeongnyeon.

246
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,543
I want to see it for myself.

247
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:25,007
Chae Gongseon's daughter
versus Han Kijoo's daughter.

248
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,636
I need to know who's more talented.

249
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,974
This joint performance…
This joint performance…

250
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:37,353
…will be a combined effort
of seven different theater troupes.

251
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,313
Moon Okgyeong will be playing
the role of Ondal

252
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:42,983
and Seo Hyerang will be playing
the role of Princess Pyeonggang.

253
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,110
And the upcoming audition

254
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,113
will decide who will play
the roles of the young leads.

255
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,658
We heard that Ms. Han Kijoo
is on the judging panel.

256
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,953
Is it true that her daughter,
Ms. Heo Youngseo,

257
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,162
is auditioning as well?

258
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:59,208
Yes, Ms. Heo Youngseo will be auditioning.

259
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:04,254
But Ms. Han Kijoo will not be scoring
her daughter's audition.

260
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,714
Regarding Ms. Yoon Jeongnyeon,

261
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,384
who was praised
for her stand-in performance as Precious,

262
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,719
many are saying
that she is the daughter of Chae Gongseon.

263
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,347
Will Ms. Yoon Jeongnyeon
be auditioning as well?

264
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,515
Yes.

265
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:18,227
Ms. Yoon Jeongnyeon
will be auditioning as well.

266
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,646
Is it true that the two
who pass the audition

267
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:24,024
will become the successors
of Moon Okgyeong and Seo Hyerang?

268
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,320
Yes, that is true.

269
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,781
Over here, Ms. Moon.

270
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:33,534
- Ms. Seo, over here!
- Director Kang!

271
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,203
Ms. Seo!

272
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,580
Extra, extra!
Read all about it!

273
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,543
Extra, extra!

274
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,711
A showdown between two geniuses

275
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,671
Daughter of pansori genius
vs. daughter of opera genius

276
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,049
A battle for the throne

277
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,843
We'll take them all.

278
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,761
Our only prince is Moon Okgyeong!

279
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,763
Only Moon Okgyeong!

280
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,515
We don't need a successor!

281
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,392
We don't need one!

282
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,019
Let's protect Okgyeong!

283
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,729
Protect Okgyeong!

284
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:05,399
Moon Okgyeong!
Moon Okgyeong! Moon Okgyeong!

285
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:06,567
"A showdown between two geniuses"

286
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,527
So Jeongnyeon is
the daughter of Chae Gongseon.

287
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,487
It must be so much pressure.

288
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,031
"One born with skill…"

289
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,115
Behind you.

290
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,714
A showdown between two geniuses

291
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,633
A battle for the throne

292
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,635
Who do you think will win?

293
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,305
-Of course it's Youngseo.
-I think Youngseo will win.

294
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,848
Youngseo?

295
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,767
Daughter of pansori genius
vs. daughter of opera genius

296
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,062
That Kang Sobok really knows
how to raise the stakes.

297
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,982
Well, this much publicity
is quite expected

298
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,651
for an audition
my daughter will participate in.

299
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,282
What is it?

300
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:58,035
Is all this publicity too much pressure?

301
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,747
-Not at all.
-Good.

302
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,333
You can't be phased
by something like this.

303
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,836
In fact, you need to be able
to enjoy your nerves

304
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,464
and channel them
to elevate your performance on stage.

305
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,299
Yes, Mother.

306
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:17,554
After I heard Gongseon's
Blooming Autumn Field,

307
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:22,184
no other pansori performance
has ever gotten me excited.

308
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,186
They all seemed fake.

309
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,065
You need to prove to everyone
with this audition

310
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:33,987
that you, my daughter,
know what it truly means to sing pansori.

311
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,072
Do you understand?

312
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,075
Yes.

What?

330
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,757
You were just touched by my acting.

331
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:22,721
Hey, that's just because
you were looking at me all sad.

332
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,392
Anyway,

333
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,520
I think we'll be fine for the audition
if we keep going like this.

334
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,397
It's not enough.

335
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,191
What's not enough?

336
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,110
Oh…

337
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:40,948
…if you mean me,
I know that I need more practice.

338
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,869
I don't mean you. I mean me.

339
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,915
I can't seem to focus on the song…

340
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,834
…and my mind's somewhere else.

341
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,089
This has never happened before.

342
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,009
I'll get my head on straight next time.

343
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:05,055
You're curious
about Youngseo and Jooran, aren't you?

344
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,393
That's what's bothering you.

345
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:12,604
No, I'm not.

346
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,532
Fine, I'm a bit curious.

347
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:27,119
I wonder how they're practicing…

348
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,708
and how good Youngseo is.

349
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,505
Don't even think about
peeking into their practice.

350
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,341
Listen to me.

351
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,969
You really can't, okay?

352
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,306
It's just going to ruin your focus.

353
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,599
Just focus on us
no matter how curious you are.

354
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,774
You guys better be on your toes.

355
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:03,155

amazing chemistry.

How were they?

372
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,664
That's the power of good chemistry.
They bring out the best in each other.

373
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,751
And it's only possible
because Youngseo has a solid foundation.

374
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,922
She has the skills
to not only focus on her own acting…

375
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:46,758
but also to match her partner freely.

376
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:49,928
Compared to her,

377
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,597
you still have a long way to go.

378
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,018
But there's no need
to be so down, Jeongnyeon.

379
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,146
You have an amazing voice.

380
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,314
This role has a lot of difficult songs,

381
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,650
so you can win with your singing.

382
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,403
But…

383
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,531
Youngseo's good at singing as well.

384
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,701
Then you just have to get even better.

385
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,663
There's a cave in the mountain nearby.

386
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,708
Try singing inside that cave.

387
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,171
You can practice by hearing your voice
bouncing back from the walls.

388
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:28,508
Repeat that 100 times a day
until you cough up blood.

389
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:33,638
You'd be able to master pansori
within half a month.

390
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:39,853
Then no matter how good Youngseo is,
you'll always come out on top.

391
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,356
Right now, you should try
everything you can to get better.

392
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,525
If Youngseo beats you this time,

393
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:47,944
it's over for you.

394
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,082
Don't listen to her.

395
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,503
It's really dangerous for you
to strain your voice like that.

396
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,341
Do you hear me?

397
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,705
We've only begun to practice,
but I think we have good chemistry.

398
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:44,543
I knew it'd be easy with you
since we get each other.

399
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:49,839
What is it?

400
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,676
Is that why you chose me?

401
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:54,970
Because it'd be easy?

402
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,429
What?

403
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,767
I heard your talk with Jeongnyeon
the other day.

404
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:04,229
You said I was stable
because I calculate everything as I act.

405
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:05,814
Uh…

406
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,399
Youngseo, I meant that--

407
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,359
When we were rehearsing for Jamyunggo…

408
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,529
you were seeing someone else.

409
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,658
So I thought
it was weird that you chose me.

410
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,204
But I think I know now.

411
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:25,000
You didn't really want me as your partner.

412
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,794
You actually wanted to partner up
with Jeongnyeon.

413
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,255
I'm just your second pick.

414
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,716
It wasn't like that.

415
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,218
Stop making me feel miserable.

416
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,098
Fine.

417
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,350
I don't care why you chose me.

418
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:47,022
All I needed was a partner
to audition with anyway.

You've been stuck on that part
for ages now.

425
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,767
I told you not to listen to Hyerang.

426
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,145
I don't think your throat's doing okay,

427
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,522
so let's call it a day
and try again tomorrow.

428
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,816
No, let's keep going.

429
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,110
Jeongnyeon.

430
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,613
Let me try a bit more.

431
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:39,157
I'll go rest if I still can't do it.

435
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:54,923
I went to the gambling house
that Mr. Ko frequented.

436
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,800
But they said
they hadn't seen him in a while.

437
00:27:56,883 --> 00:28:00,929
And anyone who might know his whereabouts
is saying the same thing.

438
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:05,183
It's clear
that he's been using our money…

439
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:09,312
but I have no idea how much.

440
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,608
And this ledger is giving me a headache.

441
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,903
Are things pretty bad for us?

442
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,614
We'll be able to pay off
our immediate debts

443
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,199
if this joint performance is a success.

444
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:22,867
I see.

445
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,327
We'll get through this.

446
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,079
Yes.

00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:29,165
Let's pray
that this performance does well.

448
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:31,710

455

You're going to ruin your throat
at this rate.

456
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,341
I can handle this much.

457
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,928
And my throat feels fine.

458
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,681
Taking care of your throat
is a basic skill for a pansori singer.

459
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,017
You should rest for today.

460
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,272
But if I don't put in this much effort,

461
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,691
I won't get the part.

462
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,490
My acting's still mediocre,

463
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,201
so all I've got is my singing.

464
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,537
If I'm not ahead of the others in singing,

465
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,539
then there's no way I'll get the part.

466
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,712
What are you so anxious about?

467
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,839
You've been doing well until now.

468
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,675
But that's not nearly enough.

469
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,887
Youngseo's improving every day

470
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,847
while I'm falling further behind.

471
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:10,850
So you're pushing yourself this hard
to get ahead of her?

472
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:13,978
At this rate,

473
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,814
you won't even make it to the audition.

474
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:18,608
You're wrong.

475
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:20,109
I will.

476
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,736
I'm going to get through this

477
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,530

You can't strain your voice like this.

486
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,401
You might ruin it forever.

487
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,278
This isn't just about
the upcoming performance.

488
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:06,990
Gongseon.

489
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,367
Just say that you can't perform this time.

490
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,119
No.

491
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:14,998
Everyone's looking forward
to hearing me sing.

492
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:18,001
They're so excited for the pansori genius.

493
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:20,378
So how could I not perform?

494
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,800
Since my father has passed away…

495
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,051
…I have…

496
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:31,264
nothing left for me except pansori.

497
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:33,808
Then all the more reason
to rest your voice!

498
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,144
Look at the bigger picture!

00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,774

500
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,985
What do you know?

501
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:47,655
How could you understand?
You've never been anywhere near my level.

502
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:52,076
Maybe it's okay for you
to ease up and take it slow…

503
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,330
but not me.

504
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:59,918

Look at me, Jeongnyeon.

510
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,585
Do not be so hard on yourself.

511
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,963
This is a marathon, not a sprint.

512
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,383
But what if Youngseo
is significantly better than me?

513
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:54,430
What if while I'm struggling,
she's already gone miles ahead of me?

514
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,307
Jeongnyeon.

515
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,476
Jooran said
that she could rely on Youngseo,

516
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,229
but she couldn't rely on me.

517
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:06,067
That's how far behind I am,
so how could I take it easy?

518
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:10,071
The reason why Youngseo
can get in sync with her partner

519
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:14,575
is because she has years of experience.

520
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,828
You can't hope to cover that
in just a few days.

521
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,496
That's impossible.

522
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,457
But Jeongnyeon,

523
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,794
you have other talents
that Youngseo doesn't.

524
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,051
Is that…

525
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,888
how far behind I am?

526
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:39,267
That's not what I'm saying.

527
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,643
I'm trying to say…

528
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:44,188
that you and Youngseo
have different strengths.

529
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:49,277
This is not the time
to be worrying about Youngseo,

530
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,197
but to focus on
your own interpretation of Ondal.

531
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,409
All right?

532
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,024
What?

533
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,443
-Jeongnyeon's not here?
-No.

534
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:31,861
What am I going to do with her?

535
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,738
What is it?

536
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:36,282
I thought she was out early
every morning to practice with you.

537
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,408
With me?

538
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,368
Don't even get me started.

539
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,748
She's been going
to the mountain every day.

540
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,168
The mountain?

541
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:52,006
♪ Come, my love ♪

542
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:57,637
♪ I shall wait for you, my darling ♪

543
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:02,767
♪ I shall sharpen my wits ♪

544
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:08,648
♪ To rival those of a dragon ♪

545
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:13,319
♪ And become as strong… ♪

546
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,084
Hey.

547
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,212
How did you know I was here?

548
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,381
Were you practicing like this
all this time?

549
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,051
Are you crazy?

550
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,429
Are you trying to ruin your voice
before we even audition?

551
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,017
Come on, let's go.

552
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,651
You're burning up.

553
00:35:56,904 --> 00:36:00,533
You can get heated up
when you practice singing for hours.

554
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:01,617
It's nothing serious.

555
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,161
Yes, it is serious.

556
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,080
Come with me.

557
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,207
Let go of me.

558
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,292
Let go.

559
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,589
Leave me alone.

560
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,842
Why are you being so stupid?

561
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:21,012
Your voice is already hoarse.

562
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,723
You're straining your throat
to sing right now.

563
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,058
And what's it to you?

564
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,437
I don't want to care either,

565
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,106
but you're being insane.

566
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,317
I just have to push through this.

567
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,236
And if I do,

568
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,572
I can master pansori.

569
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,991
What nonsense are you talking about?

570
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:47,121
Mastering pansori is something you hone
through years of practice,

571
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,624
not something you get
by straining your throat for a few days.

572
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,502
If you lose your voice,
you can't ever perform.

573
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,798
If I can't perform,

574
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:02,762
then you'd have one less rival,
so it'd be good for you.

575
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,681
What?

576
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,683
What, am I wrong?

577
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,312
You cried yourself sick
because you wanted to beat me.

578
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,023
You're right.

579
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,610
I want to beat you.

580
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,737
But I'm going to beat you with skills!

581
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,657
If I wanted to beat you with cheap tricks,
I already would have.

582
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,159
Why do you think I'm practicing to death?

583
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:29,247
I'm going to beat you with my skills
when you're in your best condition.

584
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,250
So stop with this nonsense.

585
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,252
I won't.

586
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,336
You!

587
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,549
Have you seriously gone insane?

588
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,970
You have everything.

589
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,181
You can't possibly understand me.

590
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:52,311
Singing, dancing, and acting…

591
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,694
You've perfected everything.

592
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,322
I only have my singing.

593
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,366
How could you possibly understand
my desperation?

594
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:10,204
I'm different from you.

595
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:13,749
I came all the way here
relying on my voice alone.

596
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,377
I left home by relying on my voice,

597
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:21,257
and I was able to get up every time I fell
because of my voice!

598
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:25,219
My voice is my earth and my sky!

599
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,514
It's my everything.

600
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:32,935
And you're telling me to stop?

601
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,440
If I stop now,

602
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,067
I'll only be staring down
an endless cliff!

603
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,445
So how could I possibly stop?

604
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:15,019
♪ Come, my love ♪

605
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:21,192
♪ I shall wait for you, my darling ♪

606
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,736
Ah…

607
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:05,773
I'll tell you
why I couldn't choose Jeongnyeon.

608
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,278
There was a time…

609
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:14,406
when she and I were practicing Jamyunggo.

610
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,368
When I looked at her,

611
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,287
I felt nervous for some reason.

612
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,165
I don't think I can think straight…

613
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,085
if I act with her.

614
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,255
I felt that I wouldn't be able
to tell the difference

615
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,673
between Ondal and Jeongnyeon.

616
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,883
And I'd be so confused.

617
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:36,512
And if that happens,

618
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:38,764
I wasn't sure I'd be able
to focus on my acting.

619
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,142
So I got scared.

620
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,438
That's enough.

621
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,276
I understand.

622
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,243
There's something I realized
while practicing with you.

623
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,331
Good acting isn't something
I can achieve by myself.

624
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,336
It's something you have to hone
with a good partner.

625
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,799
I relied a lot more on your acting
than I thought.

626
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,053
It's now time for you to rely on me.

627
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:22,600
Come on, Jooran.

628
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:25,352
Let's go show everyone
at the audition today

629
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,313
what we've been working on.

630
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,447
Let's protect Okgyeong!

631
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:40,034
"The Princess and the Fool
Young leads audition"

632
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:45,748
"We don't need any other prince
than Okgyeong!"

633
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:48,083
"There is only one throne under the sky!"

634
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:57,551
Do you have anything to say
to Ms. Heo Youngseo?

635
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,803
How do you feel
about your daughter's audition?

636
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,139
We'll be doing our best.

637
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,099
Have you heard
Chae Gongseon's daughter sing?

638
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:06,894
Ms. Han!

639
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:09,605
Have you gotten in touch with Ms. Chae
regarding this audition?

640
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:20,074
Hello, everyone.

641
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,325
You're all here early.

642
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:22,826
-Here, let me.
-Hello.

643
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,995
Oh my, thank you so much.

644
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,121
There.

645
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,791
How did you all get here so early?

646
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:35,381
Hey, Geumju. That's Heo Youngseo.

647
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,426
Hwaja saw her
at Maeran's last Jamyunggo production,

648
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,554
and apparently,
she was amazing as the lead antagonist.

649
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:45,182
An antagonist is different from this role.

650
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:49,228
She can't possibly make a fool of herself
as Ondal should.

651
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,356
I'll definitely get this role.

652
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:53,774
But…

653
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,777
is this everyone from Maeran?

654
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,488
Where's that girl
who already played a supporting role

655
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:01,115
when she just joined their troupe?

656
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,075
The genius girl.

657
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:04,284
Ah…

658
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,078
Yoon Jeongnyeon.

659
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:08,497
Yeah, her.

660
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,665
Where is she?

661
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:24,346
We will now begin the open audition

662
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,766
for the young leads
of Princess and the Fool.

663
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:31,186
Aside from the judges,
we are also joined today

664
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:35,232
by Maeran's Ms. Moon Okgyeong
and Ms. Seo Hyerang as observers.

665
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,693
Then let's start
with Yeonggwang Gukgeukdan's

666
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:39,737
Kim Gyeonguk and Cho Sunrye.

667
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,075
Uh…

668
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:47,536
Is Jeongnyeon here yet?

669
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:51,206
Is something wrong?

670
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:54,334
She wasn't in her room this morning.

671
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:58,172
-I think she went to the mountain.
-The mountain?

672
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:00,299
Didn't you know

673
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:02,718
that she's been practicing singing
on the mountain?

674
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:23,822
Hong Jooran!

675
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:27,326
Yeah?

676
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:30,329
We're next.

677
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,122
Let's go.

678
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,334
My goodness, Princess!

679
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:40,255
You may rise.

680
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,674
Did you say that you would cry with me?

681
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,803
Yes, Your Highness.

682
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,138
It is something…

683
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:50,891
my sick mother used to say.

684
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:57,189
♪ There is no such thing ♪

685
00:46:57,272 --> 00:47:00,192
♪ As small tears or big tears ♪

686
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:05,656

♪ Do not just pass them by ♪

689
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:18,293
Jooran?

690
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:20,420
Huh?

691
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:31,348
Next is Maeran Gukgeukdan's
Heo Youngseo and Hong Jooran.

692
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,493
I'm Heo Youngseo of Maeran Gukgeukdan.

693
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,078
I'll be playing Ondal.

694
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:55,414
I'm Hong Jooran of Maeran Gukgeukdan.

695
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:57,124
I'll be playing Princess Pyeonggang.

696
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:03,380

697
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:08,594

♪ Oh, please do not cry ♪

706
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:40,542
Look at my little girl.

707
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,170
Is there anyone else in your troupe

708
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,547
who possesses such perfect technique

709
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:48,383
and emotional depth in their performance?

710
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,802
She still has a long way to go.

711
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:52,846
She's supposed to act like a fool,

712
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,600
but she's acting much more like a prince.

713
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:59,645
Hmm… you could just compliment her,
you know?

714
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:03,982
I do admit that her gaze has gotten deeper

715
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:06,026
and her acting has gotten more detailed.

716
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:09,988
♪ Come, my love ♪

717
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:13,784
♪ I shall wait for you, my darling… ♪

718
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:17,746
How is she singing
such a difficult song so easily?

719
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:21,583
There's no one
who can beat Youngseo in singing.

720
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,005
Damn it.

721
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:31,218
♪ On those treacherous mountains ♪

722
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:34,513

723

724
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:52,572
Where the heck is she?

725
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:54,783
Just wait till she gets here.

726
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,414
Yoon Jeongnyeon!

727
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,002
I'm sorry I'm late.

728
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:07,004
What's wrong with your voice?

729
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:11,258
It's fine.
It just sounds weird when I talk.

730
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,093
It sounds fine when I sing.

731
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,095
Hey, wait.

732
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:17,139
You look terrible.

733
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:21,893
You're burning up!

734
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,689
I just didn't get enough sleep.

735
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:28,650
I'll be fine if I rest after the audition.

736
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:32,029
This is why I told you
to stop going to that mountain every day!

737
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:35,824
Why in the world
did Hyerang give you such terrible advice?

738
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:37,242
What was she trying to do?

739
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,453
What are you talking about?

740
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:53,717
Tell me.

741
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:56,511
What did Hyerang tell you to do?

742
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,730
Oh!

743
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:09,816
I was looking all over for you.
Come on, everyone's waiting.

744
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,071
What is it?

745
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:17,824
You pushed Jeongnyeon to sing in a cave
until she coughed up blood?

746
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:25,082
You really don't know
when to give up, do you?

747
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,210
I'm so sick and tired of you.

748
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:30,921
All I did was tell her what she could do.

749
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,422
She was the one who went and did it.

750
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:33,590
No.

751
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:36,134
You put her in a trap.

752
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:39,930
You knew how desperate she was
and that she'd walk right into it!

753
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:44,559
Okgyeong.

754
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:56,613
These are the last contestants.

755
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:59,699
Maeran Gukgeukdan's
Yoon Jeongnyeon and Park Chorok.

756
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:02,869
Yoon Jeongnyeon?

757
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:06,123
She's the pansori genius
Chae Gongseon's daughter, right?

758
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,167
I'm guessing she has an amazing voice
like her mother.

759
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:12,003
Having a genius mother
doesn't always mean you're a genius.

760
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,341
I'm Yoon Jeongnyeon.

761
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,635

Why did she stop?

788
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:23,445
I think her voice is shot.

789
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,532
Will you stop the song here?

790
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:32,829
She doesn't look all that well,
so I think we've seen enough.

791
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:35,623
Let's end the audition here, shall we?

792
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:39,294
Wait!

793
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:43,757
Please… Please give me one more chance.

794
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,134
We've already given you a chance.

795
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:49,888
And you've just used it up.

796
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:53,099
I'm begging you.

797
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:57,145
Please just let me sing until the end.

798
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,316
That's enough.

799
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:10,909
You shouldn't sing anymore.

800
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,079
Let's stop here, Jeongnyeon.

801
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,333
I'm going to keep going.

802
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:23,463
-Jeongnyeon.
-Just one more chance.

803
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:27,008
I'll just sing until the end.

804

If I don't sing right now…

805
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,432
I can't go on.

806
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:56,454
All right.

her last chance.
