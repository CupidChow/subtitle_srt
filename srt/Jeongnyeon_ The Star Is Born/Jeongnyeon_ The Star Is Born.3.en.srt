1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,054
It is the 1950s,
following the devastating Korean War.

2
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:16,057
Female gukgeuk, or traditional theater,
captures the heart of the public,

3
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:20,020
and many girls dream of becoming princes.

4
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,022
Playing the role of Yoon Jeongnyeon,

5
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,441
a pansori genius
who dives into the world of stars,

6
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,608
is Kim Taeri.

7
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,985
Playing the role of Heo Youngseo,

8
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:30,572
an elite trainee skilled at singing,
dancing, and even acting,

9
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:31,948
is Shin Yeeun.

10
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,867
Playing the role of Moon Okgyeong,

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,286
the undisputed Prince of Maeran,
is Jung Eunchae.

12
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,829
Playing the role of Seo Hyerang,

13
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:40,582
the beautiful flower of Maeran,
is Kim Yoonhye.

14
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:41,666
And last but not least

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,587
is the director of all the girls
who dream of becoming princes,

16
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,797
Kang Sobok played by Ra Miran.

17
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,717
We want to thank you for your patience

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,513
as we proudly present
the story of Jeongnyeon!

19
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,098
"Jeongnyeon: The Star Is Born"

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,977
"Narrator: Cho Yeongsuk
First-generation female gukgeuk actor"

21
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,604
All characters, places, organizations,
and events in this show are fictional.

22
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:03,980
The show contains Japanese expressions
to reflect the time period.

23
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,065
"Jamyunggo"

24
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,150
I actually called you here
to give you this.

25
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,322
T-This is…

26
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,282
It's the audition script
for the official performance.

27
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,494
You're now going to prepare
for this audition.

28
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:22,040
I didn't bring you to Seoul
just so you could perform with trainees.

29
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,292
I consider you as my successor--

30
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,585
No…

31
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:29,172
as my rival for male leads in the future.

32
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,804
But how could I…

33
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,722
I know you can.

34
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,392
You'll be rising to the top

35
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,687
higher and faster than anyone else.

36
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,649
So don't waste your time.

37
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:53,071
Trainee performances are for those
who need to prove themselves.

38
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,366
But you've already proven yourself to me.

39
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:01,496
All you need to do is follow me.

40
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,165
You will, won't you?

41
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,482
I'm truly thankful for your words.

42
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,901
But I don't think I can take this.

43
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:33,903
Why not?

44
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,865
That's not my way of doing things.

45
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:43,454
Everyone already thinks I have no skills
and don't deserve to be here.

46
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,665
And if I take the easy path now,

47
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,293
I'll only be proving them right.

48
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,423
Also, if I back out now,

49
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,843
that blasted Heo Youngseo
is going to be gloating so much,

50
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,761
saying that she knew this would happen.

51
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,680
I'd rather die

52
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,558
than see that smug grin on her.

53
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,518
All right.

54
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,271
If that's what you want.

55
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,025
But remember…

56
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,237
You have to take full responsibility
for your choices,

57
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,948
even if you regret it later.

58
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,208
What did I do just now?

59
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,629
You just gave up on
the official performance audition script.

60
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,757
That was the right thing to do, right?

61
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,259
That was a crazy thing to do.

62
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,678
You said no to something
others would kill to have.

63
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,099
No! I was right.

64
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:46,809
If I had taken that script,

65
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:51,022
I'd only be proving I got in the troupe
solely through Moon Okgyeong.

66
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:54,484
That's exactly what I'm trying
to prove wrong right now.

67
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,279
I'm…

68
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:02,075
…going to get that script
with my skills alone.

69
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,869
You're amazing.

70
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,663
If it were me,

71
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,249
I wouldn't have been able
to say no right away.

72
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,211
It's nothing. I just went for it.

73
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,590
But I still have no idea

74
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,842
how I'm supposed to portray Bangja.

75
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:24,097
You know what you need right now?

76
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,225
Shopping.

77
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,559
Act 3

78
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,732
-That scared me.
-Come here.

79
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,653
Oh, wow, they're so pretty.

80
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,406
You'll need makeup to go on stage.

81
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,825
Let's get you some cold cream.

82
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,118
Here.

83
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,202
Oh, and some powder.

84
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,999
With this on,
your face will look as fair as snow.

85
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,002
This is all the rage these days.

86
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,128
Is that so?

87
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,298
Hmm! It smells good.

88
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,549
-Here.
-All right.

89
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,723
This is so cute.

90
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,560
- Jeongnyeon.
- Hmm?

91
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,478
Ta-da.

92
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:15,606
It's a present.

93
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,983
One for you,

94
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,151
and one for me.

95
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:21,529
We'll keep one each
to remind us of our oath.

96
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,156
Oath? What oath?

97
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,991
That we'll always be friends.

98
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:29,203
And that we'll continue doing gukgeuk
until we're old and frail.

99
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,998
Oh, come on.

100
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,250
Isn't taking an oath
a bit too much for that?

101
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,585
I'll get angry if you don't!

102
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,880
My goodness, you can be scary.

103
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,300
Fine, let's do it.

104
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,135
I'll take that oath.

105
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:50,516
I, Yoon Jeongnyeon,
along with Hong Jooran,

106
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,354
vow to do gukgeuk
until we become old and frail

107
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:59,192
and to remain good friends
until the very end.

108
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,988
-Happy now?
-Yeah, I'm happy.

109
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,540
Should we check it out?

110
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,973
They have these people in Seoul as well?

111
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,392
We had them in Mokpo.

112
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,645
They'd dance and perform
for money during festivals.

113
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,689
He's not doing this for money, you know?

114
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:39,816
What?

115
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,610
He's doing this for himself.

116
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,070
He just loves to dance

117
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:47,782
and to make others happy
with his performance.

118
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,827
All right!

119
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,662
- That's it!
- Let's go!

120
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,341
He's amazing.

121
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,136
He's dancing so freely
and everyone's loving it.

122
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,311
He's not just dancing freely.

123
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,356
-Hmm?
-He knows exactly which moves

124
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,693
will make the crowd go wild.

125
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,822
He has everyone
in the palm of his hand.

126
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,201
I wish…

127
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:34,954
I could also…

128
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,333
orchestrate the crowd like that on stage.

129
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:53,931
Didn't get much sleep?

130
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,266
No.

131
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,393
I was up all night reading the script.

132
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,355
That's what you get

133
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,817
when you cross the line
and accept a role that's too much for you.

134
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,069
That's enough, Park Chorok.

135
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,948
Do you have a medical condition

136
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,327
where… you have to respond to everything?

137
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,579
I mean,

138
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,748
you must be so bored when I'm not around.

139
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,333
Don't worry, I'm not.

140
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,423
Oh my!

141
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,260
Goodness!

142
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,684
What's so funny?

143
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,353
Stop laughing!

144
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:43,981
Come on, let's go!

145
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:51,822
My goodness, that was the biggest laugh
I've had in a while.

146
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,333
Wait.

147
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,294
Why didn't I think of this before?

148
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,296
What do you mean?

149
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,926
Bangja is someone who makes others laugh.

150
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,094
Hmm?

151
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,805
He's someone who keeps people entertained.

152
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,140
So in other words,

153
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,518
he's a jester.

154
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,604
Someone who makes everyone laugh.

155
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:27,525
Someone who can orchestrate
the audience's reactions.

156
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,654
The jester of the whole show.

157
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,323
That's Bangja.

158
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:35,908
What?

159
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,327
I have to go somewhere, okay?

160
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,041
Tell them I won't be at rehearsal today!

161
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,003
Jeongnyeon! Where are you going?

162
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,090
This is the schedule
for the upcoming audition.

163
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,509
And those who are participating
all got their scripts?

164
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,594
Yes.

165
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:00,141
I actually have something to tell you
about the audition scripts.

166
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,855
One of the new trainees has asked
if she could get one.

167
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,691
How brazen.

168
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:09,775
Who was it?

169
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,653
Was it…

170
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:14,572
Yoon Jeongnyeon?

171
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,157
Yes.

172
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,120
Huh.

173
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:33,924
Where's Yoon Jeongnyeon?

174
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:35,926
She's not here today.

175
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,429
I need to talk to you.

176
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:50,566
I hear she also missed
the final rehearsal yesterday.

177
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,651
She did.

178
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:58,658
Are you trying to ruin the whole show
just to drive her out of the troupe?

179
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,662
What will you do
when the show starts tomorrow…

180
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,331
and Jeongnyeon still isn't here?

181
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:09,251
This may be a trainee performance,
but it's hosted by Maeran nonetheless.

182
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,629
I can't let you taint our name.

183
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,673
That will never happen.

184
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,883
I'll take Jeongnyeon's role.

185
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,552
How could you
when you're playing the lead role?

186
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,555
You mean…

187
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,308
you'll play both roles at the same time?

188
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,144
Yes.

189
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,648
Then show me what you're trying to do.

190
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,445

191
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:43,202

Hey!

203
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,380
You're getting the letter all wet.

204
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,508
But…

205
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:43,971
how do you know Chunhyang?

206
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,392
How do I know her?

207
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,353
I was simply heartbroken
at her predicament.

208
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,398
And who wouldn't shed a tear…

209
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,110
at such a heartfelt letter?

210
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,072
Wait a minute.

211
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,449
You are…

212
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,078
Master Mongryong?

213
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,624
You're Master Mongryong,
are you not?

214
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:18,798
My goodness, sir!

215
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:25,179
What in the world happened to you?

216
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,392
"Sold out"

217
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,813
Experience the love story
between Yi Mongryong and Sung Chunhyang

218
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,023
here at the International Theater!

219
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:40,903
Come watch Chunhyangjeon
as performed by future theater stars!

220
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,112
Oh, my goodness!

221
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,698
Thank you so much.
Have a great night.

222
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,700
Oh, my goodness!

223
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,994
Cast

224
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,831
Heo Youngseo is going to dominate
the whole show tonight.

225
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:55,876
She's on a different level
from the rest of the trainees.

226
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,961
Is that so?

227
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:01,382
She must really be something
for you to praise her like that.

228
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,008
Ah, ah, ah!

229
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,304
Is Jeongnyeon still not here?

230
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,514
No, she isn't.

231
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,058
She even missed the final rehearsal.

232
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,352
Maybe she ran away.

233
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,478
She didn't.

234
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,105
Why would she?

235
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,566
Then how are we supposed to perform
without Bangja?

236
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,528
I'm talking to you, Youngseo.

237
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,498
If Jeongnyeon doesn't come on time,

238
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,834
I'll take her--

239
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,502
Sorry I'm late!

240
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,753
Jeongnyeon!

241
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,591
I'm really sorry.

242
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,596
I won't ever let this happen again.

243
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,848
- Come here.
- Okay.

244
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,975
So she actually showed up.

245
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,727
But what's the point?

246
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,771
How is she going to perform
when she missed the rehearsals?

247
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,940
We've got 40 minutes left.

248
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,025
Everyone, get ready.

249
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,528
I was so worried you weren't coming.

250
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,613
What kept you so long?

251
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,658
It took a while to find my own Bangja.

252
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,589
That's lights out.
Mongryong and Bangja, you're on.

253
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,634
Okay.

254
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,005
You're so cool and handsome!

255
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,676
Youngseo's not intimidated
by the crowd at all.

256
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,155
- What's going on?
- She forgot her line.

257
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,875
She's frozen stiff.

258
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,753
Will she even be able to say
her first line?

259
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,631
She must've forgotten her line.

260
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,348
Oh, my goodness!

261
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,854
Oh, my goodness.

262
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,693
Young Master!

263
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,488
Doesn't it just…

264
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,699
knock your socks right off?

265
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:58,786
Am I right?

266
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,496
So, Young Master…

267
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:05,000
this is what I was telling you about.

268
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,170
The most famous pavilion in all the land,

269
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,379
Gwanghallu Pavilion.

270
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,174
What do you think?

271
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,677
Oh, come now.

272
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,804
What do you think?

273
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:21,016
Isn't it as amazing as I said it'd be?

274
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,312
Well, would you look at that?

275
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:30,025
My young master must be so amazed
that he's rendered speechless.

276
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,280
Is that grass I see on the roof?

277
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,991
Since you wouldn't stop talking about
this Gwanghallu Pavilion,

278
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,619
I thought it'd be much grander than this.

279
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:43,705
But is this what all the fuss is about?

280
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,249
Ah!

281
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,544
What are you talking about?

282
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:52,422
It's just a bit run down,
that's all!

283
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,425
Come, sir. Get up here.

284
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,803
Ah!

285
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,597
Take a look at this amazing view.

286
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,936
Hmm!

287
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,815
Hmm. I guess you may be right.

288
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:10,899
Right?

289
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:14,945
Nothing beats a good drink here
when the weather's just right.

290
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,618
- Wait a minute.
- Wow, that's good.

291
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,412
- Who is she?
- Huh?

292
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,123
Who are you talking about?

293
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,418
Follow my fan.

294
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:33,547
-Who is that lady over there?
-Hmm?

295
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,388
What are you talking about?

296
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,849
I don't see anything.

297
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,269
How could you possibly not?

298
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:49,980
How could you,
Young Master?

299
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:56,153

00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,016
Jeongnyeon.

361
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:56,935
That was just amazing.

362
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,439
I'm not ruining the show, am I?

363
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,107
Of course not.

364
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,484

What?

375
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,435
Once you're on stage, you're on your own.

376
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,937
If you think
someone will take care of you,

377
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,856
you'll end up ruining the show.

Here.

403
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,035
Be careful with this scene.

404
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,287
What?

405
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,248
Be careful with this scene.

406
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:07,667
Something's up.

407
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:17,886
My goodness.

408
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,681
My back is killing me.

00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,109
Goodness.

412
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,490
Ow, my nose!

413
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:42,035
Why are you standing
in the middle of the road?

414
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,665
Uh?

415
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,626
Eh?

416
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,545
That's right, I fooled you!

417
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,673
Oh, come on!

418
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,300
Stop getting in my way!

419
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,971
It's customary...

420
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,598
...for the messenger to check

421
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:07,519
the contents of the letter
for any mistakes.

422
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:10,563

423
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,773

426
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:28,456
I wasn't going to let you check it,

427
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:33,712
but you're quite impressive
with your words.

428
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:36,923
So I'll let you.

429
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,009
Stay far away.

430
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,511

00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:26,350
That was an amazing performance
worthy of Maeran.

522
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:30,563
The pressure you felt on stage

523
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:33,107

-Yes?
-Did you check your staff backstage?

529
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,421
No, I didn't.

530
00:36:56,005 --> 00:37:01,886
Checking your costumes, makeup, and props
before going on stage

531
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:02,970
is a given.

532
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,348
Yes, ma'am.

533
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,308

to find your Bangja

535
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,941
Does that mean…

536
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,984
I heard from Doaeng.

537
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,112
Come to my office tomorrow morning…

538
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:22,657

540
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:31,540

Good for you!

542
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,005

00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,549
- Good work, everyone.
- This is incredible.

544
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,976
-Guys, don't fight.
-You stay out of this.

545
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,437
Apologize.

546
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,732
-For what?
-We agreed that if I got the script,

547
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,278
you'd apologize
for saying I've got no skills

548
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:04,532
and that you'd never say another word
about me getting in through Moon Okgyeong.

549
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,535
So apologize right now!

550
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,537
In front of everyone.

551
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:13,249
-Sorry.
-Come again?

552
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,296
I'm sorry!

553
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,092
All right.

554
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:27,513
I'll let you off the hook
since you apologized.

555
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:31,434
But if you ever say such nonsense again,

556
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:32,935
I'll make you pay.

557
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:42,320
Yoon Jeongnyeon's singing and dancing
were all over the place today.

558
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,698
If she did that
in an official performance,

559
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:48,075
the director would have told her off.

560
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,954
But I'll admit it.

561
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,625
I never thought
she'd be able to find her own Bangja…

562
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,086
in just 10 days.

563
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,257
After tonight's performance,

564
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:06,344
I get why Jeongnyeon refused my offer

565
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,596
and wanted to play Bangja.

566
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,475
Perhaps she'll become

567
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:16,103
a better actor
than I ever could've imagined.

568
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,859
You're right.

569
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,694
Yoon Jeongnyeon's not bad.

570
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,781
But right now, there's no question
that Youngseo is the best.

571
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:28,824
I agree.

572
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:34,163
She was able to entice the entire audience
with her singing alone.

573
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,000
But it's pretty clear from her acting

574
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:42,463
why the director only let her play extras
in official performances.

575
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,303
What I'm confused about

576
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,181
is that you should already know
about Youngseo's limits.

577
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,975
But you've never once mentioned them

578
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,145
when you're the most critical
when it comes to actors.

579
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:05,319
You guys messed with Jeongnyeon's staff,
didn't you?

580
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,363
Don't try to deny it.

581
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:12,451
I saw you exchanging
secret signals with each other.

582
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,623
This better not happen in the future.

583
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,459
But you also hate her.

584
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,919
She's right.

585
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:25,464
You also had her play Bangja
so she'd leave the troupe.

586
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,174
-Yeah, you did.
-Yeah.

587
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:31,137
You think I did that without thinking
like you guys?

588
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,393
I was ready to play both roles
if Yoon Jeongnyeon happened to run away.

589
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:40,396
But what were you planning to do

590
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,939
if she had ruined the show?

591
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,235
If you pull another stunt like this…

592
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,905
I'll report you
to the director immediately.

593
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:31,780
Youngseo!

594
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,123
I wanted to thank you

595
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,001
for trying to help me out earlier.

596
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,086
Thanks.

597
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,841
I always thought
you had an attitude problem,

598
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,636
but I guess I misjudged you.

599
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:54,720
You're wrong.

600
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:57,765
I wasn't trying to help you.

601
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:02,019
You could have ruined my performance.

602
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:04,522
I needed to make my mark with this show

603
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,981
to move on to the next level.

604
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,151
And I won't let anyone
ruin my performance.

605
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,747
Aren't you curious

606
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:25,459
how you were so in sync with me
when you've missed practice so many times?

607
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:30,756
Don't tell me you think
it was because you're such a great actor.

608
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:33,884
Get out of your head.

609
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,137
It was only possible
because I matched your performance.

610
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:42,309
It was my skill, not yours,
that saved our show tonight.

611
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:45,229
Then what about you?

612
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:49,942
You should also have realized
Yoon Jeongnyeon's limits by now.

613
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,945
So why aren't you touching on that?

614
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:57,449
What everyone considered
her strength tonight

615
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,202
will only hinder her in the future.

616
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,788
I'm sure of it.

617
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:04,748
Her next performance…

618
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,793
is going to be her downfall.

619
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,308
Run!

620
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:23,559
Faster!

621
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,645
Your current stamina
won't get you anywhere!

622
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,606
When it comes to official performances,

623
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:32,484
you'll have to perform
at least seven times a week.

624
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,028
Without the proper stamina,

625
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:37,698
your singing or acting skills
are all useless!

626
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:00,471
Come on, girls. One last lap!

627
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:01,805
Seriously?

628
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:04,933
What?

629
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:18,822
Now,

630
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:21,200
action scenes are crucial
in our performances,

631
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,244
especially sword fights.

632
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,497
Heo Youngseo.

633
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,040
Yoon Jeongnyeon.

634
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,250
Come out and pick up a sword.

635
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:38,092
Try to be in sync with one another
just as you've seen your seniors do.

636
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:44,973
Begin.

637
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:22,761
- Oh, my goodness!
- Oh, no!

638
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:25,514
Stop!

639
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:26,890
What do you think you're doing?

640
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,476
You call that a sword fight?

641
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,900
Please give me another chance.

642
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,736
I'll make sure to win this time.

643
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:39,903
Win what?

644
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:43,574
You think all this is to see
who's stronger?

645
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:45,534
But it's a sword fight.

646
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:46,910
Don't I need to win?

647
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:50,664
Sit down, both of you.

648
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:51,749
Doaeng, come out.

649
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,423
Scene 5 of Jamyunggo.

650
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:02,676
Prince Hodong,
angered by Princess Mokryeon's death,

651
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,470
battles with Gomigeol.

652
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:08,015
I'll be Prince Hodong,
and Doaeng will be Gomigeol.

653
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:12,478
Gomigeol, you snake.

654
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:15,773
I shall avenge the princess
by taking your life.

655
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:24,907
Poor young Prince.

656
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,201
How deep is your suffering?

657
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,162
But isn't this what you wanted?

658
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:39,797
You wanted to tear apart the Jamyunggo
and trample on Nakrang!

659
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:51,683
All I did was realize your desire!

660
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,855
Oh!

661
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:02,319
Please send my regards
to the late princess,

662
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,404
dear Prince.

663
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,115
That was so cool.

664
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,291
That was amazing.

665
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,752
Doaeng's the best
when it comes to sword fights.

666
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,506
They don't call her
the best male antagonist for nothing.

667
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:24,383
Yoon Jeongnyeon.

668
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,845
-Yes?
-Do you get what's important now?

669
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,515
Being in sync, ma'am.

670
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,058
That's right, being in sync.

671
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,019
Whether it's a love scene
or a fight scene,

672
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:39,606
what's important is being in sync
with your partner.

673
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:42,860
You may act your heart out on stage,

674
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,945
but if you're not in sync
with your partner,

675
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:48,073
you'll lose your audience immediately.

676
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:51,201
Make sure to remember this. All right?

677
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:52,452
Yes, ma'am!

678
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:56,081
Good. Next is Hong Jooran and Park Chorok.

679
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:12,431
- Oh, no!
- Jooran!

680
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:18,979
You…

681
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,110
Oh!

682
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,655
What did the doctor say?

683
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,073
I have a small fracture.

684
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:32,326
So I'll need to wear a cast for a while.

685
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:33,869
Oh my…

686
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:34,953
Let's go.

687
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:39,333
That Park Chorok,
she's such a brute.

688
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:42,127
She shouldn't have
swung the sword around like that.

689
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:44,588
She should have focused on being in sync.

690
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:46,548
She just had to…

691
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:51,094
Hey, Jooran.

692
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,179
Cheer up.

693
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,765
The doctor said it was a small fracture,

694
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:58,602
so as long as you don't move it,
you'll be fine in time for the audition.

695
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,146
The audition's not the problem.

696
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,276
You should go back first.

697
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,362
I need to stop by somewhere.

698
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,281
Oh?

699
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,829
-Jooran, what's with your arm?
-I'm fine. I can still work.

700
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:20,958
Hey!

701
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,126
Jeongnyeon! Why did you follow me?

702
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,712
What's going on?

703
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,340
Do you work here?

704
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,928
You'll get in trouble.

705
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:35,347
The director told us
not to work outside the troupe.

706
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:39,309
She banned us from singing to earn money
as a Maeran troupe member, not working.

707
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:42,854
I'm only a waitress here,
and they don't know I'm part of Maeran.

708
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:48,110
Stars like Okgyeong or Hyerang
make lots of money,

709
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,613
but us trainees
don't get enough allowance.

710
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:55,325
So I can't help but work in secret.

711
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,410
So why…

712
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:02,207
Why do you need money so much
that you have to work in secret?

713
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:09,881
I need money…

714
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,218
for my sister's tuberculosis meds.

715
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:17,180
You mean the one you wrote your letter to?

716
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,059
You said she was sick,

717
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:23,478
but it was tuberculosis?

718
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:27,733
I already feel bad about leaving home
to pursue my dream on my own.

719
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:31,653
So I want to be of help somehow.

720
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,323
It must have been hard for you.

721
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,286
But…

722
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,873
I understand, but--

723
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:44,624
Sorry, I'm going to be late. I'll see you.

724
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,209
Jooran!

725
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:52,883
How's she going to work with that arm?

726
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,886
Come again, sir!

727
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,137
Come again, sir.

728
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:01,683
How are you going
to serve anything with that arm?

729
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,727
I can do it with my other arm.

730
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,312
I'll do it somehow.

731
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:08,482
What if you end up
spilling coffee on the customers?

732
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,733
And look at you.

733
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,819
It doesn't look good for us
to have an injured server.

734
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,572
You just had to do this
when we're so busy.

735
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:16,823
Excuse me,

736
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,658
I'll work in her place.

737
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,952
- You can't.
- Would that work?

738
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,331
You're going to work in her place

739
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:26,458
until she gets better?

740
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:27,584
Yes.

741
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,419
What's your name?

742
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,879
It's Yoon Jeongnyeon.

743
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:32,881
And that country accent…

744
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:36,843
You're going to be serving
our esteemed customers.

745
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,720
That accent won't do.

746
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,181
We have a reputation to uphold.

747
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:44,601
What's wrong with having an accent?

748
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,607
Then from now on…

749
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:55,529
I'll make sure to talk
like I'm from Seoul.

750
00:51:56,613 --> 00:52:00,826
I can do it if I try.

751
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:05,080
I'll first have to see how you work.

752
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:07,499
Then I'll decide whether to keep you.

753
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:10,377
-All right.
-Follow me for your uniform.

754
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,670
Okay.

755
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:13,964
What are you doing?

756
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:15,382
What else can I do?

757
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,717
I need to help my friend
if she's in trouble.

758
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,220
You were trying so hard to keep your job.

759
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:23,181
I'll just fill in for you
until you get better.

760
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,767
What if the troupe finds out
you work here?

761
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:28,395
Thank you, but you can't.

762
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,272
You said you needed this job.

763
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:33,942
That you need the money
for your sister's meds.

764
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:38,780
I also ran away from home
so I could earn money for my family.

765
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,157
So I understand how you feel.

766
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:43,326
But you'll get in trouble
if they find out.

767
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,078
Don't worry.

768
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:48,748
I just have to keep it a secret
that I'm part of Maeran.

769
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:51,084
And I'll only be serving the customers.

770
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:53,378
What are you so worried about?

771
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:00,886
Enjoy.

772
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,890
- Could we have some water?
- Coming right up.

773
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,683
- Miss Yoon.
- Yes?

774
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,101
This is for the table at the back.

775
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:12,772
Ms. Yang.

776
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:13,857
Yes?

777
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,901
Hello.

778
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,695
Yes, ma'am?

779
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:21,114
The new girl.
She's a theater troupe member, right?

780
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:22,240
Sorry?

781
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:24,451
She's part of Maeran Gukgeukdan.

782
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:27,871
I saw her recently
in one of their trainee performances.

783
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:29,915
Ah… Really?

784
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:31,625
I guess you didn't know.

785
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,753
She played Bangja,
and she was quite the actor.

786
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:36,796
And an amazing singer.

787
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,006
Is that so?

788
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:44,971
Let me know if you need anything else.

789
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,056
Okay.

790
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:51,519
I'm telling you…

791
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,774
I can do this by myself,
so stop moving around so much.

792
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:57,734
You should go rest your arm.

793
00:53:57,817 --> 00:54:01,529
How could I when you're working
at the coffee shop for my sake?

794
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,073
I'm fine.

795
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:05,992
And it's pretty fun.

796
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,495
I'm so worried
that you might get found out.

797
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:09,663
Just rest, okay?

798
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,331
I can do it.

799
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:12,540
Give me that.

800
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:13,708
I said I'll do it.

801
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,462
Wash my rag, will you?

802
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,301
Hey, Park Chorok.

803
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:31,768
Aren't you going to apologize
for hurting Jooran's arm?

804
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,478
It wasn't on purpose.

805
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:35,105
Things like this happen during practice.

806
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:39,734
And why are you throwing a fit
when Jooran's fine with it?

807
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:44,239
Actually,

808
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:49,035
there's some unfinished business
between you and me.

809
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,079
You said that if I got the script,

810
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:55,333
you'd do anything that I told you to do.

811
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,504
Don't tell me

812
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:01,464
you're going to back out of something

813
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:05,260
you've promised to do
with that pretty little mouth.

814
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,013
Fine!

815
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:09,347
I'll do it!

816
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:10,557
Who said I wouldn't?

817
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,728
Then…

818
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:17,647
…until Jooran's arm gets better,

819
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:22,485
you'll clean, do the laundry,
and wash the dishes for her.

820
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:25,780
You better start with the rags.

821
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:28,450
Jooran!

822
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:30,952
Let's go.

823
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:35,040
Yoon Jeongnyeon!
You still have to finish your share!

824
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,597
It's hot.

825
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:01,483
Oh, it's just you.

826
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:02,567
You scared us.

827
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,278
I thought the other girls smelled us out.

828
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:07,614
Hurry up and close the door.
The smell is getting out.

829
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:10,075
We're fine.

830
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:23,922
Hey.

831
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:25,465
Do you…

832
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:27,092
want one?

833
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,760
No, you can stuff your face.

834
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,976
So why did you get these?

835
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:40,563
You have to eat well
for your arm to get better.

836
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,941
Steamed buns will help my arm get better?

837
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:47,070
Anything is good for you if you enjoy it.

838
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:48,863
Oh! Well said.

839
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:55,370
What? What do you want?

840
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,707
Should I go? I should go.

841
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:00,792
No.

842
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:05,088
Why should you go?
It's not even lights out yet.

843
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,465
Don't bother. I'm leaving.

844
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,395
Hey, what if she left…

845
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,898
to get some steamed buns for herself?

846
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:27,610
Hey.

847
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,546
-Ah.
-Oh…

848
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,798
Here to practice?

849
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:51,176
-Yes.
-Should I spar with you?

850
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:31,424
Wow, Youngseo.

851
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:35,970
The only other person to beat me
was the director.

852
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:46,105
You're going to audition
for Prince Hodong, right?

853
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,526
No, I'll be auditioning for Gomigeol.

854
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,487
You're auditioning for the antagonist
and not the lead?

855
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:53,988
Yes.

856
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:58,701
But you were so great as the lead
in the trainee performance.

857
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,497
I think I need to experience
playing the antagonist

858
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:05,750
to prepare myself for the lead role
in the future.

859
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:09,170
As expected of you, Youngseo.

860
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:15,843
I…

861
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:18,513
have something I want to ask of you.

862
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:19,931
Mm.

863
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,350
Please tell me honestly…

864
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:28,398
if anything was lacking
in my last performance as Yi Mongryong.

865
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:30,608
I don't know.

866
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:34,696
You're pretty much the full package.

867
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:39,659
I'm the one who should be worried
about you coming for my spot.

868
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:42,954
I mean, I'm not at that level yet.

869
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:44,539
Don't say that.

870
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:50,253
I'm actually earnestly waiting
for someone to challenge my place.

871
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:54,007
And you're the closest one to doing so.

872
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:02,348
Ah.

873
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:07,937
Whether it's Prince Hodong or Gomigeol,
make sure to enjoy your role.

874
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:09,480
Sorry?

875
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:11,190
Enjoy playing your role.

876
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:15,820
And to do that,
you'll have to let yourself go a lot.

877
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:33,963
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

878
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,049
- Over here!
- So, Mr. Park.

879
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:38,468
How are things
at the broadcasting station?

880
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:40,845
It's pretty hectic
since it just opened, isn't it?

881
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:42,597
The job itself is fun.

882
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,432
It's just that the higher-ups
are too conservative

883
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:46,267
and it's hard to get investors.

884
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:50,063
But even all that will change
once we make a hit.

885
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:53,107
I knew it.
I like that passionate side of you.

886
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:54,734
What are you doing these days?

887
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:58,237
I'm giving singing lessons
to aspiring singers.

888
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:00,406
We can't just have you giving lessons.

889
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,076
You'll have to make a comeback
with a new song, Patricia.

890
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:07,372
Ma'am.

891
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,706
We just got a call

892
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,584
that the singer scheduled to sing today
is too sick to make it.

893
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:13,336
What?

894
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:16,839
How could she let us know this late?

895
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:18,716
Where are we supposed to find
another singer?

896
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:22,553
Let me ask Ms. Yang Huija
if she's available.

897
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:24,972
I already called her,

898
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:27,642
and she started singing
at another coffee shop last week.

899
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:28,726
She did?

900
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:31,813
Then what about Ms. Jung Okja?

901
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:35,149
She's been stuck at home
after her leg injury, remember?

902
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:36,609
Then what do we do?

903
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:38,945
Patricia is here today.

904
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:41,072
Why don't we ask her?

905
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:42,782
Patricia?

906
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:45,326
No.

907
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,579
If she sings at our place,

908
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:52,542
we might get shunned
for associating with a divorcée.

909
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:54,210
But it's just for today.

910
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:57,880
Other coffee shops
also want to ask her to perform,

911
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,425
but no one's doing it
because they're scared.

912
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:02,343
This is driving me crazy.

913
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:06,305
Miss Yoon!

914
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,182
- Yes?
- Come here for a second.

915
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:12,228
Oh, okay.

916
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:17,191
We don't have anyone to sing
for our evening show today.

917
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:20,069
So could you sing for us just this once?

918
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:22,613
You want me to sing?

919
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:24,949
Oh, no.

920
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:27,368
I'm no good at singing.

921
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:30,413
Is that so?

922
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:34,625
So a theater troupe member
doesn't know how to sing?

923
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:39,380
How did you know that?

924
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:42,842
Come on, sing for us just this once.

925
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:45,178
I'll raise your current salary

926
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:46,721
by 50%.

927
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:48,473
Absolutely not.

928
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:51,601
I really can't be singing.

929
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,353
I'm only here as a waitress,

930
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,773
so I'll just do that, okay?

931
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:01,027
Then I'll fire both you and Jooran.

932
01:03:02,695 --> 01:03:03,863
Will you be okay

933
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:06,407
if Jooran gets fired because of you?

934
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:14,207
Good evening, everyone.

935
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:19,420
Let me introduce our singer for tonight,
Ms. Yoon Jeongnyeon.

936
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:21,506
Please welcome her
with a round of applause.

937
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:38,314

Ms. Yoon Jeongnyeon.

959
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:54,116
That was a nice performance back there.

960
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:57,787
I've met my share of people who can sing,

961
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:00,289
but I've never met anyone
with a voice like yours.

962
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:05,086
Thank you so much.

963
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:11,092
I'm Park Jongguk,
a producer at a broadcasting station.

964
01:06:12,426 --> 01:06:14,053
HLKL TV
Park Jongguk

965
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:16,055
What's a broadcasting station?

966
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:18,516
It's a place that'll make you a star.

967
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:21,227
Television will soon
dominate the whole world,

968
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:24,105
and our station's going to be
the front-runner in our country.

969
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:27,858
I'd like to make you into a huge star,

970
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:31,821
so if you're interested,
please give me a call on that number.

971
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:45,001
HLKL-TV, Jongno Broadcasting Station
Park Jongguk

972
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,003
Television?

973
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:13,529
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

974
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:16,574
Could you tell me
how to get to Maeran Gukgeukdan?

975
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:20,327
Maeran Gukgeukdan

976
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:23,914
Jeongnyeon!

977
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:30,880
Mother?

978
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,341
How are you here?

979
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,263
There's no need to explain.

980
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:40,973
Let's go.

981
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:46,395
No.

982
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:58,199
Do you even know
what you're getting yourself into?

983
01:08:00,284 --> 01:08:02,828
Singing pansori
may look extravagant on the outside,

984
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:06,415
but it rots you to your core.

985
01:08:06,999 --> 01:08:08,209
Maybe to you,

986
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,920
I just seem like a reckless child.

987
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:14,256
But I've thought this through.

988
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:17,009
I know this is going to be hard,

989
01:08:17,718 --> 01:08:19,345
and I'm prepared to go through the pain.

990
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:21,388
You know nothing!

991
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:23,182
Then what about you?

992
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:27,103
How could you tell me not to do something
you've never even tried?

993
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:28,896
Because I've been through it myself--

994
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:37,822
What?

995
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:41,033
You've… been through it?

996
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:43,285
Been through what?

997
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:51,460
Are you saying you were a pansori singer?

998
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:54,004
There's no need to get into that.

999
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:57,883
Let's go. We're leaving.

1000
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:00,052
Wait, you can't just leave it at that!

1001
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:01,137
-Come on.
-You can't…

1002
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:03,722
Tell me what's going on!

1003
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:06,392
Mother!

1004
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:08,310
You have to tell me!

1005
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:09,687
We're going home!

1006
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:11,021
But, Mother!

1007
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:15,609
Gongseon.

1008
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:26,537
It's been a while, Gongseon.

1009
01:10:09,413 --> 01:10:13,334
Jeongnyeon: The Star Is Born

1010
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:15,336
You're not prepared to become an artist,

1011
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:17,171
let alone an actor.

1012
01:10:17,796 --> 01:10:18,964
You're done here!

1013
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:21,425
I've abandoned my mother

1014
01:10:21,508 --> 01:10:23,385
just so I could stay
and become a gukgeuk actor!

1015
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,931
This is the only way

1016
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:31,143
I can stay in Seoul
and not go back to Mokpo.

1017
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,104
Could you make me a singer?

1018
01:10:35,522 --> 01:10:36,523
I'm…

1019
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:39,777
going to make it big among the stars.
