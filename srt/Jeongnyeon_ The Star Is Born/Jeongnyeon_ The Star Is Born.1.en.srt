00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,869
My goodness.

360
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,413
[neighbor] Could I have
just one head of your kimchi?

361
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:28,333
My kimchi this year doesn't taste as good.

362
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,128
One head isn't going to be enough
for your family.

363
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,216
Here, have a lot.

364
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,301
[neighbor chuckles]

365
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,511
[neighbor] Well then… [grunting]

366
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,181
Let me have a taste.

367
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,058
Goodness!

368
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:48,020
[slurps] But Yongrye,

369
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:51,398
your daughters aren't back yet?

370
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,901
[mother]
They must still be at the marketplace.

371
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,863
You must be so proud of them.

372
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,282
They're such good kids
helping out at the market.

373
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,909
That's true for Jungja.

374
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,995
[sighs]
But Jeongnyeon isn't like her sister

375
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:08,081
and causes so much trouble,

376
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,834
always doing what I tell her not to do.

377
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,462
She's still a good girl.

378
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:17,549
And she sings so beautifully.

379
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,968
Everyone was amazed at the marketplace.

380
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,098
Did Jeongnyeon sing at the marketplace?

381
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,184
Oh, no. [awkward chuckle]

382
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,019
-[Jungja] We're home!
-[sisters grunting]

383
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,438
My goodness.

384
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,732
[groaning]

385
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,443
Mother, look at this.

386
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:40,197
Did you sing at the marketplace?

387
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,034
Well then, I'll be off.

388
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,620
Time to make dinner.

389
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,211
Nine.

390
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,339
[sharp inhale]

391
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,633
Keep counting.

392
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:01,843
Ten.

393
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,930
[irritated sigh] You stubborn girl.

394
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,725
Not a sound from you, huh?

395
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,311
[Jeongnyeon breathing heavily]

396
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,981
I told you not to sing, didn't I?

397
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,943
What are you, a performer? A courtesan?

398
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:21,071
Why do you keep singing
in front of people?

399
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:24,241
Those guys were causing trouble again.

400
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,450
I didn't have a choice!

401
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,202
Is that right?

402
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,539
You think they won't come back
just because you sang at them?

403
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:36,128
It was better than doing nothing like you.

404
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,798
I'm just using my talent to make money.

405
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,217
Why are you so against it?

406
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,928
We don't even have money for rice.

407
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,389
[shouts] What's so wrong
about earning money by singing?

408
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,808
Is that so?

409
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,352
I've been too kind.

410
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:56,064
I'm going to shave you bald…

411
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,026
so you won't be able
to go out in public again.

412
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,028
All right, let's go.

413
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,446
[splutters] Where are we going?

414
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,156
To the barber.

415
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,283
Let's go shave your head.

416
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,909
-Come.
-Wait!

417
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,331
[grunting] Hold on. Mother!

418
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,249
[grunts] I'm not going.

419
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,877
-[Yongrye] Come on.
-[Jeongnyeon] I'm not going! [wailing]

420
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,295
[Yongrye] Oh my…

421
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:19,838
Get inside!

422
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,257
-[Jeongnyeon] Mother!
-[Jungja] Mother, no!

423
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,800
-Mother! Mother, no!
-Goodness!

424
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,219
Mother, calm down!

425
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,430
-Please! Mother!
-[Jeongnyeon whimpers]

426
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,223
-Get back here!
-Mother, wait!

427
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,768
-[both panting]
-I think she got your point.

428
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:36,563
Is that why she keeps singing
when I tell her not to?

429
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,023
You're at fault too.

430
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,985
You were right there with her.
Why didn't you stop your sister?

431
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:46,406
She wasn't there when I was singing.
Don't blame her!

432
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,784
-That's just great.
-[Jungja] Quiet.

433
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,953
What great sisters you are!

434
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:56,208
How dare you speak back to me, you brat?

435
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,542
Mother! Mother!

436
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:58,627
-No! Mother!
-Come here!

437
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,711
[Jungja] Mother!

438
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,631
You're right. I'm sorry.

439
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:03,965
From now on,

440
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,843
I'll make sure
to keep her from singing ever again.

441
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,470
So please let her go for now.

442
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,055
Jeongnyeon's all grown up now.

443
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,848
If you shave off her hair…

444
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,767
[groans]

445
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,561
…how is she going
to show her face in public?

446
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,646
[irritated sigh] Goodness gracious.

447
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,190
-Get up, Jeongnyeon.
-Goodness.

448
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,025
Tell her you're sorry.

449
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:24,861
I'm sorry.

450
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,032
And?

451
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,410
I'll never…

452
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,038
sing again.

453
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,375

454
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,170

What am I going to do with you?

00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,683
You should have been begging
on your knees.

-Why would you talk back to her?

-Hey, you bring in the food.

461
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,567

-Yes, ma'am?
-Get out.

470
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,428
You're banned from the stage
even as an extra.

This morning.

478
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,079
Should we inform Okgyeong?

479
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,957
No, let her focus on performing for now.

480
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,876

with a handsome man yesterday.

Was it your boyfriend?

Stop talking nonsense.

500
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,982
Why would she of all people
be at the marketplace,

you just said that I couldn't act.

827

must be adept at three things.

My voice?

00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,900
You were born with cheonguseong.

You said I had a chance.

895
00:48:56,099 --> 00:49:01,438
I want to make big money with this talent,
even if my mother kills me.

896
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:05,150
So teach me what I need to do

897
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:08,278
to get out of here and get to Seoul.

898
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:10,405
[soft chuckle]

899
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:15,494
[Okgyeong] Our troupe is going to hold
an audition for new trainees.

900
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:17,245
You'll be taking that audition.

901
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,206
Au…

902
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,290
Sorry, what?

903
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,750
An audition.

904
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,086
It's an entrance exam for the troupe.

905
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:27,422
So what do they test at this "audition"?

906
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,091
Three things.

907
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:31,051
Singing, acting, and dancing.

908
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,888
Experts for each of the criteria
will serve as judges,

909
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,516
but Director Kang is the one
who holds the final say.

910
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:42,187
[sucks teeth]
We'd better focus on acting and dancing

911
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,647
since we don't have a lot of time.

912
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:52,739

this Gwanghallu Pavilion,

918
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:13,135
Uh, the biggest problem…

919
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:15,262
is that you're not phrasing
the lines properly.

920
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:19,016
The audience won't get
a word of what you're saying

921
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,184
if you read off
a string of lines like that.

922
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,728
I have a question.

923
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:26,606
How much do you earn
if you play the main character?

924
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,108
What?

925
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:31,611
My friends said
that if you succeed as a gukgeuk actor,

926
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,822
you'd be rich enough
to buy a house and a car.

927
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:35,907
Is that true?

[soft chuckle]

929
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,288
You better practice
if you want to get rich.

930
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,248
Relax your shoulders.

931
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:47,210
And maintain eye contact
with the person you're talking to.

932

Here it is, Young Master.

933

This is what I was telling you about.

934
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:55,594
The most famous pavilion in all the land,
Gwanghallu Pavilion.

935
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,304
What do you think?

936
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:59,056
Isn't it as amazing as I said it'd be?
