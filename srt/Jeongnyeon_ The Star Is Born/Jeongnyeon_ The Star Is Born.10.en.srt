1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,054
It is the 1950s,
following the devastating Korean War.

2
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,974
Female gukgeuk, or traditional theater,
captures the heart of the public,

3
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:19,853
and many girls dream of becoming princes.

4
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:21,771
Playing the role of Yoon Jeongnyeon,

5
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,357
a pansori genius
who dives into the world of stars,

6
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,483
is Kim Taeri.

7
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:26,901
Playing the role of Heo Youngseo,

8
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:30,405
an elite trainee skilled at singing,
dancing, and even acting,

9
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:31,740
is Shin Yeeun.

10
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,616
Playing the role of Moon Okgyeong,

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,869
the undisputed Prince of Maeran,
is Jung Eunchae.

12
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:37,746
Playing the role of Seo Hyerang,

13
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,373
the beautiful flower of Maeran,
is Kim Yoonhye.

14
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:41,666
And last but not least

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,294
is the director of all the girls
who dream of becoming princes,

16
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:47,380
Kang Sobok played by Ra Miran.

17
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,842
We want to thank you for your patience

18
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:55,805
as we proudly present
the story of Jeongnyeon!

19
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,390
"Jeongnyeon: The Star Is Born"

20
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,977
"Narrator: Cho Yeongsuk
First-generation female gukgeuk actor"

21
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,520
All characters, places, organizations,
and events in this show are fictional.

22
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:03,980
The show contains Japanese expressions
to reflect the time period.

23
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:07,650
If I asked you to leave Maeran with me,

24
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,319
would you?

25
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,488
Leave?

26
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,157
To go where?

27
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,034
Wherever.

28
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:18,870
So…

29
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,539
would you?

30
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,958
Why me?

31
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,919
What do you mean?

32
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:30,757
I wasn't the one
you looked out for the most.

33
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,804
Jeongnyeon's already a lost cause.

34
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,306
Even if she were to return,

35
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,600
she wouldn't be the same.

36
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,813
I can't leave.

37
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:45,980
Why not?

38
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,566
I'm waiting for someone to come back.

39
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,820
I need to wait here.

40
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:57,700
You still want to compete with Jeongnyeon?

41
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,412
Yes.

42
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:07,335
I've never actually beaten her
in anything,

43
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,129
but I still need her.

44
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,881
Why do you need her so much?

45
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,844
She's the only one who stimulates me
and makes me grow.

46
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,054
Not only that…

47
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,517
but she's the only one
who truly understands me.

48
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,564
All right.

49
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,654
You're lucky, you know.

50
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,030
What?

51
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:40,451
I never found someone,
no matter how much I waited.

52
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,089
Moon Okgyeong
directly refutes opium allegations

53
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,930
Other papers have also published
Okgyeong's counterstatement.

54
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,350
"Moon Okgyeong
refutes allegations with press conference"

55
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,602
How does it look out there?

56
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:10,064
More articles are in support of her,
but it's still a bit…

57
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:16,279
Well, it's good
that a lot of investors are still with us.

58
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,869
You should get some sleep.

59
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,454
You haven't been sleeping recently.

60
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,957
I keep having bad dreams.

61
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,419
You've been like this
since Jeongnyeon left.

62
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,884
How about you pay her a visit?

63
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:41,262
Rehearsals won't start again
until next week,

64
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,181
and I can handle the press by myself.

65
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,268
Jeongnyeon took all the scripts with her…

66
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,939
which means she hasn't totally given up.

67
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:52,774
Just like you.

68
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:00,615
She'll be heading to Mokpo right now,
so please get the car ready.

69
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:01,783
Understood.

70
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,161
Mokpo?

71
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,664
Is the director going to see Jeongnyeon?

72
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,624
Yes, she's heading out right now.

73
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,761
Hong Jooran.

74
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,680
Jooran.

75
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,974
Hey, Jooran.

76
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,643
-I'm following the director to Mokpo.
-Mokpo?

77
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,395
Are you going to meet Jeongnyeon?

78
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,772
Yes, I need to see her.

79
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:35,984
And if you do?

80
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,695
What will you do then?

81
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,572
She's probably suffering enough as it is.

82
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,784
But I miss her.

83
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,329
I miss her so much.

84
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,042
I know.

85
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,172
I'll go see her.

86
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,010
I'll make sure to bring her back.

87
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:09,267
Director!

88
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,978
You're going to see Jeongnyeon, right?

89
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,313
Take me with you.

90
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,691
Don't tell me… it's because you miss her?

91
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,109
I'm just…

92
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:21,821
I just need to see her
because I need to give her something.

93
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,240
The show is just around the corner.
What about practicing?

94
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,159
I'll work extra hard once I come back.

95
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,579
Please, Director.

96
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:32,999
Mm.

97
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,084
Act 10

98
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,502
Director.

99
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,840
I think…

100
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,635
another troupe is trying
to scout Okgyeong.

101
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,806
Did she… tell you anything?

102
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,934
She didn't elaborate much,

103
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,189
but it seemed like
she was thinking of leaving our troupe.

104
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:05,656
She has the tendency
to say ridiculous things sometimes.

105
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,409
So don't worry.

106
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,204
She probably didn't mean it.

107
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,595
The fire's a bit…

108
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,268
Mother, look.

109
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,199
Mother!

110
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,954
How dare you show your face here?

111
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,622
How dare you!

112
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,041
Why are you here?

113
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,086
To feel better about yourself?

114
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,504
Why are you here?

115
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,840
I'm here to take Jeongnyeon back.

116
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,301
You're insane.

117
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,470
You're completely out of your mind!

118
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,056
You're here to take her back?

119
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,560
And do you think
I'll just let you do that?

120
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,145
How will you take her back?

121
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,021
Are you going to kidnap her?

122
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,235
She'll come back with us of her own will.

123
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,572
She can't live without pansori.

124
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:31,492
She won't be able to bear not coming back.

125
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,121
Hurry and get the salt!

126
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,384
Salt them!

127
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,270
Oh, hi…

128
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:02,231
Do you need something?

129
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:03,941
Could you…

130
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,695
tell me where Jeongnyeon is?

131
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:03,876
What are you doing?

132
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,549
The Blooming Autumn Field

133
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,343
I came to give you this.

134
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:13,803
You left this behind.

135
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,597
I don't need it, so take it with you.

136
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,767
Why not? You used to treasure this a lot.

137
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,602
I said take it with you.

138
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,065
I'm not going anywhere near pansori.

139
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,901
Then are you never going to come back
to pansori or gukgeuk?

140
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:30,945
Oh, I get it.

141
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:33,990
You're already giving up
because you've already failed once.

142
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,119
You don't get to talk to me that way.

143
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,329
Well, it's your life,
so why should I care?

144
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,625
Just take this. It's yours.

145
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,544
-I said I don't need it.
-Take it!

146
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,213
I don't care what you do with it.

147
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,215
Crush it into pieces for all I care.

148
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,426
Do what you want.

149
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,598
Fine.

150
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:02,810
I will.

151
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,618
Sure, you don't need it.

152
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,759
Hey!

153
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,260
Hey!

154
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,460
You little…

155
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:13,005
Why would you jump in
when you don't even know how to swim?

156
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:19,762
Why are you here?

157
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:24,809
I already want to die
without you taunting me!

158
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,019
You got what you wanted.

159
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,772
You're Okgyeong's successor.

160
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,983
You should go on smugly living your life.

161
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:37,405
Why the hell
did you come all the way here?

162
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,702
What makes you want to die so badly?

163
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:47,707
Nothing I do can ever bring my voice back!

164
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,543
You saw it yourself.

165
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:55,673
So what more do you want from me?

166
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,842
You still have your acting.

167
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,638
Your acting skills
that I could never surpass.

168
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,683
I was…

169
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,687
I was never just afraid of your singing.

170
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,858
The way you act…

171
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,445
I was scared to death…

172
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,906
that no matter how much I struggled,
I could never be like you.

173
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,413
At the last audition…

174
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,250
your acting
was what I could only dream of.

175
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:36,505
I could hardly breathe
while watching you on stage.

176
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,177
Just once…

177
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:45,389
I wished with all my heart
to be able to act like you just once.

178
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,642
But I couldn't…

179
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,325
Ever since I lost my voice,

180
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,536
I keep having the same dream.

181
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,997
I keep dreaming…

182
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,959
about our last audition.

183
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,631
In my dream,

184
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,300
I can sing how I used to.

185
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,012
I widen my stance,

186
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,306
flex my abdomen,

187
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,852
pull my sound from my core…

188
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,983
and sing to my heart's content.

189
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,697
I feel that I have
complete control over my voice.

190
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,659
I know it's just a dream,

191
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,204
but it makes me feel so alive.

192
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,291
Then I'd wake up,

193
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,044
but the dream would feel so real.

194
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,464
So I'd try to sing as I did in the dream.

195
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,135
But…

196
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,139
it would be no use.

197
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,893
Whenever that happened,

198
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,271
I'd feel so scared and lonely…

199
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,732
like I was left alone in the world.

200
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:24,780
It'd feel like
a boulder was sitting on top of my chest.

201
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,073
Jeongnyeon.

202
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,998
You'll never be alone
from now on and forever.

203
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,586
I'll be by your side until the end.

204
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,426
I'll wait for you to get back on stage,

205
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,804
no matter how long it takes.

206
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,080
Why are you home so late?

207
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,002
Mother had a whole row
with some guests from Seoul.

208
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,465
How is she?

209
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,178
I'll take that.

210
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,309
Mother.

211
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,353
We need to catch some octopus tomorrow

212
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,940
and also help Suja with making kimchi.

213
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:45,986
So get ready to sleep now.
You'll need to wake up early tomorrow.

214
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,363
What did…

215
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,200
the director say to you?

216
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,786
What did she say to me?

217
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,540
I didn't want to hear another word,
so I drove her out.

218
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:02,711
Mother.

219
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,339
I'm…

220
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,093
really sorry.

221
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,013
But…

222
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,309
I'm going to continue doing gukgeuk.

223
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,069
Are you insane?

224
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,656
What did that girl say to you?

225
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,701
What did she possibly say to you…

226
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,286
that made you bring up that gukgeuk again?

227
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,082
Mother.

228
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,960
Singing is the only way…

229
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,631
to feel this huge release inside me.

230
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,885
At first,

231
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,514
I thought that if I couldn't sing
as well as I did before,

232
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:59,518
I should just forget
about pansori or gukgeuk altogether.

233
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,314
But whenever I try
to turn away from pansori…

234
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:11,780
I feel even more lost and frustrated…

235
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,326
that I can't breathe.

236
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:24,376
The only time I can breathe
is when I can sing.

237
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:31,133
The only way to release
what's inside me is to sing.

238
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,720
Mother.

239
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,972
I have no other choice.

240
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,852
You crazy little brat!

241
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:46,231
How are you going to sing
if you've lost your voice?

242
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:51,153
Who's going to come listen to you
when you can't even sing properly?

243
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,030
You little brat!

244
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:58,285
If I can't sing,
I'll find another way to be on stage.

245
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,581
If I never regain my voice,

246
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,249
I'll be a dancer.

247
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,794
And if I break my legs,

248
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,880
I'll be an extra on stage.

249
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,217
You need to wake up.

250
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,097
Wake up!

251
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,932
Wake up!

252
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,518
My goodness.

253
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,853
I can't believe you.

254
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,232
I can't believe this.

255
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,155
Hello?

256
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,116
Is anyone there?

257
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,325
Who's there?

258
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,080
Oh, you're Jeongnyeon's mother.

259
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:47,042
Did another war break out?
What are you doing so late?

260
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,127
You have…

261
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:52,714
Kang Sobok from Seoul staying here, right?

262
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,299
Kang Sobok?

263
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,307
Leave quietly…

264
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,477
as soon as it's morning.

265
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:09,481
And don't you dare bother my daughter.

266
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:13,861
No matter how much you try
to hold on to her,

267
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,904
Jeongnyeon will end up…

268
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,158
seeking me out again.

269
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,286
What did you just say?

270
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,582
She'll seek you out?

271
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,420
You lowly witch!

272
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,424
You call yourself human?

273
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,177
She's barely alive right now!

274
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,929
Are you trying

275
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:44,266
to kill her for good?

276
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,938
Jeongnyeon is different from you.

277
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:55,485
You ran away scared
because you weren't a genius anymore,

278
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,405
but Jeongnyeon's not going to run away.

279
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,408
She will get back on her path.

280
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:04,036
That path is hard enough
even without a broken voice!

281
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,624
She'll suffer all her life…

282
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,546
Sobok, please.

283
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,798
I'm begging you.

284
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,760
Please just leave quietly.

285
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:24,306
I've already lost her once to pansori.

286
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,352
I can't lose her again.

287
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,520
Not again.

288
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,445
After you left…

289
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,865
I did everything I could

290
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:46,703
to try and reach the top like you did.

291
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,665
Everyone praised me…

292
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,001
and called me a master of pansori.

293
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,254
But I knew.

294
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,965
I knew I couldn't be like you.

295
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,093
I realized it only after you left.

296
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,345
That the reason
why I had improved so much…

297
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,932
was because I had you.

298
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,189
And after you left me so easily…

299
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,943
I missed you terribly.

300
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,453
Gongseon.

301
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,667
Pansori singers can't perform
with a broken voice,

302
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,585
but gukgeuk is different.

303
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:40,132
In gukgeuk,
even if you can't sing, dance, or act,

304
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,092
you can be on stage.

305
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,220
What can she do with a broken voice?

306
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,849
Then you can teach her.

307
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,231
You… can sing.

308
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,026
I'm sure of it.

309
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,403
You're the only one…

310
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:06,742
who can teach Jeongnyeon
how to sing with a broken voice.

311
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,245
You need to take the first step.

312
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,747
Even if it's just one song.

313
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,831
No,

314
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,876
try singing even just one line.

315
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:19,713
Then you'll know.

316
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:23,967
Stop spewing such nonsense.

317
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,723
I don't care what you have to say.
A no is a no.

318
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,099
Leave now!

319
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:29,199
♪ I want to go ♪

320
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:37,416
♪ I want to go ♪

321
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:44,047
♪ I want to follow… ♪

322
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,404
Jeongnyeon!

323
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,124
You're coming with us, right?

324
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:23,503
-I can't go right now.
-Why not?

325
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:27,257
I've hurt my mother too much until now.

326
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,427
So I can't hurt her again.

327
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:35,515
I'll come back once I have her permission.

328
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,058
So you go ahead.

329
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,311
But what if
she never gives you permission?

330
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,313
All right, I understand.

331
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:51,156
Come back to us
when your mother can gladly let you go.

332
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,783
We'll be waiting.

333
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,254
Jungja, wake Jeongnyeon up.

334
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,758
Mother.

335
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,677
Jeongnyeon's not in the room.

336
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,771
That little…

337
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,856
Where have you been?

338
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,777
You scared me.
I thought you left with that director.

339
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,203
Mother.

340
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,541
I won't leave home
without telling you anymore.

341
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,168
I won't go anywhere

342
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,295
until you let me.

343
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,131
So don't worry.

344
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,594
Just come and make breakfast.

345
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,148
Youngseo!

346
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,692
Where's Jeongnyeon?

347
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,402
She didn't come with you?

348
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,196
Does she not want to come back? Why?

349
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,656
Is she that sick?

350
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:15,949
Ah…

351
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,910
She's doing fine.

352
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:22,706
She can't come back right now,
but she said she'd definitely return.

353
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,124
Really?

354
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:26,835
Yeah, she promised me
that she'd come back.

355
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,338
That's good.

356
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,591
I told her that you were waiting.

357
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:37,387
She asked a lot about you.

358
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,139
Really?

359
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,057
Really.

360
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,395
There's so much…

361
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:47,939
I want to tell her.

362
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:49,816
What?

363
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,194
You must be tired.

364
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,780
Go and get some rest.

365
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,084
The Princess and the Fool

366
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,802
It's Okgyeong!

367
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:20,930
Thank you.

368
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,524
Thank you.

369
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:37,656
Come in.

370
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,749
Are you almost ready?

371
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,084
Yes.

372
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:51,419
Hmm…

373
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,254
Do you have something to say?

374
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,006
Uh…

375
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,553
I'll let you choose the play
for our next production.

376
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:06,434
It's fine even if it's a foreign play
or something experimental.

377
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:10,605
You can choose… anything you want.

378
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,652
We might lose our audience
if it's something too experimental.

379
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:18,113
And you can't stand that.

380
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,280
Ah…

381
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,034
I know…

382
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:28,832
that you've been scouted by other troupes
and even the film industry.

383
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:34,379
And no matter how much money they offered,

384
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:37,966
you always chose to stay with us.

385
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:43,263
So I think it's time for me
to make some sacrifices for you.

386
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,143
What's gotten into you?

387
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,938
You're doing all this for me?

388
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,774
I'm a bit shocked.

389
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:02,407
This is the most tempting offer
I've ever received.

390
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:12,667
It doesn't matter
what they say against you.

391
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,796
You are the best male lead
in female gukgeuk.

392
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,215
Yes.

393
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,554
- Hey, did you hear?
- What?

394
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,514
-Hear what?
-There's word going around

395
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,934
that Hyerang will quit gukgeuk
after this production.

396
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,394
-What?
-Why?

397
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:32,812
I don't know.

398
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,482
Others say
that she fought with the director.

399
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:38,985
Things are already hectic as is
with Okgyeong's issue,

400
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:41,029
and now Hyerang is quitting?

401
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,657
Our troupe is going to be okay, right?

402
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,500
Oh my! Jooran!

403
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,044
Seriously?

404
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,213
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

405
00:29:58,797 --> 00:29:59,964
I didn't see you there.

406
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,883
That must've hurt.

407
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:05,303
Are you okay, Your Highness?

408
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,472
What do you think you're doing?
You tripped her on purpose.

409
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:10,433
Hey.

410
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,853
Can you prove that I did it on purpose?

411
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,106
My foot slipped.

412
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,691
You little…

413
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,072
What, you want to hit me?

414
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,074
Chorok!

415
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,410
Moon Okgyeong's too busy taking opium

416
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,955
while the trainees are total bullies.

417
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,206
Maeran…

418
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,709
really is a mess, huh?

419
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,841
Sorry.

420
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,718
My hand slipped.

421
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,345
Hey, Heo Youngseo!

422
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:48,429
What's next?

423
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:52,183
Are we going to grab
and pull at each other's hair?

424
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,268
Or…

425
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:56,062
have you sprinkled our shoes
with some broken glass?

426
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,818
If you hate us that much,

427
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:04,404
beat us on the stage with your skills.

428
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,448
Don't pull these cheap tricks.

429
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,538
Geumju, let's just go.

430
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,123
- Let's go.
- Come on, Geumju.

431
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,053
Thank you.

432
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,682
Don't let them bother you.

433
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,155
During the era of the three kingdoms,

434
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:50,033
in Goguryeo's royal palace

435
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:54,579
was the only daughter of King Pyeongwon,
Princess Pyeonggang.

436
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,331
She was a wee baby who'd cry all the time.

437
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,458
She'd cry because of a bee

438
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:01,586
or because she couldn't finish her meal.

439
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:05,715
One day, she was crying
because she lost her ball.

440
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:09,510
In front of her appeared a boy in tatters.

441
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:13,556
And who was he but the famous fool, Ondal,

442
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,686
who lived with his mother
who went blind before her thirties?

Tell me,

449
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,419
why are you crying today?

450
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:47,131
My ball rolled into the bushes
and disappeared.

451
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,591
Please find it for me, Father.

452
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:49,759
Pyeonggang.

453
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,929
You are the princess
of the great Goguryeo.

454
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:55,348
You cannot cry at such a tiny thing,

455
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:59,560
or you won't be able
to look over our people when you grow up.

456
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,020
She's right.

457
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,897

I'm going to have you marry
Ondal the fool.

460
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,244

00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,584

How could you say that?

471
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,214
What? It's funny.

472
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,894
I think my legs gave out

473
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,563
because I had never laid eyes
on someone so beautiful.

474
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:31,694
I never knew
Youngseo could act like a fool.

475
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,157
This belongs to the princess.

476
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,952
Hurry and get on your knees.
This is our princess.

477
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,163
You have stepped foot inside the palace.

478
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,757
My goodness, Princess!

479
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,635
I am such a fool.

480
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,554
You may rise.

481
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,100
Did you say that you would cry with me?

482
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,560
Yes, Your Highness.

483
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:09,107
It is something
my sick mother used to say.

484
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,692
"There is no such thing
as small tears or big tears,

485
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,112
light tears or heavy tears."

486
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:18,074
"So if you see someone weeping,
do not just pass them by."

487
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,995
Even Father and Mother tell me not to cry.

488
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,998
But you would cry with me?

489
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,042
Yes, Princess.

490
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,170
What is your name?

491
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,466

492
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,074
Princess.

493
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,952
I do not care
what happens to my lowly self.

494
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:08,040
But what to do
of my dear princess's sorrow?

495
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,668

There's no point looking back at the past.

What we perform today
is going to be legendary.

516
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,475

00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,769

My dear husband.

557
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:10,134
She's so cool
even when she's not a prince.

558
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:14,430
No other male lead will ever be
as good as Okgyeong.

559
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,265
Well, of course.

560
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:25,024
We have done away
with the treacherous Johyeon

561
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:26,984
and have brought back order to our nation.

562
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:31,071
Now all that is left is to conquer Silla.

563
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,157
Go, my soldiers!

564
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:36,368
Go and wipe out the Silla lands

565
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,287
and bring me back
the head of their leader.

566
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:43,542
Then you shall reap a handsome reward.

567
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:23,165
You should retire for the night
as you have a long journey tomorrow.

568
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:31,465
Princess.

569
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:38,305
So much blood has already been shed
to rid this land of that traitor.

570
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:41,850
Must you continue the tragedy?

571
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:43,811
My love.

572
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,730
Why do you say this?

573
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:54,989
I no longer see the wise princess
who longed for the peace of Goguryeo.

574
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,908
All I see now…

575
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:03,038
is a princess
who craves more war and bloodshed!

576
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:06,542
How could you misunderstand
my intentions for our lands?

577
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:10,087
All this is to secure
the might of Goguryeo.

578
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,464
You have changed, Princess.

579
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:16,051
And I am an incompetent husband…

580
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,471
for being unable to see…

581
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:24,310
and prevent my dear love from declining.

582
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,321
My love.

583
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,208
Do not worry, Princess.

584
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:54,006
I will not fail…
to bring you victory once more.

585
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,341
How excruciating.

586
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:42,513
How could love cause harm to others?

587
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:58,153
All I have done at the palace
as the princess's husband is…

588
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:03,659
…behead the treacherous Johyeon!

589
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:07,955
Slaughter the Silla scoundrels!

590
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:16,922
I wielded the sword
just as my beloved Princess ordered me to…

591
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:22,678
…and my whole body
is now drenched in blood.

592
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,195
Is this the way of the tiger and dragon…

593
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:43,073
that I swore to the princess?

594
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:46,618
This endless cycle of bloodshed?

595
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:52,499
When I first laid eyes
on my beloved princess at the palace pond…

596
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:58,922
under the fluttering peach blossoms,

597
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:02,509
I never imagined
things would turn out this way.

598
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:06,889
But…

599
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,850
…even if I were to go back…

600
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,481
Ondal.

601
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:17,941
My princess.

602
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,659
Ondal!

603
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,289
Ondal…

604
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:33,999
My dear husband…

605
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,460
You will be all right.

606
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:39,213
I shall go look for help.

607
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:53,060
Life is not always quite rosy…

608
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,439
and so many cry in desperation.

609
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,316
My love…

610
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:03,153
please do not speak.

611
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,907
Your wound will get worse.

612
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,619
So tell me, what makes you cry so?

613
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,873
What is making you so sad?

614
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:26,385
M-My love?

615
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,096
My love.

616
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,932
My love.

617
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,434

Director, the audience is going wild.

639
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,282
They're clamoring
for more tickets outside.

640
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,159
All right, that'll do it.

641
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:17,329
They've seen
that Okgyeong is as good as ever,

642
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:19,373
so they'll no longer accuse her
of taking opium.

643
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,208
And this joint performance…

644
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:24,378
will be a success.

645
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:40,894
Moon Okgyeong!

646
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,145
Okgyeong!

647
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,855
Moon Okgyeong!

648
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,065
Come out, Okgyeong!

649
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,401
- Where is she?
- Okgyeong!

650
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:52,864
Moon Okgyeong!
Moon Okgyeong! Moon Okgyeong!

651
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:59,413
Moon Okgyeong! Moon Okgyeong!

652
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:05,794
Moon Okgyeong! Moon Okgyeong!

653
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:09,548
Do you hear the crowd?

654
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,720
Heo Youngseo and Hong Jooran?

655
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:17,848
They've got a long way to go.

656
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:20,809
Okgyeong.

657
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:23,687
Let's leave Maeran
and join another troupe.

658
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:27,649
No, we could even create our own troupe.

659
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:29,776
I didn't tell you…

660
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,488
but this joint performance
will be my last.

661
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:35,657
I know.

662
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:39,619
-You knew?
-Yeah.

663
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:43,498
So what?
What does that have to do with me?

664
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:45,333
What?

665
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,044
Today's my last day too.

666
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,300
Your last day?

667
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,261
I'm leaving.

668
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,139
I'm quitting gukgeuk as of today.

669
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,559
I have nothing more to show

670
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:04,603
or anything more I want to do.

671
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,688
If you're leaving,

672
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,982
where are you going?

673
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,485
I'm going to be in films.

674
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,361
I already signed a contract.

675
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:16,239
Then what about me?

676
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,785
I'm coming with you, right?

677
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,704
Let's go our separate ways from now on.

678
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:25,457
You can live your own life,

679
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,917
and I'll live mine.

680
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,585
You're joking, right?

681
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,630
No!

682
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:33,215
You can't do this.

683
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:37,010
Who do you think saved you
from your opium addiction?

684
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:41,306
I even had Mr. Ko bribe the press
with money from the troupe.

685
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:46,311
I made you into the flawless prince
while I got my hands dirty.

686
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,731
You're not going anywhere
until I let you go.

687
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:53,652
Don't think
that you had me under your control.

688
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:57,531
You've never once had me in your grasp.

689
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:02,953
Okgyeong.

690
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:06,331
I was wrong.

691
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:08,250
I won't ever do that again.

692
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:11,461
Please don't abandon me.

693
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:20,262
Is there anything left between us?

694
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:25,684
If you want me to remember us fondly,

695
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,520
don't sink any lower.

696
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,870
Hyerang.

697
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:48,123
Your performance today was the best.

698
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,587
Goodbye, Princess.

699
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,351
Okgyeong.

700
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,021
I was on my way to get you.

701
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:14,065
Let's go.
The press is waiting for your interview.

702
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,320
Thank you for everything, Director.

703
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,325
You taught me gukgeuk
when I had lost my way

704
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:26,036
and shaped me into the best male lead.

705
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,748
I had a great time.

706
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,709
Okgyeong.

707
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:37,255
You just had an amazing performance.
Why are you doing this?

708
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,424
I promised you, didn't I?

709
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:42,052
That I'd let you pick
whatever play you like.

710
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:44,304
Three months ago,

711
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,681
that would have been a tempting offer.

712
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:49,517
But now…

713
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:53,063
…it feels quite late.

714
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:55,649
You're the lead of this whole production.

715
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,610
Are you really going to leave like this?

716
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:02,989
Then what about the rest of the shows
and your audience?

717
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:05,867
What about Maeran?

718
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:08,328
You know you can't keep me here.

719
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:11,957
I no longer have any attachment to Maeran…

720
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,459
or gukgeuk.

721
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:20,632
Do you have
no sense of responsibility at all?

722
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:22,092
Responsibility?

723
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:26,429
Did you really expect that from me?

724
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:30,058
Please have a good life, ma'am.

725
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:41,778
Okgyeong!

726
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:42,946
-Okgyeong!
-My goodness!

727
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:44,030
Okgyeong!

728
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,032
Moon Okgyeong!

729
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:48,576
Okgyeong.

730
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:50,704
Okgyeong.

731
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:53,081
Open this door.

732
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:54,457
Moon Okgyeong!

733
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,459
Okgyeong!

734
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:59,129
Okgyeong! Okgyeong!

735
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:00,839
- Okgyeong!
- Okgyeong!

736
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:03,008
Okgyeong! Okgyeong!

737
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:05,051
Okgyeong!

738
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:09,639
Okgyeong…

739
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,645
Okgyeong…

740
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,231
Okgyeong!

741
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:29,451
Go home, I'll do it.

742
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:30,869
It's fine.

743
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:33,705
I'm almost done, so you should go home.

744
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,502
What is it? You have something to say?

745
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:49,971
Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere.

746
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:54,517
I made a promise.

747
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:06,529
Mother.

748
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,700
About Jeongnyeon.

749
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,536
I think it's time…

750
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,206
to let her go.

751
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:19,542
Let her go where?

752
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:23,380
You little brat.

753
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,508
Are you trying to help her run away again?

754
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:28,635
No, I'm not.

755
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:31,096
And you heard her when she said

756
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:34,182
she's not going anywhere
until you let her go.

757
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:36,476
Then why would you say that?

758
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,562
Do you have to upset me as well?

759
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,523
Jeongnyeon…

760
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:46,778
brought all her gukgeuk scripts
all the way from Seoul.

761
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:48,279
Where are they?

762
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:51,408
-Mother! Mother, no!
-I'm going to burn them all.

763
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,868
Mother, there's no point in burning them.

764
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:57,580
She probably has every line
memorized by heart.

765
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:06,631
I saw her…

766
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:12,262
caressing those scripts
in the room by herself.

767
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:16,975
She wasn't crying or anything,
just caressing them.

768
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:19,185
And I stood there watching…

769
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:22,856
because there was nothing I could do.

770
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,321
Mother, I don't know

771
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,032
what it feels like to have a dream.

772
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:35,994
I've never had one.

773
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,079
So…

774
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,916
I can only imagine
how desperate Jeongnyeon is.

775
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:45,170
But you're different from me.

776
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:51,134
You know better than anyone
how desperate she must be for her dream.

777
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,095
So please…

778
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:58,099
Could you please…

779
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:04,564
Could you please let her have this
just this once?

780
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:55,865
Young Master.

781
00:58:57,116 --> 00:59:01,996
Doesn't it just
knock your socks right off?

782
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:22,934
Young Master.

783
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:27,730
Doesn't it just
knock your socks right off?

784
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:31,651
This is what I was telling you about.

785
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:35,822
The most famous pavilion on all the land,
Gwanghallu Pavilion.

786
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:37,949
What do you think?

787
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:39,242
Oh, come now. What do you think?

788
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:42,745
Isn't it as amazing as I said it'd be?

789
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:52,547
Today is the May 5th festival.

790
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:55,508
That is Chunhyang, the daughter of Wolmae,
a retired courtesan.

791
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,760
I guess it's her turn on the swing.

792
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:03,516
Just say the word, Young Master,

793
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:07,729
and I, Bangja,
shall go like the true man that I am

794
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:09,230
and call her over.

795
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,866

Jeongnyeon.

813
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:51,416
Jeongnyeon.

814
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:52,834
Mm?

815
01:01:57,130 --> 01:02:00,341
Get up and come with me.

816
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:10,309
Long ago,

817
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:14,355
there was a pansori master
named Jung Jeongryeol.

818
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:20,027
He was famous for singing Chunhyangga.

819
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:24,073
And whenever he sang,

820
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:28,411
everyone who heard would cry.

821
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,038
They just couldn't help it.

822
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:34,375
But his voice…

823
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:37,712
is unfit for pansori.

824
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:44,510
His voice was very raspy,

825
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,888
and he couldn't sing very high.

826
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,640
He was just born that way.

827
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:54,353
So how did he become a pansori master?

828
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:58,149
His voice must have sounded
so harsh and broken.

829
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:00,610
Have you ever heard him sing?

830
01:03:02,695 --> 01:03:03,988
I have.

831
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,367
Master Jung

832
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:14,499
had honed his raspy voice for years on end

833
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:20,588
and had transformed it
into a hoarse yet powerful voice.

834
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:24,008
To anyone listening,

835
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:26,594
his singing didn't sound broken at all,

836
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:29,263
but in fact, seemed full.

837
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:32,809
So people used to say…

838
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:38,356
that he sang with a voice he didn't have.

839
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:41,609
That he sang something out of nothing.

840
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:50,660
A voice he didn't have?

841
01:03:54,121 --> 01:03:55,665
Sing something out of nothing?

842
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,418
So Jeongnyeon.

843
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:02,922
What are you going to use…

844
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:05,967
to fill the gaps in your voice?

845
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:10,638
What about you?

846
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:16,727
What would you have used
to fill in the gaps?

847
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,067
I think…

848
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:31,909
I would have used my tears

849
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:35,454
or my sighs.

850
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:42,378
Look.

851
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:46,257

01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:03,065

Here, try these on.

877
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:03,996
Good.

878
01:08:04,538 --> 01:08:08,250
There you go. Perfect.

879
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:11,837
They look great, don't they?

880
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:19,428
I'm fine.

881
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:24,308
Your dad doesn't need new shoes.

882
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:28,646
All right, let's go.

883
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:31,857
Time to go.

884
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:34,360
Come on.

885
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:37,780
Here we go.
