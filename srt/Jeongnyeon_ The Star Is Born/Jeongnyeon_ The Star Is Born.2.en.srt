It's just that I thought
there would be a script.

Any actor needs to be able
to act without a script.

Anything could happen on stage

When that happens,
are you going to space out and do nothing

Okgyeong wants you at her house.

1066
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:20,074
Me?

1067
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:25,038
[♪ chirpy music playing]

1068
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,711
Why did you come along?

1069
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:35,423
This is my only chance
to see Okgyeong's place.

1070
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:38,134
And Hyerang also lives here.

1071
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:40,720
They live together?

1072
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:42,930
They must be really close.

1073
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:46,601
They've been close
ever since Maeran began.

1074
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:53,107
All right. I'm ready.

1075
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:54,192
Ring the bell.

1076
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:56,653

Mm… it's a secret.

1082
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:19,175
What are you two doing here?

1083
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:22,720
Okgyeong called me over
to tell me something.

1084
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:23,846
She did?

1085
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,601
[scoffs] She must really be doting on you.

1086
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:33,606
She's never taken such an interest
in any other troupe members.

1087
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:38,027
Make sure to watch your actions
for her sake.

1088
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:42,532
-[Hyerang] We'll be eating dinner out.
-[housekeeper] Yes, ma'am.

[gasps, exclaims]

1093
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:01,008
Hey, Jeongnyeon.

1094
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:03,344
-Oh! Hello.
-[Okgyeong] Hey, Jooran.

1095
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:04,429
Hello.

1096
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:05,763
Come have a seat.

1097
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,183
[Jooran chuckles shyly]

1098

1099
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:29,203
What… What was that?

1100
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:31,372
That was a movie.

1101
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,375
It's cool, isn't it?

1102
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:35,752
Yes.

1103
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:41,382
The screening for Chunhyangjeon last year
had 150,000 people in the audience.

1104
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,679
Movies are soon going to
take over the industry.

1105
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:50,641
Just as how gukgeuk
is so popular these days,

1106
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:53,352
in a little while,

1107
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,313
movies are going to be just as popular.

1108
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:59,817
Then would we be losing
our audience to movies?

1109
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:00,985
That's not good.

1110
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:03,279
[soft chuckle]

1111
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:09,035
So how are you doing
in the troupe, Jeongnyeon?

1112
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:10,495
I heard you got the role of Bangja.

1113
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:11,621
Oh!

1114
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:15,583
I actually had something
to ask you about that.

1115
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:19,921
Is there a secret to playing male roles?

1116
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:22,298
A secret to playing male roles?

1117
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:23,508
Yes.

1118
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:26,803
As a girl, I can't seem
to play the male role right.

1119
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:31,766
I get so awkward and embarrassed
that I keep freezing up.

1120
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:36,229
Since you're the best
at playing male roles,

1121
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:40,024
I thought you might have a secret
to help me get it right.

1122
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:41,234
[sharp inhale]

1123
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:43,569
I think you have the wrong idea.

1124
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:44,654
What?

1125
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:47,323
I have no secret to playing male roles.

1126
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:49,116
I just…

1127
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,953
convince the audience
of what my character is going through

1128
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:53,704
and what they're feeling.

1129
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:56,749
What's important right now

1130
01:03:56,833 --> 01:04:01,629
is how you'll convince the audience
of your own interpretation of Bangja.

1131
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:03,965
I'm getting more confused.

1132
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:05,341
[Okgyeong chuckles]

1133
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:06,509
That's understandable.

1134
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:09,929
Acting is something
you should experience with your body,

1135
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:12,056
not something to sit and ponder about.

1136
01:04:12,139 --> 01:04:13,599
Then what do I do now?

1137
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:19,564
[groaning] I have less than a week left,
and I have no idea where to even start.

1138
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:22,900
Should I show you a shortcut?

1139
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:25,653
Yes.

1140
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,324
"Jamyunggo"

1141
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:32,326
[Okgyeong] I actually called you here
to give you this.

1142
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:37,498
T-This is…

1143
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:39,458
It's the audition script
for the official performance.

1144
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:42,670
You're now going to prepare
for this audition.

1145
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:47,341
I didn't bring you to Seoul
just so you could perform with trainees.

1146
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:49,552
I consider you as my successor--

1147
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:50,970
No…

1148
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:54,348
as my rival for male leads in the future.

1149
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:56,434
[♪ dramatic music playing]

1150
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:00,980
But how could I…

1151
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:02,732
I know you can.

1152
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,527
You'll be rising to the top

1153
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:09,864
higher and faster than anyone else.

1154
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:12,700
So don't waste your time.

1155
01:05:14,201 --> 01:05:18,164
Trainee performances are for those
who need to prove themselves.

1156
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,584
But you've already proven yourself to me.

1157
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:26,631
All you need to do is follow me.

1158
01:05:28,132 --> 01:05:29,342
You will, won't you?

1159
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,805
[Youngseo] You have no right to be here

1160
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:37,016
and yet here you are
all thanks to Moon Okgyeong.

1161
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:40,394
Everyone else had to work for their place,
so what makes you special?

1162
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:42,063
You're not even a real trainee.

1163
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:43,439
You think you can act out

1164
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:44,899
just because you're close
to Moon Okgyeong?

1165
01:05:44,982 --> 01:05:46,901
[Chorok] How about you try to get
an audition script from Doaeng?

1166
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:50,196
The one for the official performance
in a few months.

Everyone already thinks I have no skills

1173
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:36,534
and don't deserve to be here.

[Chorok] You also had her play Bangja
so she'd leave the troupe.

1179
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:53,134
[Jeongnyeon] Someone who can orchestrate
the audience's reactions.

The jester of the whole show.

1181

That's Bangja.
