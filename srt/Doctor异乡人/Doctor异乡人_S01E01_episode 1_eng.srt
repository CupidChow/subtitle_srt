2
00:00:25,907 --> 00:00:30,657
 1994, Seoul
The tension on the Korean peninsula due to N.Korea's withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty

3
00:00:30,727 --> 00:00:33,967
 is continuing to build as N.Korean Leader Kim Il Sung

4
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:35,857
 has not been seen for dozens of days.

5
00:00:35,857 --> 00:00:39,187
Where is it?

6
00:00:40,447 --> 00:00:42,117
I found it!

7
00:00:42,757 --> 00:00:46,247
♪ My friend, where are  you going?

8
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:48,887
Oh?

9
00:00:48,887 --> 00:00:51,087
Fly!

10
00:00:53,937 --> 00:00:57,137
Lawsuit. Plaintiff, Park Chul.

11
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,527
Defendant, Myeongwoo Hospital?

12
00:01:02,457 --> 00:01:05,147
What is a "lawsuit", Dad?

13
00:01:09,727 --> 00:01:11,567
I'll leave for school now.

14
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:15,947
♬ Where do you plan on going? ♬

15
00:01:17,347 --> 00:01:20,077
I will now be going to school.

16
00:01:29,517 --> 00:01:32,727
Is this Professor Park Chul's house?

17
00:01:32,727 --> 00:01:34,847
That's my father.

18
00:01:34,847 --> 00:01:36,657
Is he inside?

19
00:01:37,237 --> 00:01:39,067
Dad.

20
00:01:41,287 --> 00:01:43,957
Are you Professor Park Chul?

21
00:01:43,987 --> 00:01:47,957
My name is Jang Seok Joo from the National Defense Committee of the National Assembly.

22
00:02:02,017 --> 00:02:04,827
I heard that Myeongwoo Hospital had well organized means of doing things.

23
00:02:04,857 --> 00:02:08,567
But I didn't expect that a member of the National Assembly would mobilize to stop a medical lawsuit.

24
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:11,597
There will be no trial today.

25
00:02:14,707 --> 00:02:16,247
Yes?

26
00:02:16,247 --> 00:02:20,677
Yes, Lawyer Choi. I will arrive on time to court.

27
00:02:21,997 --> 00:02:23,447
The trial is postponed?

28
00:02:23,457 --> 00:02:28,167
There is a serious threat to national security, so I called the Minister of Justice for a favor.

29
00:02:29,777 --> 00:02:32,327
It's only a trial to reveal a medical error.

30
00:02:32,347 --> 00:02:34,567
What does that have to do with national security?

31
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:36,947
The government predicts that in a couple of days on the Korean peninsula,

32
00:02:36,947 --> 00:02:39,737
a war will break out.

33
00:02:49,557 --> 00:02:51,527
It's a tank. A tank.

34
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:53,097
What is that?

35
00:02:53,127 --> 00:02:55,857
Ahjusshi, you're so cool!

36
00:03:01,217 --> 00:03:03,547
Look at the wheels on that tank!

37
00:03:06,777 --> 00:03:09,277
It's a helicopter! Helicopter!

38
00:03:09,277 --> 00:03:11,207
Wow!

39
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:19,487
The war will start with the bombing from the US.

40
00:03:19,487 --> 00:03:22,877
Currently, the US's nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, USS George Washington, and

41
00:03:22,877 --> 00:03:27,717
tens of other military warships and nuclear-powered submarines are on standby to attack the North.

42
00:03:27,717 --> 00:03:28,997
Why would the USA attack North Korea...

43
00:03:28,997 --> 00:03:32,747
Specifically, they're targeting the North's nuclear generating station.

44
00:03:32,747 --> 00:03:37,537
The US is planning to completely destroy it to prevent the North from arming themselves with nuclear weapons.

45
00:03:37,537 --> 00:03:42,047
However once the bombing starts, the North will retaliate,

46
00:03:42,047 --> 00:03:46,417
and that will cause a full-scale war between the North and the South.

47
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:55,817
What's the reason?

48
00:03:55,817 --> 00:04:00,577
I'm just a cardio-thoracic surgeon who only knows how to fix hearts.

49
00:04:00,577 --> 00:04:02,847
So why are you saying these words to me?

50
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:07,217
Because only you can stop the war.

51
00:04:13,107 --> 00:04:15,437
Ahjussi, the alarm is ringing.

52
00:04:25,357 --> 00:04:28,007
I'm back from school.

53
00:04:46,977 --> 00:04:48,547
Dad!

54
00:04:49,477 --> 00:04:52,487
Then I will be waiting for your call.

55
00:05:02,907 --> 00:05:04,577
Did you not go to the hospital?

56
00:05:04,577 --> 00:05:07,067
Leave after eating lunch, please?

57
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:10,557
I'm going to be late, so eat something out of the refrigerator.

58
00:05:10,587 --> 00:05:12,387
Hey.

59
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:19,667
Everybody, move!

60
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:24,167
- Aigoo! Why are you like this?
- Move, move!

61
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:25,907
Aigoo, look here!

62
00:05:25,907 --> 00:05:27,787
Aigoo, what are you doing?

63
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:31,227
Aigoo! Stop them!

64
00:05:31,277 --> 00:05:35,157
He must be selling something delicious, Dad.

65
00:05:35,157 --> 00:05:39,297
 According to the distribution industry, usually about 30 cases  of ramen are sold per day.

66
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,657
 But just today alone, hundreds of  cases have been sold.

67
00:05:42,657 --> 00:05:46,747
 In a matter of three days, about 50,000,000 ramen servings  have been sold throughout the nation.

68
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:47,957
Let's eat.

69
00:05:47,957 --> 00:05:52,107
On my way to school, I saw loads of tanks and soldiers.

70
00:05:52,107 --> 00:05:54,487
If there's a war, can't we go to America?

71
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:58,797
In America... Mom is there.

72
00:05:58,837 --> 00:06:00,797
Wars don't happen so easily.

73
00:06:00,797 --> 00:06:03,497
 Seoul is not far from here.

74
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:06,357
 If there is a war, the land will be a sea of fire.

75
00:06:06,357 --> 00:06:09,197
 - What are you saying? 
- Assemblyman Sung, you'll probably not survive either.

76
00:06:09,197 --> 00:06:10,917
 Does that make sense?

77
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:13,907
 - Therefore, for this situation, 
- Do you think we will stand still and not do anything?

78
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:17,097
 - We must deliberate carefully about this situation.
- Hey, I'm talking right now.

79
00:06:17,097 --> 00:06:19,067
 Are you declaring a war?

80
00:06:19,067 --> 00:06:22,357
 I'm saying that they've declared a war. You're not listening to me.

81
00:06:22,357 --> 00:06:24,667
 No, why he--

82
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:34,437
What?!

83
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:37,977
What are you talking about? An unidentified cargo ship?

84
00:06:41,827 --> 00:06:46,457
Whoa whoa whoa!

85
00:06:47,997 --> 00:06:51,407
What's happening? Is there something out there?

86
00:07:08,557 --> 00:07:11,967
There is severe constriction of the coronary artery.

87
00:07:11,967 --> 00:07:15,037
If left alone, he won't last a month.

88
00:07:16,927 --> 00:07:19,297
But why this?

89
00:07:19,297 --> 00:07:23,507
If we keep that heart alive, we will be able to stop the war.

90
00:07:24,007 --> 00:07:28,087
Alright, then bring him to my hospital.

91
00:07:28,787 --> 00:07:31,937
That man cannot come here.

92
00:07:31,937 --> 00:07:34,867
Professor, you have to go to where that man is.

93
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:36,887
Where is that?

94
00:07:36,887 --> 00:07:38,957
North Korea.

95
00:07:44,977 --> 00:07:47,087
Then by chance?

96
00:07:47,117 --> 00:07:50,577
That's right. It's Kim Il Sung's heart.

97
00:07:51,787 --> 00:07:56,327
If Kim Il Sung dies like this, then the North will fall into deep chaos.

98
00:07:56,327 --> 00:08:00,777
But the US sees it as the perfect opportunity for an attack.

99
00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:08,017
 Mom 
001-1-949-24-19-25

100
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:19,417
 Listen to me!

101
00:08:20,527 --> 00:08:22,697
I told you clearly that I cannot tell you the reason.

102
00:08:22,697 --> 00:08:24,257
 I'm getting married in a few days.

103
00:08:24,257 --> 00:08:26,417
 Does it make sense to ask me to take care of him at this time?

104
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:27,957
I know it's a difficult favor.

105
00:08:27,957 --> 00:08:30,207
However, Hoon is also your son.

106
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:34,287
 You're always like that. You only think about yourself.

107
00:08:34,287 --> 00:08:37,547
 I want to forget everything that has to do with you. Both you and Hoon.

108
00:08:37,547 --> 00:08:38,347
 Hoon's mother.

109
00:08:38,347 --> 00:08:40,127
 I'm really sick and tired of this!

110
00:08:40,127 --> 00:08:43,437
 Let's never contact each other again.

111
00:09:33,537 --> 00:09:36,797
When you come back from school, Dr. Choi will be home.

112
00:09:36,797 --> 00:09:40,147
If you stay at Ahjusshi's place, your mom will come pick you up.

113
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:42,237
I want to be with you.

114
00:09:42,237 --> 00:09:44,357
Listen to my words.

115
00:09:45,387 --> 00:09:47,317
My mom...

116
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,887
She hates me, right?

117
00:09:57,787 --> 00:09:59,717
Dad.

118
00:10:01,287 --> 00:10:03,307
Dad!

119
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:06,547
Dad.

120
00:10:14,727 --> 00:10:17,637
I will now be going to school.

121
00:10:42,617 --> 00:10:47,157

122
00:10:49,467 --> 00:10:51,077
Hoon.

123
00:10:52,517 --> 00:10:54,097
Hoon.

124
00:12:28,387 --> 00:12:33,247
This is the most recent scenario of the war between North and South Korea which the U.S. army has created.

125
00:12:37,197 --> 00:12:40,347
Is it true that we're going to send a doctor to the North?

126
00:12:40,347 --> 00:12:43,187
Yes, it was to prevent the U.S. from bombing.

127
00:12:43,187 --> 00:12:46,787
With only one doctor? Explain it in a way that's understandable.

128
00:12:46,787 --> 00:12:52,087
The U.S. will start bombing once Kim Il Sung dies of the heart disease he is currently suffering from.

129
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:53,907
Once they lose their leader,

130
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:57,467
the U.S. sees it as the perfect timing to start a war.

131
00:12:57,467 --> 00:12:59,477
Then, the doctor went...

132
00:12:59,477 --> 00:13:03,777
Yes, it was to cure Kim Il Sung's heart.

133
00:13:03,777 --> 00:13:05,547
  Pyongyang Jusuk Palace

134
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:30,787
Once the bombing starts, North Korea will immediately

135
00:13:30,787 --> 00:13:33,017
counter-attack all of the

136
00:13:33,017 --> 00:13:35,277
U.S. Army facilities in South Korea.

137
00:13:35,277 --> 00:13:40,907
But the most important fact is that South Korea's nuclear development facility

138
00:13:40,907 --> 00:13:43,627
is their prime target.

139
00:13:44,147 --> 00:13:46,647
If there comes a day that even one of these were to explode,

140
00:13:46,647 --> 00:13:50,447
there will be an explosion tens of thousands of times the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.

141
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:54,677
Even if we were able to win the war,

142
00:13:54,677 --> 00:13:59,787
one-third of S. Korea's territory will be uninhabitable for  humans for the next 200 years.

143
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:20,847
His heart has stopped!

144
00:14:20,847 --> 00:14:23,787
- CPR!
- Get ready for CPR!

145
00:14:26,837 --> 00:14:29,157
One ampoule of epinephrine!

146
00:14:40,397 --> 00:14:44,187
Dr. Park, you must save him.

147
00:14:54,857 --> 00:14:56,397
Hoon.

148
00:15:14,637 --> 00:15:16,497
Assemblyman Jang!

149
00:15:21,047 --> 00:15:25,437
The U.S. has approved of the bombing.

150
00:15:25,437 --> 00:15:27,687
What?!

151
00:15:27,687 --> 00:15:29,627
President!

152
00:15:35,747 --> 00:15:38,737
- How did this happen, Assemblyman Jang?
- This is an emergency!

153
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:42,607
- This is not what we expected!
- It's not the time for this!

154
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:46,037
Why aren't you giving me a visa?

155
00:15:46,037 --> 00:15:50,197
We're here for a visa!

156
00:15:51,777 --> 00:15:53,667
  Ten years of Korea-US '  Security Initiative

157
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:56,647
  U.S. Embassy

158
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:37,567
- Get the pump ready.
- It's ready.

159
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:39,827
The tube as well.

160
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,567
Defibrillator.

161
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:52,677
Charge at 20 joules.

162
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:26,377
Hey, hey, hey!

163
00:17:26,377 --> 00:17:30,477
Hey, what's happening? Hey, what's going on?

164
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,337
Ambassador Brady, stop the operation right now!

165
00:17:34,337 --> 00:17:38,707
We are all going to die. Before it happens, we're all going to die.

166
00:17:48,257 --> 00:17:51,527
The operation has stopped.

167
00:18:31,467 --> 00:18:35,537
Let's wrap things up. Be on your guard to the end.

168
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:45,987
  Former President Jimmy Carter, who visited Pyeongyang,

169
00:18:45,987 --> 00:18:50,597
  received a promise from Kim Il Sung that developments in nuclear weapons will be stopped for a certain period of time.

170
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:56,817
 It looks like the war in the Korean peninsula that has been feared for the past several months will not occur at this time.

171
00:18:56,817 --> 00:18:59,177
Turbulence and chaos make a hero

172
00:18:59,177 --> 00:19:03,627
and that hero rules the world.

173
00:19:09,187 --> 00:19:11,417
Assemblyman Jang, I knew you'd do it!

174
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:15,047
You did it! Assemblyman Jang, you were awesome!

175
00:19:15,047 --> 00:19:17,907
You flatter me.

176
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:21,667
He did it, he did it!

177
00:19:33,777 --> 00:19:38,717
 They evaluated the outcome of the surgery to be promising.

178
00:20:05,947 --> 00:20:07,287
What is that?

179
00:20:07,287 --> 00:20:11,657
My dad did this. He sewed it up like this after he treated an injury.

180
00:20:11,657 --> 00:20:13,807
Do you want to become a doctor?

181
00:20:13,807 --> 00:20:14,807
Yes.

182
00:20:14,807 --> 00:20:18,617
I think saving someone who is about to die is a great thing.

183
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,687
Hey, that's cool.

184
00:20:30,037 --> 00:20:32,607
I'm Song Jae Hee.

185
00:20:33,437 --> 00:20:35,047
And you?

186
00:20:41,787 --> 00:20:43,457
Hoon.

187
00:20:44,047 --> 00:20:46,787
It's time to leave.

188
00:20:53,797 --> 00:20:57,007
Just a minute, Dad.

189
00:21:08,777 --> 00:21:11,987
My name is Hoon. Park Hoon.

190

♪ We're running to a strange country.

191
00:21:32,387 --> 00:21:37,007
♪ To the devil's hideout where Nina is held captive.

192
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:43,077
Oh, Dad. It's a strange-looking truck.

193
00:22:00,967 --> 00:22:07,267

194
00:22:18,957 --> 00:22:23,707
Dad, aren't we going home?

195
00:22:23,707 --> 00:22:26,197
I don't think that we can return home.

196
00:22:26,197 --> 00:22:27,647
Why?

197
00:22:48,987 --> 00:22:54,337
There's no need for another hero other than me, Jang Seok Joo, in South Korea.

198
00:22:58,957 --> 00:23:01,827
It's our hero, Jang Seok Joo!

199
00:23:03,397 --> 00:23:04,697
Jang Seok Joo!

200
00:23:04,697 --> 00:23:05,987
Jang Seok Joo!

201
00:23:05,987 --> 00:23:08,797
Let's send Jang Seok Joo to the Blue House!

202
00:23:08,797 --> 00:23:12,367
Jang Seok Joo!

203
00:23:12,367 --> 00:23:17,407
What happened to my son?! What happened to my son?!

204
00:23:17,407 --> 00:23:19,307
What happened to my Hoon?!

205
00:23:19,307 --> 00:23:25,977
My son, Hoon... What happened to him?!

206
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:42,267
Hello! I am Jang Seok Joo.

207
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:51,267
Jang Seok Joo! Jang Seok Joo! Jang Seok Joo!

208
00:24:08,817 --> 00:24:15,417
Those South Korean bastards are so merciless.

209
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:23,087
From this point on, Professor Park Chul of South Korea is assumed dead.

210
00:24:23,967 --> 00:24:30,367
From now on, you're going to live as our Honorable Leader's citizen. 
Comrade Park Chul.

211
00:24:50,237 --> 00:24:53,557
Ah, sorry. The tape got loose.

212
00:24:57,077 --> 00:24:59,967

213
00:24:59,967 --> 00:25:03,807
♬  Tell me, tell me ...  ♬

214
00:25:03,807 --> 00:25:07,577

215

(Hit song by Wonder Girls that sparked a dance craze in 2007)

216
00:25:11,587 --> 00:25:14,777
How is it? It's killer, huh?

217
00:25:14,777 --> 00:25:17,567
If you don't know this in the South, you're pretty much a spy.

218
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:22,167
That's why when the intelligence agency sends its officers to South Korea,

219
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:26,167
they send them after teaching them this. It's called 'Tell Me.'

220
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:27,797
How much is it?

221
00:25:27,797 --> 00:25:30,047
- Two dollars.
- Oh.

222
00:25:30,047 --> 00:25:33,737
♪ Tell me, tell me ...

Hey!

230
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:46,677
- Jae Hee.
- Shh!

231
00:27:10,357 --> 00:27:11,857
I can feel your heart beating.

232
00:27:11,857 --> 00:27:14,387
I'm scared, so stay still.

233
00:27:14,387 --> 00:27:18,607
You know what's going to happen to us if we get caught.

234
00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:19,937
It's destiny.

235
00:27:19,937 --> 00:27:22,507
Stop saying stupid things.

236
00:27:27,707 --> 00:27:31,847
They say that the heartbeat for each person is different.

237
00:27:31,847 --> 00:27:35,077
Just like there aren't any two people with the same face.

238
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:44,997
Listen. But it's the same as yours, right?

239
00:28:06,737 --> 00:28:10,437
So I'm saying it's destiny. You and I.

240
00:28:16,767 --> 00:28:18,927
I've decided.

241
00:28:18,927 --> 00:28:22,317
I've also decided.

242
00:28:22,317 --> 00:28:25,707
Hey, Jae Hee! Ah!

243
00:28:25,707 --> 00:28:27,047
Wait! Wait! Song Jae Hee!

244
00:28:27,047 --> 00:28:29,137
I'm going tell everything to your father.

245
00:28:29,137 --> 00:28:31,567
Ow, are you really going to do this to your fated destiny?

246
00:28:31,567 --> 00:28:34,927
Fated destiny? You wish.

247
00:28:37,597 --> 00:28:40,567
Put me down. Put me down now.

248
00:28:53,367 --> 00:28:57,967
I know your parents don't like me, but they can't tear apart our fate.

249
00:28:57,977 --> 00:29:01,217
Will you marry me?

250
00:29:01,217 --> 00:29:03,917
- Where did you get this? 
- It's pretty, huh?

251
00:29:03,917 --> 00:29:06,567
I risked my life selling those tapes from the South for this.

252
00:29:06,567 --> 00:29:10,687
I knew you were crazy, but you're really crazy. You were putting yourself in danger for this?

253
00:29:10,687 --> 00:29:13,267
Yeah, so it would be nice if you'd hurry up and marry me.

254
00:29:13,267 --> 00:29:15,247
No way.

255
00:29:23,997 --> 00:29:26,017
You're marrying me, okay?

256
00:29:26,017 --> 00:29:29,277
Okay. I will marry you.

257
00:29:29,277 --> 00:29:31,397
After a hundred years?

258
00:29:31,397 --> 00:29:34,857
What... Hey, hey hey. Jae Hee.

259
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:38,977
Hey, Song Jae Hee. A hundred years is too much, no?

260
00:29:47,227 --> 00:29:51,487
You weren't at the lecture. Just what are you up to?

261
00:29:51,487 --> 00:29:53,667
Sorry, Father.

262
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:43,347
What are you going to do if I suddenly disappear?

263
00:30:43,347 --> 00:30:47,177
What do you mean what would I do? I would have to search all over the world and find you.

264
00:30:47,177 --> 00:30:49,487
- Really?
- Of course.

265
00:30:49,487 --> 00:30:51,897
My father says he wants to see you.

266
00:30:51,897 --> 00:30:55,257
- Really? 
- Yeah. He said to come to dinner tonight.

267
00:30:55,257 --> 00:30:59,117
But be careful. My father is really scary.

268
00:31:00,377 --> 00:31:03,197
Yeah, well. I like scary people.

269
00:31:03,197 --> 00:31:06,477
- Come handsomely dressed. 
- Of course.

270
00:31:35,487 --> 00:31:38,887
You don't have to dress up that nicely to see the patients.

271
00:31:40,947 --> 00:31:43,227
Are we seeing patients today?

272
00:31:44,967 --> 00:31:47,977
We're going to be late. Let's go.

273
00:31:47,977 --> 00:31:50,277
- Can't you leave me out just for this once?
- I can't.

274
00:31:50,277 --> 00:31:52,817
Just today, really, just only today.

275
00:31:52,817 --> 00:31:57,827
Think about the waiting patients. If you still want to stay, then do so.

276
00:31:58,717 --> 00:32:03,257
Father, there won't be that many patients, right? There weren't that many last time.

277
00:32:26,237 --> 00:32:29,297
Diagnosing the patient without any equipment isn't easy.

278
00:32:29,297 --> 00:32:32,097
If you want to be a doctor at a place like this where there's not even an x-ray machine,

279
00:32:32,097 --> 00:32:36,637
you need to be able to pinpoint a patient's illness without any diagnostic equipment.

280
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:42,747
If we don't remove the infection in the pericardium, serious complications may arise.

281
00:32:42,747 --> 00:32:47,237
It's just been 2 months since I've been at the clinical science department. If I make a mistake as I pierce this through...

282
00:32:49,487 --> 00:32:52,107
I'm sure you've read your anatomy book numerous times.

283
00:32:52,107 --> 00:32:56,987
Using your hands, feel for those images that you have in your head.

284
00:32:56,987 --> 00:33:03,787
Sometimes, what you feel with your touch will reveal what's going on in the patient's body better than any equipment.

285
00:33:42,997 --> 00:33:44,037
Are you okay?

286
00:33:44,037 --> 00:33:46,287
Yes.

287
00:33:47,037 --> 00:33:49,307
Go on in.

288
00:33:57,057 --> 00:33:59,637
I'll take care of the rest.

289
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:01,727
Let's go in.

290
00:34:04,487 --> 00:34:06,447
 Take a seat.

291
00:34:38,807 --> 00:34:41,437
Jae Hee, Jae Hee!

292
00:34:45,057 --> 00:34:48,207
Jae Hee! Jae Hee!

293
00:34:55,937 --> 00:34:57,347
 Hoon!

294
00:34:57,347 --> 00:34:59,307
Jae Hee!

295
00:35:01,327 --> 00:35:03,917
Jae Hee. Jae Hee!

296
00:35:03,927 --> 00:35:07,177
Jae Hee! Jae Hee!

297
00:35:09,577 --> 00:35:11,847
Jae Hee!

298
00:35:22,247 --> 00:35:24,557
Seriously!

299
00:35:40,117 --> 00:35:41,267
Jae Hee.

300
00:35:41,267 --> 00:35:43,837
I'm scared.

301
00:35:43,837 --> 00:35:47,237
What's wrong Jae Hee?

302
00:35:50,487 --> 00:35:53,027
 Where is she?

303
00:36:25,977 --> 00:36:27,927
Wait!

304
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:31,147
Wait!

305
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,327
-You can't forget me!
-What are you doing?!

306
00:36:33,327 --> 00:36:35,777
You can't forget me, okay?

307
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:36,617
What are you doing?

308
00:36:36,617 --> 00:36:38,177
Hoon!

309
00:36:38,177 --> 00:36:40,557
Wait a minute! Wait!

310
00:36:40,557 --> 00:36:43,147
Hoon!

311
00:36:44,027 --> 00:36:45,077
Hoon!

312
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:47,457
What are you doing?!

313
00:36:56,707 --> 00:36:58,987
Hoon!

314
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,897
Jae Hee...

315
00:37:10,377 --> 00:37:20,717

316
00:37:37,867 --> 00:37:42,887
I heard her father was a member of the North Korean Communist Party in Japan. It looks like he's going to be expelled.

317
00:37:53,987 --> 00:37:56,717
Jae Hee did nothing wrong.

318
00:37:57,637 --> 00:37:59,727
For political crimes, the family gets punished as well.

319
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:01,017
I'm going to find her!

320
00:38:01,017 --> 00:38:02,977
You'll end up being suspected too!

321
00:38:02,977 --> 00:38:04,027
Stop it.

322
00:38:04,027 --> 00:38:07,137
She's someone who makes me feel thankful to be alive and breathing.

323
00:38:07,157 --> 00:38:10,087
She's the one person who helped me find my dream.

324
00:38:18,947 --> 00:38:21,637
Who is Dr. Park Hoon?

325
00:39:00,827 --> 00:39:04,047
Who are you?

326
00:39:10,027 --> 00:39:11,667
Jae Hee!

327
00:39:14,217 --> 00:39:19,187
I was going to leave just for a short while. My father is really ill...

328
00:39:27,957 --> 00:39:30,757
Are you Park Hoon?

329
00:39:34,647 --> 00:39:36,977
You're all grown up.

330
00:39:37,877 --> 00:39:42,977
This is the place where we perform research to protect and care for our leader's health.

331
00:39:42,977 --> 00:39:47,907
Therefore, once you come in here, you can never leave.

332
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:53,497
You have seen what happens to anyone trying to leave without permission.

333
00:39:57,147 --> 00:39:59,847
I never said I'd come here.

334
00:40:04,087 --> 00:40:06,587
It's the Government's choice.

335
00:40:06,587 --> 00:40:12,347
If I study hard while I'm here, could I become the doctor who takes care of our leader?

336
00:40:12,347 --> 00:40:14,307
I guess you could see it that way.

337
00:40:14,307 --> 00:40:15,427
Seeing it that way mea...

338
00:40:15,427 --> 00:40:20,147
Whether you become the doctor or the doctor's live human experimental subject...

339
00:40:20,147 --> 00:40:22,707
That depends on you.

340
00:41:22,127 --> 00:41:32,207
 5 Years Later

341
00:41:37,737 --> 00:41:39,747
Where did you go this time?

342
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,067
Not anywhere in particular.

343
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:43,777
It's suffocating being locked up.

344
00:41:43,777 --> 00:41:47,487
Don't you know that whoever leaves without permission will be shot to death?

345
00:41:47,507 --> 00:41:52,827
Don't act so cocky based on your ability. You could trip over your big nose.

346
00:41:52,827 --> 00:41:56,197
I've always had a big nose.

347
00:41:56,197 --> 00:41:58,367
Isn't that so?

348
00:41:58,367 --> 00:42:01,087
It's a surgery on a patient with myocardial infarction.

349
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,617
Get ready.

350
00:42:05,737 --> 00:42:07,687
Hoon.

351
00:42:09,967 --> 00:42:12,047
Father?

352
00:42:14,247 --> 00:42:17,057
This a place where outsiders can't come in, how did you get in here?

353
00:42:17,057 --> 00:42:21,107
I heard you frequently sneak out of the research facility without permission.

354
00:42:23,217 --> 00:42:24,387
Yes.

355
00:42:24,387 --> 00:42:28,587
I'm searching each and every detention camp.

356
00:42:30,557 --> 00:42:32,817
Are you still searching for Jae Hee?

357
00:42:32,817 --> 00:42:34,027
Of course.

358
00:42:34,027 --> 00:42:35,277
Stop it now.

359
00:42:35,277 --> 00:42:37,417
It could become dangerous for you.

360
00:42:38,257 --> 00:42:40,727
Don't interfere, Father.

361
00:42:40,727 --> 00:42:42,987
Hoon.

362
00:42:48,027 --> 00:42:50,187
Our Center of Research for Longevity

363
00:42:50,187 --> 00:42:54,087
is a place that performs research on ways to protect and care for the health of our leader.

364
00:42:54,087 --> 00:42:57,847
Thus, we hire the most talented individuals within North Korea.

365
00:42:57,847 --> 00:43:03,237
Also, we make them perform the majority of cardio-thoracic surgeries within North Korea.

366
00:43:03,237 --> 00:43:06,847
We make an effort to help them build experience in many ways.

367
00:43:06,847 --> 00:43:09,527
Let's have a look.

368
00:43:09,527 --> 00:43:12,057
Let's take a look.

369
00:43:15,147 --> 00:43:18,347
They're performing right coronary artery bypass surgery now.

370
00:43:18,347 --> 00:43:20,317
They're performing bypass.

371
00:43:33,707 --> 00:43:34,887
Stop the surgery.

372
00:43:34,887 --> 00:43:38,817
If they don't hurry, there will be necrosis of the cardiac muscle!

373
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:41,217
He says there will be cardiac muscle necrosis if the surgery stops now.

374
00:43:41,217 --> 00:43:45,567
Tell him that the power will be back on before that time and escort him out.

375
00:43:45,567 --> 00:43:47,097
It looks like he's going to continue.

376
00:43:47,097 --> 00:43:51,617
Stop the surgery! How can you suture together a 2mm artery when you can't even see anything?

377
00:43:51,627 --> 00:43:53,987
I've performed this surgery several thousands of times.

378
00:43:53,987 --> 00:43:56,257
What do you mean I can't see?

379
00:44:20,297 --> 00:44:21,837
Cut.

380
00:44:38,477 --> 00:44:41,567
Even though it was so dark, he made it.
(German)

381
00:44:41,567 --> 00:44:44,347
He said it was an impressive surgery.

382
00:44:48,697 --> 00:44:50,697
I'll leave the rest up to you.

383
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,527
Hey, Doctor Park.

384
00:44:59,527 --> 00:45:02,257
That was a memorable surgery.

385
00:45:02,257 --> 00:45:06,827
Those human experiments you've done for the past 5 years weren't for nothing, don't you think?

386
00:45:06,827 --> 00:45:10,257
-I know, but isn't it funny?
-What is?

387
00:45:10,257 --> 00:45:14,047
This is known to be the best research center in DPRK, but a black out?

388
00:45:14,047 --> 00:45:17,087
And during a surgery at that.

389
00:45:17,897 --> 00:45:22,847
What's the worry when we have Dr. Park.

390
00:45:28,717 --> 00:45:30,377
Is this person alive?

391
00:45:30,377 --> 00:45:31,877
At least for now.

392
00:45:31,877 --> 00:45:33,787
Where in the world did this patient come from in this condition?

393
00:45:33,787 --> 00:45:36,617
The 6th Special Security Unit.

394
00:45:36,617 --> 00:45:39,077
It's a secret concentration camp for political offenders.

395
00:45:39,077 --> 00:45:42,577
They experiment with herbs and such in Eastern medicine,

396
00:45:42,577 --> 00:45:45,977
and we research transplants or tumors.

397
00:45:45,977 --> 00:45:51,247
- I can't do it.
- Try saving the man by taking a useable organ from the girl.

398
00:45:51,247 --> 00:45:53,837
There shouldn't be any rejection symptoms since they're father and daughter.

399
00:45:53,837 --> 00:45:55,597
You want me to kill the daughter to save the father?

400
00:45:55,597 --> 00:45:59,527
We should show your ability to the "big noses" once more.
(Caucasians)

401
00:45:59,527 --> 00:46:03,967
We can get medical equipment that costs millions of dollars if they just approve.

402
00:46:03,967 --> 00:46:05,527
Did you not hear me say I can't do it?

403
00:46:05,527 --> 00:46:07,847
-Do as you're told!
-The daughter will die.

404
00:46:07,847 --> 00:46:11,777
What are you going to say to the father later?

405
00:46:11,777 --> 00:46:15,837
They all die anyway when they go to the concentration camp.

406
00:46:15,837 --> 00:46:19,807
I can't do it so find someone else.

407
00:46:29,927 --> 00:46:33,507
Don't act so honorable. You've done things much worse in here.

408
00:46:33,507 --> 00:46:36,967
That's why I said I can't do it anymore.

409
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,757
Park Hoon!

410
00:46:52,587 --> 00:46:55,227
Doctor, when is the surgery?

411
00:46:55,227 --> 00:46:56,327
What surgery?

412
00:46:56,327 --> 00:46:59,287
This is the patient sent from the Special Security Unit.

413
00:46:59,287 --> 00:47:01,497
I'm not doing it.

414
00:47:36,517 --> 00:47:40,497
 I'm Song Jae Hee. And you?

415
00:48:59,067 --> 00:49:01,497
Save her

416
00:49:02,407 --> 00:49:05,617
without minding me.

417
00:49:05,617 --> 00:49:08,687
My daughter Jae Hee.

418
00:49:16,147 --> 00:49:18,527
The organs are severely damaged.

419
00:49:18,527 --> 00:49:21,057
Especially parts of the kidneys.

420
00:49:21,057 --> 00:49:24,547
It looks like a girl. This must be hard for her.

421
00:49:29,207 --> 00:49:33,307
One of the man's kidneys isn't in good shape either.

422
00:49:33,307 --> 00:49:36,227
But it looks like there is hope though.

423
00:49:36,227 --> 00:49:39,187
What if we transplant the man's kidney to the girl?

424
00:49:40,367 --> 00:49:43,867
Then you'll lose the man.

425
00:49:43,867 --> 00:49:46,747
- I can save her.
- No.

426
00:49:46,747 --> 00:49:50,257
It's not what a doctor does.

427
00:49:50,257 --> 00:49:53,247
- Then what does a doctor do?
- Are you asking because you don't know?

428
00:49:53,247 --> 00:49:56,607
Do you know what I've done in the last 5 years?

429
00:49:56,607 --> 00:49:59,437
I've opened up the chest of healthy people many times.

430
00:49:59,437 --> 00:50:01,857
I did transplants fully knowing it'll be rejected,

431
00:50:01,857 --> 00:50:04,427
I've attached countless grafts that haven't been cross-matched.

432
00:50:04,427 --> 00:50:07,857
A job of a doctor when I can't save someone who's dying?

433
00:50:07,857 --> 00:50:11,707
What exactly is that, Father?

434
00:50:11,707 --> 00:50:15,077
You thought that at least a doctor wouldn't have to kill a person, right?

435
00:50:15,077 --> 00:50:17,167
Hoon.

436
00:50:17,167 --> 00:50:19,107
You were wrong, Father! Even a doctor...

437
00:50:19,107 --> 00:50:22,047
It's a world where even doctors kill people.

438
00:50:22,047 --> 00:50:26,597
In a place like that... I'm just saying

439
00:50:26,597 --> 00:50:29,967
that I'm going to kill a person to save my woman... What is...

440
00:50:31,837 --> 00:50:35,437
What's so wrong about that, Father?

441
00:50:49,157 --> 00:50:53,047
By chance, is this kid...

442
00:52:22,927 --> 00:52:25,097
Scalpel.

443
00:52:25,097 --> 00:52:28,327
 Wasn't it a man?

444
00:52:31,367 --> 00:52:34,737
To show off my ability, the girl will be better.

445
00:52:43,507 --> 00:52:46,667
They said they'll give us support for the surgical equipment.

446
00:52:49,557 --> 00:52:52,007
Really?

447
00:52:56,287 --> 00:52:58,657
Start.

448
00:53:01,937 --> 00:53:04,057
But under one condition.

449
00:53:04,057 --> 00:53:05,547
There's one condition.

450
00:53:05,547 --> 00:53:10,517
I also want to show the other doctors the skills of Park.

451
00:53:10,517 --> 00:53:15,637
He wants to show Doctor Park's skills to doctors from other countries.

452
00:53:22,367 --> 00:53:25,817
You mean I have to go all the way to Budapest?

453
00:53:25,817 --> 00:53:28,877
4-5 days should be sufficient.

454
00:53:30,427 --> 00:53:33,127
I don't have the time.

455
00:53:35,757 --> 00:53:37,907
Doctor Park.

456
00:53:37,907 --> 00:53:42,437
They said that they'll give us support for the surgical equipment only if you go.

457
00:53:45,437 --> 00:53:49,687
Shouldn't we look at the results of the patient who had the surgery?

458
00:53:49,687 --> 00:53:51,997
Are you really

459
00:53:51,997 --> 00:53:54,657
going to be like this?

460
00:54:22,637 --> 00:54:25,457
Don't worry, Jae Hee.

461
00:54:26,497 --> 00:54:29,667
I won't let you go again.

462
00:54:58,847 --> 00:55:01,197
Hoon.

463
00:55:01,197 --> 00:55:04,947
- Father.
- I've been waiting for a while.

464
00:55:04,947 --> 00:55:08,187
Why come here at this time?

465
00:55:08,187 --> 00:55:10,817
Did you get permission to come here?

466
00:55:10,817 --> 00:55:12,767
I have something to say.

467
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:16,387
If you're found, it'll be a big problem.  Before the electricity comes back on...

468
00:55:16,387 --> 00:55:19,347
Go to Budapest.

469
00:55:19,347 --> 00:55:23,217
There was a person I knew amongst the doctors who came here.

470
00:55:23,217 --> 00:55:24,957
Then the reason I have to go Budapest is?

471
00:55:24,957 --> 00:55:27,977
I finally got the definite answer today.

472
00:55:27,977 --> 00:55:31,387
It's your last chance to escape from here.

473
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:36,537
I'm sorry. I can't leave Jae Hee behind.

474
00:55:36,537 --> 00:55:39,047
That child will go with you.

475
00:55:40,077 --> 00:55:44,477
I know what she means to you.

476
00:55:44,477 --> 00:55:46,227
Father.

477
00:55:46,227 --> 00:55:50,667
If you leave tomorrow, I'll never see you again.

478
00:55:50,667 --> 00:55:54,927
Go and live happily with that child.

479
00:55:54,927 --> 00:55:57,317
What about you?

480
00:55:57,317 --> 00:56:00,107
Don't worry about me.

481
00:56:02,287 --> 00:56:04,167
Father.

482
00:56:14,657 --> 00:56:16,397
Father.

483
00:56:17,747 --> 00:56:19,647
I'm sorry.

484
00:56:23,637 --> 00:56:25,077
I can't go.

485
00:56:25,077 --> 00:56:26,657
Why?

486
00:56:26,657 --> 00:56:29,197
Is it because of me?

487
00:56:29,197 --> 00:56:31,167
I'll protect Jae Hee no matter what.

488
00:56:31,167 --> 00:56:32,567
Hoon.

489
00:56:32,567 --> 00:56:34,997
Go. I'll see you out.

490
00:56:47,097 --> 00:56:49,777
If you go through there, there's a secret tunnel.

491
00:56:49,777 --> 00:56:53,127
I use that whenever I want to leave secretly.

492
00:56:54,747 --> 00:56:57,097
Think about it once more.

493
00:56:57,097 --> 00:57:00,887
This is your final chance to escape from here.

494
00:57:00,887 --> 00:57:04,407
Go first. You'll be in trouble if the electricity comes back on.

495
00:57:08,047 --> 00:57:10,297
Hoon.

496
00:57:15,897 --> 00:57:18,257
I'll get going.

497
00:57:50,607 --> 00:57:52,677
Father.

498
00:58:06,907 --> 00:58:11,187
Father! Father! Father!

499
00:58:11,187 --> 00:58:16,027
Father! Father! Father!

500
00:58:25,327 --> 00:58:28,167
No, no, no, Father!

501
00:59:03,567 --> 00:59:05,267
Father!
