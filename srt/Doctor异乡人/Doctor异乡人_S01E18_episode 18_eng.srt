00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,200

2
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:32,930
Hey Water bottle, I told Ah Young not to cancel the reservation for the wedding hall.

3
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:39,180
After Ah Young gets married, please let her live like the other people, huh?

4
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,520
Hey, Water bottle.

5
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,410
Are you not leaving?!

6
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:47,040
Once, just once, help me act like an older brother.

7
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,570
What's going on?

8
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,430
Scalpel.

9
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,960
What are you doing Doctor Park?

10
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,860
Aigoo.

11
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,960
- What is this?
- What else could it be?

12
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,840
I lost.

13
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,720

What's going on?
♬  If you find me, you will be crying.  ♬

16
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,620
Prime Minister Jang?

17
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,010
Ah, yes?

18
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:47,560
I'm asking you to tell me what's happening.

19
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,090
The game is over.

20
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,970
♬  At the end of this road. ♬

21

25
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,820
What did you say?

26
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,290
I said I lost.

27
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,830
Say it one more time.

28
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,020
I lost, so put down the scalpel.

29

You know what you just did right?
 ♬  at the end of this road.  ♬

38
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,160
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,230
Are you saying sorry because you're really sorry?!

40
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,020
Do you know how I got here? How could you-

41
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,130
I'm Moon Hyung Wook.

42
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,180
I'm not dying like this.

43
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,470
Have you ever seen a weed die because it was stepped on?

44
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,060
I'm a weed, you punk!

45
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:44,760
It was like you, Doctor Park.  You know that, right?

46
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,330
I'm sorry Hoon.

47
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,630
I have no choice if I'm to let you go.

48
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,070
It was a decision befitting of you.

49
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,250
I'm sorry.

50
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,830
You don't have to be sorry. I knew you would do this.

51
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:10,920
Telling me that you were going to go with me from the beginning, it was all hypocrisy.

52
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,600
Jae Hee.

53
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,420
What did you do to my Father?

54
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,560
I heard that you transplanted my father's kidney to me,

55
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,310
which is why my father passed away.

56
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,820
How did you know?

57
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,220
I heard about it from Prime Minister Jang Seok Joo before the surgery.

58
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,660
He said Cha Jin Soo told him.

59
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,870
Tell me.

60
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,520
What did you do to my father?

61
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,300
I really had no other choice.

62
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,370
 Please save her.

63
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,810
 I don't care about myself.

64
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,000
 But that child

65
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,360
 has someone she has to meet.

66
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:31,070
 Please do me this favor.

67
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,750
 Please, my Jae Hee...

68
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,280
I'm sorry.

69
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,210
You are sorry? What for?

70
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,440
For killing my father?

71
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,550
Or for saving me?

72
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,680
I had no choice.

73
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,790
You had no choice?

74
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,830
- You should have just let me die instead.
- Jae Hee.

75
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,690
Then I would've died happy.

76
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,880
I would've died just treasuring the love I felt for you!

77
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,120
You did it to save me?

78
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,410
Is that love?

79
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,350
Saving me by killing my father?

80
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:16,170
No. That is... just your greed for wanting to save the girl you like.

81
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:20,390
My father died by that greed,

82
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:24,270
and you've kept that hidden from me till now.

83
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,260
It was a lie that you loved me.

84
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:32,020
After you did that, you just felt guilty.

85
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,890
You just tried to compensate for the wrong you did to me.

86
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,380
Please stop this.

87
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,180
Isn't this rather funny?

88
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:44,740
Even after that, you pretended to be a doctor to me.

89
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,390
You would win the competition and will go with me.

90
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,360
Then why didn't you do the surgery?

91
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,910
After saying that you wouldn't let me go alone, why?

92
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,530
It was all a hypocrisy.

93
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,990
- Jae Hee...
- Don't say that name either!

94
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,410
Don't appear in front of me again.

95
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:06,600
I won't forgive you even if I die.

96
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:52,380
Then is Han Jae Joon performing the surgery?

97
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,800
What will you do?

98
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,490
Let's do that. Let's do the surgery next week.

99
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,500
I will tell the Chief Secretary to try to make the time.

100
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,150
Then the hospital?

101
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,840
Myeongwoo Hospital will be doing the Prime Minister's surgery.

102
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,680
What's wrong?

103
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,450
She told me to not even call her.

104
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,420
She told me not to appear again,

105
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,370
and she said she won't forgive me.

106
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:56,890
I really wanted to save her.

107
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:01,120
And I was going to say it when the time was right.

108
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,010
No,

109
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,870
I couldn't say what I did.

110
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,180
If Jae Hee never found out,

111
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,720
I would never have been able to say it.

112
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,320
I really have no right.

113
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,500
Father told me never to forget that I'm a doctor.

114
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,450
From the start, I

115
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,000
was not a doctor or anything else, Mom.

116
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,950
Oh, Chief Han.

117
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,570
What brings you here?

118
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:57,310
I came here to congratulate you on your win.

119
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,190
I didn't know you were such an impudent person.

120
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,990
Thin and long...

121
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,730
That is my life's motto.

122
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:09,590
If I wasn't impudent, do you think I would have survived here?

123
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,470
Forgive me.

124
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,250
  Chairman

125
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,890
Come inside.

126
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,650
I am sorry.

127
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,930
It took too long.

128
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,170
Yes.

129
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:35,450
It did take a long time, but you worked hard.

130
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,060
Sit down.

131
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,340
What time is the director's meeting?

132
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,300
In 30 minutes, Chairman.

133
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,980
We should go together.

134
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,040
To the director's meeting?

135
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,360
I promised you an acting Chairman position.

136
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,340
I am a person who is clear about a skillful guy and a guy who's not.

137
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,880
Then Professor Moon?

138
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,760
We need to send him to a branch hospital.

139
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,950
Fill in the manpower you're lacking in the cardiothoracic department from the branch office for now.

140
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,380
How about Dr. Park Hoon?

141
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,260
I asked Sang Jin to find if there are any grounds to revoke his medical license.

142
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:18,890
If there are none, even if I have to pressure the association I'm going to make sure he can never hold a scalpel again.

143
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,580
Is there a reason why you hate Dr. Park that much?

144
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,550
Of course, there is.

145
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:30,010
There was a time when that guy's father arrogantly challenged me.

146
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,100
His name is Park Chul.

147
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,540
He said he would testify in a medical malpractice lawsuit.

148
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,620
He caused chaos in our hospital.

149
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,980
At that time, if I hadn't taken care of him,

150
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,930
there wouldn't even be today's Myeongwoo.

151
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:59,880
The last year's profit has dropped by 10%.

152
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,610
It's a temporary condition for supervising the number of patients.

153
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,690
What's happening with the Jeju Island branch hospital's approval case?

154
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:09,570
We're discussing it with the local government right now. It'll be settled soon.

155
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,110
 My father didn't go to North Korea for fame.

156
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,350
 To stop a war,

157
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:19,000
 no, he went because he was deceived by Chairman Oh Joon Gyu and Jang Seok Joo.

158
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,080
Chief Han.

159
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,070
What are you doing, Chief Han?

160
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,440
Excuse me?

161
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,800
Stand up and say something.

162
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,970
What are we talking about?

163
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,890
He must be out of it.

164
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:46,990
Well, in the history of our hospital, he was appointed as the youngest acting Chairman,

165
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,800
it would be hard to believe.

166
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,660
You have been approved unanimously.

167
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,120
Please get up quickly.

168
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,210
If you hadn't done bad things and had studied well from the beginning,

169
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:33,320
we wouldn't have even been in the situation where we had to decide to get the surgery or not!

170
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,220
I am sorry.

171
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,910
Is that all you can say?

172
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,250
Ah Young.

173
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,540
What?

174
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,290
I won't tell you that I will work hard,

175
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:45,700
and I won't say I will act like a good older brother either.

176
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,900
Instead,

177
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,080
I will definitely do

178
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,940
the surgery you will need in the future.

179
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,450
Really?

180
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,180
Yes.

181
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,320
Ah, you scared me!

182
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,090
Thanks, Oppa.

183
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,900
Instead, make sure to keep your word you said earlier.

184
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,870
Okay?

185
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,710
 Chief Han Jae Joon

186
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,420
What can I get you?

187
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,800
Give me four of this.

188
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,430
- 4 D sets.
- Yes.

189
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:00,720
I am sorry, Chief Han.

190
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,440
About what?

191
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,920
The fact that I disregarded your judgment.

192
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,060
I am really sorry.

193
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,010
It is okay so cheer up already.

194
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:11,030
If I were you, I would've contemplated a lot also.

195
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,040
Go ahead, first.

196
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,900
Your order is here.

197
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,370
By chance, are you able to contact Dr. Park?

198
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,520
He doesn't pick up his phone?

199
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,510
By chance, if you see him, please tell him to call me.

200
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,490
 Resignation letter.

201
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,760
I decided to move because there was an opening in a clinic in the neighborhood.

202
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:49,170
If Professor Moon goes to the branch office, a position for an assistant professor will open up.

203
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,840
Will that make me something other than a trash-like doctor?

204
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,910
There is something other than just a resignation letter.

205
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:01,980
A witness statement of the things you and the chairman ordered me to do.

206
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,150
Is this a threat?

207
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,990
It's advice.

208
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:13,000
Advice to not become more of a monster in this hellish place.

209
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:17,590
Because I don't want to live here like a foreigner forever, either.

210
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,530
 Resignation.

211
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,030
This is Han Jae Joon.

212
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:53,040
 Can you please come to the Chairman's office for a moment?

213
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,420
I thought the Chairman called for me.

214
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,620
It's very important so please do this favor.

215
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,440
They told me to bring it, but

216
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,910
I have to  host the Directors tonight.

217
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:27,120
  Myeongwoo University Hospital Development Fund
Confidential

218
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,950
 Development Fund Participants

219
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,680
And Chief Han,

220
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,890
you can go and  you need to just  hand it to Lawyer Kim.

221
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,010
I understand.

222
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,880
Sit down.

223
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,500
Why isn't Sang Jin coming?

224
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,170
He sent it through Chief Han.

225
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:23,060
This punk, how could he order someone else to do it?

226
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,620
Call Sang Jin and tell him to come home immediately.

227
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,560
Yes.

228
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:52,210
But why aren't you two talking?

229
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,030
Were we like that?

230
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:01,090
It's because I'm concerned his whole day was hard.

231
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,980
Soo Hyeon, did you know Chief Han became an acting Chairman?

232
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,300
Yes.

233
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,030
Yes? That's all?

234
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,290
Congratulations Jae Joon.

235
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,980
Thanks.

236
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,740
With the hospital family, there will be a congratulation party.

237
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,630
A congratulation party?

238
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,060
That's right.

239
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:25,050
Prime Minister's surgery team has been decided, and we have to congratulate Chief Han for becoming an acting Chairman.

240
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:28,360
And we need to take care of your relationship as well.

241
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,720
What relationship?

242
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,300
What's there to ask? Of course it's marriage.

243
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,070
Is that alright?

244
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,790
Yes, Chairman.

245
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,900
Jae Joon.

246
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,890
Sorry Father.  I'm a bit late.

247
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,450
How could you have Chief Han take this kind of a document?

248
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:59,570
I thought this much would be okay since he's even taken your acting position.

249
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:02,750
Even so, is this an ordinary document?

250
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:06,100
I'm sorry Father. But Chief Han wouldn't possibly-

251
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,030
Shut up!

252
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:19,180
Don't worry too much about the wedding.

253
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,800
I'll take care of it.

254
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,980
I'm sorry.

255
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,930
No, I'm sorry.

256
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,970
Also about Doctor Park,

257
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,250
there was a misunderstanding about that person.

258
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,320
What misunderstanding?

259
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:44,830
Just that he is someone that you can like.

260
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,580
Just know that's how I'm thinking.

261
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,950
- You were here.
- Yes.

262
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,600
But why did the Chief want us to come here?

263
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,520
Because of Dr. Guem's wedding, he has something to say about the surgery team.

264
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,050
Oh.  Where is the Chief?

265
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,420
He's with the directors.

266
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,420
But did the chief really become the Chariman?

267
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,650
An acting Chairman.  But it's almost similar.

268
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:23,140
Wow, he's amazing. He finally took over this castle.

269
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,080
This castle?

270
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,890
Yes, as a joke, Chief

271
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:30,190
has occasionally told stories about the knight seducing the princess to take over the castle.

272
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:32,300
But that knight

273
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:36,270
really fell in love with the princess, so he was agonizing over it.

274
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,260
Would he be able to take over the castle like that?

275
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:42,040
Exactly. On top of that,  he said that this princess met another knight and confessed to him.

276
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,720
But after seeing her getting rejected and crying, he said his heart was really in pain.

277
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,810
That's not it. At first I also thought that it might be Chief's story, but it's not.

278
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:53,240
You two are always close and decisively, you

279
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,780
wouldn't confess to another knight or anything.

280
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,620
 I'll tell you my heart clearly so listen carefully.

281
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:04,230
 No matter what I do in the future, forgive me.

282
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:08,340
Um, perhaps did the chief

283
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,530
say why that knight tried to take over the castle?

284
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:14,500
I don't think so. He didn't talk about that.

285
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:30,960

286
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,410
 The person is not available, so after the beep...

287
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,120
Doctor Park.

288
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,660
What are you saying? That Chief Han is planning something?

289
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,040
I'm asking just in case.

290
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:56,300
He's a person who wants to finish the Prime Minister's surgery well so he can become the boss of your hospital.

291
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,030
But he said something strange to me.

292
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,820
What do you mean by something strange.

293
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:04,510
He said that no matter what he does, he asked me to forgive him.

294
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,240
No matter what he does?

295
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,850
Yes, it's making me nervous.

296
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,480
 About going to North Korea.

297
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,440
 Actually, I don't think I ever told you about that.

298
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,610
 Among my friends I met at Harvard,

299
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:24,020
 I had a friend named Lee Seung Hoon.

300
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,740
Why?

301
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:33,620
He's not really planning something scary, right?

302
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:36,390
By any chance, do you know someone named Lee Seung Hoon among Chief Han's friends?

303
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:38,780
I don't. Who is that?

304
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,590
He is the son of the victim of a medical malpractice lawsuit from 20 years ago.

305
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:45,310
The thing I told you about before, that lawsuit that sent us to North Korea.

306
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,650
Then could Jae Joon be...

307
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,840
That can't be it, right?

308
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,690
Watch over me, Father.

309
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:16,980
The first part of my revenge will start tomorrow.

310
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,700
Is Water Bottle not coming?

311
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,460
I don't know. How would I know?

312
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,780
He was on the same side as you.

313
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,650
Don't you know?

314
00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:02,000
In this world, there's no such thing as a forever comrade or forever enemy.

315
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,650
Chairman!

316
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,800
That weed.

317
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,490
Well, we are gathered today,

318
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:28,770
to  celebrate that our Myeongwoo was chosen as the Prime Minister's surgery team.

319
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:33,340
Next, the Chief of the Cardiothoracic Department, Han Jae Joon, who has been selected

320
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:37,830
as the performing surgeon for the Prime Minister's surgery will  come up and say his greetings.

321
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:53,000
More than that, I would like to sincerely thank the Chairman for today.

322
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,870
And I'd like to use this opportunity to also thank many doctors who have put in hard work to be chosen as

323
00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:00,060
the Prime Minister's surgery team.

324
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:04,990
As it's been a long time since we've been out of the hospital,

325
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:08,670
I wish everyone will have a good time.  Thank you.

326
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:18,660
After the meal, the Chairman of Myeongwoo University Hospital is due to make an important announcement,

327
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,980
so please stay until the end.

328
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,360
Hello, Chairman, it's good to see you.

329
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,020
- You've been well, right?
- Yes, yes.

330
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,680
You look well as usual.

331
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,760
- It's nice to see you looking healthy.
- Thank you.

332
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,850
Jae Joon?

333
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,920
I have something to ask you.

334
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,780
Don't worry.

335
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,830
It will be a bit difficult to announce our wedding today.

336
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:50,000
That's not it...

337
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,540
Why did you ask to meet?

338
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,910
I owe you an apology.

339
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:16,880
Your father's incident...

340
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,870
it seems like I had misunderstood.

341
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:23,010
Did you tell me to come all the way here for just that?

342
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:27,880
I wanted to leave with a good sentiment, at least with you.

343
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,370
And there's also a favor I want to ask you.

344
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:35,090
No thank you.  I can't afford the time to listen to your favor.

345
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:38,730
I'm speaking about Doctor Oh Soo Hyeon.

346
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:43,970
Soo Hyeon sincerely likes you.

347
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:47,000
Then were you faking your love for her?

348
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:51,970
Stop saying nonsense, and don't hurt Quack anymore.

349
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:55,360
If not, it'll hurt you many times more.

350
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,790
I'm telling you not to do anything that you'll regret.  If there's anything you're hiding, then say it before it's too late.

351
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:03,830
If there's anything you've done wrong, then ask for her forgiveness as soon as possible.

352
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,280
The thing I'm trying to do...

353
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:10,090
I can't say it to Soo Hyeon,

354
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,830
and I can't be forgiven either.

355
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,220
Then just don't do it.

356
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,510
It already started.

357
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:38,020

358
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,450
What are you doing here?

359
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:47,290
Oh Sang Jin?

360
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,640
Yes, I am.

361
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,800
I'm arresting you for embezzlement and bribery.

362
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,280
- Father!
- Which district are you guys from?

363
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,430
How dare you come here and abuse your power?

364
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,040
I'll explain the specific details at the station.

365
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,590
Which station? Are you guys allowed to arrest people like this?

366
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,530
Do you not see this warrant?

367
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,510
- What are you doing?
- Yes.

368
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,250
Father, Father. Father!

369
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,930
Father!

370
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,600
 What is that?  Why?

371
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,830
Did you do this?

372
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,880
It's just the beginning.

373
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:36,330
The events that will happen from now on as well,

374
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,750
will become scars that will be irrevocable to Soo Hyeon.

375
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,840
Just as I suspected,

376
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,530
you are Lee Seung Hoon.

377
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,920
Revenge... are you doing something like that?

378
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,100
Wouldn't that be natural if you were Lee Seung Hoon?

379
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:56,030
After losing my father, I lost my mother, too.

380
00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:00,070
And for 20 years...

381
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:03,100
I lived with their injustices buried in my heart.

382
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:07,690
I waited for the opportunity to resolve that deep sorrow,

383
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:10,310
and since it's finally come,

384
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,610
I have to do it.

385
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:14,070
He's the father of the woman you love.

386
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,200
She's a woman Han Jae Joon loved.

387
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:19,480
It wasn't Lee Seung Hoon.

388
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,490
You're wrong.

389
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:27,510
Both Han Jae Joon and Lee Seung Hoon loved Oh Soo Hyeon.

390
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,320
Am I wrong?

391
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,860
- What happened?
- An anonymous letter was sent to the prosecutors, Chairman.

392
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,390
An anonymous letter?  Who?

393
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:47,160
Since that was a secret, they couldn't say...

394
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,530
but fortunately, there was a hoobae from my hometown among the investigators...

395
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,060
So who was it?

396
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:55,000
He said it was Lee Seung Hoon.

397
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:01,030
By chance, have you heard that name before?

398
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,240
Lee Seung Hoon?

399
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,610
Yes.

400
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,750
Jae Joon, are you that person?

401
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,900
Lee Seung Hoon ... Jae Joon, are you Lee Seung Hoon?

402
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,610
- Is that important? 
- Tell me.

403
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,810
Listen carefully.

404
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,280
It doesn't matter who I am,  the important thing

405
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,100
is that we need to correct the crime from 20 years ago.

406
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,400
Is that this? Calling the police and avenging?

407
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,110
You still don't get it?

408
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:54,300
There is only one thing Lee Seung Hoon wants.

409
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,000
A sincere apology.

410
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,910
Lee Seung Hoon...

411
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,470
who is he?

412
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,060
20 years ago, that guy's father

413
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,300
died at our hospital.

414
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:42,500
The approval for the university hospital was right in front of us,

415
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,130
I didn't want that

416
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:48,680
death accident to become a lawsuit.

417
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:53,130
Right. If I didn't block that lawsuit by any means possible then,

418
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:55,520
the hospital would have fallen.

419
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:02,220
I met that person, Lee Seung Hoon.

420
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:07,400
I don't want you or that person to become more miserable.

421
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,760
Where is he?

422
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,660
Father, apologize to that person.

423
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,760
Apologize?

424
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,700
You saw it.  If you sincerely apologize, you can be forgiven.

425
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,760
I did nothing wrong.

426
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:23,170
No. I just did my duty for our Myeongwoo.

427
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:25,440
If you stay like this, something bad might happen to you as well!

428
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,170
Tell him to try.

429
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:30,910
I, Oh Joon Gyu, won't collapse that easily.

430
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,870
Father.

431
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:35,000
Leave.

432
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,990
Doctor Park Hoon.

433
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:10,960
I have to be like this so people will believe that it is my surgery. Isn't that so?

434
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,000
I heard that General Manager Oh Sang Jin was arrested.

435
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:18,330
It's Chief Han's work.

436
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,260
Who in the world is Chief Han?

437
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,360
Lee Seung Hoon.

438
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:28,820
He's the son of a man who died at Myeongoo because of a medical accident 20 years ago.

439
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:33,150
I'll take care of that problem.

440
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:36,540
So don't concern yourself with that and just concentrate on the surgery.

441
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:42,380
Also,  Park Hoon and his mother,

442
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,690
as I promised, I decided to send them to a safe place.

443
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,360
To where?

444
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:03,330
Are you not feeling well?

445
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,530
I came from the prime minister's office.

446
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:11,780
These are plane tickets to Switzerland and a bit of money for

447
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:14,430
both you and your mother.

448
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,320
Switzerland?

449
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:20,420
He said once you arrive there, it's your choice to go anywhere you like.

450
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,930
Let's go.

451
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,950
I want to meet Jae Hee.

452
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:29,020
You can not do that. There is no time.

453
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:33,640
Tell the prime minister that if I don't meet Jae Hee, I'm not going anywhere.

454
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,780
Why do you keep avoiding me? And why aren't you answering the phone?

455
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,340
Take your mother and leave.

456
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,740
I fully understand why you're doing this, but...

457
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:54,720
No. You can't understand.

458
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,400
Your father asked me to save you.

459
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,990
He asked me to save you-

460
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:01,360
That kind of excuse is too cowardly.

461
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,420
I can't  be with you anymore.

462
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:07,080
So hurry up and leave. That's the best.

463
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:10,710
I'll take my mother to a safe place and I'll come back for you.

464
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,920
No. Don't come.

465
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,880
It's over with you. There's no reason to see you anymore.

466
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,410
I promised your father that I would protect you.

467
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:22,920
If it's because of guilt for making my father die that way, you no longer have to do that.

468
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,170
No, it's not because of guilt.

469
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:29,440
I'll be going. Goodbye.

470
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:39,310
You can now forget about me and my father's incident.

471
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,610
Forget it all and live well.

472
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:16,020
Tell Prime Minister Jang to come in.

473
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:16,760
Yes.

474
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:19,160
What's the problem?

475
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,380
It's probably nothing.

476
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:24,100
It's more annoying that he's telling me to come and go when it's nothing.

477
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:29,120
Also, tell him to send Park Hoon well so there won't be any further trouble.  Got it?

478
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,100
Yes.

479
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,930
What are you doing?

480
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,610
I'm just carrying out my orders.

481
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,990
The surgery is next Monday.

482
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:51,380
Did you say it was Chief Han Jae Joon?

483
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,140
Yes.

484
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:57,120
However, about that Doctor Park Hoon...

485
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,670
Yes.

486
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:01,650
To give up on the surgery... it's very foolish.

487
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:04,330
It seems that there is no big difference in skills between the two.

488
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:08,160
I don't understand why he, on his own, threw away

489
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,380
such a good opportunity like this.

490
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,370
Just like you said,

491
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:16,290
he must be foolish.

492
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:19,900
Foolish....

493
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:45,120
Yes.

494
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,580
Pardon?

495
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,720
I understand.

496
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:06,000
He's not foolish, but he probably only thinks about the patient.

497
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,530
But the one who won the competition is Chief Han Jae Joon.

498
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:13,350
Thinking more importantly about a patient's life than winning,

499
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:16,260
isn't that a doctor?

500
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,840
Is that so?

501
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,430
If you were a patient,  naturally,

502
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:26,400
you would choose a doctor like Doctor Park Hoon.

503
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:41,660
It's me, Doctor Park.

504
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:47,440
Son of a bit*h!  You had no intention of keeping us alive from the beginning, right?!

505
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,890
You're not dead but still alive, aren't you?

506
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:59,300
The President chose you as the performing surgeon.

507
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:03,680
Do you think I'll do as you guys order me to do?!

508
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,880
You'll have to.

509
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,420
We have your mother.

510
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:22,990

511
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:39,290
What do you mean that Park Hoon is performing the surgery?

512
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:41,090
It's the President's order.

513
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:44,910
It's his heart, what can I do?

514
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,380
Anyway, Park Hoon is still Myeongwoo University Hospital's doctor.

515
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:54,190
And all the benefits that Myeongwoo Hospital will receive still remain the same.

516
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:58,130
When the surgery ends, I'll take care of Park Hoon.

517
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:00,950
So just be patient until then.

518
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:06,540
This surgery needs to proceed.

519
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,670
You understand, right?

520
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:11,000
I understand.

521
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:15,190
I took care of the Prosecutor issues.

522
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:17,890
Your son will be released.

523
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:19,270
Thank you.

524
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:23,980
I'll call Chief Han Jae Joon personally.

525
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,670
The performing surgeon has changed?

526
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:34,690
Yes, I'm sorry.

527
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,160
It doesn't matter.

528
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,580
Chairman Oh's son will be released soon.

529
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:45,870
I'm warning you but whatever you do,

530
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:49,130
keep in mind that I can block it all.

531
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:53,750
When the surgery is done, I will give you a chance to take care of Oh Joon Gyu,

532
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:57,710
so stay quiet until then, understand?

533
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:40,150
This tiresome work will be over in a week, too.

534
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:03,920
Are you here?

535
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,090
Where's my mom?

536
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:08,980
We're taking good care of your mother,

537
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,800
so don't worry.

538
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:15,970
If you just finish the surgery well, she'll be safe.

539
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:18,610
I don't trust your words anymore.

540
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:20,500
Fine.

541
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,890
How would it be if I said it like this?

542
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:30,680
If you say something stupid,

543
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,900
your mother will die.

544
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:40,640
How's that?

545
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:54,490
The president chose me as the performing surgeon.

546
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:56,790
What about your mother?

547
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,200
She'll be fine.

548
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,910
As long as I'm the one performing the surgery, they'll also take good care of her.

549
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,750
What are you going to do now?

550
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:10,420
It's as I said before.

551
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:14,430
When the day of the President's surgery comes, you just need to as well as you normally do.

552
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:16,050
I'll take care of the rest.

553
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:18,860
There might not be time to meet the President alone.

554
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:21,670
The Prime Minister's guys will be monitoring you day and night.

555
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:26,200
Taking care of that much, I got enough training with Cha Jin Soo for 2 years.

556
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,970
Take care?

557
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:32,630
Then did you think I came here with just anesthesiology training?

558
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:34,890
- Why would you-
- You're right.

559
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:38,400
If I knew that you'd killed my father, I wouldn't have even started getting

560
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,280
that kind of scary training.

561
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,520
Because the will to see you wouldn't have existed.

562
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:54,710
What are you going to do if everything ends safely as you think?

563
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:59,140
I don't know. But the one thing I'm sure of

564
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:02,480
is that I'll never be with you.

565
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:19,460
If it's about Lee Seung Hoon, I don't want to hear it, so leave!

566
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:22,040
Even if you don't want to hear it, listen.

567
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,790
That person was adopted to America after the medical accident incident.

568
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:30,760
Get out!

569
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,170
He came to Korea to take revenge on you.

570
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:35,100
Why are you uselessly going around meeting that bastard?

571
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,930
You also saw Oppa getting arrested!

572
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:39,270
That's been taken care of!

573
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:41,910
Apologize sincerely to that man.

574
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:43,520
Then he will definitely forgive you.

575
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,960
Apologize?

576
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,120
Impudent fool. I did nothing wrong.

577
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,270
What do you mean you did nothing wrong?

578
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:55,340
That person's father passed away and because the lawsuit was dropped, he even lost his mother.

579
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:57,400
Overnight, he became an orphan!

580
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,810
So I'm telling you to seek forgiveness by saying sorry!

581
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:01,920
Won't you shut up!?

582
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:06,360
Father, do you really not know what you did wrong?

583
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,850
I said I did nothing wrong!

584
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:17,430
He dares to mess with me?

585
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:19,790
Tell him to try as much as he wants!

586
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:24,200
No matter how much fuss a guy like that makes, I won't fall.

587
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:35,560
Jae Joon.

588
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:40,630
I know you used me

589
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:43,200
and deceived me.

590
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:48,440
I'll forget everything, so please stop here, Jae Joon.

591
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,550
I'm sorry, Soo Hyeon.

592
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,640
I haven't told Father anything yet.

593
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,620
I'll try to convince him somehow, so stop...

594
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,570
Don't try.

595
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,820
You have something you need to do.

596
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,490
Are you talking about Lee Seung Hoon?

597
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:05,500
Yes.

598
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,910
I  just came after meeting him.

599
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:10,910
Really?

600
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:14,070
What does he want?

601
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:15,940
How much does he want?

602
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:18,270
He said he doesn't need money.

603
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:23,970
Lee Seung Hoon, that bastard, was really tenacious even as a child.

604
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:28,050
 Don't forget. My father is Lee Jo Seon, and I'm Lee Seung Hoon.

605
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:29,790
 Remember that clearly!

606
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:33,700
 I'm telling you to clearly remember the person who's going to take revenge on you!

607
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:36,220
When it's been 20 years,

608
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:38,360
to think that he would stab me in the back!

609
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:43,490
If you'll apologize sincerely even now and acknowledge your wrong, then he said he'll stop the revenge.

610
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:46,890
Apologize? Acknowledge?

611
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:49,880
Impudent fool.

612
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:54,270
I have nothing to apologize for or to acknowledge.

613
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:57,560
Blocking the medical incident then

614
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:00,930
was the best thing that I've done.

615
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:09,280
If the lawsuit had progressed back then,

616
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,650
Myeongwoo would have disintegrated into the air.

617
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:16,000
You have no thoughts that you did wrong?

618
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,990
Not at all!

619
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:22,330
I, Oh Joon Gyu, protected Myeongwoo.

620
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:24,280
No one can touch Myeongwoo!

621
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,950
You never know if Lee Seung Hoon gave you a last chance.

622
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:28,230
What chance?!

623
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:33,620
The last chance for not being able to apologize and pleading for forgiveness back then.

624
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:37,860
The thing the victims of the medical incident want is a sincere apology.

625
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:41,170
- Even last time...
- Tell him not to make me laugh!

626
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:46,380
At this rate,

627
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:48,520
if Lee Seung Hoon decides to do something dangerous...

628
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:52,010
Tell him to give it a try.

629
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:54,340
Whether he tries to retaliate or avenge,

630
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:57,490
no matter how much he desperately tries,

631
00:53:57,490 --> 00:54:01,140
he will never make me fall.

632
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:02,810
Do you really think that?

633
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:05,110
Sang Jin's prosecution investigation?

634
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:07,160
I've blocked it all.

635
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:11,700
But it seems you won't be able to block what's about to happen now.

636
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:16,510
The branch hospital that's being built in Jeju Island won't be able to open.

637
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:22,050
Lee Seung Hoon has already sent over Meyongwoo's insufficient financial data to Daehan Bank.

638
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,410
To acquire more loans will be difficult.

639
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:28,590
He also said the pressure to collect loans will start soon.

640
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:29,740
What?

641
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:31,790
Also, Lee Seung Hoon

642
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:34,260
has already approached the reporters.

643
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:36,290
You already know that he found out about embezzlement of the school foundation's funds

644
00:54:36,290 --> 00:54:40,950
and the corruption of evaluation from Judge Kim Pyeong Woo.

645
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:47,560
You have to pay up 5 times the unjustified treatment cost that's been claimed as an additional fee.

646
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:50,080
The amount of that sum will be huge.

647
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:52,900
Lee Seung Hoon.

648
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,430
Lee Seung Hoon, you bastard.

649
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:05,350
How dare you? You dare to mess with me?!

650
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:21,590
Find a solution

651
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:25,210
to stop it!

652
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:28,720
It's not over yet.

653
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:33,030
20 years ago, when Meyongwoo was getting approved as an university hospital,

654
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:36,790
he said he'll announce the willful close alliance with the politicians.

655
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:38,210
What?

656
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:41,920
Prime Minister Jang Seok Joo's name will be the first to come out.

657
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:47,930
That... bring that bastard Lee Seung Hoon in front of me right now.

658
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:50,270
Right now!

659
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:52,410
What happened?

660
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:58,440
Jae Joon. Jae Joon.

661
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,480
For the last 20 years, he said that he hasn't forgotten for even a day,

662
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,320
and endured it with Chairman's slander.

663
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:10,430
But, as his notes got longer, and as the opportunity got closer,

664
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:13,910
he was also frightened.

665
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:19,200
What if you were penitent about the past and reflecting on it? What is he supposed to do then?

666
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:24,570
So if you acknowledge your wrong and sincerely apologize, what should he do then?

667
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:26,770
I agonized over it.

668
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:34,070
Then what should I do? Should I forgive?

669
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,920
If I forgive, what happens to my life until then?

670
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:44,050
I was worried...

671
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,200
But it's a relief.

672
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:53,160
You... what are you talking about?

673
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:56,320
It's really a relief

674
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,240
that you haven't changed and are still like this.

675
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:03,870
No, I want to thank you.

676
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:09,210
You... are you perhaps...

677
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:10,980
Yes.

678
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:17,990
I'm that Lee Seung Hoon from 20 years ago.

679
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:27,830
Thank you for not letting my life go to waste.

680
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:31,570
Chairman Oh Joon Gyu.

681
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:37,030
You... you bastard!

682
00:57:52,890 --> 00:58:00,840

683
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:07,210
- Take out the emergency key right now.
- Okay.

684
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:14,710
Father. Father are you alright?

685
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:15,770
Jae Joon.

686
00:58:15,770 --> 00:58:21,330
♬  You and I both in a lonely life  ♬

687
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:26,590
 Father! 
♬  That is how we are destined to live  ♬

688
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:28,560
♬  Love is fragile  ♬

689
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:32,310
 Father. Father are you alright? 
♬  And time simply passes.  ♬

690
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:35,140
 Jae Joon! 
♬  And time simply passes.  ♬
