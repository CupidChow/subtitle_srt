1
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:25,933

2
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:29,303
Doctor Han Seung Hee.

3
00:00:29,303 --> 00:00:33,793
They say that the heartbeat for each person is different.

4
00:00:33,793 --> 00:00:37,943
Just like there aren't any two people with the same face.

5
00:00:37,943 --> 00:00:40,403
It means that every heart moves differently.

6
00:00:41,543 --> 00:00:43,853
What are you saying all of a sudden, Doctor Park?

7
00:00:43,853 --> 00:00:46,873
I just need a moment.

8
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:12,363
What are you doing?

9
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,583
What are you doing? Hurry and apologize.

10
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:17,613
Forget it, Doctor Oh.

11
00:01:23,063 --> 00:01:25,703
Are you crazy?

12
00:01:27,613 --> 00:01:28,893
What's wrong?

13
00:01:28,893 --> 00:01:32,363
There's exactly one person in the world who has the same heartbeat as you.

14
00:01:32,363 --> 00:01:35,043
That's your fate.

15
00:01:35,043 --> 00:01:37,123
Really?

16
00:01:38,283 --> 00:01:40,813
Then, Doctor Han-

17
00:01:40,813 --> 00:01:44,223
It's a fib, Quack. How could there be such a thing?

18
00:01:44,223 --> 00:01:47,923
- What?
- Even if there is, it's not her.

19
00:01:47,923 --> 00:01:53,103
Wait a minute, perhaps Quack, you're my fate?

20
00:01:55,243 --> 00:01:59,253
Shall we try to match the sound of our heartbeats? To see if we're one's fate?

21
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:16,103
Are you messing with a person, or what?

22
00:02:26,543 --> 00:02:32,023
 Episode 7

23
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:50,463
I'm really sorry. I mistook you for someone else.

24
00:02:50,463 --> 00:02:52,413
Yes, it's Han Seung Hee.

25
00:02:52,413 --> 00:02:54,113
Yes, it's Oh Soo Hyeon.

26
00:02:54,113 --> 00:02:56,393
- I understand.
- Yes.

27
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:59,873
From now on, only exhibit behaviors which are appropriate for that coat.

28
00:03:01,863 --> 00:03:04,223
Go.

29
00:03:04,223 --> 00:03:06,573
- Where to?
- To the ER to see an urgent patient.

30
00:03:06,573 --> 00:03:09,753
- I don't know, I'm not going.
- Stop babbling and follow me.

31
00:03:09,753 --> 00:03:12,353
Ah!

32
00:03:12,353 --> 00:03:14,993
Here. It's good, right?

33
00:03:14,993 --> 00:03:18,453
From this point on, there's no problem with this.

34
00:03:18,453 --> 00:03:22,173
Hey, this happened while trying to catch a spy so you can let this one pass.

35
00:03:22,173 --> 00:03:24,823
You really are naive.

36
00:03:24,823 --> 00:03:28,013
- If she's a spy, she'd have manipulated this a long time ago. 
- Manipulate?

37
00:03:28,013 --> 00:03:32,023
If we say, "You're a spy if you have one kidney," then she'd  obviously provide a picture with two kidneys.

38
00:03:32,023 --> 00:03:33,803
That's true.

39
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:48,673
Blood pressure is unstable. Give her more saline solution and please quickly prepare blood.

40
00:03:48,673 --> 00:03:50,783
Yes.

41
00:03:50,783 --> 00:03:54,543
Why is this like this?  The hemorrhage and air leak are severe.

42
00:03:54,543 --> 00:03:56,563
If blood pressure keeps dropping, the fetus is in danger, too.

43
00:03:56,563 --> 00:03:58,723
Huh?

44
00:04:05,643 --> 00:04:09,343
The pressure from the air in the lung is affecting the heart which is why the BP is dropping.

45
00:04:09,343 --> 00:04:11,933
Just suction out the air.

46
00:04:23,303 --> 00:04:28,213
What?  There's a lot of air leaking and the hemorrhage is severe?

47
00:04:28,213 --> 00:04:30,203
Tell him to look for a laceration in the lung tissue.

48
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,683
The lung is lacerated.

49
00:04:31,683 --> 00:04:32,973
Take a CT first.

50
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:35,203
If there really is a laceration in the lung, then there is no time to do that.

51
00:04:35,203 --> 00:04:38,653
If the mother's BP drops, then the blood stream  going to the fetus drops too. Then there is a possibility for a miscarriage.

52
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:43,713
Or the internal organs of the fetus could be damaged. I'm saying, we could make this normal fetus become disabled.

53
00:04:43,713 --> 00:04:46,513
 Urgent Operation Theater

54
00:04:46,513 --> 00:04:49,373
You said you are an anesthesiologist?

55
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:52,373
Okay, let's move her.

56
00:04:57,233 --> 00:05:00,823
Why does that jerk talk informally to people, so rude.

57
00:05:00,823 --> 00:05:04,263
Why? It makes him cool.

58
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:07,073
What's so cool about him?

59
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:33,403
Start.

60
00:05:33,403 --> 00:05:35,423
Scalpel.

61
00:05:37,843 --> 00:05:40,433
Hey, Anesthesiologist, if you can't control the BP or the oxygen saturation level, then we're screwed.

62
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:42,643
Don't worry.

63
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,123
Quack, are you going to be my assistant?

64
00:05:44,123 --> 00:05:46,723
Can you stop calling me "Quack"?

65
00:05:46,723 --> 00:05:49,413
Focus properly.

66
00:06:00,343 --> 00:06:02,763
She didn't even take five minutes from check-in to operation.

67
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:06,443
Anesthetizing a pregnant woman is very difficult, and yet she's doing so well.

68
00:06:06,443 --> 00:06:10,633
If she's not a spy, I would totally accept her as the anesthesiologist for my team.

69
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:12,753
Spy?

70
00:06:13,753 --> 00:06:15,263
Listening to your explanation, it seems so.

71
00:06:15,263 --> 00:06:19,303
If she really is a spy, she can easily fabricate a CT.

72
00:06:19,303 --> 00:06:21,933
I know. Do you have any good method?

73
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:24,693
There is one way.

74
00:06:24,693 --> 00:06:27,953
Before that...

75
00:06:27,953 --> 00:06:30,593
First, can you fix my pay for this month?

76
00:06:30,593 --> 00:06:32,893
What? Didn't Chief Han fix that already?

77
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,563
Chief is supposed to deal with an  unpaid fellow's salary.

78
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:37,733
I think he forgot about me because I'm in your team.

79
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:41,153
Okay. I will tell him right away.

80
00:06:41,153 --> 00:06:44,583
Tell me what that good method is.

81
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,583
We can tell her to get a physical again because we don't accept the one from a local branch.

82
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:51,763
CT is included in the physical so we will know right away.

83
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,513
That's right.

84
00:06:55,513 --> 00:06:57,593
Okay.

85
00:07:07,373 --> 00:07:09,753
Her blood pressure is dropping!

86
00:07:09,753 --> 00:07:11,113
I've got it.

87
00:07:11,113 --> 00:07:13,063
Oxygen saturation for the mother is 90%. Is the respirator tube blocked?

88
00:07:13,063 --> 00:07:16,143
- It's going in.
- Then why isn't it going up?

89
00:07:16,143 --> 00:07:19,643
- 90% is all right.
- Are you stupid? She's pregnant. Even at 100%, she can be in danger.

90
00:07:19,643 --> 00:07:24,603
I want to raise it, but because she's pregnant, her lung capacity is low and it won't go up. Her other lung is not well either.

91
00:07:24,603 --> 00:07:27,373
Are you going to be making excuses after we kill her?

92
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,663
Doctor Park.

93
00:07:31,753 --> 00:07:33,863
Let's do lung ventilation.

94
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:37,903
Can you do the operation? It will be hard to get a proper view.

95
00:07:37,903 --> 00:07:40,333
I can do it.

96
00:07:55,473 --> 00:07:58,593
I will do lung ventilation again.

97
00:07:58,593 --> 00:08:03,263
It will be okay since you removed the blood that passed over to the other lung.

98
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:18,583
You were too harsh on her.

99
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,583
She is not even familiar with this place because she came today.

100
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:24,173
A patient does not care about that stuff. Show me more of the left.

101
00:08:24,173 --> 00:08:27,913
That's enough. I think you are venting because she is not the one you were looking for.

102
00:08:27,913 --> 00:08:30,833
- Stop saying nonsense and call Ob-Gyn.
- Are you going to give an delivery?

103
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:35,053
If she is going to have a C-section anyway, let's do it now.

104
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:53,363
Remove the lung ventilation.

105
00:08:57,193 --> 00:09:00,903
There is no bubble. I think we gave a good suture.

106
00:09:02,713 --> 00:09:05,323
Suction.

107
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:16,413
They are twins.

108
00:09:22,013 --> 00:09:26,023
- You can do the draining, right?
- Don't worry, I've got it.

109
00:09:30,413 --> 00:09:34,483
- Get a physical examination again?
- That's right.

110
00:09:34,483 --> 00:09:36,393
Do a new one for Doctor Han Seung Hee.

111
00:09:36,393 --> 00:09:39,303
And send me the results to me right away, okay?

112
00:09:39,303 --> 00:09:41,343
I'll be imprisoned for this, Hyung.

113
00:09:41,343 --> 00:09:44,123
We already did something to be imprisoned.

114
00:09:44,123 --> 00:09:46,403
Do as you're told or we go down together.

115
00:09:46,403 --> 00:09:48,203
I'm going to tell everything.

116
00:09:48,203 --> 00:09:50,373
Hyungnim!

117
00:09:51,903 --> 00:09:54,053
Should I call for a personnel committee?

118
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:56,023
Or should I call the police?

119
00:09:56,023 --> 00:09:58,063
Hyungnim!

120
00:09:58,063 --> 00:10:00,133
Listen to me.

121
00:10:24,443 --> 00:10:27,223
What happened? Why...

122
00:10:27,223 --> 00:10:30,233
They were twins, Jae Joon.

123
00:10:31,493 --> 00:10:33,803
You felt that often, right?

124
00:10:33,803 --> 00:10:36,253
After the surgery, when the patient looks at you,

125
00:10:36,253 --> 00:10:40,523
you feel good but your shoulders also feel heavy.

126
00:10:40,523 --> 00:10:42,923
That kind of feeling.

127
00:10:42,923 --> 00:10:44,713
There are times when you feel distressed, too.

128
00:10:44,713 --> 00:10:46,713
Right?

129
00:10:48,143 --> 00:10:51,043
Anyway, Doctor Park was really impressive.

130
00:10:51,043 --> 00:10:54,383
Being able to work with him turned out to be great.

131
00:11:03,373 --> 00:11:05,403
I'll go see the patient.

132
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:09,643
Soo Hyeon, you did well with the surgery.

133
00:11:09,643 --> 00:11:13,113
But, I'd like you to remember one thing.

134
00:11:13,113 --> 00:11:14,293
What?

135
00:11:14,293 --> 00:11:18,623
That you're the first assistant on my team.

136
00:11:18,623 --> 00:11:22,323
Of course. I'll be going.

137
00:11:51,563 --> 00:11:55,203
There's no one like Dr. Han Seung Hee for our surgical team's anesthesiologist.

138
00:11:55,203 --> 00:11:57,513
You acknowledge that too, right?

139
00:11:57,513 --> 00:11:58,613
Well, she's not bad.

140
00:11:58,613 --> 00:12:03,593
You have to acknowledge my worry and distress. This  unbearable dilemma.

141
00:12:03,593 --> 00:12:07,453
If she's Han Seung Hee, you might hate it but I'll like it.

142
00:12:07,453 --> 00:12:12,213
However, if she's Song Jae Hee, you might like it but I'll be dead.

143
00:12:12,213 --> 00:12:16,073
Because then it means that you're a spy, too. Or does it not?

144
00:12:16,073 --> 00:12:18,373
What are you on about? We confirmed that she's not Jae Hee.

145
00:12:18,373 --> 00:12:20,933
Just because she has two kidneys?

146
00:12:20,933 --> 00:12:25,543
If she's a spy, she can easily fabricate it.

147
00:12:25,543 --> 00:12:28,073
So, close your eyes tightly,

148
00:12:28,073 --> 00:12:31,743
and let's get to the end of it today, okay?

149
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:37,013
I already submitted my physical exam results from the local branch.

150
00:12:37,013 --> 00:12:39,083
So why do I have to take it again?

151
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:43,203
I'm sorry, but those are the rules.

152
00:12:44,553 --> 00:12:47,443
You have to get the physical exam for employment here.

153
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:12,473
What if we get really caught?

154
00:13:13,073 --> 00:13:17,593
If I take out my sword, I have to at least cut a radish. I don't care about the consequences now.

155
00:13:29,813 --> 00:13:32,783
 We will get a new employment exam.

156
00:13:32,783 --> 00:13:37,423
 Blood test, vision, hearing, etc.

157
00:13:44,483 --> 00:13:49,423
However, this is infallible. It was taken today.

158
00:14:08,343 --> 00:14:10,673
- Employment exam?
- Yes.

159
00:14:10,673 --> 00:14:12,703
Didn't we prepare that from the local branch?

160
00:14:12,703 --> 00:14:15,253
They told me to take it again.

161
00:14:15,253 --> 00:14:16,803
Did you take it?

162
00:14:16,803 --> 00:14:18,383
Yes.

163
00:14:20,003 --> 00:14:24,113
We didn't think of that, but medical records are very sensitive information.

164
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,223
Even in South Korea, it is the same.

165
00:14:26,223 --> 00:14:28,383
Doctor Han.

166
00:14:31,613 --> 00:14:33,923
I'll contact you again.

167
00:14:39,903 --> 00:14:47,203

168
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,163
What is it?

169
00:14:53,163 --> 00:14:57,003
I have to confirm whether or not you're a spy, Doctor Han.

170
00:14:57,003 --> 00:14:58,393
What is that supposed to mean?

171
00:14:58,393 --> 00:15:02,733
Doctor Park's lover only had one kidney, right?

172
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:08,923
If the results say that Dr. Han has only one kidney, then you are his lover, which means you are a spy.

173
00:15:08,923 --> 00:15:10,733
I'm sorry.

174
00:15:12,163 --> 00:15:15,453
If you have two kidneys...

175
00:15:15,453 --> 00:15:18,113
then I apologize. Sorry.

176
00:15:18,113 --> 00:15:20,083
Give it.

177
00:15:21,943 --> 00:15:25,463
No way, is that my medical record?

178
00:15:26,013 --> 00:15:28,983
We are doing this because of Master, so stay calm.

179
00:15:28,983 --> 00:15:32,853
Don't you know that this is a criminal offense?

180
00:15:36,053 --> 00:15:38,253
Let go!

181
00:15:40,143 --> 00:15:42,183
Stay put.

182
00:16:02,113 --> 00:16:04,413
What on earth is going on?!

183
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,743
Hyungnim.

184
00:16:10,013 --> 00:16:11,883
Give me that CD immediately.

185
00:16:11,883 --> 00:16:14,343
You see, I have something I have to confirm.

186
00:16:14,343 --> 00:16:19,033
Does looking at someone else's medical record on your own will make any sense?

187
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:21,623
Give that here immediately.

188
00:16:26,223 --> 00:16:28,173
What are you doing?

189
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,843
Hoon!

190
00:17:00,843 --> 00:17:02,623
There are two.

191
00:17:04,383 --> 00:17:08,133
I won't let what happened just pass.

192
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:19,283
Doctor Han Seung Hee.

193
00:17:21,283 --> 00:17:23,403
I'll apologize instead.

194
00:17:23,403 --> 00:17:26,403
I hope you can pretend this never happened.

195
00:17:26,403 --> 00:17:30,693
It wasn't even anyone else, but doctors. How can they look at someone else's records on their own will?

196
00:17:30,693 --> 00:17:34,823
I'll apologize instead, please.

197
00:17:34,823 --> 00:17:39,033
Doctor Han Seung Hee, I'm really sorry!

198
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:41,843
Because he's sorry, just let it go, huh?

199
00:17:41,843 --> 00:17:46,973
Yes. I'm asking of you to please forgive me this once.

200
00:17:56,943 --> 00:18:03,163
Doctor Han! Doctor Han! Doctor Han!

201
00:18:08,563 --> 00:18:10,953
Hey, Lee Chang Yi. What are you doing here?

202
00:18:10,953 --> 00:18:13,453
To earn money and pay for Mom's hospital fee.

203
00:18:13,453 --> 00:18:15,863
Aigoo...

204
00:18:19,513 --> 00:18:24,413
Hey! What the? W-what?! W-what? What?! Really! What?

205
00:18:24,413 --> 00:18:27,793
Across the street? It's my time to go to the part-time job.

206
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:32,723
Huh? What are you wearing on the inside?

207
00:18:35,773 --> 00:18:39,653
Sauna. Do you want to see what's inside this T-shirt too?
 Jewelry Sauna

208
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:42,173
Forget it. Just give me the keys to your truck.

209
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:45,323
- Going somewhere, Hyung?
- Garibong.

210
00:18:45,323 --> 00:18:48,513
- Shall I give you a lift? 
- Forget it, I thought you needed to earn money.

211
00:18:48,513 --> 00:18:50,953
Mother, get her to buy you lots of delicious things.

212
00:18:50,953 --> 00:18:52,263
Of course.

213
00:18:52,263 --> 00:18:54,113
I'm going.

214
00:18:55,313 --> 00:18:57,853
Why do you call Doctor Park "hyung"?

215
00:18:57,853 --> 00:18:59,233
What's wrong with that?

216
00:18:59,233 --> 00:19:02,233
A girl should call a guy "oppa".

217
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:05,313
Why do you say "hyung"? So embarassing.

218
00:19:05,313 --> 00:19:07,083
It's because it makes me comfortable.

219
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,653
How is that comfortable?

220
00:19:08,653 --> 00:19:13,253
It just is. Aren't you going to eat this? Shall I eat it?

221
00:19:37,063 --> 00:19:39,803
So this is your hospital, huh?

222
00:19:42,893 --> 00:19:45,733
What are you doing all the way over here?

223
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:53,493
I'm going to China in a few days.

224
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:54,863
Don't go.

225
00:19:54,863 --> 00:19:57,313
The person to guide me from China to North Korea will be coming.

226
00:19:57,313 --> 00:19:59,633
I'll find Jae Hee by my own ability.

227
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:02,603
So, Ahjusshi, don't interfere with Jae Hee anymore.

228
00:20:02,603 --> 00:20:05,733
Before I go, I have something to say to you.

229
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:07,823
I don't want to hear it.

230
00:20:08,613 --> 00:20:10,563
Your Father...

231
00:20:11,653 --> 00:20:15,053
The reason he went to North Korea.

232
00:20:22,893 --> 00:20:27,583
 Lawsuit

233
00:20:31,783 --> 00:20:35,213
 Lawsuit. Plaintiff Park Chul.

234
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:37,183
 Defendant, Myeongwoo Hospital?

235
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:55,423
 A phone call will come to your hospital next week.

236
00:20:56,253 --> 00:20:58,283
 Doctor Park,

237
00:20:58,283 --> 00:21:00,853
 do you have to do this?

238
00:21:00,853 --> 00:21:03,683
 A patient died, in fact during a surgery.

239
00:21:03,683 --> 00:21:06,593
 Anyone can make mistakes.

240
00:21:07,553 --> 00:21:12,513
 Friend, do you know why people call us doctors?

241
00:21:12,513 --> 00:21:16,153
 Because we are doctors, they can not accept a single mistake.

242
00:21:16,153 --> 00:21:17,993
 Doctors deal with life and death.

243
00:21:17,993 --> 00:21:20,383
 Look here, Doctor Park.

244
00:21:20,383 --> 00:21:24,053
 They won't reveal who did the surgery.

245
00:21:27,113 --> 00:21:29,473
 Tell your friend

246
00:21:29,473 --> 00:21:32,933
 to feel the burden of the doctor's gown he is wearing.

247
00:21:37,203 --> 00:21:40,833
 I will take the responsibility for this situation.

248
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,843
 Responsibility?

249
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:46,073
 - Exactly how?
- It was a mistake made during my surgery.

250
00:21:46,073 --> 00:21:47,443
 I'll admit to the medical accident and...

251
00:21:47,443 --> 00:21:49,243
 Then what about our Myeongwoo?

252
00:21:49,243 --> 00:21:52,103
 Our Myeongwoo Hospital is so close to getting an approval to be a medical college.

253
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,773
 We can get the approval next year.

254
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:56,453
 Look, Chief Choi!

255
00:21:56,453 --> 00:21:58,653
 You made a promise to me!

256
00:21:58,653 --> 00:22:02,773
 That we would make our Myeongwoo into the best hospital in Korea, no the best in the world. Did you forget it already?

257
00:22:02,773 --> 00:22:04,843
 I'm doing this to keep that promise.

258
00:22:04,843 --> 00:22:09,733
 If we don't get the approval this year, our hospital will be closed. How will you keep you the promise then?

259
00:22:09,733 --> 00:22:12,683
  Chairman...

260
00:22:17,843 --> 00:22:21,133
  Oh, you were here.

261
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:23,233
 You've worked hard.

262
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:25,423
 Aigoo, it's been a while.

263
00:22:26,643 --> 00:22:31,553
 I want to help you two to keep that promise.

264
00:22:31,553 --> 00:22:34,343
 What do you mean?

265
00:22:35,573 --> 00:22:41,413
 North Korea has asked us for a skillful thoracic surgeon.

266
00:22:41,413 --> 00:22:44,893
  Oh, yes. That's good.

267
00:22:44,893 --> 00:22:48,133
 If that's the case, I think Chief Choi might be the perfect person for this.

268
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,733
 But this is a private request,

269
00:22:50,733 --> 00:22:54,553
 I do not think this will help you out with advertising your hospital.

270
00:22:55,913 --> 00:23:00,803
 And my main doctor should take care of me.

271
00:23:03,563 --> 00:23:08,013
 Every year, I support you with money worth one apartment.

272
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:12,183
 Shouldn't there be a "give and take"?

273
00:23:13,093 --> 00:23:17,403
  We need a doctor that can fix Kim Il Sung's heart.

274
00:23:18,593 --> 00:23:20,963
 Kim Il Sung?

275
00:23:20,963 --> 00:23:26,333
 Therefore, the doctor won't be able to come back for a while if he goes...

276
00:23:27,213 --> 00:23:29,593
 - Then...
- Yes.

277
00:23:29,613 --> 00:23:32,433
 I am planning on trying to convince Professor Park Chul.

278
00:23:36,663 --> 00:23:40,413
 I think the medical accident lawsuit will be stopped for now.

279
00:23:40,413 --> 00:23:45,183
 Meanwhile, you should get the approval and settle the lawsuit.

280
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,993
 Congressman Jang.

281
00:23:52,113 --> 00:23:57,163
 Instead, you'll have to help me.

282
00:24:01,253 --> 00:24:08,283

283
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:15,423
 There is severe constriction of the coronary artery.

284
00:24:15,423 --> 00:24:18,573
 If left alone, he won't last a month.

285
00:24:19,073 --> 00:24:21,953
 That man cannot come here.

286
00:24:23,413 --> 00:24:26,353
 - Then by chance?
- That's right.

287
00:24:26,353 --> 00:24:28,413
  It's Kim Il Sung's heart.

288
00:24:28,413 --> 00:24:30,493
 I told you clearly that I cannot tell you the reason.

289
00:24:30,493 --> 00:24:32,123
 I'm getting married in a few days.

290
00:24:32,123 --> 00:24:34,183
 Does it make sense to ask me to take care of him at this time?

291
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:35,813
 I know it's a difficult favor.

292
00:24:35,813 --> 00:24:38,173
 However, Hoon is also your son.

293
00:24:38,173 --> 00:24:41,393
 I want to forget everything that has to do with you. Both you and Hoon.

294
00:24:41,393 --> 00:24:43,753
 - Hoon's mother.
- I'm really sick and tired of this!

295
00:24:43,753 --> 00:24:46,183
 Let's never contact each other again.

296
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:50,173
  Oh, yeah. Please take care of him for about a week.

297
00:24:50,173 --> 00:24:52,163
 Then the child's mother will come.

298
00:24:52,163 --> 00:24:54,183
  What is the matter, Professor Park?

299
00:24:54,183 --> 00:24:59,423
  I will tell you the details later on. I will rely on you to take care of my Hoon.

300
00:25:05,563 --> 00:25:08,753
 Don't worry too much, Doctor.

301
00:25:08,753 --> 00:25:10,963
 Lives of the two people...

302
00:25:10,963 --> 00:25:15,763
  This Jang Seok Joo will be responsible no matter what.

303
00:25:28,913 --> 00:25:32,303
Lies. Responsibility?

304
00:25:32,303 --> 00:25:33,403
For what?

305
00:25:33,403 --> 00:25:35,573
Congressman Jang and I

306
00:25:35,573 --> 00:25:38,323
looked for every possible way to get your father back but...

307
00:25:38,323 --> 00:25:40,643
You all tried to kill us, what do you mean every possible way?

308
00:25:40,643 --> 00:25:43,813
What does that mean? Tried to kill you?

309
00:25:43,813 --> 00:25:46,223
Don't pretend like you know anything. I heard every word.

310
00:25:46,223 --> 00:25:49,013
North Korea has lied to you. Impossible.

311
00:25:49,013 --> 00:25:51,403
Stop with the nonsense!

312
00:25:54,133 --> 00:25:58,103
You decide whether to believe me or not.

313
00:25:58,103 --> 00:26:01,413
But someone had to go,

314
00:26:02,023 --> 00:26:04,243
or else there would have been a war.

315
00:26:05,473 --> 00:26:08,423
As a doctor, he just went to save a patient.

316
00:26:08,423 --> 00:26:10,813
And you people just used my father.

317
00:26:10,813 --> 00:26:15,353
Because of your greed, my father and I were sent to the North,

318
00:26:16,143 --> 00:26:18,773
and you abandoned us like garbage.

319
00:26:19,433 --> 00:26:21,983
We, who were abandoned just like that...

320
00:26:23,413 --> 00:26:26,353
Do you know how we lived in that weird world?

321
00:26:26,353 --> 00:26:27,733
Do you have any idea?

322
00:26:27,733 --> 00:26:31,253
Even so, your father raised you to be a doctor.

323
00:26:31,253 --> 00:26:33,053
Doctor?

324
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:39,253
In your eyes, do I look like a doctor?

325
00:26:39,253 --> 00:26:41,153
Hoon.

326
00:26:43,653 --> 00:26:45,763
Right.

327
00:26:46,403 --> 00:26:49,173
Father tried to raise me to be a doctor.

328
00:26:49,173 --> 00:26:55,073
Because he said if I became a doctor, at least I wouldn't have to kill anyone. But he was wrong.

329
00:26:57,533 --> 00:27:04,073
Over there... Over there... Even doctors kill people.

330
00:27:04,073 --> 00:27:08,873
I killed so many people.

331
00:27:08,873 --> 00:27:11,573
I killed so many people. I can't even count...

332
00:27:12,843 --> 00:27:15,643
That's not a doctor, Ahjusshi.

333
00:27:15,643 --> 00:27:18,223
Someone who cuts people open by orders

334
00:27:18,223 --> 00:27:20,783
is just a murderous, crazy dog.

335
00:27:22,113 --> 00:27:23,693
Yes.

336
00:27:25,253 --> 00:27:27,813
Your warped mind...

337
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,313
I understand it just a bit.

338
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:34,253
However, no matter what anyone says, you're a doctor.

339
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:37,233
If you could understand, at least a little, why your father had to raise you up to be a doctor...

340
00:27:37,233 --> 00:27:41,033
Shut up! How can you

341
00:27:41,913 --> 00:27:45,243
possibly understand how my father felt that you're talking to me like this?

342
00:27:46,193 --> 00:27:49,743
Father ...

343
00:27:49,743 --> 00:27:52,163
I, who became a crazy dog...

344
00:27:52,163 --> 00:27:56,023
He took a bullet to make me a doctor again.

345
00:27:58,213 --> 00:28:01,763
How can you possibly know what my father felt?

346
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:05,913
And how a son, more worthless than a dog, feels for abandoning a father like that...

347
00:28:05,913 --> 00:28:08,693
What do you know, Ahjusshi?

348
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,953
Go.

349
00:28:30,133 --> 00:28:32,443
I couldn't collect

350
00:28:33,843 --> 00:28:36,413
Dr. Park's corpse.

351
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:09,883
 Hoon!

352
00:29:11,613 --> 00:29:13,573
 Hoon.

353
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:09,993
Father.

354
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:33,303
Father.

355
00:31:15,253 --> 00:31:17,853
Thank you for my father's keepsake.

356
00:31:17,853 --> 00:31:20,053
But don't interfere anymore.

357
00:31:20,053 --> 00:31:22,053
Hoon.

358
00:31:24,573 --> 00:31:26,663
What happened to these people?

359
00:31:26,663 --> 00:31:29,143
Her husband died, and

360
00:31:29,143 --> 00:31:31,723
the wife also followed him soon after.

361
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,533
They had a child, but....

362
00:31:33,533 --> 00:31:37,103
He become an orphan because of you.

363
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:41,973
I heard that he was adopted by an American family.

364
00:31:41,973 --> 00:31:46,023
I am thinking about looking for him after bringing Jae Hee here.

365
00:31:46,023 --> 00:31:48,253
I will find Jae Hee by myself.

366
00:31:48,253 --> 00:31:51,923
So please go find that person and say that you did wrong.

367
00:31:51,923 --> 00:31:52,713
Hoon.

368
00:31:52,713 --> 00:31:55,243
I am telling you to go to America instead of N. Korea.

369
00:31:55,243 --> 00:31:57,683
Stop getting involved with Jae Hee.

370
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:08,263
  Lawsuit

371
00:32:26,423 --> 00:32:28,373
Jae Joon.

372
00:32:29,743 --> 00:32:31,493
Why are you here when you said that you had something to do?

373
00:32:31,493 --> 00:32:33,933
Because Father told me to please come by.

374
00:32:33,933 --> 00:32:35,923
You too?

375
00:32:37,453 --> 00:32:40,393
I guess he has something to say to us.

376
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,403
Jae Joon.

377
00:33:14,483 --> 00:33:16,453
Yeah?

378
00:33:24,733 --> 00:33:26,553
Why?

379
00:33:26,553 --> 00:33:29,493
Just stay still.

380
00:33:50,483 --> 00:33:52,953
We are here.

381
00:33:55,413 --> 00:33:57,213
Do you believe in things like fate?

382
00:33:57,213 --> 00:33:58,973
Fate?

383
00:33:59,903 --> 00:34:02,353
You believe in things like that?

384
00:34:02,353 --> 00:34:04,483
It's silly, huh?

385
00:34:18,363 --> 00:34:22,163
You must have a feeling why I asked both of you to come here, right?

386
00:34:23,323 --> 00:34:27,523
Okay. I think it is time to think about marriage now.

387
00:34:29,273 --> 00:34:32,153
Father, you believe in fate, right?

388
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,923
Fate? What are you saying suddenly?

389
00:34:34,923 --> 00:34:38,473
Didn't you say you felt it when you first met my mother?

390
00:34:42,993 --> 00:34:47,073
Thank you for thinking to that extent for us.

391
00:34:47,073 --> 00:34:51,363
But I think marriage is for Soo Hyeon and me to decide.

392
00:34:52,873 --> 00:34:54,533
Are you two going through some problem?

393
00:34:54,533 --> 00:34:55,883
No.

394
00:34:55,883 --> 00:34:58,043
I like Jae Joon.

395
00:34:58,043 --> 00:35:00,883
You also like me, right?

396
00:35:02,553 --> 00:35:06,283
But as for the marriage, I need to think more.

397
00:35:12,533 --> 00:35:14,683
Yes.

398
00:35:14,683 --> 00:35:17,373
I understand.

399
00:35:17,373 --> 00:35:18,993
I can leave first, right?

400
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:21,003
Okay.

401
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:35,493
Was that from the hospital?

402
00:35:35,493 --> 00:35:37,383
Yes, from the hospital.

403
00:35:37,383 --> 00:35:38,393
Should I take you there?

404
00:35:38,393 --> 00:35:40,953
Leaving my father alone?

405
00:35:43,663 --> 00:35:46,183
Soo Hyeon.

406
00:35:46,183 --> 00:35:50,083
The fate I know is not just something that people believe or not believe.

407
00:35:52,423 --> 00:35:57,663
I think people create things like that.

408
00:35:57,663 --> 00:36:00,163
As expected, it is you.

409
00:36:01,153 --> 00:36:03,693
I will leave first.

410
00:36:53,443 --> 00:36:55,833
I am crazy, seriously.

411
00:37:05,513 --> 00:37:08,553
Will you be responsible for Soo Hyeon?

412
00:37:08,553 --> 00:37:09,523
I should.

413
00:37:09,523 --> 00:37:12,773
Be responsible for  Myeongwoo Hospital as well.

414
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:15,943
I am telling you to be responsible for everything I have.

415
00:37:30,513 --> 00:37:32,683
 Oh, Jae Joon.

416
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:33,933
Didn't you say you were going to the hospital?

417
00:37:33,933 --> 00:37:36,373
Sorry, there was a place I had to stop by.

418
00:37:36,373 --> 00:37:39,273
If you don't hurry up, another person will sign the contract.

419
00:37:39,273 --> 00:37:40,973
Yes.

420
00:37:40,973 --> 00:37:42,993
Are you at the hospital?

421
00:37:42,993 --> 00:37:44,693
Yes.

422
00:37:44,693 --> 00:37:45,783
Are you going to come to the hospital?

423
00:37:45,783 --> 00:37:46,953
No.

424
00:37:46,953 --> 00:37:48,493
I will go home.

425
00:37:48,493 --> 00:37:49,223
Why?

426
00:37:49,223 --> 00:37:52,903
I felt a bit lonely after you left like that.

427
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:55,213
I have to discuss the surgery team with you.

428
00:37:55,213 --> 00:37:56,183
Let's do it tomorrow.

429
00:37:56,183 --> 00:37:57,533
Okay?

430
00:37:57,533 --> 00:37:58,763
Okay.

431
00:37:58,763 --> 00:38:01,293
Drive home safely.

432
00:38:16,233 --> 00:38:18,083
Father.

433
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:20,033
Mother.

434
00:38:21,243 --> 00:38:23,543
I am almost there.

435
00:38:25,793 --> 00:38:28,373
Please wait just a moment.

436
00:38:37,513 --> 00:38:38,733
Doctor Han.

437
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:43,053
Please do me a favor.

438
00:38:50,443 --> 00:38:53,083
Please forgive me now, Doctor Han.

439
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:56,393
I already told you I won't call for a personnel committee.

440
00:38:57,253 --> 00:38:59,423
Hmm, I am grateful for that.

441
00:38:59,423 --> 00:39:03,223
You should come to our team if you really forgive me.

442
00:39:03,223 --> 00:39:05,193
I'm saying that I won't further consider what had happened as a problem,

443
00:39:05,193 --> 00:39:07,203
but I absolutely don't forgive your actions.

444
00:39:07,203 --> 00:39:08,463
Dr. Han.

445
00:39:08,463 --> 00:39:09,773
I am sorry.

446
00:39:09,773 --> 00:39:13,953
While working, there may be a time when I coincidentally work with you two in the surgery room,

447
00:39:13,953 --> 00:39:18,333
but I am not interested in things like surgery teams.

448
00:39:20,213 --> 00:39:22,283
Excuse me, Dr. Han.

449
00:39:22,283 --> 00:39:23,463
No.

450
00:39:23,463 --> 00:39:26,443
Are you really going to ignore my heart?

451
00:39:26,443 --> 00:39:29,533
I said I really need you, Dr. Han.

452
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:30,733
Seriously.

453
00:39:30,733 --> 00:39:32,963
- Dr. Han. 
 - Stop. Stop. Stop.

454
00:39:32,963 --> 00:39:33,853
What are you doing?

455
00:39:33,853 --> 00:39:35,243
Aren't you going a bit too overboard?

456
00:39:35,243 --> 00:39:36,133
What is?

457
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:41,593
Why are you doing this for a week straight with people watching, to a daughter-like person, while you are a married man?

458
00:39:41,593 --> 00:39:43,243
Why?

459
00:39:43,243 --> 00:39:46,283
Can't a married man confess his love once he gets old?

460
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:49,013
You, yourself, do well.

461
00:39:49,013 --> 00:39:50,233
- Dr. Han. 
 - I guess that can happen.

462
00:39:50,233 --> 00:39:51,593
Okay.

463
00:39:52,813 --> 00:39:55,143
That's good. So everything about the team is over, right?

464
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:57,273
What is finished?

465
00:39:57,273 --> 00:40:00,863
How can you make a surgery team without an anesthesiologist?

466
00:40:00,863 --> 00:40:04,763
Then at least make the first deposit. It has already been a week.

467
00:40:04,763 --> 00:40:08,263
I am sorry. Since I am gathering the money,

468
00:40:08,263 --> 00:40:10,563
please give me a bit more time.

469
00:40:10,563 --> 00:40:12,583
I also want to do that, but...

470
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:15,793
I am sorry. I am really sorry, Nurse.

471
00:40:15,793 --> 00:40:20,703
Is being sick a sin? Stop being sorry.

472
00:40:20,703 --> 00:40:23,303
Let's go. I will help with your wound dressing .

473
00:40:28,583 --> 00:40:31,053
Follow me.

474
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,913
Master.

475
00:40:37,063 --> 00:40:40,733
If there's no money, it's hard being a parent.

476
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:48,293
Please give me Room 1102's blood pressure results.

477
00:40:53,053 --> 00:40:54,923
Your twins are sick?

478
00:40:54,923 --> 00:40:57,523
Yes, Doctor.

479
00:40:57,523 --> 00:41:00,263
But because of the hospital fees...

480
00:41:00,263 --> 00:41:03,453
I will go take a look, so Ahjumma, don't wander around and stay still.

481
00:41:03,453 --> 00:41:08,483
Hey, this is not what's important. The surgery team selection is right around the corner.

482
00:41:08,483 --> 00:41:10,703
What is more urgent for a doctor than looking at sick patients?

483
00:41:10,703 --> 00:41:12,543
I am also a patient.

484
00:41:12,543 --> 00:41:15,853
Because of you guys, my heart is thumping like crazy.

485
00:41:17,483 --> 00:41:19,623
The mother has to be healthy in order to take care of the kids.

486
00:41:19,623 --> 00:41:21,443
Hey!

487
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:26,313
What's the reason for betting your all on the surgery team or something like that?

488
00:41:26,313 --> 00:41:28,523
After stepping on top of Han Jae Joon,

489
00:41:28,523 --> 00:41:31,663
I'm planning on asking again for my position as chief. Why?

490
00:41:31,663 --> 00:41:33,583
What is the big deal about being the chief?

491
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:35,713
It is a big deal. Don't you know?

492
00:41:35,713 --> 00:41:40,083
Our hospital only picks the next director out of the thoracic surgeons.

493
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:44,323
The Chairman and Byeong Cheol Hyung were thoracic surgeons.

494
00:41:45,013 --> 00:41:48,953
Master, you have a lot of money and you don't lack anything. Do you really want to do that too?

495
00:41:48,953 --> 00:41:51,763
It is my dream. What are you going to do about it?

496
00:41:51,763 --> 00:41:53,613
How can that be a dream?

497
00:41:53,613 --> 00:41:55,133
Of course, it can.

498
00:41:55,993 --> 00:42:01,573
My father, for 30 years working in the pharmaceutical business,

499
00:42:02,693 --> 00:42:07,083
whenever he was in front of a doctor, he bent his back as if he was a criminal.

500
00:42:08,153 --> 00:42:10,073
That kind of man...

501
00:42:10,073 --> 00:42:12,663
Do you know what he said to me when he passed away?

502
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:14,463
Hyung Wook,

503
00:42:16,713 --> 00:42:20,953
you have to become a hospital director no matter what, ok?

504
00:42:21,673 --> 00:42:23,543
So...

505
00:42:24,823 --> 00:42:30,123
you have to make all those doctors bow to me at my memorial service.

506
00:42:31,353 --> 00:42:33,483
He was like that.

507
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:44,333
The reason isn't just that, right?

508
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:47,643
Of course, if I become the hospital director do you know how much money I get?

509
00:42:47,643 --> 00:42:49,353
Is not what I mean.

510
00:42:49,353 --> 00:42:52,123
I said it's was my father's will.

511
00:42:52,123 --> 00:42:55,963
I understand. How is looking for another anesthesiologist going?

512
00:42:55,963 --> 00:42:57,953
It can't be another person.

513
00:42:57,953 --> 00:43:01,123
The best people need to be chosen. The best.

514
00:43:01,123 --> 00:43:03,173
You as the surgeon, then Han Seung Hee as the anesthesiologist.

515
00:43:03,173 --> 00:43:09,083
Who on earth is the surgery team going to perform on that you keep saying the best, the best?

516
00:43:10,013 --> 00:43:12,403
Prime Minister Jang Seok Joo.

517
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:14,933
Who?

518
00:43:14,933 --> 00:43:17,263
Prime Minister Jang Seok Joo.

519
00:43:18,903 --> 00:43:22,443
Yeah. It is Prime Minister Jang Seok Joo.

520
00:43:35,033 --> 00:43:38,043
  Alert Record and Coma

521
00:43:44,733 --> 00:43:46,973
It's incredible.

522
00:43:56,023 --> 00:43:58,353
I would like to meet them.

523
00:43:58,353 --> 00:44:00,263
Are you saying you want to meet them yourself?

524
00:44:01,253 --> 00:44:03,373
There are too many eyes watching you.

525
00:44:03,373 --> 00:44:04,593
It is dangerous.

526
00:44:04,593 --> 00:44:09,253
They have my political career, no my life, in their hands.

527
00:44:09,253 --> 00:44:11,973
I should be able to risk that much danger.

528
00:44:22,363 --> 00:44:28,033
I heard that there is this joke among the thoracic doctors.

529
00:44:28,033 --> 00:44:34,223
When we retire, there will be no doctor to fix our heart when there is a problem with it.

530
00:44:34,223 --> 00:44:38,013
So if there is a problem with the heart,

531
00:44:38,013 --> 00:44:42,983
then there is no other way but to jump into the Han River.

532
00:44:44,043 --> 00:44:48,013
No, it isn't something to laugh about.

533
00:44:48,013 --> 00:44:53,403
If the number of thoracic surgeons decrease, then in the end, it'll be worse for our citizens.

534
00:44:53,403 --> 00:44:56,023
Does the Blue House know about this event?

535
00:44:56,023 --> 00:44:57,423
Of course.

536
00:44:57,423 --> 00:45:03,013
The President is probably curious about which thoracic department will perform surgery on my heart.

537
00:45:03,013 --> 00:45:05,643
Is there a hospital that is a strong candidate?

538
00:45:08,523 --> 00:45:13,323
After the first round of evaluation, Jaeil Hospital, Dongwoon Hospital, Minguk Hospital as well as

539
00:45:13,323 --> 00:45:18,113
Myeongwoo Hospital are the candidates.

540
00:45:22,713 --> 00:45:25,283
What did they say are the final deciding points?

541
00:45:25,283 --> 00:45:29,183
Ah, the hospital's financial integrity, their public relations,

542
00:45:29,183 --> 00:45:31,473
and the patients' satisfied loyalty.

543
00:45:31,473 --> 00:45:34,453
This is a team that will operate on the nation's prime minister.

544
00:45:35,143 --> 00:45:39,343
Thus, the hospital with the best skills will be selected in the end.

545
00:45:39,343 --> 00:45:44,503
If selected, ₩ 10,000,000,000 for initial medical fund, and ₩ 15,000,000,000 for further research will be granted.

546
00:45:44,503 --> 00:45:50,223
If the surgery is successful, its advertising powers will create an economic effect of at least ₩ 100,000,000,000.

547
00:45:50,223 --> 00:45:53,543
It's another chance for our Myeongwoo Hospital to be alive again.

548
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:56,763
I will depend on many doctors' and chief's involvement.

549
00:45:56,763 --> 00:45:59,013
Then the representative for our hospital, will it be Chief Han's team?

550
00:45:59,013 --> 00:46:02,093
No, there will be two teams that will be competing.

551
00:46:03,503 --> 00:46:04,673
- Two teams? 
 - Yes.

552
00:46:04,673 --> 00:46:09,423
The first team is Han Jae Joon's surgical team.

553
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:17,243
Irrigation.

554
00:46:19,373 --> 00:46:21,053
Suction.

555
00:46:26,153 --> 00:46:30,863
They're taking photos in advance saying that we will be the representative team for the Prime Minister's surgery.

556
00:46:30,863 --> 00:46:32,463
Then smile so that the photographs will turn out well.

557
00:46:32,463 --> 00:46:35,323
How can we smile with a mask on?

558
00:46:35,323 --> 00:46:37,003
Then at least wave your hand.

559
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:40,813
Is there another team other than Doctor Han's team in the Thoracic Department?

560
00:46:40,813 --> 00:46:43,463
There is Dr. Park Hoon's team.

561
00:46:45,463 --> 00:46:48,723
But Father, he is a defector.

562
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:52,223
Operating on a heart has to do with skill, not place of origin.

563
00:46:52,813 --> 00:46:57,303
Regardless of who it is, as long as he has the skills, he can become the representative of Myeongwoo.

564
00:46:57,303 --> 00:47:01,093
Myeongwoo's representative? Don't kid me.

565
00:47:02,293 --> 00:47:04,713
I don't know about anyone else, but you can't do this to me.

566
00:47:04,713 --> 00:47:09,923
If you succeed, then you will be recognized by the whole nation as the best doctor.

567
00:47:09,923 --> 00:47:12,323
What are you trying to hide this time?

568
00:47:12,323 --> 00:47:12,973
Hoon!

569
00:47:12,973 --> 00:47:17,103
If not, how could you tell me to do the surgery on him, huh?

570
00:47:21,153 --> 00:47:24,803
What we had to go through because of that person,

571
00:47:24,803 --> 00:47:27,253
it's already not enough to kill him, but you want me to operate on him?

572
00:47:27,253 --> 00:47:31,053
Your father saved  even Kim Il Sung's heart.

573
00:47:31,053 --> 00:47:32,343
I am not my father.

574
00:47:32,343 --> 00:47:33,623
You are also a doctor.

575
00:47:33,623 --> 00:47:35,623
That kind of thing!

576
00:47:35,623 --> 00:47:38,213
Give it to the dogs.

577
00:47:40,973 --> 00:47:42,993
Hoon!

578
00:47:46,623 --> 00:47:48,373
Hoon!

579
00:47:51,423 --> 00:47:52,553
I can't do it.

580
00:47:52,553 --> 00:47:56,053
I absolutely can't act like a doctor in front of that kind of human being.

581
00:48:00,293 --> 00:48:02,713
Park Hoon! Hey!

582
00:48:04,403 --> 00:48:11,313

583
00:48:14,013 --> 00:48:15,553
What is this?

584
00:48:15,553 --> 00:48:17,953
It's in place of a white flag of surrender.

585
00:48:17,953 --> 00:48:20,413
It didn't even start, but you're already surrendering?

586
00:48:20,413 --> 00:48:22,233
Can't I do that?

587
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:24,203
Truthfully, it is funny.

588
00:48:24,203 --> 00:48:27,653
A match between doctors who fix patients,

589
00:48:27,653 --> 00:48:29,453
when we're not warriors armed with soldiers.

590
00:48:29,453 --> 00:48:31,373
That's why I am saying I am not doing it.

591
00:48:31,373 --> 00:48:33,743
But I was looking forward to it.

592
00:48:34,913 --> 00:48:39,193
If I have a match against the infamous Doctor Park, what would happen?

593
00:48:40,573 --> 00:48:43,473
I'm sorry for disappointing you.

594
00:48:46,873 --> 00:48:50,773
There's no way this is because you are afraid of losing, right?

595
00:48:50,773 --> 00:48:55,533
Think whatever you like. In any case, you won. Then.

596
00:48:56,393 --> 00:48:59,763
Hey! Win what?

597
00:49:00,713 --> 00:49:02,653
Chief Han, this isn't right.

598
00:49:02,653 --> 00:49:05,273
This is not surrender, okay?

599
00:49:06,103 --> 00:49:09,683
Hey, Hoon! Hey!

600
00:49:19,713 --> 00:49:22,253
How did this happen?

601
00:49:23,083 --> 00:49:23,723
Are you okay?

602
00:49:23,723 --> 00:49:26,303
I'll take care of this, you go to Room 1129.

603
00:49:37,853 --> 00:49:41,973
Mother, please calm down first. First, please let go of that.

604
00:49:41,973 --> 00:49:45,643
In any case, we will get kicked out from the hospital and die.

605
00:49:45,643 --> 00:49:47,453
There will be a social support team. There will be a way if you go...

606
00:49:47,453 --> 00:49:49,133
- There's no use!
- Ajummoni.

607
00:49:49,133 --> 00:49:51,633
Don't come, Doctor.

608
00:49:51,633 --> 00:49:54,283
I will go together with my kids.

609
00:49:55,963 --> 00:49:57,633
What happened?

610
00:49:58,443 --> 00:49:59,953
Both children have heart malformations.

611
00:49:59,953 --> 00:50:01,413
What?

612
00:50:05,343 --> 00:50:07,093
Why did you step up when it's dangerous?

613
00:50:07,093 --> 00:50:09,643
I'm sorry. But I had to do it because of the baby.

614
00:50:09,643 --> 00:50:13,463
If something went wrong, who will take care of our child?

615
00:50:16,083 --> 00:50:17,803
Patient Byeong Mi Ok's twin's chart.

616
00:50:17,803 --> 00:50:20,033
It's on the monitor.

617
00:50:23,833 --> 00:50:26,333
She would have known if only she had gotten an ultrasound while she was pregnant.

618
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:28,393
She probably wouldn't have had the money for that.

619
00:50:28,393 --> 00:50:31,323
The ductus arteriosus is almost shut and the atrial septal defect is too small.

620
00:50:31,323 --> 00:50:35,183
If there is a small atrial septal defect, then isn't it really dangerous as the repair is more difficult?

621
00:50:36,163 --> 00:50:39,293
She started as a scrub nurse for the OR.

622
00:50:39,293 --> 00:50:43,383
- Get ready for the surgery.
- What surgery?

623
00:50:48,443 --> 00:50:51,463
- Oh, Chief Choi, you're here. 
 - For what reason did you call me?

624
00:50:51,463 --> 00:50:54,433
Call the chiefs of each department and ask them to come to the front of the hospital.

625
00:50:54,433 --> 00:50:55,573
Yes.

626
00:50:55,573 --> 00:50:57,033
I assume that a VIP is coming?

627
00:50:57,033 --> 00:50:59,923
Let's go. You know the person well, too.

628
00:51:05,933 --> 00:51:07,093
Release the patient?

629
00:51:07,093 --> 00:51:10,943
We've already spent hundreds for your video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and C-section.

630
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:13,773
- We did as much as we can.
- The baby is hurt.

631
00:51:13,773 --> 00:51:16,663
One surgery costs ₩30,000,000. Together is ₩60,000,000.

632
00:51:16,663 --> 00:51:18,873
- Are you going to pay?
- Does that mean you have to kick out a patient?

633
00:51:18,873 --> 00:51:20,723
Who is kicking her out?

634
00:51:20,723 --> 00:51:24,043
We are kindly bringing her to the police.

635
00:51:24,043 --> 00:51:25,293
To the police?

636
00:51:25,293 --> 00:51:27,793
I heard there is a hostage situation.

637
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:30,083
And you've been hurt from that?

638
00:51:31,593 --> 00:51:36,203
It'll work well for us. First we'll release her then let the police take care of it.

639
00:51:39,213 --> 00:51:41,343
What's wrong?

640
00:52:11,033 --> 00:52:13,473
Aigoo, long time no see.

641
00:52:21,873 --> 00:52:25,493
What should I do, Doctor? The baby isn't moving.

642
00:52:25,493 --> 00:52:29,333
- I will take a look at the baby.
- Don't come closer. We're going to die together.

643
00:52:29,333 --> 00:52:31,993
Die? Who's going to die?

644
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,813
There is no breathing.

645
00:52:36,813 --> 00:52:38,083
Bring the intubation set.

646
00:52:38,083 --> 00:52:40,303
Yes, Doctor.

647
00:52:41,943 --> 00:52:44,003
- Make sure that bastard doesn't come in.
- What do you mean?

648
00:52:44,003 --> 00:52:47,813
He said he will bring the police. Are you going to kick the babies out of the hospital?

649
00:52:55,663 --> 00:52:57,303
- Move aside!
- They are in the middle of treating the patient.

650
00:52:57,303 --> 00:52:58,333
Is a hostage situation a type of treatment now?

651
00:52:58,333 --> 00:52:59,533
I told you we are in the middle of treatment.

652
00:52:59,553 --> 00:53:02,683
Are you joking? What are you doing?

653
00:53:02,683 --> 00:53:04,813
I'm Oh Soo Hyeon.

654
00:53:04,813 --> 00:53:08,343
If you move one step, I won't stay still.

655
00:53:18,363 --> 00:53:21,863
There is no pulse. First, the NICU--

656
00:54:56,363 --> 00:54:59,083
You have to come back to Mom.

657
00:55:37,553 --> 00:55:40,243
Now you look like a doctor.

658
00:55:42,713 --> 00:55:45,443
Doctor Park Hoon.

659
00:55:50,193 --> 00:55:52,173
These people...

660
00:55:52,173 --> 00:55:55,463
How dare you be unreasonable?

661
00:55:57,093 --> 00:55:58,543
Move aside!

662
00:55:58,543 --> 00:56:00,303
What are you doing right now?!

663
00:56:00,303 --> 00:56:02,333
Move the babies to the intensive care unit.

664
00:56:02,333 --> 00:56:04,463
What are you doing?

665
00:56:11,113 --> 00:56:12,713
Doctor Park, come with me for a moment.

666
00:56:12,713 --> 00:56:16,373
Yeah, later, because I have to go somewhere.

667
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:26,693
  Dr. Park Hoon.

668
00:56:30,723 --> 00:56:32,523
Doctor Park Hoon gave up?

669
00:56:32,523 --> 00:56:36,503
Yes. He said that a few moments ago.

670
00:56:36,503 --> 00:56:38,403
So what?

671
00:56:38,403 --> 00:56:40,953
We have Chief Han Jae Joon.

672
00:56:43,023 --> 00:56:45,023
We do, but...

673
00:56:45,023 --> 00:56:48,013
  Let go, please. Seriously.

674
00:56:48,013 --> 00:56:51,343
- You can't do this. 
 - Forget it.

675
00:57:00,633 --> 00:57:03,313
Dr. Park Hoon?

676
00:57:07,453 --> 00:57:08,873
What is the matter?

677
00:57:08,873 --> 00:57:11,353
Because I have something to find.

678
00:57:17,103 --> 00:57:19,003
Didn't you give up?

679
00:57:19,003 --> 00:57:21,353
I have a condition.

680
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:24,123
A condition?

681
00:57:24,123 --> 00:57:27,343
Competition or contest, whatever it is,

682
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:30,453
the hospital will take responsibility for the expense no matter what.

683
00:57:33,763 --> 00:57:38,203
- Is that the only condition? 
 - Then I will assume you accept it.

684
00:57:39,223 --> 00:57:42,043
Please take good care of me.

685
00:57:45,323 --> 00:57:54,173
