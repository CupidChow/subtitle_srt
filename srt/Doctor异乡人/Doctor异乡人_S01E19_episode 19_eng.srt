1
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,767

2
00:00:27,367 --> 00:00:34,597
Yes. I'm that Lee Seung Hoon from 20 years ago.

3
00:00:38,967 --> 00:00:43,677
Thank you for not letting my life go to waste.

4
00:00:45,027 --> 00:00:46,977
Chairman Oh Joon Gyu.

5
00:00:46,977 --> 00:00:52,097
You... you bastard!

6
00:01:00,037 --> 00:01:02,667
- Take out the emergency key right now.
- Okay.

7
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:05,987
Father. Father, are you okay?

8
00:01:05,987 --> 00:01:08,277
Jae Joon!

9
00:01:36,187 --> 00:01:37,877
Father!

10
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,957
Call the operating room. Hurry!

11
00:01:48,957 --> 00:01:51,077
Yes!

12
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:55,147
What in the world did you do? What did you do...

13
00:01:57,537 --> 00:02:00,767
Father. Father.

14
00:02:03,747 --> 00:02:05,927
Move him quickly.

15
00:02:22,027 --> 00:02:26,477
I will never forgive you. Never.

16
00:03:02,857 --> 00:03:05,987
I'm almost done so go on out.

17
00:03:05,987 --> 00:03:08,817
He's okay, so don't worry.

18
00:03:08,817 --> 00:03:11,217
Because you keep just standing there, I can't focus.

19
00:03:11,217 --> 00:03:13,267
Okay.

20
00:03:21,237 --> 00:03:25,347
 Episode 19

21
00:03:48,047 --> 00:03:49,307
How is the Chairman?

22
00:03:49,307 --> 00:03:51,967
He'll be okay.

23
00:03:51,967 --> 00:03:54,367
Although that's bad news to you.

24
00:03:57,097 --> 00:03:59,707
Were you thinking to do this from the beginning?

25
00:04:00,747 --> 00:04:05,297
Tell me! I'm asking if you were thinking of  causing my father to die from the beginning!

26
00:04:05,297 --> 00:04:06,777
I didn't know he would collapse.

27
00:04:06,777 --> 00:04:09,847
Lies. Then why did you lock the door?

28
00:04:09,847 --> 00:04:12,947
- I didn't want to be interrupted.
- From what?

29
00:04:12,947 --> 00:04:15,237
From killing Father?

30
00:04:15,237 --> 00:04:17,087
- Soo Hyeon.
 - Then what?!

31
00:04:17,087 --> 00:04:19,877
I told you. If only I got an apology from the Chairman-

32
00:04:19,877 --> 00:04:23,237
Don't kid with me. If I hadn't come in at that time, my father would have died.

33
00:04:23,237 --> 00:04:26,177
He would have died in your hands!

34
00:04:26,177 --> 00:04:28,367
You're a doctor after all.

35
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:30,417
How can you do something so cruel?

36
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:33,797
When a person was dying in front of your eyes, how can...

37
00:04:35,847 --> 00:04:38,177
You're not a doctor, but a murderer.

38
00:04:47,027 --> 00:04:50,547
You're right. I'm not even a doctor.

39
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,547
All I am is a murderer who is blinded by revenge.

40
00:04:58,457 --> 00:05:00,867
However can't you try to understand me?

41
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,267
You're asking me to understand you?

42
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:08,577
The feeling you have right now, it's that feeling I felt when I  lost my parents 20 years ago.

43
00:05:08,577 --> 00:05:14,417
Why I had to do that, why I had no other choice but to be so cruel... I'm asking you to think about it.

44
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:16,997
After doing this to me,

45
00:05:16,997 --> 00:05:19,437
you're asking me to understand you?

46
00:05:20,297 --> 00:05:22,337
I can't understand you.

47
00:05:23,587 --> 00:05:26,127
Get out of this hospital right now.

48
00:05:26,127 --> 00:05:27,847
Immediately.

49
00:05:32,247 --> 00:05:34,077
Alright.

50
00:05:55,257 --> 00:05:57,167
Thanks.

51
00:05:59,557 --> 00:06:04,277
I don't know who it was, but if emergency measures were taken even a little bit later, it could have been bad.

52
00:07:21,397 --> 00:07:23,877
 Jeez, seriously.

53
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,667
Hyungnim.

54
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:30,057
That weird rumor going around in the hospital...

55
00:07:30,057 --> 00:07:32,427
perhaps ... that's not true, right?

56
00:07:32,427 --> 00:07:33,527
What rumor?

57
00:07:33,527 --> 00:07:36,607
That you are the son of a medical malpractice victim.

58
00:07:36,607 --> 00:07:39,717
That's why you did this to take revenge on the chairman, but-

59
00:07:39,717 --> 00:07:42,257
- It's true.
- What?

60
00:07:42,257 --> 00:07:44,967
I'm saying that it's not a rumor, but it's the truth.

61
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:46,767
Hyung.

62
00:07:51,317 --> 00:07:53,577
I'll be leaving soon.

63
00:07:53,577 --> 00:07:56,347
From the start, I didn't fit in here.

64
00:07:57,397 --> 00:08:01,887
Chi Gyu, you must work hard and become a good doctor.

65

73
00:09:22,927 --> 00:09:25,217
What are you doing here?

74
00:09:31,757 --> 00:09:34,037
I turned in my resignation.

75
00:09:34,897 --> 00:09:36,507
Then  go now.

76

♬  On a bright sunny day. On a good day like this.  ♬

78
00:09:40,627 --> 00:09:45,447
No, don't even come anywhere near this hospital.
♬  On a bright sunny day. On a good day like this.  ♬

79
00:09:47,407 --> 00:09:53,847

89
00:10:48,877 --> 00:10:51,757
Why on earth did you do that?

90
00:10:51,757 --> 00:10:55,457
Because it was something I've been waiting and planning for 20 years.

91
00:10:55,457 --> 00:10:57,057
So?

92
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:59,137
Do you feel better now?

93
00:10:59,137 --> 00:11:01,577
I've failed to get revenge.

94
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,487
You didn't fail but gave up, isn't it?

95
00:11:03,487 --> 00:11:04,707
Because you love Quack.

96
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:05,477
No.

97
00:11:05,477 --> 00:11:07,037
Please don't lie.

98
00:11:07,037 --> 00:11:10,247
I already know that you performed CPR on the Chairman to save him.

99
00:11:18,147 --> 00:11:21,237
Tell Quack the truth and ask for her forgiveness.

100
00:11:21,237 --> 00:11:25,507
Otherwise Quack will misunderstand and resent you all her life.

101
00:11:25,507 --> 00:11:28,467
It's preferable this way.

102
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:31,807
She'll be able to forget about me at once.

103
00:11:33,557 --> 00:11:36,797
I came here to say goodbye before I leave.

104
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:38,607
What do you mean by leaving?

105
00:11:38,607 --> 00:11:43,527
Doctor... I'm going to quit.

106
00:11:43,527 --> 00:11:44,177
Why?

107
00:11:44,177 --> 00:11:47,367
I'm not qualified.

108
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:50,167
Since the beginning, I became a doctor for revenge.

109
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:54,267
I had no sense of duty of treating patients.

110
00:11:56,837 --> 00:12:01,157
At first, I thought you were a foreigner.

111
00:12:01,157 --> 00:12:05,067
But when I thought about it, it turned out that the real foreigner

112
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:08,097
was me.

113
00:12:08,097 --> 00:12:10,347
I realized this thanks to you, Doctor Park.

114
00:12:10,347 --> 00:12:16,007
Doctors who truly don't respect a patient's life are all foreigners.

115
00:12:16,007 --> 00:12:19,437
If that's what you're thinking, then you should stay right here.

116
00:12:19,437 --> 00:12:23,957
Once you keep doing that, a time will come when even Quack will come to understand you as well.

117
00:12:23,957 --> 00:12:28,187
I can't forgive myself.

118
00:12:28,187 --> 00:12:32,607
I won't be coming back to the hospital.

119
00:12:32,607 --> 00:12:34,727
Instead, I have a favor to ask of you.

120
00:12:34,727 --> 00:12:36,047
What favor?

121
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:41,037
Soo Hyeon likes you sincerely.

122
00:12:43,377 --> 00:12:47,467
I am sorry but I found Jae Hee.

123
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,807
It's hard to tell the specific details but I found her.

124
00:12:49,807 --> 00:12:52,527
So I can't like another woman,

125
00:12:52,527 --> 00:12:54,657
nor do I have the capacity to be concerned about it.

126
00:12:54,657 --> 00:12:57,857
I decline that favor.

127
00:12:57,857 --> 00:13:01,057
Then let me ask you for a favor like this.

128
00:13:01,057 --> 00:13:05,807
Stay by Soo Hyeon as a friend and watch over her.

129
00:13:07,907 --> 00:13:11,017
A friend?

130
00:13:11,017 --> 00:13:13,807
Please.

131
00:13:30,757 --> 00:13:32,327
Father...

132
00:13:32,327 --> 00:13:34,997
Father are you alright?

133
00:13:36,217 --> 00:13:39,417
Why? Who are you looking for?

134
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:41,697
Chief Han.

135
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:46,367
Where is Han Jae Joon?

136
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,507
He's not here anymore.

137
00:13:48,507 --> 00:13:50,627
Bring him here.

138
00:13:50,627 --> 00:13:52,647
There is something I need to say.

139
00:13:52,647 --> 00:13:54,267
Forget about it.

140
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:57,487
Why would you look for the person who just watched you when you collapsed?

141
00:13:57,487 --> 00:14:00,667
No,

142
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:03,887
Chief Han saved me.

143
00:14:28,107 --> 00:14:31,037
  It's because of Soo Hyeon.

144
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,377
Find Jae Joon.

145
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,077
That can't be.

146
00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:44,757
- Hurry.
- He didn't say anything to me. Not a word-

147
00:14:44,757 --> 00:14:48,037
Jae Joon...

148
00:14:48,037 --> 00:14:51,347
It's a lie.

149
00:14:51,347 --> 00:14:53,987
Hurry.

150
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:59,017
  The number you dialed...

151
00:15:00,657 --> 00:15:03,127
  Oh Soo Hyeon

152
00:15:20,517 --> 00:15:25,057
  Cardiothoracic Department Han Jae Joon

153
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,927
Jae Joon.

154
00:16:17,987 --> 00:16:20,217
I am sorry.

155
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,107
I am sorry.

156
00:16:26,137 --> 00:16:29,997
So, Chairman is recovering at the ICU right now.

157
00:16:29,997 --> 00:16:32,847
He got bitten by Han Jae Joon properly.

158
00:16:32,847 --> 00:16:35,447
I hear they will be picking a new acting Chairman soon.

159
00:16:35,447 --> 00:16:39,957
They have to. There is not much time left until VIP's surgery.

160
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:43,607
Would it make sense not to have the head here?

161
00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:50,957
You can't find the body?

162
00:16:50,957 --> 00:16:52,517
It's a body which was shot.

163
00:16:52,517 --> 00:16:54,187
You definitely have to find him.

164
00:16:54,187 --> 00:16:56,127
Yes.

165
00:18:10,707 --> 00:18:13,727
There is a chance that Cha Jin Soo is still alive so be extra careful.

166
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:16,167
I understand, Secretary Kim.

167
00:18:43,737 --> 00:18:48,647
Since I got to be in this position due to the Chairman's illness, my  heart is heavy.

168
00:18:48,647 --> 00:18:52,027
To be sure that it won't be troublesome for the Chairman when he returns after his recovery,

169
00:18:52,027 --> 00:18:56,567
I will execute the Chairman's position with all my efforts during this period.

170
00:19:03,597 --> 00:19:07,757
 Chairman, Oh Joon Gyu.

171
00:19:10,527 --> 00:19:15,337
You should quickly grasp the manpower we need and after you call the branch, put it up on the board.

172
00:19:15,337 --> 00:19:17,707
Okay.

173
00:19:17,707 --> 00:19:19,287
No.

174
00:19:19,287 --> 00:19:23,407
I understand, acting Chairman.

175
00:19:23,407 --> 00:19:25,977
You can talk comfortably as before.

176
00:19:25,977 --> 00:19:30,147
Then it means that starting today, I've become the  Chief of Cardiothoracic Department, right?

177
00:19:30,147 --> 00:19:32,227
Yes.

178
00:19:33,997 --> 00:19:39,327
It's really unfortunate about Chief Han's matter.

179
00:19:39,327 --> 00:19:42,087
- Please take your leave. 
 - Okay.

180
00:19:51,927 --> 00:19:55,037
  Cardiothoracic Department Chief 
Moon Hyung Wook

181
00:19:56,337 --> 00:20:00,047
I just came back to my original place, but

182
00:20:00,047 --> 00:20:02,907
why am I so moved?

183
00:20:02,907 --> 00:20:06,787
Congratulations Doctor Moon, I mean Chief Moon.

184
00:20:06,787 --> 00:20:09,187
Let's end this quickly.

185
00:20:09,187 --> 00:20:10,807
Stay still for a moment.

186
00:20:10,807 --> 00:20:15,697
Why are you telling me to hurry it up when it's such an emotionally moving moment?

187
00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:18,317
Let's give a round of applause.

188
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,777
Thanks.

189
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:26,917
When the Prime Minister's surgery ends,

190
00:20:26,917 --> 00:20:29,897
there will be an endless amount of interest in our cardiothoracic department,

191
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:33,477
and an enormous sum of research funds will be rolling in.

192
00:20:33,477 --> 00:20:35,887
What are you doing, huh?

193
00:20:36,557 --> 00:20:38,827
An enormous sum of research funds... yes, go ahead.

194
00:20:38,827 --> 00:20:41,827
As your chief, as the chief,

195
00:20:41,827 --> 00:20:45,187
I am feeling an overwhelming responsibility.

196
00:20:45,187 --> 00:20:47,947
So all of you should unite with me,

197
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:52,237
and let's do our best to make this cardiothoracic department become the face of

198
00:20:52,237 --> 00:20:54,337
Myeongwoo University Hospital..
 Quack

199
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:58,107
This what I want to say. Hey where are you going?

200
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:00,867
What weird thing did Jae Hee say?

201
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:05,207
Is it correct that you used Jae Hee's father's kidney to do the transplant surgery?

202
00:21:06,207 --> 00:21:11,287
If that is really true, then that means that Jae Hee really likes you.

203
00:21:11,287 --> 00:21:14,387
Otherwise, how could she have come looking for you after knowing that?

204
00:21:14,387 --> 00:21:17,227
What are you saying? She knew that before meeting me?

205
00:21:17,227 --> 00:21:21,407
She said that's why she was not confident in meeting you.

206
00:21:22,767 --> 00:21:25,077
On top of that, she was saying that you liked me.

207
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:27,907
Quack, I told you it's not you. That's why I apologized.

208
00:21:27,907 --> 00:21:31,887
I'm so thankful for confirming it, but what I'm saying is

209
00:21:31,887 --> 00:21:36,007
that it seemed like Jae Hee was pointlessly trying to pass you over to me.

210
00:21:45,907 --> 00:21:48,457
Why did you lie to me?

211
00:21:48,457 --> 00:21:50,367
Lie?

212
00:21:50,367 --> 00:21:55,017
You knew from earlier on that you had your transplant surgery with your father's kidney.

213
00:21:55,737 --> 00:21:57,457
Is knowing when I found out important?

214
00:21:57,457 --> 00:22:00,947
You said that you couldn't forgive me as you said you had just found out.

215
00:22:00,947 --> 00:22:04,027
On top of that, you had even asked Quack to take care of me.

216
00:22:04,027 --> 00:22:06,327
You're doing it on purpose.

217
00:22:06,327 --> 00:22:08,897
You pretended to be angry to send me away.

218
00:22:08,897 --> 00:22:12,697
Fine, I did it to send you away.

219
00:22:12,697 --> 00:22:13,407
Why?

220
00:22:13,407 --> 00:22:15,667
I already told you,

221
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,207
I found out that this love was a hypocrisy.

222
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:22,787
What you're feeling is guilt and sense of duty for causing my father to pass away.  And you're calling that love.

223
00:22:22,787 --> 00:22:25,817
- Jae Hee-
- I told you not to call out that name.

224
00:22:25,817 --> 00:22:27,677
Do you know?

225
00:22:28,337 --> 00:22:30,647
Do you know...

226
00:22:30,647 --> 00:22:33,877
how it feels to live with my father's death attached to my body?

227
00:22:33,877 --> 00:22:37,037
Even if I want to forget, it can't be forgotten.

228
00:22:38,527 --> 00:22:42,227
When he's always here in my body,  how can it be forgotten?

229
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:45,857
Every single day I live, I feel so guilty and is very painful.

230
00:22:45,857 --> 00:22:52,407
But it hurts even more since I think it's because of you.

231
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,787
Do you still not know?

232
00:22:56,507 --> 00:22:58,717
Then I'll say it more clearly.

233
00:22:58,717 --> 00:23:04,007
I have never once sincerely loved you.

234
00:23:07,647 --> 00:23:10,307
If you understand, go back now.

235
00:23:17,287 --> 00:23:19,767
Then what was this?

236
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:23,797
 The last  month I was able to meet you again,

237
00:23:23,797 --> 00:23:27,037
 were moments that I really could not forget.

238
00:23:27,997 --> 00:23:31,107
 Especially you know...  that one time,

239
00:23:31,107 --> 00:23:34,767
 when you hugged me tightly in the staff room.

240
00:23:35,387 --> 00:23:38,167
 I was really happy then.

241
00:23:39,107 --> 00:23:43,957
 Even if I don't say it... even if  I keep denying it,

242
00:23:44,927 --> 00:23:48,417
  I felt that you recognized me.

243
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:50,527
Listen!

244
00:23:51,737 --> 00:23:53,757
 Hoon,

245
00:23:53,757 --> 00:23:56,867
 the reason why I said I'd do this alone,

246
00:23:56,867 --> 00:23:59,597
 is because of your mother.

247
00:23:59,597 --> 00:24:04,747
 If you are in charge of the surgery team and by any chance something goes wrong,

248
00:24:04,747 --> 00:24:07,997
 there would be no one to take care of your mother.

249
00:24:09,807 --> 00:24:12,637
Look straight into my eyes and say it.

250
00:24:12,637 --> 00:24:16,737
Is it true that you don't love me?

251
00:24:17,777 --> 00:24:19,847
That's right.

252
00:24:21,187 --> 00:24:23,717
Say it again.

253
00:24:23,717 --> 00:24:25,927
Is it for real?

254
00:24:29,577 --> 00:24:31,157
Say it!

255
00:24:31,157 --> 00:24:33,287
Is it for real?

256
00:24:36,447 --> 00:24:39,907
That's right I like you. I love you.

257
00:24:39,907 --> 00:24:44,187
I have never once hated you!   Pretending to hate you was really hard!

258
00:24:44,187 --> 00:24:46,207
I only thought about you every day.

259
00:24:46,207 --> 00:24:51,407
Each day, I've only lived dreaming of living happily with you.

260
00:24:56,267 --> 00:25:03,357
♬  Like the sun which comes through the window late in the morning waking me  ♬

261
00:25:03,357 --> 00:25:10,307
♬  You gently approach.  ♬

262
00:25:10,307 --> 00:25:17,047
♬  When I open my eyes I wonder whether it is a dream. I wonder whether I am allowed to feel this joy.  ♬

263
00:25:17,047 --> 00:25:23,277
♬  I keep asking myself.  ♬

264
00:25:26,627 --> 00:25:30,697
♬  I love like a tomorrow which may not come.  ♬

265
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:32,587
Then why did you do that?
♬  I love like a tomorrow which may not come.  ♬

266
00:25:32,587 --> 00:25:35,377
You becoming a doctor,
♬  I love as if I may not see you again.  ♬

267
00:25:35,377 --> 00:25:39,117
I thought I was blocking it.
♬  I love as if I may not see you again.  ♬

268
00:25:39,117 --> 00:25:43,697
I thought that I had to let you go for you to become
♬  Day to day for me I heal with love instead of scars.  ♬

269
00:25:43,697 --> 00:25:46,557
comfortable and to be safe.
♬  Day to day for me I heal with love instead of scars.  ♬

270
00:25:46,597 --> 00:25:48,247
♬  Day to day for me I heal with love instead of scars.  ♬

271
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:50,907
I'm sorry.
♬  Day to day for me I heal with love instead of scars.  ♬

272
00:25:50,907 --> 00:25:55,707
I didn't think that you would be in danger because of me.

273
00:25:56,537 --> 00:25:58,937
Why is that because of you?

274
00:25:58,937 --> 00:26:02,197
It's because I made the wrong choice.

275
00:26:02,197 --> 00:26:04,727
The wrong choice?

276
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:08,967
When I think about it now, I regret it so much.

277
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:18,007

278
00:26:20,437 --> 00:26:23,797
 Don't you want to meet that bastard, Park Hoon?

279
00:26:33,707 --> 00:26:40,377
♬  I love like a tomorrow which may not come.  ♬

280
00:26:40,377 --> 00:26:44,257
Back then, I never imagined that it'd put you in danger!
♬  I love as if I may not see you again.  ♬

281
00:26:44,257 --> 00:26:48,957
No, I didn't even have time to think about that.
♬  I love as if I may not see you again.  ♬

282
00:26:48,957 --> 00:26:51,877
Because I missed you so much.
♬  Day to day for me I heal with love instead of scars.  ♬

283
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:53,967
♬  Day to day for me I heal with love instead of scars.  ♬

284
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:56,107
I'm sorry, Hoon.
♬  Day to day for me I heal with love instead of scars.  ♬

285
00:26:56,107 --> 00:26:58,047
I seriously,
♬  Day to day for me I heal with love instead of scars.  ♬

286
00:26:58,047 --> 00:27:01,537
never thought you would be in danger.
♬  Day to day for me I heal with love instead of scars.  ♬

287
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,897
I just,
♬  Because I am grateful, I will always keep the tears inside.  ♬

288
00:27:03,897 --> 00:27:06,047
just once,
♬  Because I am grateful, I will always keep the tears inside.  ♬

289
00:27:06,047 --> 00:27:08,757
even if it was just once,
♬  Because I am grateful, I will always keep the tears inside.  ♬

290
00:27:08,757 --> 00:27:12,107
wanted to see you.
♬  Because I am grateful, I will always keep the tears inside.  ♬

291
00:27:18,007 --> 00:27:24,987
♬  When today passes like closing our eyes  ♬

292
00:27:24,987 --> 00:27:31,677
♬  Like there cannot be a more perfect tomorrow.  ♬

00:27:31,677 --> 00:27:35,967

294
00:27:35,967 --> 00:27:43,187
♬   I heal with love instead of scars.  ♬

295
00:27:43,187 --> 00:27:46,267
Jang Seok Joo did that to you and Mother?

296
00:27:46,267 --> 00:27:49,897
I didn't say it because I thought you would worry. I'm sorry.

297
00:27:49,897 --> 00:27:54,627
No, I was a fool for thinking that he would just let you go.

298
00:27:54,627 --> 00:27:57,087
I'm going to try meeting with Secretary Kim tomorrow.

299
00:27:57,087 --> 00:27:59,237
Jang Seok Joo's secretary?

300
00:27:59,237 --> 00:28:03,857
If I convince that person, I think there should be a good way.

301
00:28:03,857 --> 00:28:06,157
Can you do it?

302
00:28:06,157 --> 00:28:09,627
I have to try. I have to do something.

303
00:28:11,427 --> 00:28:13,397
Yes.

304
00:28:17,287 --> 00:28:19,207
You want me to to betray the Prime Minister?

305
00:28:19,207 --> 00:28:23,377
People like Jang Seok Joo have no right to become a nation's leader.

306
00:28:23,377 --> 00:28:27,637
I'm sure you know that more than anyone else.

307
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,987
If you'll just help, I have a plan to stop that.

308
00:28:31,987 --> 00:28:35,147
I've worked in the area of intelligence, but I'm a soldier.

309
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:38,527
To a soldier, there is something that money can't buy.

310
00:28:38,527 --> 00:28:40,977
Do you know what that is?

311
00:28:40,977 --> 00:28:43,437
It's loyalty.

312
00:28:43,437 --> 00:28:46,897
That's the same for all the agents who serve the Prime Minister.

313
00:28:46,897 --> 00:28:49,507
Would a person like Jang Seok Joo really  know that?

314
00:28:49,507 --> 00:28:53,217
If he didn't know, he wouldn't have kept me beside him for over 20 years.

315
00:28:53,217 --> 00:28:54,947
Loyalty.

316
00:28:54,947 --> 00:28:59,167
If it was that amazing, why did you save me and look after my mother?

317
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:01,037
Is that what that person ordered?

318
00:29:01,037 --> 00:29:03,937
I thought of it as a debt.

319
00:29:09,837 --> 00:29:14,977
I will act like I never heard this so don't think of useless stuff,

320
00:29:14,977 --> 00:29:18,067
and just prepare well for the surgery.

321
00:29:30,547 --> 00:29:32,167
Yes, it's Jang Seok Joo.

322
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:35,067
 It's the VIP, Prime Minister.

323
00:29:39,207 --> 00:29:40,757
Yes Mr. President.

324
00:29:40,757 --> 00:29:42,527
How are you feeling?

325
00:29:42,527 --> 00:29:45,277
It's somewhat bearable.

326
00:29:45,277 --> 00:29:48,497
I intend to visit you at the hospital tomorrow.

327
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:49,397
Tomorrow?

328
00:29:49,397 --> 00:29:54,147
Yes, when the Prime Minister has been hospitalized, I shouldn't just stay still.

329
00:29:54,147 --> 00:29:56,907
Yes I understand.

330
00:30:04,187 --> 00:30:06,817
There's not much time left.

331
00:30:06,817 --> 00:30:11,007
 Overwhelming amount of support for the current Prime Minister, Jang Seok Joo.

332
00:30:39,507 --> 00:30:43,717
If the election was happening right now, you would be able to get what you want.

333
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:50,567
In the logic of nature that the strong defeat the weak and rule the world,

334
00:30:50,567 --> 00:30:52,517
an election is an action which offends that logic.

335
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:58,027
Shall I say it's like the bathroom where ignorant people excrete their desire?

336
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:02,807
If I want to win here, instead of this approval rating,

337
00:31:02,807 --> 00:31:08,177
I'll need bunch of toilet paper that I can properly wipe their bottoms with, called money.

338
00:31:08,177 --> 00:31:14,647
Either that or... I'll need an event exciting enough for them to spring up, even forgetting to wipe their bottoms.

339
00:31:14,647 --> 00:31:17,487
You mean like the North-South Korean summit?

340
00:31:17,487 --> 00:31:19,927
Exactly.

341
00:31:21,407 --> 00:31:22,757
What is it?

342
00:31:22,757 --> 00:31:25,807
I'm sure you're not here to promote my philosophy about politics.

343
00:31:25,807 --> 00:31:29,457
Please return Park Hoon's mother.

344
00:31:29,457 --> 00:31:32,497
What's the reason I have to grant that request?

345
00:31:32,497 --> 00:31:38,747
If you don't, we won't be able to perform the surgery on the President as you wish.

346
00:31:38,747 --> 00:31:41,117
Does it work like that?

347
00:31:41,117 --> 00:31:46,397
In order for you to get a horse to run, I heard that both a carrot and a whip are needed.

348
00:31:46,397 --> 00:31:49,747
The person who has hovered between life and death because of your pranks,

349
00:31:49,747 --> 00:31:51,887
can't be moved with threats anymore.

350
00:31:51,887 --> 00:31:54,557
The whip isn't working,

351
00:31:54,557 --> 00:31:56,077
so offer a carrot?

352
00:31:56,077 --> 00:31:59,157
It will be enough by returning his mother, of course,

353
00:31:59,157 --> 00:32:03,717
surveillance is something you guys can do as you want.

354
00:32:03,717 --> 00:32:06,587
For some reason, I feel like I'm being cornered to a "wooden hand mill." (no way out)

355
00:32:06,587 --> 00:32:09,527
Keep in mind that right now,

356
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:13,937
there is no other option than Park Hoon.

357
00:32:26,117 --> 00:32:27,557
The President's coming?

358
00:32:27,557 --> 00:32:32,767
Yes, he's coming to visit the Prime Minister tomorrow.

359
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:36,937
He might ask to meet the Prime Minister's surgery team, so be prepared.

360
00:32:36,937 --> 00:32:42,597
If I meet the President and shake his hand, that would be an honor for my family.

361
00:32:42,597 --> 00:32:48,427
No, when we meet, let's ask him to take a picture first.  Right?

362
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,607
 Dr. Han Seung Hee

363
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,027
Yeah, it's me.

364
00:32:54,027 --> 00:32:55,507
Stop by my house for a bit.

365
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:57,537
What is it?

366
00:32:57,537 --> 00:33:00,977
Your mother is here.

367
00:33:09,797 --> 00:33:11,817
Mom.

368
00:33:23,917 --> 00:33:32,237

369
00:33:40,217 --> 00:33:43,857
Mom, the food looks much better than last time, right?

370
00:34:24,287 --> 00:34:26,757
I will eat well.

371
00:34:34,117 --> 00:34:37,567
Mom, she's Jae Hee, my girlfriend.

372
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:39,937
Girlfriend?

373
00:34:39,937 --> 00:34:41,877
Isn't she pretty?

374
00:34:42,797 --> 00:34:45,107
She's pretty.

375
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:54,547
You are beautiful, too.

376
00:34:54,547 --> 00:34:56,987
Of course, she's my mom.

377
00:36:03,907 --> 00:36:06,277
See you later.

378
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:34,797
You'll meet the President?

379
00:36:34,797 --> 00:36:39,187
It's a good opportunity. If I'm able to  just tell the President about Jang Seok Joo's  plan,

380
00:36:39,187 --> 00:36:40,977
we can get assured of our safety.

381
00:36:40,977 --> 00:36:43,337
Jang Seok Joo's people will be watching.

382
00:36:43,337 --> 00:36:46,967
Even with the President's bodyguards there,  will you be able to meet him?

383
00:36:46,967 --> 00:36:49,497
I will try to do something about people watching over me.

384
00:36:49,497 --> 00:36:51,567
Instead, you try to convince Quack.

385
00:36:51,567 --> 00:36:53,647
Doctor Oh?

386
00:36:54,327 --> 00:36:57,697
To meet the President, we need Quack's assistance.

387
00:37:27,697 --> 00:37:29,577
How are you feeling?

388
00:37:29,577 --> 00:37:33,327
It's a bit stifling to just lay here when I'm perfectly fine.

389
00:37:33,327 --> 00:37:38,357
But what are you here for? If you had something to say, you could've just called me.

390
00:37:38,357 --> 00:37:40,627
There's someone I wanted to meet.

391
00:37:40,627 --> 00:37:44,067
- Who?
- Doctor Park Hoon.

392
00:37:44,067 --> 00:37:46,977
- Doctor Park Hoon?
- Yes.

393
00:37:46,977 --> 00:37:51,557
He's the doctor who'll fix my heart. Don't you think I should at least see his face once?

394
00:37:51,557 --> 00:37:55,537
He doesn't know that it's your surgery yet.

395
00:37:55,537 --> 00:37:59,287
If the rumors spread, I am worried that

396
00:37:59,287 --> 00:38:01,937
everything we kept secret will have been for nothing.

397
00:38:01,937 --> 00:38:04,447
Is that so?

398
00:38:04,447 --> 00:38:07,827
Then should l just look around the hospital?

399
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:11,207
Yes, please do. I will call ahead.

400
00:38:15,387 --> 00:38:18,437
You have people keeping tabs on Park Hoon and Han Seung Hee, right?

401
00:38:18,437 --> 00:38:20,227
Yes.

402
00:38:21,017 --> 00:38:26,037
No no. Since it'll be a big problem if they meet and say something wrong,

403
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:27,897
you do it yourself.

404
00:38:27,897 --> 00:38:29,277
I understand.

405
00:38:29,277 --> 00:38:33,057
Dr. Oh, how long have you been here?

406
00:38:33,057 --> 00:38:35,557
After coming back from studying abroad, I started right away.

407
00:38:35,557 --> 00:38:38,957
This room is where the surgeons do their research.

408
00:39:47,347 --> 00:39:50,687
What? You lost Park Hoon?

409
00:39:50,687 --> 00:39:52,997
I'm sorry, Prime Minister.

410
00:39:53,677 --> 00:39:56,247
Where is the President right now?

411
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:04,247
 Hoon has a reason to meet the President.

412
00:40:04,247 --> 00:40:06,977
 Will there be an opportunity to meet him without being seen by others?

413
00:40:06,977 --> 00:40:09,627
 I beg you. It's something important.

414
00:40:09,627 --> 00:40:10,997
 Exactly why is it that you're like this?

415
00:40:10,997 --> 00:40:13,097
 It will not ever cause damage to the hospital,

416
00:40:13,097 --> 00:40:16,667
 so I'm begging you.

417
00:40:17,367 --> 00:40:19,337
Is this the staff room?

418
00:40:19,337 --> 00:40:22,007
Yes, have a look around.

419
00:40:34,007 --> 00:40:35,907
Block him!

420
00:40:41,297 --> 00:40:43,397
I'm Park Hoon, Mr. President.

421
00:40:43,397 --> 00:40:46,707
You are the person who will do the surgery on the Prime Minister, right?

422
00:40:46,747 --> 00:40:48,607
I have something to say to you.

423
00:40:48,607 --> 00:40:50,407
To me?

424
00:41:04,107 --> 00:41:05,747
It's something for only the President to hear.

425
00:41:05,747 --> 00:41:08,827
It is a bit difficult, but what is the matter?

426
00:41:11,067 --> 00:41:14,607
It's fine, so just say it.

427
00:41:15,577 --> 00:41:19,647
I understand. This Prime Minister's surgery....

428
00:41:19,647 --> 00:41:22,037
Ah, so you were here.

429
00:41:22,967 --> 00:41:24,807
Prime Minister Jang.

430
00:41:24,807 --> 00:41:26,897
You already met him.

431
00:41:26,897 --> 00:41:30,287
This is Doctor Park Hoon.

432
00:41:32,107 --> 00:41:34,057
Even though his mother is sick,

433
00:41:34,057 --> 00:41:37,347
he is preparing himself here at the hospital.

434
00:41:37,347 --> 00:41:39,437
I see.

435
00:41:39,437 --> 00:41:44,107
In any case, please take care of the Prime Minister.

436
00:41:56,357 --> 00:41:59,067
What are you doing?

437
00:41:59,067 --> 00:42:01,167
I am sorry.

438
00:42:23,837 --> 00:42:26,577
10 years of hard work almost failed. Do you know?!

439
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:29,597
- I am sorry. 
 - Do you think saying sorry takes care of everything?

440
00:42:29,597 --> 00:42:33,227
You did it on purpose, right?

441
00:42:33,227 --> 00:42:34,827
You let him go on purpose, didn't you?

442
00:42:34,827 --> 00:42:36,887
- Prime Minister.
- If not,

443
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,507
why would you lose that guy, huh?

444
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:44,047
I had a weird feeling you were protecting him.

445
00:42:44,047 --> 00:42:45,967
I told you to kill him, but instead you save him.

446
00:42:45,967 --> 00:42:49,037
I told you to dispose of her but instead, you took care of his mother for over 10 years.

447
00:42:49,037 --> 00:42:50,637
I didn't feel the need to do that.

448
00:42:50,637 --> 00:42:52,507
Shut up.

449
00:42:53,507 --> 00:42:58,167
Even during the prosectutor's investigation, you carried on saying weird things!

450
00:42:58,167 --> 00:43:00,097
I heard things from the Prosecutors!

451
00:43:00,097 --> 00:43:04,137
Prime Minister, I have been serving you for over 20 years.

452
00:43:04,137 --> 00:43:07,317
- How can you take my loyalty- 
- Loyalty?!

453
00:43:08,647 --> 00:43:12,107
Let's be honest! Honest! Let's be honest here!

454
00:43:12,107 --> 00:43:16,357
You're only seeking the position as Chief of Presidential Security Service once I become President, so you're enduring it!

455
00:43:16,357 --> 00:43:19,047
- Prime Minister! 
 - Endure it!

456
00:43:19,047 --> 00:43:22,157
So no matter what seize it! I'll forgive you for all of it!

457
00:43:22,157 --> 00:43:28,437
However, before then, do it properly properly properly! UNDERSTAND?!

458
00:43:40,077 --> 00:43:41,687
  VIP

459
00:43:49,677 --> 00:43:51,037
Yes, Mr. President.

460
00:43:51,037 --> 00:43:54,537
What do you think about changing to Mingook University Hospital?

461
00:43:54,537 --> 00:43:57,847
Next week is the surgery... if you say that now...

462
00:43:57,847 --> 00:44:00,027
The Chairman of Myeongwoo collapsed, and

463
00:44:00,027 --> 00:44:02,817
I heard that his son was arrested also.

464
00:44:02,817 --> 00:44:04,957
But you already decided to get the surgery here...

465
00:44:04,957 --> 00:44:09,427
In any case, let's reconsider doing it at Myeongwoo.

466
00:44:22,497 --> 00:44:24,947
 Do you think it's necessary to kill him?

467
00:44:24,947 --> 00:44:27,607
 It was a sacrifice for a greater cause.

468
00:44:36,867 --> 00:44:41,417
 I'd like to first say that this incident has nothing to do with the Prime Minister.

469
00:44:41,417 --> 00:44:44,987
 Even during the prosectutor's investigation, you carried on saying weird things!

470
00:44:44,987 --> 00:44:48,237
 There are things that I heard from the Prosecutors!

471
00:45:02,687 --> 00:45:05,037
 I'm home from school.

472
00:45:28,207 --> 00:45:30,417
Jang Seok Joo saw you?

473
00:45:32,607 --> 00:45:35,697
Did you say anything to the President?

474
00:45:36,397 --> 00:45:37,457
No.

475
00:45:37,457 --> 00:45:39,177
Yet you're this idle?

476
00:45:39,177 --> 00:45:43,037
The President might change the hospital to Mingook University Hospital.

477
00:45:44,397 --> 00:45:46,137
That won't happen.

478
00:45:46,137 --> 00:45:47,567
What?

479
00:45:48,407 --> 00:45:50,697
The President won't be able to have the surgery anywhere else.

480
00:45:50,697 --> 00:45:53,407
If it isn't me, there's no one else who can do the surgery.

481
00:45:53,407 --> 00:45:54,717
What do you mean by that?

482
00:45:54,717 --> 00:45:59,137
I'll tell you soon, but there's something you have to help me with.

483
00:45:59,137 --> 00:46:01,237
Me? What?

484
00:46:01,237 --> 00:46:03,097
That's ...

485
00:46:04,907 --> 00:46:06,917
What did you say?

486
00:46:06,917 --> 00:46:08,017
Is there something wrong?

487
00:46:08,017 --> 00:46:10,937
What did you say, that the President won't do the surgery here?

488
00:46:10,937 --> 00:46:14,917
The President won't be able to go to another hospital.

489
00:46:14,917 --> 00:46:18,487
The President's heart in one week ...

490
00:46:19,607 --> 00:46:24,127
I'm sorry, it's hard to guarantee even one more week.

491
00:46:24,937 --> 00:46:29,207
Even though it's dangerous, how about considering a transplant?

492
00:46:29,207 --> 00:46:33,547
In order to live, he has to do a heart transplant but I'm sure there's a reason why he can't.

493
00:46:33,547 --> 00:46:36,397
He probably has a condition where he can't take immunosuppressant drugs.

494
00:46:36,397 --> 00:46:40,467
If I take immunosuppressant drugs, you said I'll die. Is there another way?

495
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:41,807
There is a Batista Operation ( Left Ventricular Reduction ), but

496
00:46:41,807 --> 00:46:43,967
the probability of success becomes too low.

497
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,087
Then are you saying there isn't a method at all?

498
00:46:46,087 --> 00:46:47,557
It's not impossible.

499
00:46:47,557 --> 00:46:52,327
There is a most idealistic surgery method for your heart, but

500
00:46:53,007 --> 00:46:56,187
it's a procedure that has died out.

501
00:46:56,187 --> 00:46:57,767
What is that?

502
00:46:57,767 --> 00:47:00,117
It is SAVER.

503
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:03,227
I looked through published research in the past 10 years,

504
00:47:03,227 --> 00:47:07,347
there weren't even clinical trials, let alone successful cases.

505
00:47:08,417 --> 00:47:10,217
There is one.

506
00:47:15,537 --> 00:47:19,027
I am saying there is a person who did that.

507
00:47:19,797 --> 00:47:22,067
If he wants to live,  he'll have to do a SAVER surgery.

508
00:47:22,067 --> 00:47:23,697
If you're wrong?

509
00:47:23,697 --> 00:47:25,267
We will get a call.

510
00:47:25,267 --> 00:47:27,567
Don't act arrogant!

511
00:47:33,997 --> 00:47:35,647
 VIP

512
00:47:45,017 --> 00:47:45,937
Yes?

513
00:47:45,937 --> 00:47:48,197
  It's me, Prime Minister Jang.

514
00:47:48,197 --> 00:47:50,577
Yes, please speak.

515
00:47:51,257 --> 00:47:54,527
I think I need to have it at Myeongwoo.

516
00:48:08,647 --> 00:48:10,117
Jae Hee.

517
00:48:10,117 --> 00:48:11,737
How did it go?

518
00:48:11,737 --> 00:48:13,977
The President will come here.

519
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:25,307
We only have a little more to go.

520
00:48:27,247 --> 00:48:30,007
It will all turn out well... all of it.

521
00:48:35,657 --> 00:48:42,847

522
00:48:46,107 --> 00:48:49,327
I suppose there is nothing more to hide.

523
00:48:49,327 --> 00:48:51,887
Yes, Mr. President.

524
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,817
The truth is that the person who is going to receive the surgery

525
00:48:54,817 --> 00:48:58,647
isn't the Prime Minister, but me.

526
00:49:03,397 --> 00:49:07,977
The surgery that Doctor Park did not too long ago,

527
00:49:07,977 --> 00:49:10,057
SAVER.

528
00:49:10,057 --> 00:49:11,547
Yes.

529
00:49:11,547 --> 00:49:13,677
The patient who received SAVER surgery...

530
00:49:13,677 --> 00:49:16,517
is still healthy even now, right?

531
00:49:16,517 --> 00:49:18,167
Of course.

532
00:49:31,207 --> 00:49:35,397
Is the SAVER surgery possible?

533
00:49:53,727 --> 00:49:56,157
The left ventricle is enlarged more than normal.

534
00:49:56,157 --> 00:49:57,627
This is called left ventricular hypertrophy.

535
00:49:57,627 --> 00:50:00,237
I heard a lot about that from my other doctors.

536
00:50:00,237 --> 00:50:04,597
Not that but tell me about the possibility of success.

537
00:50:04,597 --> 00:50:06,517
It is hard to say there is a 100% success rate.

538
00:50:06,517 --> 00:50:08,877
I really hate the way the doctors speak like that.

539
00:50:08,877 --> 00:50:11,977
"We will do our best. We need to keep an eye on it."

540
00:50:11,977 --> 00:50:14,357
They don't give me any answers with certainty.

541
00:50:14,357 --> 00:50:18,127
No person other than God is confident about having a 100% success rate.

542
00:50:19,867 --> 00:50:22,447
Is there no premium service for the President?

543
00:50:22,447 --> 00:50:26,477
Once you lie on the surgery table, you're a patient. No more and no less.

544
00:50:27,417 --> 00:50:29,627
You are a doctor by nature.

545
00:50:30,787 --> 00:50:34,247
Then this time, shall we listen to

546
00:50:34,247 --> 00:50:36,267
what you were going to say before?

547
00:50:40,657 --> 00:50:43,587
Inside the hospital, there is the Chief of Performance and three Security Agents.

548
00:50:43,587 --> 00:50:46,787
Outside the building, there is a team of Presidential Security Service on standby.

549
00:51:00,897 --> 00:51:02,487
How is he?

550
00:51:02,487 --> 00:51:05,427
The condition of his heart is more severe than I thought.

551
00:51:05,427 --> 00:51:08,327
Let's schedule the surgery for tomorrow.

552
00:51:08,327 --> 00:51:11,827
Yes. I understand, Mr. President.

553
00:51:11,827 --> 00:51:14,917
Then please take care of me.

554
00:51:16,737 --> 00:51:19,367
- Mr. President!
- Wait, help me...

555
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:21,687
Hurry.

556
00:51:37,247 --> 00:51:39,277
Doctor Park.

557
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,357
Please.

558
00:51:55,227 --> 00:51:57,357
 Emergency Button

559
00:51:57,357 --> 00:51:59,627
Let's quickly move him.

560
00:52:07,997 --> 00:52:09,937
 Everyone, listen! Everyone, listen!

561
00:52:09,937 --> 00:52:12,887
Chief Jung.

562
00:52:12,887 --> 00:52:17,237
You know Article 71 under the Constitution, right?

563
00:52:24,297 --> 00:52:27,587
From now on, until the President wakes up,

564
00:52:27,587 --> 00:52:29,797
on the basis of Article 71 under the Constitution,

565
00:52:29,797 --> 00:52:33,337
I, the Prime Minister,

566
00:52:33,337 --> 00:52:37,547
will temporarily take jurisdiction over  the President's position.

567
00:52:37,547 --> 00:52:41,647
Call the Presidential Secretariat and all heads of departments to gather immediately at the Blue House.

568
00:52:41,647 --> 00:52:43,367
Then the President's condition...?

569
00:52:43,367 --> 00:52:45,887
Maintain that under strict security.

570
00:52:45,887 --> 00:52:47,927
Yes, I understand.

571
00:53:04,477 --> 00:53:06,027
Doctor Park, what happened?

572
00:53:06,027 --> 00:53:08,117
- Hurry, Nurse Min.
- What happened all of a sudden?

573
00:53:08,117 --> 00:53:11,187
Shut up and Delinquent...  you stay completely alert, understand?

574
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:13,257
Yes, I got it.

575
00:53:19,227 --> 00:53:21,237
Quickly scrub and come.

576
00:53:40,767 --> 00:53:42,947
We're ready.

577
00:53:49,397 --> 00:53:53,437
Okay. From now on, we'll begin the SAVER surgery.

578
00:53:53,437 --> 00:53:55,207
Scalpel.

579
00:54:04,527 --> 00:54:06,657
What do you mean the President collapsed?

580
00:54:06,657 --> 00:54:09,267
He's in emergency surgery right now.

581
00:54:09,267 --> 00:54:10,947
Then where is he right now?

582
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:13,007
He's at Myeongwoo University Hospital.

583
00:54:13,007 --> 00:54:16,547
If a problem arises, what happens?

584
00:54:16,547 --> 00:54:18,037
What do you mean "a problem"?

585
00:54:18,037 --> 00:54:22,127
Isn't it obvious? He's asking what happens if something goes wrong during surgery.

586
00:54:22,127 --> 00:54:24,447
Is that something you're wishing for or what?!

587
00:54:24,447 --> 00:54:27,887
Ah, quiet, quiet. Be quiet please.

588
00:54:27,887 --> 00:54:30,467
What is there to ask about?

589
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:34,697
There is a clear direction in the Constitution.

590
00:54:34,697 --> 00:54:37,007
In a case where the President is in an accident or vacant,

591
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:39,967
the Prime Minister gets the authority.

592
00:54:49,717 --> 00:54:52,747
 Message

593
00:55:09,857 --> 00:55:13,227
The surgery ended well as you wished.

594
00:55:26,007 --> 00:55:29,117
If the BIS value is from 40-60, he's in a state of anesthesia.

595
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:32,587
If it goes over 80, it means his consciousness is coming back.

596
00:55:32,587 --> 00:55:36,937
If it maintains this current state, there will be a vacancy.

597
00:55:36,937 --> 00:55:41,067
If it goes over 80 even momentarily, and then drops again,

598
00:55:41,067 --> 00:55:43,697
it becomes a state of an accident.

599
00:56:04,017 --> 00:56:06,017
I, you see...

600
00:56:06,017 --> 00:56:09,897
do you know which king from the Joseon Dynasty I like the best?

601
00:56:09,897 --> 00:56:11,847
It's Sejo. Sejo.

602
00:56:11,847 --> 00:56:15,777
Tae Joeng Tae Sae Moon Dan Sae, that Sejo.

603
00:56:15,777 --> 00:56:18,057
You know who it is.

604
00:56:18,057 --> 00:56:21,437
It's that man who became a king after killed his nephew.

605
00:56:21,437 --> 00:56:24,297
He was someone who knew something.

606
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:29,077
What does he know? The difference between a weak man and a strong man.

607
00:56:29,077 --> 00:56:32,547
That...it's not something that happens just because you're strong.

608
00:56:32,547 --> 00:56:37,657
You have to know how to properly trample on the weak to be the strong one.

609
00:56:37,657 --> 00:56:41,267
Nephew? That stuff doesn't matter.

610
00:56:41,267 --> 00:56:43,557
Without mercy, when you have the power,

611
00:56:43,557 --> 00:56:45,707
you need to know how to properly trample the weak.

612
00:56:45,707 --> 00:56:48,687
That is the law of the world and the truth.

613
00:56:57,117 --> 00:57:02,927
Because he doesn't know that, our President is... here like...

614
00:57:04,447 --> 00:57:08,067
Hey, when you found fault with the election slush fund,

615
00:57:08,067 --> 00:57:11,107
you should have trampled and killed me at that moment.

616
00:57:11,107 --> 00:57:13,497
After putting me on such a trivial leash,

617
00:57:13,497 --> 00:57:16,357
if you pulled and dragged me, "Yes, I understand."

618
00:57:16,357 --> 00:57:18,237
"Yes, I'll do as you say."

619
00:57:18,237 --> 00:57:20,937
Did you think I would do that?

620
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,727
Really!

621
00:57:32,507 --> 00:57:36,397
Soon, there will be a Presidential Election.

622
00:57:36,397 --> 00:57:39,427
Until then, rest well.

623
00:57:39,427 --> 00:57:42,897
I'll accomplish the North-South Korean Summit with the North Koreans,

624
00:57:42,897 --> 00:57:45,607
and lighten the mood for the ignorant citizens.

625
00:57:45,607 --> 00:57:50,167
After that, I'll allow you to rest forever.

626
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:52,757
Understand?

627
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:30,167
