1
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:29,833

2
00:00:32,883 --> 00:00:36,603
Dr. Oh, what brings you here at this time?

3
00:00:44,343 --> 00:00:46,003
Jae Hee.

4
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:06,113
 Then, kill me first.

5
00:01:06,113 --> 00:01:07,483
 You think I won't be able to kill you?

6
00:01:07,483 --> 00:01:09,973
 There's only death for people who do not complete the task.

7
00:01:09,973 --> 00:01:13,253
 I, Han Seung Hee, am not afraid of death given by my country.

8
00:01:13,253 --> 00:01:18,353
 I, too, am only afraid that I cannot finish the task.

9
00:01:31,493 --> 00:01:32,893
 Let me meet him.

10
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:35,713
 If you meet him...what exactly are you going to do?

11
00:01:35,713 --> 00:01:38,913
 - I am Han Seung Hee. 
 - That's right!

12
00:01:38,913 --> 00:01:41,903
 Han Seung Hee. The Han Seung Hee that I made.

13
00:01:41,903 --> 00:01:45,283
 However, Park Hoon will see me as Song Jae Hee.

14
00:01:45,283 --> 00:01:48,573
 Until the Prime Minister's surgery team is determined, I will remain as Han Seung Hee,

15
00:01:48,573 --> 00:01:51,183
 then after, I will become Song Jae Hee.

16
00:01:51,183 --> 00:01:53,933
 That was our plan from the start.

17
00:01:55,393 --> 00:01:59,583
 If you can't believe me, shoot me at any time.

18
00:02:00,573 --> 00:02:03,893
 You have to make the choice, Comrade Cha Jin Soo.

19
00:02:06,053 --> 00:02:09,563
 I... it was definitely not me.

20
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:13,173
 Then how did that bastard Park Hoon

21
00:02:13,173 --> 00:02:15,573
 run away so easily?

22
00:02:15,573 --> 00:02:17,553
 I did not know.

23
00:02:18,343 --> 00:02:20,853
 I never knew that bastard could...

24
00:02:26,863 --> 00:02:30,963
 It's not me. It's not me! It's really not me!

25
00:02:30,963 --> 00:02:33,453
 What did you receive in return for letting him escape?

26
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,853
 I didn't  do anything of the kind!

27
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:38,133
 Speak!

28
00:02:41,783 --> 00:02:43,973
 Speak you bastard!

29
00:02:43,973 --> 00:02:48,073
 Democratic People's

30
00:02:48,073 --> 00:02:50,613
 Republic of Korea...

31
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:55,923
 - Hooray!
- Say it!

32
00:02:57,813 --> 00:02:59,543
 People's Republic...

33
00:03:00,983 --> 00:03:03,563
 Hooray!

34
00:03:22,263 --> 00:03:27,043
Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

35
00:03:29,483 --> 00:03:31,463
 Park Hoon!

36
00:03:52,513 --> 00:03:54,163
Jae Hee.

37
00:04:04,353 --> 00:04:06,303
You cut your hair.

38
00:04:08,503 --> 00:04:10,303
Doctor Oh.

39
00:04:11,723 --> 00:04:13,783
It suits you well.

40
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,763
You don't know me?

41
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,343
Who is he?

42
00:04:22,403 --> 00:04:25,103
It's me, Hoon.

43
00:04:26,613 --> 00:04:29,483
I think you have got the wrong person.

44
00:04:31,693 --> 00:04:33,583
What do you mean by Jae Hee?

45
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:37,763
Doctor Han, do you know a person named Song Jae Hee by any chance?

46
00:04:37,783 --> 00:04:41,563
Song Jae Hee? Who is that?

47
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,563
This. You don't know this?

48
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:52,133
Yes, the one exactly same as this...

49
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:56,383
I made it for you the first time we met.

50
00:04:56,383 --> 00:04:59,283
Why is that there?

51
00:04:59,293 --> 00:05:00,173
What do you mean why?

52
00:05:00,173 --> 00:05:04,073
That is something I made for Doctor Oh's mother.

53
00:05:04,073 --> 00:05:06,923
But why do you have that?

54
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,083
It's the same as the one I made for you.

55
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,923
It can be considered as an article from her deceased mother.

56
00:05:21,283 --> 00:05:23,603
Who in the world is this person?

57
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:25,713
He's the person who performed surgery on my mother.

58
00:05:25,713 --> 00:05:27,453
A doctor?

59
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,763
Then how come you have her deceased mother's article?

60
00:05:31,763 --> 00:05:33,133
Is that true, Doctor Park?

61
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,733
This is what I made for you.

62
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:37,493
Say something that makes sense!

63
00:05:41,293 --> 00:05:43,823
Jae Hee...just why...

64
00:05:45,363 --> 00:05:47,713
I'm so sorry, Doctor.

65
00:05:51,243 --> 00:05:53,023
I think I have to go inside.

66
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,443
Ah, alright.

67
00:06:02,953 --> 00:06:04,893
Episode 6

68
00:06:04,893 --> 00:06:07,103
Jae Hee...

69
00:06:08,973 --> 00:06:10,993
Go inside first.

70
00:06:12,423 --> 00:06:14,083
That woman is Jae Hee!

71
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,323
- Stay still! 
 - What do you mean stay still?

72
00:06:16,323 --> 00:06:18,463
She said she isn't Jae Hee.

73
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:22,063
- It's right. She's Jae Hee. 
- Please!

74
00:06:22,063 --> 00:06:23,833
 Ai!  Seriously!

75
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,763
 Song Jae Hee!

76
00:06:27,773 --> 00:06:30,283
You made the right decision.

77
00:06:30,283 --> 00:06:33,093
- It was for our task.
- That task...

78
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:36,363
I hope you don't ever forget that again.

79
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:38,583
Don't be arrogant.

80
00:06:42,013 --> 00:06:43,703
Move aside!

81
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:47,153
Just say still. If I let you go, what are you planning to do anyway?

82
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:49,273
I have to ask her why. Why she's acting like she doesn't know me!

83
00:06:49,273 --> 00:06:50,703
She is doing that because she doesn't know.

84
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:53,213
- Why doesn't she know me? 
 - Because she is not Jae Hee.

85
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:55,173
She's not?

86
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:57,483
Quack, you saw her too.

87
00:06:59,223 --> 00:07:01,943
 Hoon.

88
00:07:01,943 --> 00:07:05,483
I don't know either. But she's saying she isn't!

89
00:07:05,483 --> 00:07:09,103
Don't be silly. She's Jae Hee.  I'm telling you, she's really Jae Hee.

90
00:07:09,103 --> 00:07:10,703
Doctor Park.

91
00:07:11,853 --> 00:07:13,093
Let go!

92
00:07:13,093 --> 00:07:17,383
I can't go to sleep. Right now, even my thigh aches.

93
00:07:17,383 --> 00:07:19,723
For now, I will prescribe pain medication...

94
00:07:19,723 --> 00:07:22,733
Why are you like this? Why are you acting like you don't know me?

95
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,603
Just a moment.

96
00:07:24,603 --> 00:07:30,413
This is inside the hospital. If you have more things left to say, please wait for me outside.

97
00:07:30,413 --> 00:07:32,183
Are you mad because I didn't find you?

98
00:07:32,183 --> 00:07:35,273
- Please get out. 
 - I tried to find you.

99
00:07:35,273 --> 00:07:37,713
I did all sorts of things to find you.

100
00:07:37,713 --> 00:07:41,343
I have to look over this patient so please get out now.

101
00:07:44,283 --> 00:07:48,453
Okay, alright. I-I-I'm sorry. I did wrong.

102
00:07:48,453 --> 00:07:51,853
I understand so please let go. Don't you see the patient is waiting for me?

103
00:07:51,853 --> 00:07:54,223
Is that important right now?

104
00:07:56,863 --> 00:07:58,583
Didn't you say you are a doctor?

105
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:02,793
Is there anything more important than a patient to a doctor?

106
00:08:04,643 --> 00:08:09,333
Even with such thoughts, can you really say that you are a doctor?

107
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,913
Jae Hee...

108
00:08:10,913 --> 00:08:13,583
Take care of this person, Doctor Oh.

109
00:08:38,773 --> 00:08:40,633
Let's go for now.

110
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:44,773
I will call her later to see if she has time. Huh?

111
00:09:06,483 --> 00:09:09,773
Now, he won't believe that Song Jae Hee is dead.

112
00:09:09,773 --> 00:09:12,653
Seeing him acting wildly crazy...

113
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:13,883
was enjoyable.

114
00:09:13,883 --> 00:09:17,103
This way, we can control Park Hoon as we have planned.

115
00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:19,473
Was it tomorrow that you are moving to Myeongwoo University Hospital?

116
00:09:19,473 --> 00:09:22,783
Park Hoon will also follow me because Song Jae Hee is going there.

117
00:09:22,783 --> 00:09:26,803
But he was kicked out of there. Oh Joon Gyu, that man,

118
00:09:26,803 --> 00:09:30,233
isn't a guy that will easily change a decision that he has made.

119
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:33,643
Then, we will move someone who can change his decision.

120
00:09:34,523 --> 00:09:37,093
 Government Complex Sejong

121
00:09:41,653 --> 00:09:45,833
I think we need to get approval from the Blue House for this.

122
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:49,113
Why do we need approval for forming the Prime Minister's committee?

123
00:09:49,113 --> 00:09:52,123
Isn't this a committee that the President is paying close attention to?

124
00:09:52,123 --> 00:09:54,533
Just because he's paying close attention, do you get approval for everything?

125
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:58,633
I made an appointment to meet the President tomorrow morning,

126
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:01,213
so I will ask him what his intentions are.

127
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:03,063
Let's move onto the next item.

128
00:10:03,063 --> 00:10:06,003
Your health isn't even well,

129
00:10:06,003 --> 00:10:07,723
why don't we end for today?

130
00:10:07,723 --> 00:10:10,083
I'm still okay.

131
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,403
Let's do what we have to do before finishing this.

132
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,253
You've all worked hard today.

133
00:10:15,253 --> 00:10:17,123
Please return safely.

134
00:10:19,893 --> 00:10:21,673
Why don't we have a meal together, Hyungnim?

135
00:10:21,673 --> 00:10:23,373
It's very late.

136
00:10:23,463 --> 00:10:26,513
I have to stop by somewhere before I meet the President in the morning.

137
00:10:26,513 --> 00:10:28,393
You need to make a plan.

138
00:10:28,393 --> 00:10:31,073
Does it make sense that a prosecution investigation is in progress when it's been so long since the election has ended?

139
00:10:31,073 --> 00:10:33,403
They're just telling me to listen to them well.

140
00:10:33,403 --> 00:10:36,203
Is he daring to provoke someone who got him into the Blue House?

141
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:38,713
- People are listening.
- So what if someone hears!

142
00:10:38,713 --> 00:10:40,103
You're really--

143
00:10:40,103 --> 00:10:43,683
There are 52  Assemblymen that are just looking to follow you.

144
00:10:43,683 --> 00:10:45,833
All those 52 people are being ignored.

145
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,863
You people are really--

146
00:10:47,863 --> 00:10:51,933
The things you say because the meeting ran a little long!

147
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:54,763
- Hurry and go.
- Yes.

148
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:07,683
This is one of Republic of Korea's government complexes,

149
00:11:07,683 --> 00:11:10,743
but the security is really messed up.

150
00:11:10,743 --> 00:11:12,023
It's been a long time.

151
00:11:12,023 --> 00:11:17,283
This kind of meeting is not part of your original plan, is it?

152
00:11:22,373 --> 00:11:25,063
There's something you need to help me with.

153
00:11:28,663 --> 00:11:31,463
Is it about Park Hoon?

154
00:11:31,463 --> 00:11:34,063
Meet with Oh Joon Gyu.

155
00:11:34,063 --> 00:11:37,683
Well, that'd be a bit difficult.

156
00:11:37,683 --> 00:11:40,773
It's a bit weird for me to step in personally,

157
00:11:40,773 --> 00:11:44,543
and if people were to find out that I met with Oh Joon Gyu,

158
00:11:44,543 --> 00:11:47,363
Myeongwoo will be disqualified from providing a candidate team for my surgery.

159
00:11:47,363 --> 00:11:49,653
If Park Hoon doesn't return to Myeongwoo,

160
00:11:49,653 --> 00:11:54,043
our plan will be over. Do as you please.

161
00:11:55,973 --> 00:11:59,493
Prime Minister, the car is waiting.

162
00:11:59,493 --> 00:12:01,773
Let's go.

163
00:12:19,213 --> 00:12:21,403
Since he's watching like that

164
00:12:21,403 --> 00:12:24,153
will I be able to make time?

165
00:12:24,153 --> 00:12:27,823
I will try to make some time.

166
00:12:42,163 --> 00:12:45,393
Yes, he departed just now.

167
00:12:45,393 --> 00:12:48,773
Prime Minister Jang has just left the Sejong Government Complex now.

168
00:12:48,773 --> 00:12:50,753
What time is he supposed to come tomorrow?

169
00:12:50,753 --> 00:12:53,473
At 11 A.M.

170
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:54,883
Wasn't it 10 A.M.?

171
00:12:54,883 --> 00:12:58,123
I heard that he has a breakfast gathering with a  Korea Reunification group.

172
00:12:58,123 --> 00:13:01,483
He's going to make me wait for that kind of matter? Tell him to come at 10 o'clock.

173
00:13:01,493 --> 00:13:04,063
Yes, I understand.

174
00:13:10,793 --> 00:13:14,263
Do you still think Doctor Han is Jae Hee?

175
00:13:18,363 --> 00:13:19,543
Just give me some alcohol.

176
00:13:19,543 --> 00:13:20,963
I don't think she's Jae Hee.

177
00:13:20,963 --> 00:13:23,003
How can a quack know that?

178
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:26,013
You said that Jae Hee smiles a lot.

179
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:29,033
But it seems like Doctor Han doesn't.

180
00:13:29,973 --> 00:13:32,763
What do you know for you to be babbling?

181
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:37,853
Just in case, I looked at Doctor Han's photos.

182
00:13:37,853 --> 00:13:42,103
It seems like she doesn't smile as well as your girlfriend.

183
00:13:44,143 --> 00:13:46,893
How do you do this?

184
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:49,373
Click here.

185
00:13:55,163 --> 00:13:58,133
Do you know Doctor Han's parents by any chance?

186
00:13:58,133 --> 00:14:02,213
There's a picture of her with her parents.

187
00:14:09,273 --> 00:14:11,863
 Please, our Jae Hee.

188
00:14:11,863 --> 00:14:14,663
 Save her...

189
00:14:19,663 --> 00:14:21,903
They're not, right?

190
00:14:27,763 --> 00:14:30,083
This seems like a photo taken in the beginning of May.

191
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,133
I really envy her.

192
00:14:32,133 --> 00:14:35,103
Even her father looks very nice.

193
00:14:36,393 --> 00:14:39,133
What about your father?

194
00:14:45,973 --> 00:14:48,213
He died.

195
00:14:48,913 --> 00:14:51,343
Then what about your mother?

196
00:14:52,363 --> 00:14:55,523
 Now I want to forget everything that's entangled with you.  You and Hoon, too.

197
00:14:55,523 --> 00:14:58,373
 - Hoon's mom.
- I'm really sick of it.

198
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,933
- I don't know. 
- You don't know? Why?

199
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:04,943
I don't know.

200
00:15:10,613 --> 00:15:12,843
Just pour me a glass.

201
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,913
Umm ... Ahjummoni.

202
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:28,873

203
00:15:35,463 --> 00:15:39,353
Hey, forget it already!

204
00:15:39,353 --> 00:15:42,953
-Forget what?
-You can't hold onto

205
00:15:44,183 --> 00:15:47,203
to the person in heaven like this.

206
00:15:47,203 --> 00:15:50,423
I will hold onto her until I die, why?

207
00:15:50,423 --> 00:15:53,233
Do you like Jae Hee that much?

208
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:56,113
Of course.

209
00:15:56,903 --> 00:15:59,143
I'm envious.

210
00:15:59,143 --> 00:16:02,013
- Of what?
- Of Jae Hee.

211
00:16:02,863 --> 00:16:04,763
She has someone

212
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:09,043
who always thinks about her, like you.

213
00:16:09,043 --> 00:16:11,853
No matter what I do, or wherever I am,

214
00:16:11,853 --> 00:16:16,433
to have someone who only thinks about me always.

215
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,683
I really envy that.

216
00:16:17,683 --> 00:16:21,273
You have a person like that.

217
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:26,113
What's his name... Chief Han with his nose like...

218
00:16:27,343 --> 00:16:29,033
I don't know.

219
00:16:30,043 --> 00:16:33,423
Does Jae Joon really  think of me like that?

220
00:16:33,423 --> 00:16:37,893
I guess it's strange for someone to like you with your personality being like that.

221
00:16:38,563 --> 00:16:40,783
Is that so?

222
00:16:43,163 --> 00:16:44,893
Anyway, let's drink.

223
00:16:44,893 --> 00:16:49,653
For Jae Hee who is in heaven.

224
00:16:49,653 --> 00:16:51,993
Why is Jae Hee in heaven?

225
00:16:51,993 --> 00:16:53,433
Why would she be?

226
00:16:53,433 --> 00:16:56,033
Jae Hee is alive.

227
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:59,053
She's alive, damn it!

228
00:17:41,263 --> 00:17:44,563
♬  While people gathered on a nice day like this they laughed and rejoiced.  ♬

229
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:49,543
♬  While people gathered on a nice day like this they laughed and rejoiced.  ♬

230
00:17:49,543 --> 00:17:52,123
♬  While people gathered on a nice day like this they laughed and rejoiced.  ♬

231
00:17:52,123 --> 00:17:55,533
♬  Because the tears are flowing and I am in pain only by myself  ♬

232
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:59,393
♬  Because the tears are flowing and I am in pain only by myself  ♬

233
00:17:59,393 --> 00:18:02,463
♬  I’m thinking of you.  ♬

234
00:18:02,463 --> 00:18:06,183
♬  It shouldn’t be a secret.  ♬

235
00:18:06,183 --> 00:18:11,373
♬  It should be easy to forget you like that.  ♬

236
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:13,063
Yes, Jae Joon.

237
00:18:13,063 --> 00:18:14,913
Where are you?

238
00:18:14,913 --> 00:18:16,383
At my mom's house.

239
00:18:16,383 --> 00:18:17,803
Alone?

240
00:18:17,803 --> 00:18:18,933
Yes.

241
00:18:18,933 --> 00:18:21,383
It sounds a bit  noisy.

242
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:23,473
Are you with anyone?

243
00:18:23,473 --> 00:18:28,063
It might be because the television is on.

244
00:18:30,633 --> 00:18:33,093
♬  On a nice day like this, the day we broke up.  ♬

245
00:18:33,093 --> 00:18:33,793
Yeah.
♬  On a nice day like this, the day we broke up.  ♬

246
00:18:33,793 --> 00:18:36,683
♬  On a nice day like this, the day we broke up.  ♬

247
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:40,253
Should I go there, if you feel uncomfortable alone?

248
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:41,753
It's okay, Jae Joon.

249
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:44,263
Will you really be okay?

250
00:18:44,263 --> 00:18:48,063
Yes. I have something to think about alone.

251
00:18:48,063 --> 00:18:51,553
♬   I tried my best   ♬

252
00:18:51,553 --> 00:18:53,793
I understand.

253
00:18:53,793 --> 00:18:55,033
Rest until tomorrow.

254
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:56,963
Okay. Thanks.

255
00:18:56,963 --> 00:19:03,273
♬  On a nice day like this, the day we broke up.  ♬

256
00:19:03,273 --> 00:19:11,793
♬  I tried to bear it but that didn’t work.  ♬

257
00:19:11,793 --> 00:19:16,723
♬  On a bright sunny day. On the day we broke up.  ♬

258
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:22,843
♬  On a bright sunny day. On the day we broke up.  ♬

259
00:19:38,973 --> 00:19:41,183
Jae Hee...

260
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:48,873
Maybe this is why people drink.

261
00:19:51,693 --> 00:19:54,643
You can see people you want to see.

262
00:19:56,683 --> 00:19:59,113
The person I want to see,

263
00:19:59,113 --> 00:20:01,053
Jae Hee...

264
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:18,113
Jae Hee is sitting right in front of me, Doctor Oh.

265
00:20:33,683 --> 00:20:36,063
Did you come, Doctor Han?

266
00:20:37,073 --> 00:20:39,523
It seems like he is very drunk.

267
00:20:39,523 --> 00:20:43,453
I thought he needed to apologize so I called you but he got drunk like this.

268
00:20:43,453 --> 00:20:45,803
There is no need for an apology.

269
00:20:45,803 --> 00:20:49,563
But...what do we do with this person?

270
00:21:02,443 --> 00:21:04,043
Jae Hee.

271
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,023
Jae Hee.

272
00:21:15,433 --> 00:21:16,743
Really...

273
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:18,863
You must be crazy.

274
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:33,293
  Father

275
00:21:36,873 --> 00:21:39,693
Yes. I'm at Mom's house.

276
00:21:40,393 --> 00:21:42,653
I'm going to stay here today.

277
00:21:42,653 --> 00:21:44,053
Come home.

278
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:48,773
I'm sorry. I will call you again tomorrow.

279
00:21:48,773 --> 00:21:50,773
Soo Hyeon.

280
00:22:12,343 --> 00:22:14,833
You can use your mother's room.

281
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,473
I'm sorry. I feel that I am causing you trouble.

282
00:22:18,473 --> 00:22:21,023
This is your house from the first place, Doctor Oh.

283
00:22:21,023 --> 00:22:24,683
More than that, it seems like you two are really close.

284
00:22:25,313 --> 00:22:26,823
Excuse me?

285
00:22:26,823 --> 00:22:30,563
It seems like it. You guys came this far and are drinking together.

286
00:22:30,563 --> 00:22:32,723
And you take care of him when he's drunk.

287
00:22:32,723 --> 00:22:35,323
That's not it. . .

288
00:22:36,903 --> 00:22:39,873
The person whom Doctor Park loved

289
00:22:39,873 --> 00:22:42,083
passed away.

290
00:22:44,353 --> 00:22:46,783
Is that true?

291
00:22:48,173 --> 00:22:53,663
But Doctor Park's lover really looks like you.

292
00:22:55,023 --> 00:22:58,053
Oh, so that's why. . .

293
00:22:58,053 --> 00:23:00,383
Now you can understand a little, right?

294
00:23:02,163 --> 00:23:05,293
I suddenly am curious about that person.

295
00:23:05,293 --> 00:23:08,333
I'll make some coffee. Will you tell me about her?

296
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,313
Should I?

297
00:23:14,323 --> 00:23:16,623
Please talk comfortably.

298
00:23:16,623 --> 00:23:18,783
Would that be okay?

299
00:23:21,103 --> 00:23:24,173
My brother is 80 years old.

300
00:23:24,173 --> 00:23:26,933
But for a few years I was not able to see him.

301
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:30,653
I don't know if he's alive or if he has passed away.

302
00:23:30,653 --> 00:23:33,543
I don't know what to say, elder.

303
00:23:33,543 --> 00:23:39,493
I heard that North Korea has suggested meetings for separated families.

304
00:23:39,493 --> 00:23:40,913
Yes.

305
00:23:40,913 --> 00:23:46,293
I will tell the President to make this meeting happen, no matter what.

306
00:23:46,293 --> 00:23:48,403
I ask for your favor.

307
00:23:48,403 --> 00:23:51,233
Yes. Please eat.

308
00:23:51,233 --> 00:23:53,033
You must eat a lot and have strength

309
00:23:53,033 --> 00:23:57,223
to meet your parents, siblings, or children.

310
00:23:57,223 --> 00:23:58,403
Please eat.

311
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:02,113
Elders, let's all eat.

312
00:24:02,113 --> 00:24:04,133
Please have some.

313
00:24:08,543 --> 00:24:10,213
I ate well.

314
00:24:10,213 --> 00:24:12,153
Go safely.

315
00:24:28,503 --> 00:24:31,363
I will escort him out.

316
00:24:31,363 --> 00:24:33,163
Yes.

317
00:24:41,073 --> 00:24:43,333
It's been a long time Prime Minister.

318
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:45,533
Yes it has.

319
00:24:52,873 --> 00:24:56,243
Has it been 20 years? Since the last time we met like this?

320
00:24:56,243 --> 00:24:57,763
I have a favor to ask.

321
00:24:57,763 --> 00:24:59,943
If it's something like that, you could've just called...

322
00:24:59,943 --> 00:25:03,293
There are many eyes watching and many ears listening.

323
00:25:04,793 --> 00:25:07,033
There isn't much time.

324
00:25:07,033 --> 00:25:09,963
I'll tell you simply.

325
00:25:09,963 --> 00:25:11,893
What does this concern?

326
00:25:11,893 --> 00:25:14,513
A doctor named Park Hoon.

327
00:25:19,233 --> 00:25:23,213
Please give him another chance.

328
00:25:52,283 --> 00:25:55,813
Jae Hee!

329
00:26:04,743 --> 00:26:06,233
Jae Hee.

330
00:26:10,693 --> 00:26:12,253
Jae Hee.

331
00:26:13,853 --> 00:26:15,343
What are you doing? Get out!

332
00:26:15,343 --> 00:26:17,323
- Wait... I... I...
- Get out! Aren't you going to get out?

333
00:26:17,323 --> 00:26:19,873
I'll close it. I'll close it. I'll close it!

334
00:26:25,803 --> 00:26:27,313
Hey.

335
00:26:31,183 --> 00:26:32,783
Are you okay?

336
00:26:33,503 --> 00:26:35,193
Are you okay?

337
00:26:39,593 --> 00:26:40,443
Dang.

338
00:26:40,443 --> 00:26:42,093
Would you be okay if you were me?

339
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:45,533
That's why, why would you suddenly come into someone else's bathroom like that?

340
00:26:45,533 --> 00:26:47,343
Bathroom?

341
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:50,553
Did you see everything?

342
00:26:50,553 --> 00:26:51,823
- See what?!
- See what?!

343
00:26:51,823 --> 00:26:54,843
But why are you two here together?

344
00:26:54,843 --> 00:26:57,503
- Then why are you here?
- Then why are you here?

345
00:26:57,503 --> 00:26:59,823
I just...

346
00:26:59,823 --> 00:27:02,133
I'm here because the Chairman told me to bring him.

347
00:27:02,133 --> 00:27:03,743
Chairman? Why?

348
00:27:03,743 --> 00:27:05,953
Maybe because he's giving him a chance?

349
00:27:05,953 --> 00:27:08,623
I mean why else would he want to see him?

350
00:27:08,623 --> 00:27:10,093
I have no interest.

351
00:27:10,093 --> 00:27:11,463
Why?

352
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,023
Can you take me to where I was yesterday?

353
00:27:13,023 --> 00:27:14,423
To go to Doctor Han?

354
00:27:14,423 --> 00:27:15,483
I need to see again.

355
00:27:15,483 --> 00:27:17,093
Even if you go, she won't be there.

356
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:17,783
Then?

357
00:27:17,783 --> 00:27:19,443
She said she will be working at the main branch.

358
00:27:19,443 --> 00:27:22,253
Main branch? Please take me there.

359
00:27:22,253 --> 00:27:25,563
I told you that I'd take you there, geez.

360
00:27:36,993 --> 00:27:39,203
What are you going to do?

361
00:27:39,753 --> 00:27:42,203
I'm going to stay here a bit longer.

362
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:44,403
Anyway thank you.

363
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:28,313
Chief Han

364
00:28:29,593 --> 00:28:31,743
will be doing surgeries all morning.

365
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:33,583
Chairman...

366
00:28:34,193 --> 00:28:37,873
I chose to use Doctor Park Hoon again.

367
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:49,283
I always thought the saying "there is no parent who wins over their children" was about other people.

368
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,903
This person. I liked her.

369
00:29:03,203 --> 00:29:07,683
When she looked at me like this, it was always comforting.

370
00:29:09,443 --> 00:29:13,743
I don't know what she liked about me, however,

371
00:29:13,743 --> 00:29:16,583
I sincerely liked your mother.

372
00:29:17,553 --> 00:29:20,283
If there's something called fate

373
00:29:20,283 --> 00:29:24,273
I thought it would be something like this.

374
00:29:26,733 --> 00:29:28,763
Father.

375
00:29:32,033 --> 00:29:36,243
It's been a long time since I've heard you call me that.

376
00:29:37,523 --> 00:29:42,103
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

377
00:29:44,493 --> 00:29:46,553
And...

378
00:29:48,783 --> 00:29:50,783
Thank you.

379
00:29:52,173 --> 00:29:57,113
For loving mother. Thank you very much.

380
00:30:09,263 --> 00:30:16,173

381
00:30:37,273 --> 00:30:39,163
There's a lot of traffic.

382
00:30:39,213 --> 00:30:41,553
I think we'll be about 5 minutes late.

383
00:30:41,553 --> 00:30:43,503
Will it be okay?

384
00:30:47,733 --> 00:30:51,023
For something like this, as a Prime Minister, just make a decision on your own.

385
00:30:51,023 --> 00:30:53,873
Some suggested that it should get the President's approval.

386
00:30:53,873 --> 00:30:58,473
The committee  is under your chain of command. Why do you need my approval?

387
00:30:58,473 --> 00:31:00,283
I'm sorry.

388
00:31:05,483 --> 00:31:08,513
Don't be late for the appointed time next time.

389
00:31:11,913 --> 00:31:15,843
I'm sorry. I will try not to make this happen again.

390
00:31:18,803 --> 00:31:21,173
 Republic of South Korea; President, Hong Chan Sung

391
00:31:29,343 --> 00:31:32,523
5 minutes!  Because I was late 5 minutes,

392
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:37,843
the person was complaining is the President.  The President!

393
00:31:38,933 --> 00:31:40,513
This kind of person

394
00:31:40,513 --> 00:31:43,683
is South Korea's President!

395
00:31:49,213 --> 00:31:51,963
Did you say that her name is Han Seung Hee?

396
00:31:51,963 --> 00:31:53,293
Yes.

397
00:31:53,293 --> 00:31:55,723
Tell them I want to see her skills.

398
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:01,283
It's funny. It was so laughable!

399
00:32:01,283 --> 00:32:05,623
My heart can no longer handle this.

400
00:32:09,813 --> 00:32:12,123
There's a woman who looks exactly like your girlfriend?

401
00:32:12,123 --> 00:32:13,793
It's not a woman who's exactly the same, but it's Jae Hee.

402
00:32:13,793 --> 00:32:16,403
She herself says that she's not the person, then what are you going to do?

403
00:32:16,403 --> 00:32:17,423
But I know.

404
00:32:17,423 --> 00:32:20,383
Hey, do you really think that'll work if you're the only one who knows?

405
00:32:20,383 --> 00:32:23,903
You know why the people who see aliens see them alone?

406
00:32:23,903 --> 00:32:26,713
Because it's fake.

407
00:32:26,713 --> 00:32:29,163
There's someone else who saw her besides me.

408
00:32:31,733 --> 00:32:34,333
I can know it right away.

409
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:39,083
But, Doctor Park, forget about her now.

410
00:32:42,423 --> 00:32:43,733
Where are you right now?

411
00:32:43,733 --> 00:32:46,483
I'm going right now, so stay right by your mother's side.

412
00:32:46,483 --> 00:32:48,443
Okay.

413
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:52,573
I shouldn't have told him that.

414
00:32:52,573 --> 00:32:55,913
Why? If she's dead, then she's dead.

415
00:32:55,913 --> 00:32:58,933
Your way of speaking sounds like you want Doctor Park's girlfriend to be dead.

416
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:00,583
When did I?

417
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:03,093
Stop saying nonsense. What do you want to eat?

418
00:33:03,093 --> 00:33:08,173
Cold noodles. Hamhung (N. Korean city) noodles.  Okay?

419
00:33:20,113 --> 00:33:25,083
 If there's nowhere to lean on, I need to find out the truth myself.

420
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:29,403
 I saw Oh Gang Chul in the mountains...

421
00:33:32,153 --> 00:33:35,213
 Jang Seok Joo says that he wants to see your skills.

422
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:39,653
 He's in a hurry. I just came to Myeongwoo today.

423
00:33:39,653 --> 00:33:42,023
 There's a good patient.

424
00:33:42,803 --> 00:33:45,813
 - No way. 
 -That's right.

425
00:33:45,813 --> 00:33:49,833
 The grandma who said nonsense to Park Hoon.

426
00:33:50,873 --> 00:33:53,393
 I will set it up,

427
00:33:53,393 --> 00:33:56,253
 show your skills all you want.

428
00:34:06,163 --> 00:34:08,463
-Chang Yi!
- Mom fainted all of a sudden.

429
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,083
What?

430
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:13,973
Move aside!

431
00:34:13,973 --> 00:34:18,393
Move aside!

432
00:34:26,623 --> 00:34:28,023
She became unconscious suddenly?

433
00:34:28,023 --> 00:34:31,263
65 year old female patient. I think she had an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack).

434
00:34:31,263 --> 00:34:32,453
What about Doctor Eun?

435
00:34:32,453 --> 00:34:34,903
It's not an atmosphere where I can leave. What should we do?

436
00:34:34,903 --> 00:34:38,943
Dr. Eun, we need muscle relaxant. Right now.

437
00:34:44,023 --> 00:34:46,613
Doctor Eun can't come.

438
00:34:46,613 --> 00:34:50,113
Then who's going to be our anesthetist? If it is an acute myocardial infraction, we need to hurry.

439
00:34:50,113 --> 00:34:53,573
Chief, the preparation for the surgery is complete.

440
00:34:54,313 --> 00:34:55,593
 Operation in Process

441
00:35:00,563 --> 00:35:03,303
Preparation is really done, Chief.

442
00:35:03,303 --> 00:35:05,293
Who started the IV line?

443
00:35:06,603 --> 00:35:08,423
I'm Han Seung Hee.

444
00:35:08,423 --> 00:35:10,253
Han Seung Hee?

445
00:35:10,253 --> 00:35:12,573
It's Dr. Eun Min Se.

446
00:35:15,953 --> 00:35:17,503
Who is Dr. Han Seung Hee?

447
00:35:17,503 --> 00:35:19,003
 Is Doctor Han there?

448
00:35:19,003 --> 00:35:21,213
Do you know her? It's my first time seeing her.

449
00:35:21,213 --> 00:35:24,483
She was recruited because she was an excellent anesthesiologist from another branch.

450
00:35:24,483 --> 00:35:26,383
Trust her this once and start your operation.

451
00:35:26,383 --> 00:35:28,473
 I'm going right now!

452
00:35:28,473 --> 00:35:31,453
 Chief, I'm a little busy.

453
00:35:38,033 --> 00:35:41,863
10 mL of Etomidate (anesthetic) and 50mL of Rocuronium (muscle relaxer - adjunct to anesthetic) are taken care of.

454
00:35:41,863 --> 00:35:44,243
Are you ready with dopamine (here, can be used to increase blood pressure)  and dobutamine (to reverse heart failure if needed)?

455
00:35:44,243 --> 00:35:46,723
The Epi is ready too (epinephrine can help reverse cardiac arrest).

456
00:35:46,723 --> 00:35:49,303
Please start the surgery.

457
00:35:51,293 --> 00:35:53,603
I will rely on you.

458
00:35:53,603 --> 00:35:55,133
Scalpel.

459
00:36:16,553 --> 00:36:18,163
Doctor.

460
00:36:19,633 --> 00:36:22,913
The surgery turned out well. She will regain consciousness soon.

461
00:36:22,913 --> 00:36:27,743
What happened here? That patient wasn't at a point to have myocardial infarction.

462
00:36:27,743 --> 00:36:30,953
The patient is old enough to suspect any illness.

463
00:36:31,653 --> 00:36:32,723
Isn't that right?

464
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:35,243
Her heart wasn't one to have a myocardial infarction.

465
00:36:35,243 --> 00:36:37,373
What are you doing, Hyung?

466
00:36:37,373 --> 00:36:40,783
Anyway, thank you, Doctor.

467
00:36:42,573 --> 00:36:45,133
Thank the anesthesiologist.

468
00:36:45,133 --> 00:36:48,673
- If the prognosis is good, it's all thanks to fast preparation by her.
- Mom.

469
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:53,283
Did you say you are Doctor Han?

470
00:36:53,283 --> 00:36:55,743
You worked hard, Chief.

471
00:37:20,553 --> 00:37:22,853
 Intensive Care Unit

472
00:37:23,993 --> 00:37:27,203
Mom, Mom, are you alright?

473
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:31,203
It's too hard for her to talk. Since the patient needs some rest,

474
00:37:31,203 --> 00:37:33,843
will you please wait outside?

475
00:37:48,523 --> 00:37:50,853
I get to see you again here.

476
00:37:52,683 --> 00:37:55,583
I'm sorry about yesterday.

477
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:00,653
Doctor Han Seung Hee!

478
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,183
Hello, I'm Doctor Han Seung Hee.

479
00:38:02,183 --> 00:38:03,873
I'm sorry. You just got here.

480
00:38:03,873 --> 00:38:07,263
I'll take care of her from this point. Go and see the personnel office first.

481
00:38:07,263 --> 00:38:08,753
Yes.

482
00:38:20,063 --> 00:38:22,293
She's not Jae Hee?

483
00:38:22,293 --> 00:38:25,353
Then, is she a different person?

484
00:38:25,353 --> 00:38:27,533
I don't know.

485
00:38:27,533 --> 00:38:30,323
So when your mom regains her strength, I want to ask her.

486
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:38,693
Can you make some time?

487
00:38:46,813 --> 00:38:49,283
This must be called an ill-fated relationship.

488
00:38:49,283 --> 00:38:52,743
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about the relationship between you and me.

489
00:38:54,013 --> 00:38:57,013
I don't have time to fool around. Just get to the point.

490
00:38:57,013 --> 00:39:00,723
I heard you came into our hospital because of your girlfriend.

491
00:39:00,723 --> 00:39:05,203
But I heard stories...that that person had passed away.

492
00:39:08,683 --> 00:39:11,493
Are you done? Then...

493
00:39:15,533 --> 00:39:19,613
So if you are done with your business at this hospital where you were kicked out, stop loitering

494
00:39:19,613 --> 00:39:21,823
and get lost.

495
00:39:22,533 --> 00:39:27,043
Especially, don't go near Doctor Oh.

496
00:39:27,043 --> 00:39:28,813
Doctor Oh?

497
00:39:29,523 --> 00:39:31,993
Ah, Quack?

498
00:39:31,993 --> 00:39:34,023
Watch what you say.

499
00:39:34,023 --> 00:39:39,483
Dr. Oh is not a doctor you can call "a quack".

500
00:39:39,483 --> 00:39:41,823
In my eyes, she is.

501
00:39:41,823 --> 00:39:44,183
What do you think, Quack?

502
00:39:54,453 --> 00:39:57,823
I'm sorry. I was a bit harsh.

503
00:39:57,823 --> 00:39:59,823
What is the matter?

504
00:40:01,663 --> 00:40:06,443
It's nothing much. Looks like you guys need to have a conversation.

505
00:40:06,443 --> 00:40:08,993
- Doctor Park. 
 - Soo Hyeon.

506
00:40:10,733 --> 00:40:13,713
He called you a quack,

507
00:40:13,713 --> 00:40:15,293
so unconsciously, I reacted like that.

508
00:40:15,293 --> 00:40:17,683
You grabbed his collar just for that?

509
00:40:17,683 --> 00:40:20,033
It's not like you, Jae Joon.

510
00:40:20,033 --> 00:40:21,873
Soo Hyeon, you are my team's First.

511
00:40:21,873 --> 00:40:25,713
I can't stand such an insulting remark.

512
00:40:27,203 --> 00:40:29,233
I'm thankful, but...

513
00:40:30,063 --> 00:40:35,003
can't you get along with Doctor Park, Jae Joon?

514
00:40:35,923 --> 00:40:37,243
Why?

515
00:40:37,243 --> 00:40:41,613
What do you mean why? There are a lot of things that aren't working out.

516
00:40:41,613 --> 00:40:44,333
You guys are doctors in the same department.

517
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:46,373
Same department?

518
00:40:46,373 --> 00:40:48,693
Did the Chairman give permission?

519
00:40:48,693 --> 00:40:50,293
Yes.

520
00:40:51,463 --> 00:40:56,603
Anyways, let's get along well. Alright?

521
00:40:58,013 --> 00:40:59,933
Okay.

522
00:40:59,933 --> 00:41:03,073
Then, what about dinner tonight?

523
00:41:03,073 --> 00:41:07,103
Sorry. I have somewhere to go.

524
00:41:07,103 --> 00:41:10,643
- I'll be going for an outpatient appointment.
- Soo Hyeon.

525
00:41:20,243 --> 00:41:24,523
It's relief that your face looks more relaxed now.

526
00:41:37,003 --> 00:41:39,003
- Move aside. 
 - Let's go.

527
00:41:39,003 --> 00:41:41,003
- Where? 
 - To Chairman.

528
00:41:41,003 --> 00:41:43,173
- Why? 
 - To beg!

529
00:41:43,173 --> 00:41:46,293
Do you think I brought you here for no reason?

530
00:41:46,293 --> 00:41:48,573
Come here.

531
00:41:48,573 --> 00:41:51,603
Why are you attempting to resist me when you came all this way?

532
00:41:51,603 --> 00:41:54,793
- Chairman is in his office, right? 
 - He's not here right now.

533
00:41:54,793 --> 00:41:56,743
She said he's not here.

534
00:41:56,783 --> 00:42:00,043
But- Oh, Hyungnim.

535
00:42:12,243 --> 00:42:14,933
It's been a long time, right?

536
00:42:18,293 --> 00:42:22,363
  Hoon, you want to go to your dad, right?

537
00:42:22,363 --> 00:42:23,953
 Yes, Ajusshi.

538
00:42:23,953 --> 00:42:28,503
  Then, let's go with Ajusshi.

539
00:42:33,933 --> 00:42:38,483
Hyungnim, why does Chairman want to see Doctor Park?

540
00:42:38,483 --> 00:42:40,153
He decided to forgive Doctor Park.

541
00:42:40,153 --> 00:42:43,233
Really? Is he taking Doctor Park in again, Hyungnim?

542
00:42:43,233 --> 00:42:45,963
I also requested it of the Chairman.

543
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:48,013
Thankfully, he allowed it.

544
00:42:48,013 --> 00:42:49,743
I'm not interested in that.

545
00:42:49,743 --> 00:42:51,783
I heard that you have great skills.

546
00:42:51,783 --> 00:42:55,893
But, if you want to be like your father, you need to learn more.

547
00:42:57,253 --> 00:42:59,113
Do you have the right to say that?

548
00:42:59,113 --> 00:43:04,803
I do. Because that way I can ask for forgiveness.

549
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:11,133
You're searching for a person named Jae Hee, right?

550
00:43:21,863 --> 00:43:23,773
 Doctor Park!

551
00:43:33,093 --> 00:43:35,203
How do you have this photo?

552
00:43:35,203 --> 00:43:40,993
Dr. Johan was not only your father's friend but he is a doctor I'm also close to.

553
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:47,503
And Dr. Johan gave me that picture.

554
00:43:47,503 --> 00:43:52,623
That picture that Dr. Johan gave me

555
00:43:52,623 --> 00:43:55,353
made me realize what I should do  with my life.

556
00:43:57,303 --> 00:43:59,243
You mean, making me a doctor of this hospital?

557
00:43:59,243 --> 00:44:04,813
Also, to search for  that girl...

558
00:44:06,093 --> 00:44:09,013
Don't talk bullsh*t.

559
00:44:11,293 --> 00:44:16,133
Your lover... is it true that she's in North Korea?

560
00:44:16,133 --> 00:44:18,163
- Jae Hee is here.
- What?

561
00:44:18,163 --> 00:44:20,103
How can a person in North Korea suddenly be here?

562
00:44:20,103 --> 00:44:24,063
- I don't know. 
- Gosh, that's weird.

563
00:44:31,663 --> 00:44:41,473

564
00:44:45,863 --> 00:44:48,543
Welcome. Come in this way.

565
00:44:53,753 --> 00:44:55,003
The surgery was successful.

566
00:44:55,003 --> 00:44:58,893
The skill that we want to see isn't that.

567
00:45:01,493 --> 00:45:05,303
You will see what you want soon.

568
00:45:12,593 --> 00:45:14,233
Why did your mother suddenly lose consciousness?

569
00:45:14,233 --> 00:45:16,873
I don't know. By any chance, my mom...

570
00:45:16,873 --> 00:45:19,273
Don't jinx it.

571
00:45:20,463 --> 00:45:23,203
What's the problem? Why are the patient's vitals down?

572
00:45:23,203 --> 00:45:26,343
I don't know what is happening. The patient keeps waking up and losing consciousness.

573
00:45:26,343 --> 00:45:28,263
What happened, Doctor Eun?

574
00:45:28,263 --> 00:45:29,843
I don't know either.

575
00:45:29,843 --> 00:45:32,843
Truthfully, I use dozens of anesthetics but

576
00:45:32,843 --> 00:45:36,943
nobody knows why they anesthetize a person.

577
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:40,433
Anesthetics... You think you get it, but you don't.

578
00:45:42,093 --> 00:45:43,883
Is there something wrong with my mom?

579
00:45:43,883 --> 00:45:47,573
She's okay now. Don't worry too much.

580
00:45:47,573 --> 00:45:50,303
Take care of this patient, Doctor Han.

581
00:46:01,043 --> 00:46:05,213
Mother, can you recognize me?

582
00:46:05,213 --> 00:46:07,513
Yes.

583
00:46:10,483 --> 00:46:13,513
You said you would know if you saw Jae Hee, right?

584
00:46:18,153 --> 00:46:20,523
Doctor?

585
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:27,673
Doctor Choi?

586
00:46:27,673 --> 00:46:31,613
You were fine when you were crossing the Yalu River. What happened?

587
00:46:31,613 --> 00:46:36,403
He is the one who got me out of the concentration camp.

588
00:46:36,403 --> 00:46:40,843
My dear Dr. Choi...

589
00:46:40,843 --> 00:46:46,833
Dr. Choi... dear Dr. Choi...

590
00:46:49,933 --> 00:46:52,473
Mom! Mom!

591
00:46:52,473 --> 00:46:54,523
Mom. Mom!

592
00:46:54,523 --> 00:46:58,763
Don't worry. She has momentarily lost consciousness.

593
00:47:01,533 --> 00:47:05,813
If she rests, she will regain her consciousness again.

594
00:47:12,263 --> 00:47:15,883
- Did you really bring my mom here? 
 - Yes.

595
00:47:19,523 --> 00:47:25,283
 Please say thank you to Dr. Choi ...

596
00:47:25,283 --> 00:47:28,683
 I really thank you.

597
00:47:29,753 --> 00:47:31,683
But how?

598
00:47:31,683 --> 00:47:33,653
  It's simple.

599
00:47:33,653 --> 00:47:37,713
 If I give this to Chinese people over there,

600
00:47:37,713 --> 00:47:42,243
 and when they say how much they got to the Chinese businessman in North Korea,

601
00:47:42,243 --> 00:47:46,793
  Then, that person will find the person we want.

602
00:47:46,793 --> 00:47:51,593
  Then, they will take the person out through a route they know.

603
00:47:51,593 --> 00:47:55,163
Mr. Lim really was a swindler...

604
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:58,123
I asked him to say that.

605
00:47:58,123 --> 00:47:59,523
Why?

606
00:47:59,523 --> 00:48:04,323
Until we found Jae Hee, I couldn't personally step in.

607
00:48:04,323 --> 00:48:07,503
But by helping Chang Yi's mom escape,

608
00:48:07,503 --> 00:48:09,773
I wanted to give you hope.

609
00:48:09,773 --> 00:48:13,903
- What hope? 
 - Hope that you can meet Jae Hee.

610
00:48:17,443 --> 00:48:19,553
Mom.

611
00:48:42,633 --> 00:48:47,003
You really look similar to her.

612
00:48:47,003 --> 00:48:50,813
I've heard that a lot since yesterday, Grandma.

613
00:48:52,393 --> 00:48:56,533
If you feel uncomfortable, just tell me any time.

614
00:49:06,823 --> 00:49:08,923
Mother.

615
00:49:08,923 --> 00:49:11,883
She looks similar,

616
00:49:11,883 --> 00:49:15,343
but she isn't Jae Hee, Doctor Park.

617
00:49:16,523 --> 00:49:19,573
I definitely saw her

618
00:49:19,573 --> 00:49:23,813
dying.

619
00:49:27,553 --> 00:49:29,763
No, Mother.

620
00:49:30,903 --> 00:49:33,413
That child is alive.

621
00:49:53,403 --> 00:49:55,393
Hoon.

622
00:50:03,783 --> 00:50:06,493
 Thoracic Surgery Park Hoon

623
00:50:07,313 --> 00:50:11,713
I heard from a reliable source that she is alive.

624
00:50:11,713 --> 00:50:15,843
- After I take care of business here, I will go back to the North.
- I will go too.

625
00:50:15,843 --> 00:50:19,793
I'm an old man, so it's okay, but it's too dangerous for you.

626
00:50:21,173 --> 00:50:25,663
Let's see each other once more before I leave.  I have something to give you.

627
00:50:46,703 --> 00:50:48,373
It's me.

628
00:50:49,343 --> 00:50:51,933
Why didn't you just block that grandma and that kid's mouthes?

629
00:50:51,933 --> 00:50:55,263
That isn't what the Prime Minister wants.

630
00:50:55,263 --> 00:50:57,253
What about Park Hoon?

631
00:51:00,103 --> 00:51:03,393
He came back to the hospital. What about the Chariman here?

632
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:06,013
Jang Seok Joo persuaded him.

633
00:51:06,013 --> 00:51:09,033
Now everything is back to normal again.

634
00:51:09,033 --> 00:51:13,683
Park Hoon is back at the hospital and we showed the Prime Minister what he wants.

635
00:51:13,683 --> 00:51:18,023
That's right. We need to move to achieve our task.

636
00:51:40,673 --> 00:51:44,123
That grandma is going back and forth from being alert and in coma.

637
00:51:44,123 --> 00:51:47,223
 Alert: out of 5 levels of consciousness, state of clarity.
 Coma: state of unconsciousness.

638
00:51:47,223 --> 00:51:50,963
You can control legislation with that.

639
00:52:04,953 --> 00:52:08,153
Hey, see me for a moment.

640
00:52:20,463 --> 00:52:22,083
Is she your lover or not?

641
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:23,503
I don't know.

642
00:52:23,503 --> 00:52:25,533
Tell me exactly.

643
00:52:25,533 --> 00:52:28,703
If she is your lover by any chance, that means she's a spy.

644
00:52:28,703 --> 00:52:30,083
Why is Jae Hee a spy?

645
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:33,543
Think about it. It's weird for a North Korean to be here

646
00:52:33,543 --> 00:52:36,903
and it's weird for her to act like she doesn't know you.

647
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:40,403
- That's not possible. 
 - If that's the case, it's a big problem.

648
00:52:40,403 --> 00:52:45,513
If we choose her to join our team because she's  good at anesthesia and find out she's a spy, then our team is screwed.

649
00:52:45,513 --> 00:52:47,293
Fine. Let's just say

650
00:52:47,293 --> 00:52:50,113
if she is your girlfriend.

651
00:52:50,113 --> 00:52:53,113
Do you have any way to check if it's her other than her face?

652
00:52:53,113 --> 00:52:56,333
Does she have scars on her body or anything like that?

653
00:52:58,513 --> 00:53:01,153
She received a kidney transplantation about two years ago.

654
00:53:01,153 --> 00:53:02,663
Kidney transplantation?

655
00:53:02,663 --> 00:53:06,733
Both of her kidneys weren't in good condition, so she received one kidney.

656
00:53:06,733 --> 00:53:09,613
Let's go. I have a way to check that.

657
00:53:09,613 --> 00:53:11,643
Come quickly.

658
00:53:13,503 --> 00:53:16,113
- I said you can't. 
 - You're so stubborn.

659
00:53:16,113 --> 00:53:17,623
Just do it for us.

660
00:53:17,623 --> 00:53:19,243
Of course not.

661
00:53:19,243 --> 00:53:21,543
We just need to check Doctor Han's kidney. I beg you.

662
00:53:21,543 --> 00:53:24,553
Yeah, you just need to tell us if she has one or two kidneys.

663
00:53:24,553 --> 00:53:26,083
I can never tell you, Hyungnim.

664
00:53:26,083 --> 00:53:27,443
Are you really going to act like this?

665
00:53:27,443 --> 00:53:29,993
Hyungnim, this is a medical record.

666
00:53:29,993 --> 00:53:34,083
If you see this without proper permission, you're going to go to prison... to prison!

667
00:53:35,023 --> 00:53:38,613
Hey, we can't.  No, we can't do rice with beans. 
(rice with beans refers to prison)

668
00:53:42,453 --> 00:53:44,743
I just need a moment. It's really just a moment.

669
00:53:44,743 --> 00:53:46,323
-You! 
 - Hyungnim!

670
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:48,823
Hey! Stop there!

671
00:53:51,033 --> 00:53:55,183
Hey, stop! If you see that, you're in big trouble.

672
00:53:55,183 --> 00:53:57,223
Hey! I was wrong.  Stop here.

673
00:53:57,223 --> 00:54:00,523
Since you haven't seen it yet, you can still get pass this. But the minute you see this, it will really be the end for you.

674
00:54:00,523 --> 00:54:01,883
Aish, move aside.

675
00:54:01,883 --> 00:54:05,383
Hey, hey! Your doctor's license will be revoked and you'll really go to prison!

676
00:54:05,383 --> 00:54:08,073
Aish, I told you to move!

677
00:54:08,073 --> 00:54:11,583
I didn't see it! I never saw it!

678
00:54:18,933 --> 00:54:21,023
How many?

679
00:54:28,703 --> 00:54:31,653
Two?

680
00:54:31,653 --> 00:54:36,783
She's not a spy!

681
00:54:36,783 --> 00:54:38,953
She's not a spy.

682
00:54:38,953 --> 00:54:42,543
Hurray! Hurray!

683
00:54:43,493 --> 00:54:46,723
Hurray!

684
00:54:53,563 --> 00:54:59,073
♬  You and I both in a lonely life  ♬

685
00:54:59,073 --> 00:55:04,273
♬  That is how we are destined to live  ♬

686
00:55:04,273 --> 00:55:07,533
♬  Love is fragile  ♬

687
00:55:07,533 --> 00:55:12,553
♬  And Time simply passes.  ♬

688
00:55:16,863 --> 00:55:22,203
♬  There must be no permanent commitment.  ♬

689
00:55:22,203 --> 00:55:27,493
♬  While we look on, both the words which were whispered  ♬

690
00:55:27,493 --> 00:55:33,183
♬  And the dust which covered the sky are shattered.  ♬

691
00:55:33,183 --> 00:55:38,613
♬  We passed each other like strangers.  ♬

692
00:55:38,613 --> 00:55:43,853
♬  I love you to death, until I'm driven crazy,  ♬

693
00:55:43,853 --> 00:55:49,443
♬  I will love you through eternity.  ♬

694
00:55:49,443 --> 00:55:54,243
♬  I'm not letting go. I must find you.  ♬

695
00:55:54,243 --> 00:55:57,203
  It is fate.

696
00:55:57,203 --> 00:56:01,503
  They say that the heartbeat for each person is different.

697
00:56:01,503 --> 00:56:04,803
 Just like there aren't any two people with the same face.

698
00:56:08,583 --> 00:56:12,763
  Listen. But it's the same as yours, right?

699
00:56:24,193 --> 00:56:26,923
I'm Han Seung Hee who will be working in the Anesthesiology Department.

700
00:56:26,923 --> 00:56:29,313
Please take care of me.

701
00:56:29,313 --> 00:56:31,623
Wow, it's great to have another female on the team.

702
00:56:31,623 --> 00:56:35,483
We are lucky to work with an excellent anesthesiologist.

703
00:56:35,483 --> 00:56:38,273
Please take good care of us, too

704
00:56:39,673 --> 00:56:42,683
- Let's work well, Doctor Han. 
 - I will try my best, Doctor Oh.

705
00:56:42,683 --> 00:56:45,313
Work well with me too, whatever that may be.

706
00:56:45,313 --> 00:56:47,153
I'm glad to meet you.

707
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:48,863
Me too.

708
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:53,013
Make time, so that you can eat with us.

709
00:56:53,013 --> 00:56:54,603
Thank you, Chief.

710
00:56:54,603 --> 00:56:57,643
Oh yay.  I call the seat next to her.

711
00:57:02,193 --> 00:57:04,353
- Is this place okay for you?
- Yes.

712
00:57:04,353 --> 00:57:07,253
If you have any problems, tell me.

713
00:57:07,253 --> 00:57:10,363
Doctor Han Seung Hee.

714
00:57:10,363 --> 00:57:13,793
Can you make some time for me?

715
00:57:13,793 --> 00:57:17,923
- Why Doctor Park?
- A brief time will be sufficient.

716
00:57:17,923 --> 00:57:20,503
Are you trying to apologize for what happened yesterday?

717
00:57:22,593 --> 00:57:25,563
You don't have to apologize.

718
00:57:25,563 --> 00:57:27,453
I heard from Doctor Oh.

719
00:57:27,453 --> 00:57:31,603
I think I can understand how your feeling a little bit.

720
00:57:31,603 --> 00:57:35,543
I also wish that you can meet that person.

721
00:57:35,543 --> 00:57:39,633
They say that the heartbeat for each person is different.

722
00:57:39,633 --> 00:57:42,193
Just like there aren't any two people with the same face.

723
00:57:42,193 --> 00:57:45,963
It means that every heart moves differently.

724
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:51,273
What are you saying all of a sudden, Doctor Park?

725
00:57:51,273 --> 00:57:54,123
Can I ask you for one thing?

726
00:57:55,333 --> 00:57:57,793
I just need a moment.

727
00:58:22,533 --> 00:58:31,133

728
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:33,033
♬  I'm going to meet you right now. Let's meet again.  ♬
