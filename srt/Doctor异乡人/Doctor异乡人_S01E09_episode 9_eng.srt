1
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,900

2
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,460
- What?
 - Hyung, the atmosphere is weird.

3
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,430
Is Dr. Han okay?

4
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,010
What is the reason for wanting to meet us?

5
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,450
We want to change the plan a little.

6
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,170
Change?

7
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,060
That's right.

8
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:58,000
We will use Han Jae Joon's card for the Prime Minister's surgery team.

9
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,350
Hyung!

10
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,550
What is the matter?

11
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,610
The girl that looks like Unni...

12
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:16,270
Yes, Dr. Han Seung Hee!

13
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,880
 I think they are going to kill her.

14
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,480
Dr. Oh.

15
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,500
Where is he going?

16
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,640
 Episode 9

17
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,310
- Doctor Park.
- Let go!

18
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,420
Where are you going?

19
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,060
I have to go! Let go!  I said let go!

20
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,810
Where!? Where are you going leaving the baby behind?

21
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,980
I'm begging you. Please let me go.

22
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,610
Chief,

23
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,270
the atmosphere over there is a bit weird.

24
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,940
Let go!

25
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,560
Look.

26
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,430
I don't know where you were going, but if you go now, what about that baby?

27
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,400
How about that baby?

28
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,930
We need to save the baby.

29
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,610
 Can you come?

30
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,780
 We have to save the baby.

31
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,390
What is the meaning of saying you'll be using Han Jae Joon's card?

32
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:18,520
It's just as you heard. The heart surgery team will be assigned  to Han Jae Joon.

33
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,410
Is that the reason why you told me to join that team?

34
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,630
But you rejected our demand.

35
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:26,120
The plan was to enter Park Hoon's team.

36
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,650
The plan has been changed.

37
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,060
Then, we don't need to speak any further.

38
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,590
Let me ask just one question.

39
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:47,620
Your actions... Did my Republic consent to this?

40
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:53,280
We don't need consent. We only act according to our own volition.

41
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,100
Do we look that laughable to you?

42
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,040
Drop your guns!

43
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,240
Where on earth were you planning to go?

44
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,210
- Just prepare for the surgery.
- What about Doctor Han?

45
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,050
 Current time: 9:21 PM

46
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,260
She'll come.

47
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,330
- Director Choi.
- Yes.

48
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,240
How do we determine the winner?

49
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,490
For now, success of the surgery comes first.

50
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,530
What if both are successful?

51
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:49,320
The difficult part of this surgery is while creating the aorta,

52
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,480
it's the very moment when the pump stops on ECMO.
 (Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation - heart-lung machine)

53
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,910
Then the babies will die because the oxygen flow to the babies'  brains stops.

54
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,040
If we set the rectum temperature to be 18Â°C, we can buy about 45 minutes.

55
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,490
You probably mean that's the maximum.

56
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:07,760
Yes. Also  the shorter the  time it takes to create the aorta, the better the prognosis.

57
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,850
So it depends on who can create the aorta faster in those 45 minutes?

58
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,410
Yes.

59
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:19,890
The winner will be the one with more minutes left on the clock.

60
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,510
How is the result of the last ABGA test?
 (Arterial Blood Gas Analysis - blood test using blood from an artery)

61
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,600
50/40. Fortunately,  it didn't drop lower.

62
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,070
That's a relief.

63
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,080
Hey, why hasn't Doctor Han come?

64
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,790
Should we be preparing for another anesthesiologist?

65
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,590
Doctor Han will come.

66
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,070
Oh, come on.  You should put those away!

67
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,790
Is it Park Hoon or Han Jae Joon?

68
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,990
At one point, it was Han Jae Joon.

69
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,650
But my thoughts changed a bit after seeing you.

70
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,990
I'm curious about something.

71
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,180
What is it?

72
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:22,640
Are you... Song Jae Hee or Han Seung Hee?

73
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:32,090
I'll be able to trust you when I know your true identity.

74
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,640
Surgical scars?

75
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,580
Yes, you could've transplanted one more kidney,

76
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,400
but there should be a trace of surgery left on her abdomen.

77
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,540
Are you curious?

78
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,650
How unfortunate. I haven't seen her bare skin either.

79
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,060
Did that answer your question?

80
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:15,240
Park Hoon, this kid, is really a pitiful guy.

81
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:23,250
Fine. I'll give a chance to Park Hoon.

82
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:29,220
But remember. I only need one card.

83
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,530
Did you say the match is at 10pm?

84
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,010
Yes. It is at 10.

85
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:09,430
If that jerk Park Hoon loses, you will also lie beside his dead body.

86
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,340
Why isn't this starting?

87
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:59,190
Will it be Park Hoon or Han Jae Joon? It seems like it'll be a long night.

88
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,960
Park Hoon will win.

89
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,040
He has to. Otherwise he will die by your hands.

90
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,730
Truthfully, I kind of wish Park Hoon would win.

91
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,800
Even though it might be okay if Park Hoon dies,

92
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,900
if I find that child, Han Seung Hee, as a corpse,

93
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,830
I don't think I will feel very good.

94
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,590
Don't worry.

95
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,370
I don't leave things like a corpse around.

96
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,200
What is this?

97
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,900
What is this?

98
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,410
 The number you have reached...

99
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:51,040
Why don't you pick up, Park Hoon?

100
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,580
Damn. Stop calling if he is not picking up.

101
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,940
- Hello.
- Why aren't you answering the phone?!

102
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,900
Who is this?

103
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,210
Isn't this Hoon Hyung?

104
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:15,140
Water Bottle, no, Dr. Park has gone into a surgery.

105
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,800
Who are you?

106
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,940
You will get hurt if you know. Why does she keep calling when he's not answering? So annoying.

107
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,210
Why are you putting your coat on? We haven't even started yet.

108
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,760
Forget it. I'm going to go watch the surgery.

109
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,830
We have some time left.

110
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,650
Oh, it's 10 PM. Let's go, let's go.

111
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,310
  Current Time: 22:00

112
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,520
Director Choi.

113
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,990
Yes.

114
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,370
It's 10pm.

115
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:46,530
The anesthesiologist hasn't arrived yet for this side.

116
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,610
Let's begin.

117
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,320
Director.

118
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,080
You're all ready, right?

119
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,830
Take care of us, Dr. Eun.

120
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,740
Then, I will start anesthesia.

121
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:17,370
I've put in a ketamine infusion and 2mg of atracurim.

122
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,220
Why aren't you starting?

123
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,600
The anesthesiologist is not here yet.

124
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,160
Then, you should call another anesthesiologist, dang it!

125
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,050
 Hey, Park Hoon!

126
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,610
What happened to Dr. Han?

127
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,410
She will come.

128
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,760
- Oh?
- Aish, this...

129
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,190
Isn't this Chief's operating room?

130
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,410
- Next room.
- I know.

131
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,850
But why are you here, Dr. Oh?

132
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,980
Can you just go away?

133
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,960
Water Bottle, fighting!

134
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,920
Hey, Kim Chi...

135
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,160
Dr. Han.

136
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:51,700
 I will give a chance to Park Hoon.

137
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,660
 I only need one card.

138
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,780
 If that jerk Park Hoon loses,

139
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,250
 you will also lie beside his dead body.

140
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,960
I will start anesthesia.

141
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,000
I'll put in 2mg of atracurim.

142
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,070
We will lose at this rate.

143
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,540
If you think that way, then leave.

144
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,150
This is just an ordinary surgery.

145
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,750
The surgery to heal a baby that's sick.

146
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,110
You may start.

147
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,860
You worked hard.

148
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,190
Scalpel.

149
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,250
Dr. Eun is doing well.

150
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,520
She is good.

151
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,750
She was our Myeongwoo Hospital's best anesthesiologist until not too long ago.

152
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,690
Until?

153
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:20,540
Yes. Until Dr. Han Seung Hee came.

154
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,060
You may begin.

155
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,670
Scalpel.

156
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,760
Look only at the baby.

157
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,090
Han Seung Hee?

158
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,060
The anesthesia is already finished on that side!

159
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,330
Shut up and just watch.

160
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,370
They started a bit late

161
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,370
but both teams started the incision at about the same time.

162
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:06,270

163
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:13,250
Chairman, watch them carefully.

164
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,320
They are our Myeongwoo Hospital's...no.

165
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:20,240
The doctors who will take responsibility for Korea's cardio thoracic surgery are right over there.

166
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:36,180
They should be in the middle of their match by now.

167
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,850
I'm curious.

168
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:44,520
Who will be my card?

169
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,180
From now on, it'll be the highlight of the surgery.

170
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,220
Temperature.

171
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,450
18 degrees. (64Â°F)

172
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,340
Highlight?

173
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,170
When they stop the ECMO (heart-lung machine), within 45 minutes,

174
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:25,130
they have to create the aorta.  It's what that is.

175
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,030
Pump off.

176
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,820
They have to finish it before the clock hits zero.

177
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,960
Otherwise, the baby dies right away.

178
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,630
They really shortened their time on anesthesia.

179
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:00,560
I think it's also due to a skillful scrub nurse.

180
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,870
Suction.

181
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,860
Look at the field.

182
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,290
Okay.

183
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,400
 Myeongwoo University Hospital

184
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,840
Hey Quack!

185
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,330
Blood vessel just ripped.

186
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,390
Perform anastomosis.

187
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,210
We don't have much time. Quickly, start the anastomosis.

188
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,150
Oh that quack!

189
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,580
We don't have much time. Doctor Park, you perform the anastomosis.

190
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,490
Look at the baby, not me.

191
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,400
Look at the baby!

192
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,000
Perform the anastomosis.

193
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,990
You do it. There's no time.

194
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:24,710
Doctor Park, you do it. We don't have much time and I can't perform an anastomosis quickly.

195
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,700
You practiced earlier.

196
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:35,530
Do it. Do you want to be called a "quack" forever?

197
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,090
Quickly.

198
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:00,040
You do it. There isn't time.

199
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,500
- Stay still. 
 - Doctor Park!

200
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:13,220
 Apart from being Chairman's daughter, Doctor Oh is just an average doctor.

201
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,260
 It's not a surgery you're able to perform.

202
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,280
 Give the First to Bong Hyun for this surgery.

203
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,270
 I'm doing this because I think it's possible if it's our quack who tries.

204
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:25,540
 You have the hands of a cardiothoracic surgeon.

205
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,820
Okay, Quack.

206
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,750
Give it to me.

207
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,870
Pump on.

208
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,640
They're finished.

209
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,150
Han Jae Joon has won.

210
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,580
Chief, we won.

211
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,760
Cut.

212
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,940
Pump on.

213
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,170
I'm sorry... Because of me...

214
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:57,630
Because of you, the baby lived.

215
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:03,080
We lost.

216
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,090
It doesn't matter.

217
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,560
Doctor Han.

218
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,320
Later.

219
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,510
Chairman.

220
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:11,280
I sincerely congratulate you.

221
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:16,390
Yes. There will soon be something to congratulate you on.

222
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:20,130
It was a rare surgery to watch.

223
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,540
It was that guy Park Hoon's last surgery.

224
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:36,140
Chairman, it was a surgery that proved why Park Hoon has to stay at our hospital.

225
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:39,590
Yes. I acknowledge the skill.

226
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:41,490
But...

227
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,050
I can't stay together with that guy.

228
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:46,880
Making our Myeongwoo Hospital the best

229
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,840
is your dream.

230
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,680
Park Hoon and Chief Han are the talents that will help us achieve that dream!

231
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,960
That kind of a dream... Chief Han alone is enough.

232
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,920
Chairman.

233
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:20,480
There'll be something to congratulate me on?

234
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,570
Congratulations, Professor.

235
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:34,560
Your transfer to the branch office, I'm congratulating you early.

236
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,660
This punk.

237
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:40,520
You've put in much effort until now.

238
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:45,660
But now that we won't be seeing each other,

239
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,410
I feel so happy that tears are blocking my view.

240
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,800
What?

241
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,960
What you punk? What did you just say you bastard? Huh?

242
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,830
- Hey!
- Wait, wait.

243
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:00,000
Come here!

244
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,520
Hey, stop!

245
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,570
I heard that there are a lot of pretty female doctors at the branch office.

246
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:08,660
If you give them flowers... oh, I'll send you some, Elder.

247
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,410
Aish, this thug-like bastard!

248
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,740
You, do you want to die today? Huh?

249
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,260
You know, there'll be clean water and

250
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,790
fresh air at the branch office.

251
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:23,650
So I hope that you restore your energy and stamina, then come back, Elder. Please be healthy.

252
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:26,740
That mouth of yours, come over here.

253
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,760
That's for making fun of an elder, you punk.

254
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,260
- You brat! Come here. 
- Branch office, hwaiting!

255
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,520
Come here! You're not coming here?

256
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,270
Gosh, really.

257
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,960
Professor, by chance has the Chairman left?

258
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,680
Hey Oh Soo Hyeon...

259
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:45,380
You know that we lost because of you, right?

260
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,710
I'm sorry, Professor.

261
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:50,040
Right. Well, your personality is beautiful.

262
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,930
So please tell the Chairman

263
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:56,570
to not send me to the branch office.

264
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:57,820
The branch office?

265
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,600
Chairman said

266
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,680
there'll be something to congratulate me on.

267
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,890
No way, we don't even have that much staff here, how can he send away people?

268
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,980
Right, on that fact,

269
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:13,730
put your beautiful heart on top, and convey it in that exact manner

270
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,920
to Chairman please.

271
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,670
I, with my all,

272
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:23,430
will serve Myeongwoo. Definitely. Forever.

273
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:27,230
I think it would be best if you told these kinds of things to him directly.

274
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:37,190
Aish, how did I end up begging her?

275
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:42,810
Aish! Park Hoon, that bastard, really!

276
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,700
Hey! Hey!

277
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:47,490
Park Hoon.

278
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,300
Let go.

279
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,640
Why did you lose, man?!

280
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,400
Ah, so what? We saved the kid.

281
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,630
I'm going to die!

282
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:57,300
Die? Who's going to die? It's okay. Go, go.

283
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,290
Hey! We're all dead!

284
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:08,840
We're all dead, I said! You jerk!

285
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:13,780
What kind of bull is this?!

286
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:24,440

287
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,860
Good job, Doctor Han.

288
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,570
Please look after the baby for a moment.

289
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,440
Are you going somewhere?

290
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,670
It was so close, Dr. Park.

291
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,230
What about Dr. Han?

292
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:42,540
She just left.

293
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,980
Hyung!

294
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,550
Hyung, is she Jae Hee?

295
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,040
Listen to me well from now on.

296
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,860
- Listen to what I have to say, Hyung.
- Listen!

297
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,050
Don't ever tell anybody what you saw.

298
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:21,460
- But...
- Answer me.

299
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:26,240
Okay. Then tell me one thing.

300
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,130
What?

301
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,380
Is she really Jae Hee?

302
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,930
I saw guns too. Is she a spy?

303
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,130
That's why I'm saying that no one else can know.

304
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,340
Hyung...

305
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,500
Give me the truck key and go to your mother.  I'll call you later.

306
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:54,530
Hyung, you are okay, right?

307
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:56,450
Thank you.

308
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:06,660
 I will finish Park Hoon off.

309
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,830
You also won't be able to live past this.

310
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,720
 Didn't I tell you before?

311
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,700
 Only thing I'm afraid of is not being able to complete the task.

312
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,960
And we failed to complete the task.

313
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:27,430
Jae Hee...

314
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,370
Jae Hee...

315
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:09,180
It's the Party who will decide whether the task was a success or a failure.

316
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,810
It's not your authority, Comrade.

317
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:14,350
Your excuses are too long.

318
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,590
Are you afraid of dying?

319
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:20,580
- There is still a chance.
- There was.

320
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,820
But that bastard blew it away.

321
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,460
Operating room is going overboard...

322
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,970
That's what I'm saying.

323
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:25,080
Uh?  Water Bottle. Cheer up.

324
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:29,330
You did well too but the Chief did too well. It was too extreme, right? Cheer up.

325
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:31,690
It's okay. Let's go.

326
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,020
Hello.

327
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,510
You worked hard today.

328
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,970
You worked hard today too, Chief.

329
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:03,330
You said it was a single match, right Chief?

330
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:07,350
- What about Dr. Oh?
- She is not answering her phone.

331
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:13,630
I didn't know Dr. Oh would really go to Water Bottle's team.

332
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,940
We won thanks to her.

333
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:22,930
- What?
- Water Bottle's team almost caught up to us,

334
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:25,930
but because Dr. Oh hesitated, they were left far behind again.

335
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,810
Dr. Eun...

336
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:35,630
  Chairman is asking you to come up, Chief.

337
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,010
Alright.

338
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:44,460
Well, since it's already a bit late today, for now, why don't you go in and rest?

339
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,750
How could you help Park Hoon?

340
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:51,050
Anyway, everyone got what they wanted.

341
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:54,960
The babies are all well, and Jae Joon and you won the match.

342
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,540
Is that something that you can say? What good will come out of falling out with Chief Han?

343
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:01,750
Are you worrying about me? That I might break up with Jae Joon?

344
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:05,700
I'm worrying about me, you rascal. That I might lose a son-in-law that I like.

345
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:11,010
Why? You don't like Chief Han?

346
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:14,490
I like him, he's next after you.

347
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:17,600
Take care of him well then.

348
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,510
Father, I want to be move out.

349
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:23,080
What? What are you suddenly talking about?

350
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,870
I will tell you my reasons slowly later.

351
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,130
Soo Hyeon!

352
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,890
Thank you, Father.

353
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,320
Soo Hyeon.

354
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,430
Go in. My father is waiting.

355
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,370
Do you have some time?

356
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:51,330
Later...

357
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,290
Anyhow, congratulations, Jae Joon.

358
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,410
 This is Gyeonggi Branch Police Station.

359
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:16,500
 To report a spy please press 1.

360
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,780
What are you doing, Chang Yi?

361
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,060
Doctor.

362
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,940
Why are you so startled?

363
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,290
It's nothing.

364
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:30,180
By chance, have you seen Dr. Park?

365
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,660
I don't know.

366
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:34,100
His phone is even continuously busy.  Where did he go?

367
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:38,600
Chang Yi, if you see Dr. Park tell him to call me.

368
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,490
Dr. Han!

369
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:02,860
Dr. Keum.

370
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:08,000
Have you seen Dr. Park?

371
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,140
I... I'm not sure.

372
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,420
You worked hard today.

373
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,170
Yes...

374
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:20,020
Dr. Oh's face is bright.

375
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:26,300
Never mind that. You stood as First because of me,

376
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,990
so what are you going to do?

377
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:31,060
What do you mean, what I am going to do?

378
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:40,660
First, request for a day off over the weekend.

379
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:45,830
After taking a day off, what are you going to do?

380
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:51,890
Don't worry. I will take care of everything.

381
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:02,720
 The number you have reached is not answering...

382
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:05,780
Dr. Park.

383
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,430
Yeah, have you seen Dr. Han?

384
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:11,050
I did see her near our ward...

385
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,910
Hey, are you busy?

386
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:15,470
- Why?
- I have something I want to say.

387
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,280
Later.

388
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:31,010
What am I going to do, Hyungnim?

389
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:34,400
Stop. Stop crying and just look for Hoon in a hurry.

390
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,050
What use is it to find him? Everything is done. You take the responsibility!

391
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:42,140
This happened because you recommended him.

392
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:46,650
What am I going to do? I can't fulfill my father's dying wish.

393
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:51,520
Aigoo, seriously.  What am I supposed to do? Really, dang it!

394
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,240
Aigoo, my life.

395
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,110
Where are you?

396
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:23,210
Listen to me carefully. Leave the hospital right now.

397
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:24,130
I am asking you where you are.

398
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,980
Didn't you hear what I said? I told you to leave the hospital immediately.

399
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,450
I am asking you where you are.

400
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,980
Jae Hee.

401
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,860
Stop.

402
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:33,730
It can't end like this.

403
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:43,080
Jae Hee.

404
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,200
I am telling you to stop.

405
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:51,030
There's still a chance.

406
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:36,100
  Code Blue. ICU code blue. (ICU = Intensive Care Unit)

407
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,780
  Code Blue, Code Blue, ICU Code Blue.

408
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,960
Even though there was nothing you could do,

409
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,940
you should have persuaded her well. Why did you let her go to the other team?

410
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,130
I am sorry, Chairman.

411
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,970
Comfort Soo Hyeon well.

412
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:26,330
She acts strong, but she's a soft-hearted person deep inside.

413
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:28,210
Yes.

414
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:31,170
Gosh, that daughter gives me a headache. Quickly take her,

415
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:33,560
so that I don't have to worry anymore.

416
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,960
  Code Blue, Code Blue, ICU Code Blue.

417
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,370
  Code Blue, Code Blue, ICU Code Blue.

418
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:58,120
What happened?

419
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,500
The BP suddenly dropped.

420
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,310
That's why I'm asking you what happened.

421
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:06,290
His pulmonary vascular resistance has dropped. He needs to undergo surgery again to reduce the flow through the shunt.

422
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:08,500
It can't be possible. I made sure.

423
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,090
You made sure, yet he's in shock?

424
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:11,770
Whose patient is he, huh?

425
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:13,260
The patient whom Chief Han operated on?

426
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,830
Right?

427
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:18,840
What is this?

428
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,360
What else? We have to do the surgery quickly.

429
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:25,410
Nurse Min, let's move him to the operating room.

430
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:26,080
Yes.

431
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,700
Stay still.

432
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:31,840
- Are you going to let the kid die like this?
- He is my patient!

433
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,920
I will do it.

434
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,680
I am sorry, Chief.

435
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,600
Move him to the operating room.

436
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:02,110
What is the matter?

437
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,230
What is this? Did we win?

438
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:10,850
Hooray!

439
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:12,550
Hooray!

440
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,130
Hooray!

441
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:21,610
Why, Hyung?

442
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:23,460
What do you think you're doing at the ICU?

443
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,620
It's because I am happy.

444
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:28,170
More importantly than that, we have to go meet Chairman, Hyung.

445
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,680
Chairman?

446
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,090
Chief Han finished earlier, but there's a problem now.

447
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:35,540
So we have to indisputably decide the winner and the loser.

448
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,630
The result isn't what's important.

449
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:40,040
The reason why I agreed to this surgery

450
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:44,280
was because I wanted Chief Han and Dr. Park to realize something as doctors.

451
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,840
Hyungnim, to me, the result is more important than my life.

452
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,780
Let's go quickly to meet Chairman.

453
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,740
  Operating surgeon: Han Jae Joon.

454
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,350
Cut.

455
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:09,360
I'll finish up, Chief.

456
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,770
I will do it, so you go out first.

457
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:26,090
Forceps.

458
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:29,360
Needle holder.

459
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:46,630
What happened?

460
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:47,750
Get out.

461
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:48,550
Jae Joon.

462
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:50,100
GET OUT!

463
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,990
Yes! We won.

464
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:41,800
We won. Oh yay!

465
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:45,590
That bastard, Han Jae Joon. It's game over!

466
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:48,030
Oh you punk, stop.

467
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:51,640
Turn around.

468
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:56,860
Chief!

469
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:58,540
Nim? (honorific)

470
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:08,550
- As you go down, "To the branch office"
- To the branch office...

471
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:11,810
As you come up, "Han Jae Joon is going."

472
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:13,360
Han Jae Joon is going.

473
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,940
Repeat.

474
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:17,850
To the branch office, Han Jae Joon is going.

475
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:19,030
Be automatic!

476
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:22,420
To the branch office, Han Jae Joon is going.

477
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:26,470
To the branch office, Han Jae Joon is going.
Ouch, that hurts.

478
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,460
Chief, should... should I go? To the branch office?

479
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:29,860
Do it quickly!

480
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:35,400
Gosh. To the branch office, Han Jae Joon is going. To the branch office,

481
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,940
- Do it properly. Okay? 
- Han Jae Joon is going.

482
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,630
Look at the speed.

483
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:44,370
To the branch office, Han Jae Joon is going.

484
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:48,440
To the branch office, Han Jae Joon is going.

485
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,700
Han Jae Joon lost?

486
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:57,950
Yes, the kid that Chief Han operated on almost died.

487
00:48:57,950 --> 00:49:00,680
Stupid punk.

488
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:09,520
Then is it the Park Hook card again?

489
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,060
Gosh.

490
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:31,130

491
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:53,640
Park Hoon won.

492
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,340
I know.

493
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:57,940
Comrade, because of your rash action, our mission could have been ruined.

494
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:00,790
My rash action?

495
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:04,000
You could have killed Park Hoon.

496
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,860
You, without fearing (of failing our mission), told him to run away!

497
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:10,940
You should stop your rash acts.

498
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:15,800
I am always watching you.

499
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:22,300
I'm the one who will decide both whether he lives or dies.

500
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:26,520
That's for you, too.

501
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,320
Han Seung Hee.

502
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:35,840
Where are you going?

503
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,290
  The person you dialed....

504
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:43,400
How did the surgery go?

505
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,910
It went well.

506
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:46,950
Have you seen Dr. Han?

507
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:49,350
She probably has gotten off from work.

508
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:34,440
Park Hoon! Where are you going?

509
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,410
If we won, we should celebrate.

510
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:38,490
Do it yourself.

511
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:41,650
Hoon, I love you.

512
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:45,770
I love you. Hey!

513
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:49,280
I love youuuu!

514
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,910
 Garibong Clinic

515
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:31,400
  Hoon!

516
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,350
  Hoon.

517
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:54,780
Hoon.

518
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:08,790
Hoon.

519
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:38,560
â¬  When today passes as our eyes close   â¬

520
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:45,230
â¬  As if without a more ideal tomorrow.  â¬

521
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:49,470
â¬  I will fill every moment with memories   â¬

522
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:56,020
â¬  Instead of with tears.  â¬

523
00:55:56,020 --> 00:56:03,180
â¬   I love you like a tomorrow which may not come.  â¬

524
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:09,970
â¬   I love you as if I may not see you again.  â¬

525
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:14,020
â¬  Day by day   â¬

526
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:15,780
  Hoon.  
â¬  I  grow healthy tissue  â¬

527
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:20,820
â¬    with love instead of scars.  â¬

528
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:25,780
Stop watching this. I am here.

529
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:28,260
Okay. Sorry.

530
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:51,430
â¬   Like the sun which comes through the window late in the morning waking me  â¬

531
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:58,350
â¬  You gently approach.  â¬

532
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:05,100
â¬  When I open my eyes, I wonder whether it is a dream.
I wonder whether I am allowed to feel this joy.  â¬

533
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:11,250
â¬  I ask myself over and over.   â¬

534
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:21,900
â¬   I love you like a tomorrow which may not come.  â¬

535
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:25,400
It tastes really good with seaweed.
â¬   I love you as if I may not see you again.  â¬

536
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:27,710
Let's see.

537
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:32,870
â¬   Day by day for me   â¬

538
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:37,660
â¬  I grow healthy tissue with love instead of scars.  â¬

539
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:39,090
It is delicious.

540
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:40,870
Was it delicious?

541
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:51,290

542
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,800
Is it delicious?

543
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,470
Jae Hee.

544
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:20,390
â¬  When today passes, like closing our eyes.   â¬

545
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:24,620
â¬  Like being without a more perfect tomorrow.  â¬

546
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:27,000
Jae Hee.

547
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,400
Jae Hee.
â¬  I will fill each moment  of my day   â¬

548
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:37,800
â¬  With memories instead of tears.  â¬

549
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,500
â¬   I will love like a tomorrow which may not come.  â¬
