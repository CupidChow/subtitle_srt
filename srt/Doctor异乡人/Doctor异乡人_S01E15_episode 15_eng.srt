1
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:27,800

2
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,190
But what should I do?

3
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,980
I want to win this competition now.

4
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:39,490
Regardless of which operating room it is, I won't let you go in by yourself.

5
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,330
Has the surgery begun yet?

6
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,970
Yes, it has.

7
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,390
I will do the SAVER surgery.

8
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,870
If we do the surgery without the guardian's consent,

9
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:02,350
there's nothing we can do after.

10
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,370
The blood pressure is dropping.

11
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,530
Let's do it.

12
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,010
Please prepare the sternum saw.

13
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:08,810
Doctor Park.

14
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,580
If we leave the operating room like this, the patient will die.

15
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,720
You need to have the guardian's consent in order for you to do the surgery.

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,710
What consent will you get after he dies?

17
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,300
What are you doing?

18
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,700
Be prepared for shock.

19
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,710
If you see bleeding anywhere else, tell me immediately.

20
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,860
Okay. Then we will begin the SAVER surgery from now on.

21
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,470
Scalpel.

22
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,700
Will it be between these 2 people?

23
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,360
Yes, they are the doctors who are competing at Myeongwoo.

24
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,480
This the deciding round?

25
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes, that's correct.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,620
Then how will one win?

27
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,440
First of all, since it is a heart surgery,

28
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,410
after the surgery, the heart needs to beat again.

29
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,070
It's good that it's simple.

30
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,770
Saw.

31
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,520
  Episode 15

32
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,300
Oh it's so gross.

33
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,290
That's right.

34
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,330
The path of a doctor is

35
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,390
this gross and scary. That's why it's so hard on me.

36
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,270
Unni!

37
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,730
Don't just stand there, do you want to see your hyung's surgery?

38
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,970
- Hyung's? 
 - Yes.

39
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,600
This is a very important surgery to decide whether or not the doctor can be on the Prime Minister's surgery team or not.

40
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,140
Also, this is your hyung.

41
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,930
On the leeeft!

42
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,970
Which one is it?

43
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,120
That one.

44
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,700
Bovie.

45
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,640
Please prepare the saw.

46
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,330
Nurse Min.

47
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,840
Give it to me please.

48
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,660
Doctor Park, please check that saw again.

49
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,020
I don't have time.

50
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,390
Please stop it for a moment.

51
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,600
Doctor Park!

52
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,820
What happened?

53
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,450
I think the saw blade leaped out of the way.

54
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,300
What?

55
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,330
That kind of thing happens sometimes.

56
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,080
- Doctor Park. 
 - Be quiet.

57
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,370
The glove.  Please prepare a different one for me.

58
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,170
How about the patient's vitals?

59
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,520
The blood pressure is unstable but more than that...

60
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,950
Just pay attention to the vitals.

61
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:09,870
Let's start again after stitching. Please get me a needle and suture.

62
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,700
Please come to this side.

63
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,130
Please get out from the operating room.

64
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,560
Please get out now!

65
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,470
Nurse Min.

66
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,840
Can't you hear me telling you to get out?

67
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,400
What are you doing now?

68
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,020
If you have something to say, say it after we are done with the surgery.

69
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,780
I am telling you to get out, Seung Min's dad!

70
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,550
You don't have the right to be here.

71
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,650
Please leave quickly.

72
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,030
What's wrong over there?

73
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,450
Is something going on?

74
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,990
It seems Dr. Park is hurt...

75
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,660
I heard he got hurt from the blade of the bone saw.

76
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,100
How much?

77
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,070
This much.

78
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,510
Then how can he perform a surgery?

79
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,630
It is a big problem, over there.

80
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,600
Omo, why is Dr. Yang leaving?

81
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,260
I am sorry.

82
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,800
- I think Dr. Yang...
 - Later.

83
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,660
Please call another doctor for me.

84
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,730
All other staff doctors are in the middle of surgeries.

85
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,470
Dr. Yang can't.

86
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,620
Ring the next room.

87
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,010
It is from Room  #2.

88
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,730
What is it?

89
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:53,510
Let me borrow one of your doctors.

90
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,780
Please call Doctor Yang again.

91
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,460
Due to some circumstances,  let me just borrow one person.

92
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,940
I'll send

93
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,440
Kim Chi Gyu.

94
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,550
Bovie.

95
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,910
Jae Joon.

96
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,800
Do it properly.

97
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,280
It's too much for Chi Gyu to be First.

98
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,160
What about the donor's heart?

99
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,350
It will arrive soon.

100
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,750
Hello.

101
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,980
Yes.

102
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,770
I understand. Yes.

103
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,350
Move, move, move!

104
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,270
Stand by.

105
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,150
I will go to the next room.

106
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,060
I've already called Chi Gyu.

107
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,360
Jae Joon.

108
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,100
Why are you like this?

109
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,060
What is?

110
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,190
I said I'll go because Chi Gyu isn't ready yet.

111
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,890
Is that really the only reason

112
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,300
why you want to go to the next room?

113
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,500
Don't go.

114
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,950
It's just your curiosity.

115
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,830
It's just temporary being attracted to something new.

116
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,970
Do you really think that's it?

117
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,160
Did you call me?

118
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,560
- Go to the next room. 
 - Yes.

119
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,140
No.

120
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,670
- Stay here. 
 - Pardon?

121
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,720
Dr. Oh.

122
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,840
Why is it you, Quack, out of all people?

123
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,600
Shut up.

124
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,170
Getting hurt like an idiot.

125
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,440
That's my place.

126
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,620
Are you telling me to perform?  Did you hurt your hand that badly?

127
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,240
Aigoo, stop talking nonsense and come here.

128
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,600
What the?

129
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,400
You're going to do the surgery with your left hand?

130
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,190
Go to the back.

131
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:09,500
What is that? Is Water Bottle planning on doing it with his left hand?

132
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,240
Shut up and just watch.

133
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,270
Okay, let's start. Scalpel.

134
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,220
Wow, that ghost.

135
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,330
But can he do it with his left hand like that?

136
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,290
He's doing it.

137
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,780
It won't be easy.

138
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:42,430
Wait, is it possible to do it with  just your left hand?

139
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,900
It's strange.

140
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,760
Wow, Chief Han is doing well, as expected.

141
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,170
Needle holder.

142
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,190
Cut.

143
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,650
ACC off.
 (Aorta Cross Clamping)

144
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,150
Paddle.

145
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,440
Charge 50 joules.

146
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,610
It's charged.

147
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,380
Shock.

148
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,040
Cut.

149
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,380
ACC off.

150
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,840
Charge 50 joules.

151
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,930
It's charged.

152
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,870
Shock.

153
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,970
Charge 70 joules.

154
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,640
Shock.

155
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,340
70 joules once more!

156
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,100
Shock.

157
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,900
Charge 70 joules again.

158
00:14:53,850 --> 00:15:01,010

159
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:15,090
♬  Will someone please tell me  ♬

160
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:20,140
♬  where is this place ?  ♬

161
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:26,000
♬  Where I don't see anywhere to lean on   ♬

162
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,790
♬  Every time I open my eyes, I don't see any light  ♬

163
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:38,080
♬  I take a step with much difficulty  ♬

164
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,500
♬  Using any means, I'm trying to live.  ♬

165
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,210
What happened?

166
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,800
They succeeded.

167
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,780
Really?
♬  Difficultly, I take a step  ♬

168
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,320
♬  Walk on without stopping.  ♬

169
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,360
That's good.
♬  Walk on without stopping.  ♬

172
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,690
Yeah!

173
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,480
It's a success, Doctor Park.

174
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,820
You worked hard, Doctor Park.

175
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,200
You worked hard too, Nurse Min!

176
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,030
What are you doing, Doctor Park?

177
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,540
Oh, I'm sorry.  You suffered a lot.

178
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,300
Thank you.

You did well.

181
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:01,580

184
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:12,030
What's wrong? I said you worked hard.
♬  As you love, you will wait at the end of this road.  ♬

185
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,390
You've worked hard.
♬  Wait for me a little bit  ♬

186
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,860
I'm going to see the guardians.

187
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:21,500
Okay.

188
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,350

190
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,510
♬  Just wait for me a while.  ♬

191
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,180
The surgery went well.

192
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,410
But because his condition before was so bad,

193
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,190
the induced coma period may be a bit long.

194
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,290
What do you mean, induced coma?

195
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:52,820
Until the heart returns to normal function, we have to put him on the ventilator.

196
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,410
We're intentionally putting him to sleep.

197
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,630
Then, when will he wake up?

198
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:01,380
We'll have to do it for about 4 days for it to be good for the patient.

199
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:06,000
By chance, it's not because something went wrong with the surgery, right?

200
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,260
We did our best. So feel rest assured and please wait.

201
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,690
Thank you.

202
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:21,290
Doctor Park.

203
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,530
Can you take a look at our patient at the Intensive Care Unit?

204
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:25,670
I have something to say.

205
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,350
Oh, later. Have you not seen Nurse Min or Doctor Yang?

206
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,450
Doctor Park.

207
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,920
You worked hard today, okay?

208
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:36,750
Aigoo, I'm tired. Where could Nurse Min be?

209
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:46,020
Do you really know how much I've suffered?

210
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,610
What have you done?

211
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,530
Jung Han.

212
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,840
The patient we operated on today

213
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,180
almost died because he didn't have money to pay for surgery.

214
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,620
Even so, he got the surgery.

215
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,390
Yes, because of Park Hoon.

216
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,630
However, there is only one Park Hoon in this world.

217
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:17,390
There's no Park Hoon to help us whenever we need it.

218
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,390
In order to protect ourselves we need power, we need money.

219
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:23,790
Is that why you did such a thing in the operating room?

220
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,920
Yes, because of family.

221
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,360
Not because of money?

222
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,280
What's the difference?

223
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,200
Then, is it the same?

224
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,750
We can't depend  on luck for our family.

225
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,350
The thing our family needs isn't money,

226
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,400
it's an honorable husband and father.

227
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,900
Don't you get it?

228
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,000
For how long are we going to live like this?

229
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,770
For how long at the bottom...

230
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,240
Apologize.

231
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,010
I'm sorry, Soo Ji.

232
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:57,650
Not to me, but to Doctor Park.

233
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,590
I hate that person.

234
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,500
Why?

235
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,280
Answer me, why?

236
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,890
I just hate him. Because he's too good.

237
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:13,870
Doctor Yang! Doctor Yang!

238
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,830
What is it? Did you perhaps hear everything?

239
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:22,250
When you speak so loudly, how can I not hear you?

240
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,710
I'm sorry.

241
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:32,270
Don't worry, I forgot already because I have a bad memory.

242
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,990
Thank you, even so from now on

243
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,670
don't eavesdrop on other people's conversation.

244
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,370
You got it?

245
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,790
Doctor, his blood pressure keeps on dropping.

246
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,440
Increase the Norepinephrine.

247
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,480
But Doctor, will this patient be okay?

248
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,630
These are symptoms that can be displayed after major surgery so don't make a fuss.

249
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,480
The patient's guardians are watching.

250
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:16,040
I'm saying to not create needless worry when it was a surgery which is difficult to succeed at.

251
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,820
Yes.

252
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,130
Yes, I got it.

253
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,750
The said that induced coma will take awhile but the patient is fine.

254
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,980
What should we do?

255
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,310
We have to find a solution.

256
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:57,100
Um, can we talk for a little?

257
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,780
A surgery method that's dead (no longer used)?

258
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:08,150
So, he originally said he will install VAD  and got a consent form from you, right?

259
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:12,260
Yes, he said it's a really expensive thing but he said he'd do it for free.

260
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:17,210
But instead of doing that, he performed a really strange surgery so that's why your husband is still like that!

261
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:22,240
But the Doctor said that he finished the surgery well.

262
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,520
Have you ever seen a doctor who says that a surgery went badly?

263
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,430
And, truthfully, that person even killed a person during a surgery.

264
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,910
He was trying to show off his skills and just like that-

265
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:39,110
Didn't that person graduate from Myeongwoo University?

266
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:42,350
If he graduated from there, his skills would...

267
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,580
How could you say something so disappointing?

268
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,770
That guy is from North Korea.

269
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:48,510
North Korea?

270
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:51,680
Yes. He graduated from Pyongyang Medical School.

271
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,630
I wasn't going to say this,

272
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,720
but that person killed a person before,

273
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,270
and he did a strange surgery to redeem himself this time.

274
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,690
They both succeeded with the surgeries, Chairman.

275
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,840
Truthfully, compared to a heart transplant,

276
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,730
SAVER is a much more difficult surgery. Don't you agree, Chairman?

277
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,180
You don't, for no reason, say that it's a dead surgery.

278
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,010
Isn't that so?

279
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:28,960
Yes. I acknowledge that it's a difficult surgery.

280
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,220
However, just because the surgery is over, doesn't mean that the competition is.

281
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:33,830
What?

282
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,090
Both patients are in induced comas.

283
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:40,050
Success or failure can be decided after those two patents  wake up.

284
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:49,640
That patient will definitely wake up, without any problems, right?

285
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,760
Ah, I already told you.

286
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,790
So go back and get at least a confirmation document.

287
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,700
What confirmation document?

288
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,910
My surgery was more complicated and prognosis is better.

289
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,210
So,

290
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:06,280
I'm saying to get a confirmation document such as if the patient wakes up, we win!

291
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,490
I have to see Doctor Park!  Let me go.

292
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:14,050
- You can't go in!
- I have to meet Dr. Park Hoon! I must really meet  Doctor Park Hoon!

293
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,240
Don't do that.

294
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,350
SAVER. That's a surgery that none of the other doctors do.

295
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:25,410
However, that was the only option for your husband. 
Also, the surgery went well-

296
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,800
Well? What went well?

297
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,640
He still hasn't woken up!

298
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,430
Like I said earlier for the sake of treatment...

299
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,420
Don't lie to me.

300
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,320
Why lie?

301
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,860
I heard you even killed a person during a surgery.

302
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,180
And I heard that  you're not even a graduate from Myeongwoo University,

303
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,460
but you're from North Korea!

304
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:47,860
A person like that did a surgery that I've never heard of in my life and

305
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:51,130
did it even without our permission!

306
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:54,190
I'm really sorry that we were unable to get your permission before the surgery.   However...

307
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,740
I don't need any of it!

308
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,520
If the surgery really has succeeded as you say,

309
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,040
wake my husband up immediately.

310
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,110
That will be difficult.

311
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,540
That's because the surgery didn't go well!

312
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:10,320
Will you really come to your senses only if I sue you for murder!

313
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:18,530
Lowering of blood pressure or arrhythmia are common symptoms after a heart surgery, isn't it?

314
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,650
No matter how much I explained, it was of no use.

315
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,680
Well, we're going to have to explain until she understands.

316
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,870
How about waking him briefly?  At least so we won't be pestered by the guardian.

317
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:35,670
Are you suggesting to do something clearly harmful to the patient because we were criticized?

318
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:39,190
In any case, it's all over once the patient wakes up.

319
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:43,910
When we just need to endure it for a bit, we can't do something harmful to the patient because we can't endure that.

320
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,480
If we don't show them that the surgery ended successfully,

321
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,020
doing the surgery without getting the consent can become a serious matter.

322
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,420
A serious matter?

323
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,490
A disciplinary committee procedure can open.

324
00:25:56,290 --> 00:26:00,170
It's okay. Because the patient will definitely wake up healthy.

325
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:04,580
Then we've also won the competition. So don't worry too much.

326
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,260
Okay.

327
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,000
Instead, stay put.

328
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,350
Even if someone asks to wake him, you cannot do it without my permission.

329
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:27,630

330
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,500
Don't you have anything to say to me?

331
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:49,410
For leaving the operating room,

332
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,480
I'm sorry.

333
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,690
Not that.

334
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,220
Park Hoon

335
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,750
doesn't suit you.

336
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,190
Why?

337
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,920
Are you asking because you don't know?

338
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,580
He already has someone else.

339
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,660
That's right. Ms. Jae Hee.

340
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,290
You'll only be left hurt.

341
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:11,030
He may not even be able to find her.

342
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,710
She's not in front of his eyes, but she's in his heart.

343
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,180
Whether he finds her or not isn't important.

344
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,710
- I know that too!
- Soo Hyeon...

345
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,280
I know...

346
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,630
I know that, but I'm still like this.

347
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,760
That Doctor Park only has Jae Hee in his heart, I know that...

348
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,010
What am I supposed to do when I like him?

349
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:30,110
I thought it was curiosity at first.

350
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:32,660
I thought I would get sick of him really soon.

351
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,620
That's why I tried to forget him, but I can't do that...

352
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,130
The more I try to forget about him, the more I think of him,

353
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,730
and the tears keep flowing out.

354
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,650
I'm sorry.

355
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,410
I...

356
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,550
I don't want to hurt you anymore.

357
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,000
Really.

358
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,750
Don't go.

359
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,050
Just let me go now.

360
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,980
You'll forget me soon.

361
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:16,440
I'm begging you.

362
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,910
Stop, stop, stop.

363
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,500
Do you know what this is?

364
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,900
I don't know, so can you get lost?

365
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,070
Don't be like that. This is a BIS.

366
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:57,810
You know how Water Bottle went against my hyungnim in the surgery competition?

367
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:01,270
This will determine who wins.

368
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,110
How?

369
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:07,980
With this they check if they get back consciousness or not.

370
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,230
If the number goes up then it means they're gaining their consciousness.

371
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:16,230
The most important function of this machine is hidden.

372
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:19,720
You stick it on forehead for a bit

373
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:27,790
and you check if we have things in common.

374
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:32,740
Then you must know what I'm thinking then.

375
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:51,490
Chief Han, aren't you waking her up too early?

376
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,210
I'm waking her up because it's time.

377
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,820
- Mom!
- Honey!

378
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:13,020
- Mom!
- Honey!
- Dad, Mom opened her eyes.

379
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:18,440
Doctor, thank you. Thank you so much!

380
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,180
Honey!

381
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:26,480
Patient, if you can hear me, try to blink.

382
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,420
Why isn't our patient waking up?

383
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,220
Today and tomorrow is important, so watch carefully.

384
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:48,920
Let's step outside. I'll explain in detail.

385
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,520
Okay! Tell me.

386
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,580
When that person woke up like that, what's wrong with my husband?

387
00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:00,710
Since the patient's condition before the surgery wasn't  good, the treatment is taking longer.

388
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,970
Then exactly when is he waking up?

389
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,190
Please tell me certainly.

390
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:08,190
We are being careful because if we hurry in rash,  there may be some complications.

391
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:11,380
We are all doing our best so please just wait a couple more days.

392
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,910
So how many more days?

393
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,420
Perhaps are you doing this to get rid of the evidence

394
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:20,790
that you guys did wrong without us knowing?

395
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:23,330
It's nothing like that. If you wait a little longer-

396
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:28,070
I don't need it! Wake my children's father right now. Right now!

397
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,980
A 45 years old male patient showed signs of cardiac infarction so I progressed with additional tests.

398
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,900
According to the tests, I had found abnormalities in the mitral valve and left ventricle.

399
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,510
I planned to do a VAD surgery, but

400
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:49,730
because he had coagulopathy, following the lead surgeon's judgement, we proceeded with SAVER surgery.

401
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:54,090
Why did you do the SAVER surgery that is "dead" (no longer used)?

402
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,770
What an ignorant thing to say.

403
00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:00,580
It's just that the level of difficulty is high and it's complicated, but it's a surgery that's still being done.

404
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:07,110
In this patient's case, the area of ventricular aneurysm was over 40% so it was difficult but the surgery was a success.

405
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:09,770
How can you be so certain?

406
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:12,190
Because I've done it a lot.

407
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,690
Where?

408
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,180
In North Korea?

409
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,750
Yes.

410
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:28,330
Those patients... did they all live?

411
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,090
Did they all live?

412
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:34,060
No.

413
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,670
Then this case too, he could die.

414
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,640
You performed a surgery that could lead to death at your own will.  Am I correct?

415
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,650
Have all the patients you've performed surgery on lived?

416
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,910
I asked if they all lived.

417
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:59,630
The saying goes, a thoracic surgeon's experience is equivalent to the number of dead in the operating room.

418
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,840
To make that death not in vain,

419
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,550
isn't that why we agonizingly worry and earnestly practice?

420
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,670
Because we can't kill them next time.

421
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:10,830
This time we have to save them no matter what.

422
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:15,580
Because that's the only way to ask for forgiveness from the patient I killed.

423
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:22,440
The surgery's patient was a success. All the patients I've killed certainly will forgive me.

424
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,750
If I didn't even try because I was scared that the patient would die, then I would never be forgiven.

425
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,430
Those are touching words.

426
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:36,450
But isn't it too soon to receive forgiveness?

427
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:39,530
The patient needs to wake up in order for you to be forgiven.

428
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:41,930
I'm letting him sleep to recover his condition.

429
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:44,650
Are you not waking him or can't wake him?

430
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:45,570
What does that mean?

431
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:49,720
Aren't you intentionally not waking him to hide the fact that you failed the surgery?

432
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,230
I said no.

433
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:56,580
It's suspicious that you're inducing coma for this long.

434
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,970
I'm going to wake the patient in two days.

435
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,020
What if he doesn't wake up?

436
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,040
There's no way. The patient will definitely wake up.

437
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:07,100
That must happen. Otherwise the problem won't be being eliminated from Prime Minister's surgical team,

438
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,120
but you'll become a murderer.

439
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,380
You performed surgery without the guardian's consent form, right?

440
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:20,100
Performing surgery without the consent form is clearly my fault.

441
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,580
I'll follow the hospital's rules for disciplinary actions regarding that.

442
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:25,240
Disciplinary action isn't the problem.

443
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,330
The guardian says she's going to sue you for murder. What are you going to do?

444
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:31,090
That's something that'll all be solved once the patient wakes up.

445
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:35,160
Have you told the guardian that it was a SAVER surgery?

446
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,850
- I couldn't.
- Isn't it that you intentionally didn't, not couldn't?

447
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,430
- No. 
- If it's not, then why did you perform the surgery without notifying her first?

448
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:46,100
I judged it as an emergency situation.

449
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,790
What emergency situation?

450
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:52,200
By chance, are you talking about coagulopathy?

451
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,750
Yes.

452
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:59,850
Dr. Yang, when did Dr. Park find out about the patient's coagulopathy?

453
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:02,230
I told him before the incision.

454
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:08,390
Strictly speaking the surgery hadn't started yet, and there was enough time and opportunity to explain to the guardian.

455
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:12,180
But you progressed the surgery dogmatically. Correct?

456
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:15,020
I judged that it would be best for the surgery to be performed right away in order to maintain the patient's condition.

457
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:18,040
Since the patient's condition was like that, shouldn't you have all the more stopped the surgery?

458
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,260
If he would just pull through the surgery then the patient's condition-

459
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:25,490
Don't make excuses. The patient was not in a state to handle a surgery!

460
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,310
I thought I needed to save the patient.

461
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,670
That again?

462
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,940
You needed to save the patient?

463
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,230
Please stop acting like you're the only doctor and that you're the only one who cares for the patient.

464
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:43,660
-Chief Han.
-Do you think the other doctors get the consent forms each and every time because they don't have those thoughts?

465
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:46,600
Consent form is the very least mechanism to protect the patient.

466
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,250
You ignored that, yet you still want to save the patient.

467
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,540
Can you say that you care for the patient?

468
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,210
I'll apologize to the guardian-

469
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:59,330
Apologize? You didn't even tell her what kind of surgery you're doing, and didn't even get the consent form.

470
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:03,230
When the patient who received the surgery isn't even waking up, what kind of guardian would accept that apology?

471
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:06,660
- The patient will wake up.
- Wake him up right now!

472
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:11,060
Wake him up and prove to the guardian that there is nothing wrong with the patient.

473
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:20,690

474
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,990
What is it?

475
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:28,400
He performed the surgery without consent?

476
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,480
- It must be like that in North Korea.
- Isn't he crazy?

477
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,210
Is surgery a joke?

478
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,330
Did you guys see?

479
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:39,250
I'm asking if you people saw him do that intentionally! If you don't know, then stay still.

480
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:42,190
Why do you talk thoughtlessly when you don't even know anything?

481
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,340
 The patient will definitely wake up.

482
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,680
 He must.

483
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,720
 Otherwise the problem won't be being eliminated from the Prime Minister's surgical team. You'll become a murderer.

484
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,370
 The guardian says she's going to sue you for murder. What are you going to do?

485
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:09,560
 Wake him immediately. Wake him and prove to the guardian

486
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,060
 that there is nothing wrong with the patient.

487
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:28,650
You must not wake him.

488
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:31,430
Just two days. Please wait just two days.

489
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,170
It's not something for me to decide.

490
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:37,150
The only condition for the competition was to succeed in the surgery. There was nothing about until when.

491
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:41,560
We don't know if you're deceiving us after you've failed.

492
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,140
You know that's not true.

493
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,770
I'm not sure.

494
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:51,020
I thought that maybe you and I could be good friends.

495
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:57,930
Although we're competing right now, I thought that after the competition we could.

496
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:00,020
But I was mistaken.

497
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:04,990
That will never happen.

498
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:10,250
 Code Blue, Code Blue. Thoracic department ICU.

499
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,840
200 joules.

500
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,070
What happened?

501
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,840
One more time. Shock.

502
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,940
One more time. Shock.

503
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:41,140
When I was trying to wake the patient, suddenly an arrest happened.

504
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,010
What's wrong with him?

505
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:46,990
Did you guys really do something wrong?

506
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:50,230
This is something that happens often after heart surgery. You don't have to worry.

507
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:54,710
How can I not worry? I came to watch because you said you'd wake him up but his heart stopped!

508
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:58,550
After a major surgery, arterial fibrillation is something that could happen.

509
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,400
We are also prepared for it.

510
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,640
Won't you stay still?

511
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,020
What do you mean stay still. Did I say something wrong?

512
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,490
Please take care of the patient briefly.

513
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,840
Even after that you call yourself a doctor?

514
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,760
- You almost killed the patient.
- I only did that because I believed you.

515
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,890
If you believed, you should've waited.

516
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:25,520
The surgery succeeded, and I confirmed that with my eyes.

517
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,710
So?

518
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,900
I thought it would be okay to wake him.

519
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,360
Why? On your on will, why?!

520
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,170
Because if we don't wake him up, you'd get kicked out of the hospital!

521
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:36,920
What does me getting kicked out of the hospital have to do with you?  What are you?

522
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,980
Because...

523
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,560
I like you.

524
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,460
Because I like you,

525
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:57,090
I wanted to block you from getting kicked out of the hospital. Satisfied?

526
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:05,280
Don't tell me to not like you. If it worked like I wanted it to, it wouldn't have even come this far.

527
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,750
Is it because of Jae Hee?

528
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,950
Your father, Oh Joon Gyu,

529
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:23,680
sent my father, Park Chul, to North Korea.

530
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,520
He conspired together with Jang Seok Joo and sent my father to North Korea.

531
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,640
What are you saying?

532
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,020
For  the reason he was going to stand as a witness for the medical lawsuit against  Myeongwoo Hospital,

533
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:36,700
your father is a person who sent my father to North Korea.

534
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:43,660
If you know now, come to your senses.

535
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,570
Is it true?

536
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:19,610
What are you saying?

537
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,440
Did you

538
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,790
really send Doctor Park's father to North Korea?

539
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:28,030
Am I correct?

540
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,230
Did he tell you that?

541
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:32,160
Answer me! Is it correct?

542
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,290
Yes. You're right.

543
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,290
How?

544
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,350
How could you do that scary kind of thing?

545
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:46,210
How?

546
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:48,910
That guy tried to ruin my Myeongwoo.

547
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:51,880
Why did you do that? Why?

548
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,620
I did what I had to in order to protect Myeongwoo.

549
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,400
Father.

550
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,150
So don't be close with Park Hoon.

551
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,610
How can I see Doctor Park's face now?

552
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,240
How can I see him?

553
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,730
You can just not see him!

554
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:11,700
When I feel like I can't endure it if I don't see him, how can I not see him?

555
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,620
Why did you come here without contacting us?

556
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:36,960
I was curious because I heard that the competition is finished,  but the winner was not decided.

557
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,680
Doctor Park's patient hasn't waken up yet.

558
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,220
Did your patient wake up?

559
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,700
Yes.

560
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:48,350
Fine. How about you do it like this?

561
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:52,940
If you wake up the patient and if the patient is fine then it's  tied.

562
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,890
If you can't wake him up, Doctor Park loses.

563
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:58,910
How does that sound?

564
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,100
That's good, Prime Minister.

565
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:15,720
What are you going to do? If you can't wake him up now, it's a forfeit.

566
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:20,350
You can't wake him up now. Because of the arrest yesterday, it might take a few more days to wake him up.

567
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:23,170
I think it'll be okay somehow.

568
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,660
Since the night of  the surgery, the patient's vitals were stable.

569
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:35,160
I checked every two hours after the arrest yesterday. The vitals are continually stable.

570
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,510
It's done.

571
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:40,700
Then, I'm telling them that you'll wake him up. Don't change your minds.

572
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,150
I'm not sure if we should wake him yet.

573
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:50,780
Let's try waking him up. My judgment is okay.

574
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,600
Is it because you want to win?

575
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,720
No... Because I believe in you.

576
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,260
He'll wake up for sure since we succeeded in the surgery.

577
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:20,800

578
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,080
I think we know who won.

579
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:58,170
Patient!

580
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:08,520
Patient, are you coming to your senses?

581
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,090
Honey...

582
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:31,740
It's me.

583
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:34,230
Do you recognize me?

584
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,610
My wife...

585
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,110
Yes, it's me.

586
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:57,370
Your wife.

587
00:45:57,370 --> 00:46:00,130
Honey! Honey!

588
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:02,780
Honey!

589
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:06,480
Honey!

590
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:11,030
Honey!

591
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:39,820
Then... Is this a tie?

592
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:41,330
Yes, it is.

593
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:43,270
Then we must go into overtime (decisive competition).

594
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:45,630
Of course.

595
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:50,610
At the decisive competition, I hope there will be a final winner.

596
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:11,220
Prepare well for the decisive competition.

597
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,740
That's what I want to say.

598
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:21,130
Do you have a multi-personality disorder or something?

599
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:27,280
Seriously, what is the reason why you're suddenly being ferocious when you were fine before the surgery?

600
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:33,690
Ah, that felt good.

601
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:36,970
Why does it feel so good when he walks around with a frown?

602
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:40,090
It's because you are mean.

603
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:42,550
Are you on my side or his?

604
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:44,080
On my side.

605
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,390
Seriously.

606
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,950
Hyungnim.

607
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:03,300
Doctor Oh is absent today, so I am going to be your assistant for the surgery.

608
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:07,180
- Absent?
- Yes, she says she has the flu.

609
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,760
What time is the surgery?

610
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,910
5 o'clock.

611
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:56,650
This won't do.

612
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,150
Let's go to the hospital.

613
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:00,890
I'm fine.

614
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:03,200
Fine? How are you fine?

615
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,170
Your face is a mess.

616
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:05,740
I told you I'm fine.

617
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,720
Soo Hyeon.

618
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,890
I'm sorry, but

619
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:11,520
I want to be alone.

620
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,090
No.

621
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:14,340
What if you faint all of a sudden?

622
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:17,090
I just want to be alone, please.

623
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:23,950
Did Doctor Park say something because you woke the patient yesterday?

624
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,580
Why are you being like this?

625
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:33,020
Jae Joon...

626
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,640
You said that to me,

627
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,430
Doctor Park

628
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:45,240
is just a new and fresh handbag.

629
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:50,130
But...

630
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,280
But why am I like this?

631
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:02,130
♬  On a nice day like this, the day we broke up.  ♬

632
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:05,800
It really hurts.
♬  On a nice day like this, the day we broke up.  ♬

633
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:09,420
It hurts so bad.
♬  I tried to bear it but that didn’t work.  ♬

634
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:13,770
♬  I tried to bear it but that didn’t work.  ♬

635
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:18,510
♬  On a bright sunny day.   ♬

636
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:22,790
♬  On a good day like this.  ♬

637
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:26,840
What's wrong?  Tell me in details.

638
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,800
I told Dr. Park

639
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,080
that I like him.

640
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:35,700
What?

641
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,470
But he said we can never be together.

642
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:49,510
♬  I’m thinking of you.  ♬

643
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:56,550
♬  It shouldn’t be a secret. It should be easy to forget you like that.  ♬

644
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:59,610
It hurts so bad that I think I'm going to die.

645
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,000
What should I do?

646
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,300
♬  Without you it seems I can’t survive.  ♬

647
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:09,570
♬  I can neither eat nor sleep.  ♬

648
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:15,950
♬  I can neither laugh nor cry. That’s right.  ♬

649
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:23,950
♬  On a nice day like this, the day we broke up.  ♬

650
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:28,470
♬  I tried to smile, but it was no good.  ♬

651
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:34,940
♬  Even though I try to pretend I’m fine, I’m the same.  ♬

652
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:40,010
♬  Even though I try to pretend I’m fine, I’m the same.  ♬

653
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:41,720
Okay.

654
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,480
Cry.

655
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:47,020
Just cry in front of me.

656
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:50,260
♬  On a nice day like this, the day we broke up.  ♬

657
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:58,850
♬  I tried to bear it but that didn’t work.  ♬

658
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:03,630
♬  On a bright sunny day.  ♬

659
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:08,730
♬  On a good day like this.  ♬

660
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:19,810
Where did you go earlier, Hyung?

661
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:21,880
- Chi Gyu.
 - Yes, Hyung.

662
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,610
You know the princess who lives in the castle...

663
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:26,390
Princess? Oh that princess?

664
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:28,860
That princess likes another knight.

665
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:32,620
Oh, it is a love triangle.

666
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:38,160
But that princess got dumped after confessing to the knight.

667
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,390
I saw her cry.

668
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:45,020
Instead of getting angry,

669
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,500
my heart hurts.

670
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:54,850
That means you really love her.

671
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:56,940
Real love?

672
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:00,040
Yes. Even though you hate her to death,

673
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:03,640
on the other side, your heart hurts.

674
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:08,560
Now you can't swallow up the castle since you really fell in love with the princess.

675
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:21,210
Eat this at least. It's a porridge.

676
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:26,760
I am sorry. I can't eat anything now.

677
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:35,090
What is the matter?

678
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:44,030
I confessed to Dr. Park and got dumped.

679
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:53,620
My state is funny, isn't it?

680
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:56,090
Dr. Oh.

681
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:59,810
I am okay. You don't have to comfort me.

682
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,400
I am sorry.

683
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,430
Why would you be sorry, Dr. Han?

684
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:14,210
I am sorry, Dr. Oh.

685
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:16,960
Why are you like this?

686
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:20,440
It is okay.

687
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:49,920
I heard about Dr. Oh.

688
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,320
I told her about Chairman.  She must've been shocked.

689
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:58,200
I didn't want to hurt her like that.

690
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:06,110
My mother is doing well, right?

691
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:13,060
You said it was for one month, right?

692
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:20,430
Okay, I'll be patient. Instead take good care of her.

693
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:33,490
 Your father, Oh Joon Gyu, sent my father, Park Chul, to North Korea.

694
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:38,320
 Your father, Oh Joon Gyu, conspired with Jang Seok Joo and sent my father to North Korea.

695
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,850
 The reason your father sent my father to North Korea

696
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:44,380
 was that my father was going to be a witness against Myeongwoo in a medical malpractice lawsuit.

697
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:47,370
 Now that you know, get a hold of yourself.

698
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:49,780
 That guy tried to ruin my Myeongwoo.

699
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:53,590
 I did what I had to in order to save Myeongwoo.

700
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,640
 Jae Hee got a kidney transplant two years ago.

701
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,110
 A kidney transplant?

702
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:48,580

703
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:02,960
 Both of her kidneys were in such a bad condition, that she got a transplant for one of them.

704
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:24,330
 I am sorry, Doctor Oh.

705
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:39,200
