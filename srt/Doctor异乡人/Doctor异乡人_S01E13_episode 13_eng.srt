1
00:00:25,767 --> 00:00:30,067

2
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:36,227
- Did you find it?
- It's hard to see, Chief.

3
00:00:36,227 --> 00:00:37,627
Calm down.

4
00:00:37,627 --> 00:00:40,647
- But Chief...
- I said calm down!

5
00:00:42,687 --> 00:00:44,917
Keum Bong Hyun.

6
00:01:13,487 --> 00:01:15,697
Please take me in.

7
00:01:29,037 --> 00:01:31,447
Why do you have your heads lowered like people who've committed sins?

8
00:01:31,447 --> 00:01:34,707
There is nothing that you people have done wrong so lift your heads.

9
00:01:35,777 --> 00:01:39,947
The ones who should have their heads shoved down are up there.  Look.

10
00:01:54,307 --> 00:01:57,727
That's right, let's become confident.

11
00:01:57,727 --> 00:02:01,897
Because the only real doctors in this hospital are just you people.

12
00:02:12,947 --> 00:02:18,197
Okay, since our necks hurt, let's stop looking and let's hurriedly do it.

13
00:02:18,197 --> 00:02:19,907
Please find the area that's hemorrhaging first.

14
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:22,517
Because the hemorrhage is severe, we can't stop it.

15
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:27,447
Since we are in the middle of surgery, we can't do a CT scan or an ultrasound.

16
00:02:36,977 --> 00:02:42,807
♬ Because of this will, because of heart's will ♬

17
00:02:44,437 --> 00:02:46,437
Suction.

18
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:52,087
Needle holder.

19
00:02:54,487 --> 00:02:56,427
Forceps.

20
00:02:59,437 --> 00:03:03,577
I don't think there is a surgery Doctor Park Hoon can't do.

21
00:03:03,577 --> 00:03:07,387
What's the point?  It seems like they're all going to be fired now.

22
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,687
- What about the vitals?
- They're  good.

23
00:03:09,687 --> 00:03:12,327
I don't think we need to worry anymore.

24
00:03:12,327 --> 00:03:17,247
Of course, since we have a great First. Right?

25
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:21,057
♬ Just wait a bit longer ♬

26
00:03:21,057 --> 00:03:24,297
What are you doing here? Didn't you hear me say  to open a disciplinary committee  and to prepare for a lawsuit?

27
00:03:24,297 --> 00:03:27,177
Yes, I understand, Chairman.

28
00:03:31,187 --> 00:03:34,677
I can understand the disciplinary committee but what is this about a lawsuit, Hyungnim?

29
00:03:34,677 --> 00:03:38,327
 Episode 13 
This is a surgery that's revealing that the surgical procedure was done wrong.

30
00:03:38,327 --> 00:03:40,247
That's why we have to prepare for the lawsuit.

31
00:03:40,247 --> 00:03:43,597
Geez... Another problem that's going to be tiring.

32
00:03:43,597 --> 00:03:45,897
Hyungnim, can we convince the Cardiology Department,

33
00:03:45,897 --> 00:03:48,507
so that we can avoid the lawsuit?

34
00:03:48,507 --> 00:03:50,497
How can we persuade them?

35
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:56,197
Have you ever seen a doctor in this world that says, "I did wrong"?

36
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:58,477
I will finish it up.

37
00:03:58,477 --> 00:04:00,267
Yes, please.

38
00:04:00,267 --> 00:04:02,477
You've worked hard.

39
00:04:03,227 --> 00:04:06,207
You've worked hard.

40
00:04:37,837 --> 00:04:39,827
Jae Joon!

41
00:04:42,197 --> 00:04:44,387
I clearly warned you.

42
00:04:44,387 --> 00:04:47,967
If you do surgery on that patient, it's clearly over.

43
00:04:48,937 --> 00:04:50,277
I'm prepared for it.

44
00:04:50,277 --> 00:04:52,817
A sincere apology?

45
00:04:53,857 --> 00:04:59,187
Okay. Let's see if you can stop the medical malpractice lawsuit with that.

46
00:05:14,497 --> 00:05:16,827
Doctor.

47
00:05:16,827 --> 00:05:20,217
Don't worry, the surgery went well.

48
00:05:20,217 --> 00:05:22,627
Thank you, Doctor!

49
00:05:25,507 --> 00:05:29,297
I apologize instead of the hospital for making you worry.

50
00:05:29,297 --> 00:05:34,227
Why are you like this when you have no reason to apologize?

51
00:05:34,227 --> 00:05:36,977
If anyone should apologize, the cardiology department's doctors should.

52
00:05:36,977 --> 00:05:41,207
Are you going to pursue the lawsuit?

53
00:05:42,347 --> 00:05:44,267
I don't know.

54
00:05:45,877 --> 00:05:49,707
If you need anything, please contact me.

55
00:05:55,247 --> 00:05:59,817
Shouldn't we at least make plans when we're all about to be fired?

56
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,977
Didn't you see the laser coming out of Chairman's eyes?

57
00:06:02,977 --> 00:06:06,007
There won't be any use even if you make plans.

58
00:06:07,347 --> 00:06:10,287
Except for one person.

59
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:13,527
What are you doing, not moving the patient?

60
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:18,847
I will follow soon.

61
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,397
Doctor Keum!

62
00:06:25,207 --> 00:06:29,267
What is this?  This lonely and lonesome feeling.

63
00:06:41,637 --> 00:06:43,517
Are you worried that you'll be fired?

64
00:06:43,517 --> 00:06:45,807
- No!
- Then why?

65
00:06:45,807 --> 00:06:47,877
I am Chief's First,

66
00:06:47,877 --> 00:06:52,547
but I didn't do anything during the twin's surgery and today's surgery!

67
00:06:53,957 --> 00:06:57,927
It's my first time seeing Doctor Keum getting mad like this.

68
00:06:59,507 --> 00:07:01,617
Don't feel so distressed.

69
00:07:01,617 --> 00:07:07,327
Naturally, kids all make mistakes as they become adults.

70
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,627
Do I look like a kid to you?

71
00:07:09,627 --> 00:07:12,907
No, what I mean is...

72
00:07:12,907 --> 00:07:17,727
Somehow, Dr. Keum's innocent charm is...

73
00:07:38,087 --> 00:07:43,127
Stop treating me like a child now!

74
00:07:47,207 --> 00:07:49,177
I understand.

75
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:52,567
Then,

76
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,177
from now on,

77
00:07:58,097 --> 00:08:02,227
from now on... I will treat you like an adult.

78
00:08:06,307 --> 00:08:08,257
Mom!

79
00:08:11,547 --> 00:08:14,027
Your mom will get better.

80
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,937
Thank you, Doctor.

81
00:08:15,937 --> 00:08:19,537
I am a fake, but Doctor Oh here is the real one.

82
00:08:22,217 --> 00:08:23,437
Right?

83
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:27,167
Yeah, that's right.

84
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:29,857
I'll call you when your mom regains consciousness so wait a little bit.

85
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:32,107
Yes, Doctor.

86
00:08:32,107 --> 00:08:34,687
Thank you.

87
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:37,237
Doctor Oh?

88
00:08:38,887 --> 00:08:42,137
 Isolation Ward

89
00:08:57,147 --> 00:08:59,427
What are you looking so intently at?

90
00:08:59,427 --> 00:09:01,567
Did you say Doctor Oh?

91
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:04,777
- Did I say that?
- You said that in front of Jae Cheol earlier.

92
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,417
Well, I guess I briefly had a slip of the tongue.

93
00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:09,267
Come on, it wasn't a slip.

94
00:09:11,497 --> 00:09:13,017
Why are you like this?

95
00:09:13,017 --> 00:09:15,697
You said to become confident.

96
00:09:15,697 --> 00:09:18,277
That the only real doctors in this hospital are just us.

97
00:09:18,277 --> 00:09:22,057
That's why you called me Doctor Oh. Isn't that so?

98
00:09:22,057 --> 00:09:23,777
I didn't know the quack was in there.

99
00:09:23,777 --> 00:09:25,757
- Really?
- Of course.

100
00:09:25,757 --> 00:09:28,217
How can I know who is who when everyone is wearing a mask and has a surgeon's cap on.

101
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:30,097
You even talked to me.

102
00:09:30,097 --> 00:09:32,247
That was after the surgery had finished.

103
00:09:32,247 --> 00:09:34,387
Do you not like calling me Doctor Oh that much?

104
00:09:34,387 --> 00:09:36,647
Is that really that  important?

105
00:09:36,647 --> 00:09:40,637
That's why your hair keeps on falling off because you concern yourself with those things.

106
00:09:40,637 --> 00:09:44,487
Think about your own hair. What kind of hair is that for a doctor?

107
00:09:44,487 --> 00:09:47,257
- What about my hair?
- Trim it a bit.

108
00:09:47,257 --> 00:09:51,707
These days patients like tidy doctors, not weird perm-haired ones.

109
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:55,607
Stop talking nonsense and go put in a good word to your father.

110
00:09:55,607 --> 00:09:57,697
About what?

111
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:01,037
Won't everyone get fired because we did Jae Cheol's mom's surgery?

112
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:05,327
Seeing today, Chief Han seems like a decent guy.

113
00:10:05,327 --> 00:10:07,317
I don't know about the others, but

114
00:10:07,317 --> 00:10:10,107
ask him to do something for that person.

115
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:18,527
 Complaint

116
00:10:20,717 --> 00:10:22,687
I'm sorry,

117
00:10:23,387 --> 00:10:25,487
Father.

118
00:10:34,697 --> 00:10:37,297
The patient woke up.

119
00:10:39,227 --> 00:10:40,217
Okay.

120
00:10:40,217 --> 00:10:44,347
You're were really cool today,  you know that right?

121
00:10:44,347 --> 00:10:45,967
Thank you.

122
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:49,027
Don't worry too much about Chairman.

123
00:10:49,027 --> 00:10:52,817
If I leave the hospital, I'm going to go back to America.

124
00:10:52,817 --> 00:10:54,417
America?

125
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,677
But I don't want to go alone.

126
00:11:01,857 --> 00:11:06,867
Let's go together. I'll look for a spot at Harvard.

127
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:17,597
Thank you,

128
00:11:17,597 --> 00:11:19,997
but you won't be leaving the hospital.

129
00:11:19,997 --> 00:11:22,917
Because I'll try to persuade Father somehow.

130
00:11:24,537 --> 00:11:26,307
Cheer up!

131
00:12:11,187 --> 00:12:13,777
Why did you go into the surgery?

132
00:12:13,777 --> 00:12:16,227
Let's talk later.

133
00:12:36,847 --> 00:12:39,297
I said to to do it later.

134
00:12:40,747 --> 00:12:41,557
Hoon.

135
00:12:41,557 --> 00:12:45,107
Go, I want to be alone now.

136
00:12:49,417 --> 00:12:52,047
You don't like competing with patient's lives.

137
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:55,087
So, I thought if I let this competition be, I thought it would end.

138
00:12:55,087 --> 00:12:58,867
So, are you telling me to ignore a patient who was going to die?!

139
00:12:58,867 --> 00:13:02,167
There were other people in the operating room.

140
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:04,397
Jae Cheol's mom was dying.

141
00:13:04,397 --> 00:13:07,047
And they were asking for help in the operating room!

142
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:10,097
So how could I stay still?

143
00:13:19,557 --> 00:13:22,117
Don't do that to me.

144
00:13:23,297 --> 00:13:25,607
I'm really

145
00:13:25,607 --> 00:13:28,667
confused whenever you do that to me.

146
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:33,487
Truthfully, when I first met you here,

147
00:13:33,487 --> 00:13:35,627
I was really ashamed.

148
00:13:36,587 --> 00:13:41,567
During the time after I lost you, I did a lot of horrible things.

149
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:44,297
But I gained courage.

150
00:13:46,007 --> 00:13:48,567
Now that I've found you,

151
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:51,397
because my dream came back,

152
00:13:52,197 --> 00:13:57,367
I thought I could really return back to myself, when I put that bracelet on your hand.

153
00:13:57,367 --> 00:13:59,607
However,

154
00:13:59,607 --> 00:14:01,957
how could that Jae Hee

155
00:14:01,957 --> 00:14:04,877
do that to me?

156
00:14:05,677 --> 00:14:10,327
How can you tell me to

157
00:14:10,327 --> 00:14:12,917
ignore a dying patient?

158
00:14:46,507 --> 00:14:48,957
That son of a bitch.

159
00:14:58,017 --> 00:14:59,237
Move aside.

160
00:14:59,237 --> 00:15:00,557
Stop it.

161
00:15:00,557 --> 00:15:02,387
Get your mind together.

162
00:15:07,357 --> 00:15:09,007
Stop it.

163
00:15:09,007 --> 00:15:11,857
I said to stop it!

164
00:15:20,117 --> 00:15:21,987
Stop it.

165
00:15:22,697 --> 00:15:25,497
Please, stop it.

166
00:15:26,377 --> 00:15:28,517
Right now...

167
00:15:28,517 --> 00:15:31,617
You can still wait now.

168
00:15:32,687 --> 00:15:35,997
I'm saying you can wait a little bit.

169
00:15:39,357 --> 00:15:46,437

170
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:54,127
Whether my decision is wrong,

171
00:15:54,127 --> 00:15:57,217
don't you judge it by yourself.

172
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:05,387
You want me to forgive them?

173
00:16:05,387 --> 00:16:09,397
The thing you are worried about is the medical malpractice lawsuit.

174
00:16:09,397 --> 00:16:12,417
A lawsuit is like a disease.

175
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:16,027
If you ignore it thinking it's nothing much, it will spread throughout your body instantly and

176
00:16:16,027 --> 00:16:18,257
ultimately, it makes a person die.

177
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:20,387
It will kill our Myeongwoo.

178
00:16:20,387 --> 00:16:22,597
Then, Father,

179
00:16:22,597 --> 00:16:25,647
what if the guardian doesn't proceed with the lawsuit?

180
00:16:25,647 --> 00:16:30,057
That patient's guardian already requested the records of the surgical procedure.

181
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:31,857
It means he has already started preparing for the lawsuit.

182
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,487
So I'm saying,

183
00:16:33,487 --> 00:16:37,717
if the guardian doesn't proceed with the lawsuit, will you forgive all of us?

184
00:16:37,717 --> 00:16:41,457
What's the reason? Is it because of Han Jae Joon?

185
00:16:41,457 --> 00:16:42,617
Of course.

186
00:16:42,617 --> 00:16:47,207
Why are you talking like this now when you said you needed time when I told you to get engaged?

187
00:16:48,247 --> 00:16:50,037
I only have that person.

188
00:16:50,037 --> 00:16:53,897
If he gets kicked out, I'll have to live by myself forever. Can you let that happen?

189
00:16:53,897 --> 00:16:56,227
What horrible thing are you saying?

190
00:16:56,227 --> 00:16:59,877
So then, Father, promise me.

191
00:16:59,877 --> 00:17:03,657
If the medical malpractice lawsuit doesn't happen, forgive all of us.

192
00:17:05,507 --> 00:17:06,787
Fine then.

193
00:17:06,787 --> 00:17:09,857
But the medical malpractice lawsuit will start for sure.

194
00:17:09,857 --> 00:17:14,077
In this world, there aren't any guardians or doctors that Han Jae Joon talked about.

195
00:17:14,077 --> 00:17:16,717
I will look for one this time.

196
00:17:20,627 --> 00:17:22,957
Thank you, Father.

197
00:17:55,197 --> 00:17:57,897
How can that be a meal?

198
00:18:01,617 --> 00:18:03,557
Do you know how tasty this is?

199
00:18:03,557 --> 00:18:07,007
You have to make it right to make it a meal.

200
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:08,667
Why did you come here?

201
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,627
I have a favor to ask.

202
00:18:10,627 --> 00:18:12,797
What favor?

203
00:18:15,287 --> 00:18:17,217
He'll forgive us if we just stop the medical malpractice lawsuit?

204
00:18:17,217 --> 00:18:19,937
Yeah, so that's why I'm asking you to help me.

205
00:18:19,937 --> 00:18:23,447
If he's going to forgive us, he should just let it pass.  Why is he being so petty by putting a condition on it?

206
00:18:23,447 --> 00:18:26,607
Anyway, an opportunity is available for Chief Han.

207
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:28,557
You will help right?

208
00:18:28,557 --> 00:18:29,297
Forget it.

209
00:18:29,297 --> 00:18:31,417
If you stay still, you'll get kicked out too.

210
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:33,017
If he kicks me out, I'll just leave.

211
00:18:33,017 --> 00:18:33,907
Don't you need money?

212
00:18:33,907 --> 00:18:36,897
I can earn it here, and if it doesn't work out, I can steal too.

213
00:18:36,897 --> 00:18:39,177
Are you going to be keep being so twisted?

214
00:18:39,177 --> 00:18:41,257
You said Chief Han is a decent person.

215
00:18:41,257 --> 00:18:46,337
And there are those who you said were real doctors.  Are you going to just watch them get kicked out?

216
00:18:46,337 --> 00:18:48,697
Well, that's true.

217
00:18:49,647 --> 00:18:51,157
Why is it me?

218
00:18:51,157 --> 00:18:53,517
Why do you talk so much when you can say that you'll help?

219
00:18:53,517 --> 00:18:55,247
Why the temper when you're asking for help?

220
00:18:55,247 --> 00:18:58,967
Fine then. I'll do it alone.

221
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:00,797
Okay, I'll help you.

222
00:19:00,797 --> 00:19:04,847
Other people's lives and deaths are on the line. Can't you be more serious?

223
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:06,777
You don't die just because  you take off the gown.

224
00:19:06,777 --> 00:19:08,527
Hey, Park Hoon!

225
00:19:08,527 --> 00:19:11,667
Sorry, sorry. What do I have to do?

226
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:14,457
First of all, we have to persuade the guardian.

227
00:19:14,457 --> 00:19:16,737
Aigoo, it's expected of a quack.

228
00:19:16,737 --> 00:19:19,247
How can that be the first?

229
00:19:19,247 --> 00:19:22,457
Just do as I say.  Huh?

230
00:19:23,127 --> 00:19:26,217
Okay, I got it.

231
00:19:30,217 --> 00:19:31,937
I'm sorry, Doctor.

232
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,497
I can't just let it pass when those people tried

233
00:19:34,497 --> 00:19:36,977
to hide what they did wrong.

234
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:38,387
Dad.

235
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:41,677
We can promise monetary compensation for a mistake made during the surgical procedure.

236
00:19:41,677 --> 00:19:44,077
Money is important.

237
00:19:44,077 --> 00:19:48,267
However, what I want to know is what went wrong during my wife's surgical procedure.

238
00:19:48,267 --> 00:19:53,967
Also if they did something wrong, I believe a sincere apology for what they did wrong is more important.

239
00:19:53,967 --> 00:19:56,247
I doubt those people will ever apologize...

240
00:19:56,247 --> 00:19:58,257
Doctor Park...

241
00:19:58,257 --> 00:20:00,017
I got it.

242
00:20:00,017 --> 00:20:02,877
Then we will go first and try to talk to them.

243
00:20:02,877 --> 00:20:04,427
Apologize?

244
00:20:04,427 --> 00:20:06,807
What apology? What are you?

245
00:20:06,807 --> 00:20:08,747
If we didn't do the surgery, we would have been in trouble.

246
00:20:08,747 --> 00:20:11,237
Cardiology Department's treatment was good enough.  Did you know that?

247
00:20:11,237 --> 00:20:14,137
You guys were the ones who over-treated the patient.

248
00:20:14,137 --> 00:20:16,967
Let them do the lawsuit if they want to.

249
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:20,937
We are not even going to blink our eyes.

250
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,027
Now what do we do?

251
00:20:23,027 --> 00:20:25,487
What do you mean?  If begging doesn't work then we need to threaten.

252
00:20:25,487 --> 00:20:26,877
Threaten?

253
00:20:26,877 --> 00:20:29,537
Jae Cheol's mom's surgical procedure was done by the cardiologist's third year resident.

254
00:20:29,537 --> 00:20:31,217
I heard about Doctor Kim, too.

255
00:20:31,217 --> 00:20:33,287
I called the branch just in case.

256
00:20:33,287 --> 00:20:36,097
They said he's on vacation. He's not answering the phone either.

257
00:20:36,097 --> 00:20:37,437
If so, we should go find him.

258
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:39,127
How?

259
00:20:40,547 --> 00:20:42,527
- Do you have some money?
- Money?

260
00:20:42,527 --> 00:20:44,457
Why money?

261
00:20:44,457 --> 00:20:47,207
We need to find Doctor Kim.

262
00:21:06,287 --> 00:21:13,207

263
00:21:21,397 --> 00:21:24,197
Hyungnim is doing well, right?

264
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:31,337
Of course, he's been well.  Thanks to you.

265
00:21:31,337 --> 00:21:33,987
In very good health.

266
00:21:33,987 --> 00:21:36,857
- In prison.
- Oh no.

267
00:21:36,857 --> 00:21:41,157
- I really had my mouth shut tight.
- It's okay.

268
00:21:41,157 --> 00:21:44,127
During the 10 years Hyungnim isn't here,

269
00:21:44,127 --> 00:21:46,737
I am the Hyungnim.

270
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:48,807
Congratulations.

271
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,587
Ah, well, there's no need to congratulate.

272
00:21:50,587 --> 00:21:54,687
- Well, then, work hard.
- Where are you going?

273
00:21:57,257 --> 00:21:59,837
Oh, yeah.

274
00:22:00,867 --> 00:22:01,817
Here.

275
00:22:01,817 --> 00:22:03,737
- You should endorse it.
- Ah... Right?

276
00:22:03,737 --> 00:22:07,027
- Of course.
- Of course I have to endorse it.

277
00:22:07,027 --> 00:22:10,807
My kids really had a difficult time trying to catch this guy.

278
00:22:10,807 --> 00:22:12,687
Guys, count!

279
00:22:12,687 --> 00:22:17,057
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

280
00:22:17,057 --> 00:22:18,807
eleven!

281
00:22:18,807 --> 00:22:22,317
11!  That's a freakin' lot of kids, isn't it?

282
00:22:22,317 --> 00:22:25,357
I should feed them beef. 10 for each head.

283
00:22:25,357 --> 00:22:29,167
Wow, your memory is really good!

284
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:31,567
Let's feed them some beef.

285
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:33,667
Who is this woman?

286
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:36,397
It just keeps coming out. Is this an ATM or what?

287
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:38,717
Here. That's enough, right?

288
00:22:38,717 --> 00:22:41,847
- Give me 500 more won (50 cents).
- What's with 500 won?

289
00:22:41,847 --> 00:22:45,057
I don't know. You asked for it too, hmm?

290
00:22:45,057 --> 00:22:46,487
Oh!

291
00:22:46,487 --> 00:22:48,407
Here!

292
00:22:51,087 --> 00:22:53,157
Okay!

293
00:22:53,157 --> 00:22:54,767
You've suffered through a lot!

294
00:22:54,767 --> 00:22:56,767
Okay, let's go now.

295
00:22:56,767 --> 00:22:58,557
Thank you.

296
00:22:58,557 --> 00:23:02,057
Call me if something comes up again.

297
00:23:02,057 --> 00:23:04,047
What are you here for?

298
00:23:04,047 --> 00:23:06,287
I have something to tell you.

299
00:23:08,997 --> 00:23:10,417
It tickles, Doctor.

300
00:23:10,417 --> 00:23:13,087
If they use a kid to record me, did they think I'd fall for it?

301
00:23:13,087 --> 00:23:15,197
Recording? What recording?

302
00:23:15,197 --> 00:23:17,867
Don't play dumb. If I say that I made a mistake,

303
00:23:17,867 --> 00:23:21,777
you are going to record it and use that as evidence in the lawsuit!

304
00:23:28,677 --> 00:23:31,907
I don't know what you are going to say but we have done nothing wrong.

305
00:23:31,907 --> 00:23:35,007
You're right, my father was the one who made a mistake.

306
00:23:36,027 --> 00:23:39,087
You were trying to make my mom better when that happened. A lawsuit...

307
00:23:39,087 --> 00:23:42,187
I don't think we need to do things of that nature.

308
00:23:44,917 --> 00:23:48,837
Since you are a doctor, even if you are really mad because of my dad,

309
00:23:48,837 --> 00:23:51,867
- I wish you'd understand.
- Is that so?

310
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:56,937
Tell your dad exactly what you just said.  Got it?

311
00:24:04,247 --> 00:24:06,327
Professor!

312
00:24:06,327 --> 00:24:09,607
Aren't you being too much to a kid?

313
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:25,707
A fist is closer than the law, hmm?

314
00:24:25,707 --> 00:24:27,617
Hey.  Hey.  Hey.

315
00:24:27,617 --> 00:24:31,187
- Let's settle this peacefully. If you don't apologize... 
- Doctor!

316
00:24:38,587 --> 00:24:40,787
Look here, Ahjussi,

317
00:24:40,787 --> 00:24:44,567
I'm telling you that even if this goes to a lawsuit, there is nothing you'll gain.

318
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:46,707
Have you heard of beating your head against the wall?

319
00:24:46,707 --> 00:24:48,987
You are doing just that right now.

320
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,207
There is nothing else I want.

321
00:24:51,207 --> 00:24:55,307
If a mistake was made during the surgical procedure, really acknowledge that fact,

322
00:24:55,307 --> 00:24:59,117
and all you need to tell me is, "I'm sorry," and "I've made a mistake."

323
00:24:59,117 --> 00:25:03,767
Just so you can record it and submit it to the court if we apologize like that?

324
00:25:03,767 --> 00:25:07,747
Ah seriously, do you think you can we're that easy to fool?

325
00:25:07,747 --> 00:25:12,217
You little... That's enough, you bas--

326
00:25:14,607 --> 00:25:16,577
What is this?

327
00:25:21,877 --> 00:25:25,247
Watch from over there if you are curious.

328
00:25:29,957 --> 00:25:32,087
I'm sorry.

329
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:39,567
Our professor should have done the surgical procedure. But while a resident was performing the surgical procedure,

330
00:25:39,567 --> 00:25:41,267
there was a mistake.

331
00:25:41,267 --> 00:25:46,167
Above all, the fact that we did not tell you the truth from the start,

332
00:25:46,807 --> 00:25:49,547
I'm sincerely sorry.

333
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:53,947
We've done something so shameful as doctors.

334
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,637
I'm sorry.

335
00:26:01,417 --> 00:26:03,867
Was it that difficult?

336
00:26:06,347 --> 00:26:08,827
To say "I'm sorry, I made a mistake!"

337
00:26:08,827 --> 00:26:12,097
"I'm sorry, I made a mistake!"

338
00:26:13,227 --> 00:26:16,217
Was it that difficult to say that?

339
00:26:22,077 --> 00:26:24,107
I'm going to sue all of you.

340
00:26:24,107 --> 00:26:26,767
All of you...

341
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:33,417
Don't do it, Dad.

342
00:26:34,587 --> 00:26:38,117
Even so, they're people who tried to make Mom better.

343
00:26:38,117 --> 00:26:40,407
They will also heal me, too.

344
00:26:42,327 --> 00:26:46,317
They will heal you, too, if you get sick later.

345
00:27:17,757 --> 00:27:19,987
Thank you.

346
00:27:19,987 --> 00:27:22,897
Buy me at least a meal if you are thankful.

347
00:27:22,897 --> 00:27:25,037
Tae Sung!

348
00:27:25,037 --> 00:27:29,237
I told you not to pick up things rashly. Give me that.

349
00:27:44,017 --> 00:27:45,247
Why? It's dirty.

350
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:46,687
Just because.

351
00:27:46,687 --> 00:27:48,447
Son.

352
00:28:10,877 --> 00:28:15,407
I'm sorry, Son. You've waited a long time, right?

353
00:28:15,407 --> 00:28:18,177
Is this your son?

354
00:28:27,157 --> 00:28:31,257
You can't go around like this.  Come this way please.

355
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:59,657
I think it's because we are near the Psychiatric ward.

356
00:29:03,767 --> 00:29:05,717
What's wrong?

357
00:29:06,577 --> 00:29:08,417
I don't know.

358
00:29:12,827 --> 00:29:14,667
Hey, Park Hoon.

359
00:29:16,207 --> 00:29:18,217
It's all over.

360
00:29:18,217 --> 00:29:20,887
It's  all  over.

361
00:29:20,887 --> 00:29:24,437
 After a diversified screening,

362
00:29:24,437 --> 00:29:30,017
 out of the three candidate hospitals, the chosen hospital to perform the surgery on Prime Minister will be

363
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,817
 Jaeil University Hospital.

364
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:39,297
 What were the specific criteria for your selection?

365
00:29:39,297 --> 00:29:41,137
 When is the surgery date?

366
00:29:41,137 --> 00:29:44,307
 Why was Myeongwoo eliminated...

367
00:29:56,687 --> 00:29:59,647
  Yes, Jaeil University Hospital,

368
00:29:59,647 --> 00:30:03,057
 not only secured the best medical team,

369
00:30:03,057 --> 00:30:07,997
  but it was especially highly assessed in the area of ethics.

370
00:30:07,997 --> 00:30:13,867
 Anyway, since there weren't any clear differences in the overall evaluation in all 3 hospitals...

371
00:30:13,867 --> 00:30:17,217
 The final decision is Jaeil University Hospital.

372
00:30:18,887 --> 00:30:21,317
Jaeil University Hospital.

373
00:30:24,807 --> 00:30:27,337
Then what is going to happen to us?

374
00:30:27,337 --> 00:30:29,217
What do mean 'what happens to us'?

375
00:30:29,217 --> 00:30:32,657
Competitions or whatever, it's all over now.

376
00:30:32,657 --> 00:30:36,617
This situation is exactly what you call, "It's pie in the sky."

377
00:30:36,617 --> 00:30:39,527
Isn't that right, Water Bottle?

378
00:30:39,527 --> 00:30:42,037
 It was a subjective decision...

379
00:30:42,037 --> 00:30:44,527
Why are you so happy when he says our hospital has been eliminated?

380
00:30:44,527 --> 00:30:46,137
That's why I'm happy.

381
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:48,147
- Do you want some? 
- Give it.

382
00:30:48,837 --> 00:30:50,587
So dirty.

383
00:30:51,607 --> 00:30:55,877
Because of Soo Hyeon's plea, I'll let it go for now.

384
00:30:55,877 --> 00:30:57,347
Thank you, Chairman.

385
00:30:57,347 --> 00:31:00,747
Then, you forgive all of the other doctors too, right?

386
00:31:00,747 --> 00:31:02,747
Except one.

387
00:31:02,747 --> 00:31:03,847
Who?

388
00:31:03,847 --> 00:31:05,947
Park Hoon. That guy can't be here.

389
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:10,187
Dr. Park is the one who suffered the most in stopping this lawsuit, but why?

390
00:31:10,187 --> 00:31:12,747
No means no!

391
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:23,957
- My Master, you suffered a lot all this time.
 - Yeah.

392
00:31:24,797 --> 00:31:27,177
You also suffered a lot.

393
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:30,707
I hope you fulfill your father's wishes.

394
00:31:36,297 --> 00:31:38,167
Hey, wait.

395
00:31:38,167 --> 00:31:42,047
What did you do with the ₩50 million that I gave you?

396
00:31:42,047 --> 00:31:44,127
You probably can't use that.

397
00:31:44,127 --> 00:31:45,697
Why not?

398
00:31:51,007 --> 00:31:53,577
Because I only have half of each one.

399
00:31:54,407 --> 00:31:59,707
Okay, since they're useless anyway, I'll get rid of them.

400
00:31:59,707 --> 00:32:01,787
You worked hard.

401
00:32:26,587 --> 00:32:28,247
I'm sorry.

402
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:49,807
You take it.

403
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:22,237
Can you throw this away?

404
00:33:26,867 --> 00:33:28,587
Hey, Quack,

405
00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:34,037
If you keep doing just as much as you're now, you'll become a useful doctor someday too.

406
00:33:36,357 --> 00:33:38,287
Take care.

407
00:33:40,007 --> 00:33:44,077
By chance, if you want to stay here longer, tell me.

408
00:33:44,077 --> 00:33:47,437
I'll try talking to my father again.

409
00:33:47,437 --> 00:33:51,467
Forget it. Your father will never be able to take me in.

410
00:33:51,467 --> 00:33:55,487
Why?  Father was the one who said he'd accept you in the first place.

411
00:33:55,487 --> 00:33:57,627
That was when he didn't know who I was.

412
00:33:57,627 --> 00:34:00,067
What are you saying?

413
00:34:00,067 --> 00:34:04,247
There is something like that.  Anyway, take care.

414
00:34:12,837 --> 00:34:15,177
 Thoracic Surgery Department Park Hoon

415
00:34:40,487 --> 00:34:43,267
Tell me what I need to do now.

416
00:34:44,847 --> 00:34:46,607
Alright.

417
00:34:56,147 --> 00:34:57,927
Doctor Park!

418
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:02,467
Just in case, take it.

419
00:35:03,227 --> 00:35:04,817
 Thoracic Surgery Department Park Hoon

420
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:24,707

422
00:35:54,507 --> 00:35:56,217
 Help me.

423
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,897
Thank you.

424
00:36:30,157 --> 00:36:36,937

427
00:36:46,207 --> 00:36:48,557
Did Patient Kim Cheul Seo's blood test in room 25 come out yet?

428
00:36:48,557 --> 00:36:52,617
The directions to that injection has to be done by a doctor.  Just a minute please.

429
00:36:52,617 --> 00:36:58,537
♬ Let's meet again. ♬

430

Yes, it's the nurses' station.

431
00:37:04,687 --> 00:37:08,777
Hey, you quack.  Since you can't even do that right, that's why you are being called a quack.

432
00:37:08,777 --> 00:37:10,277
Ouch. Let go.

433
00:37:10,277 --> 00:37:12,977
- When will you come to your senses?
- Ow, it hurts! It hurts!

434
00:37:12,977 --> 00:37:17,217
When will you? When will you come to your senses?

439
00:37:41,617 --> 00:37:44,697
Are you not going to pick up the phone?

♬  If you are not there, I am nothing.  ♬

441

442
00:37:53,827 --> 00:37:55,697
Doctor Oh...

443
00:37:57,537 --> 00:37:59,637
Doctor Oh, are you crying?

444
00:37:59,637 --> 00:38:01,207
Me?

445
00:38:03,537 --> 00:38:05,227
Me?

446
00:38:06,437 --> 00:38:07,987
Is something wrong?

447
00:38:07,987 --> 00:38:12,077
No, it's just... I think something went in my eye.

455
00:39:13,997 --> 00:39:16,597
Why aren't you eating?  This is all expensive food.

456
00:39:16,597 --> 00:39:18,417
Please explain something to me.

457
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:19,897
What do you mean Jaeil University Hospital?

458
00:39:19,897 --> 00:39:23,007
Ah... About that...

459
00:39:23,007 --> 00:39:27,267
I put Myeong, Mingook, and Jaeil,

460
00:39:27,267 --> 00:39:30,097
these 3 items for approval.

461
00:39:30,097 --> 00:39:33,247
It was an agenda the President had a lot of interest in too.

462
00:39:33,247 --> 00:39:35,697
In that case, he wanted to make the decision.

463
00:39:35,697 --> 00:39:38,757
But, by reading his countenance,

464
00:39:38,757 --> 00:39:43,327
it seemed like he was going to reject the hospital I chose.

465
00:39:43,327 --> 00:39:47,477
If I chose Myeongwoo, he seemed like he was going to choose Mingook or Jaeil.

466
00:39:47,477 --> 00:39:53,627
So, I purposely chose Mingook, but,

467
00:39:53,627 --> 00:39:57,697
of all places, he chose Jaeil at that moment!

468
00:39:57,697 --> 00:40:00,377
I did not come here because I wanted to hear those words, Prime Minister.

469
00:40:00,377 --> 00:40:02,437
Of course.

470
00:40:05,897 --> 00:40:12,167
The words that you want to hear should be in here.

471
00:40:15,047 --> 00:40:16,887
Do not worry too much.

472
00:40:16,887 --> 00:40:20,727
Our work will progress well.

473
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,997
It's an awesome place.

474
00:40:42,117 --> 00:40:46,837
Aigoo. As you can see, there isn't much here.

475
00:40:47,677 --> 00:40:51,327
The cup is not important as long as it tastes good.

476
00:41:00,577 --> 00:41:05,317
Out of all the coffee I've ever tasted, it's really the worst.

477
00:41:05,317 --> 00:41:11,077
Jeez, I did my best yet you're complaining that it's not tasty. Really, this person.

478
00:41:19,347 --> 00:41:22,947
Is this rotten? It's gone bad.

479
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:26,827
Your skills in brewing coffee are totally different from your skills in surgery.

480
00:41:26,827 --> 00:41:30,137
Well, you didn't come here to taste my coffee.

481
00:41:30,137 --> 00:41:32,367
What brings you all the way here?

482
00:41:32,367 --> 00:41:34,447
I have two things I want to ask you.

483
00:41:34,447 --> 00:41:35,967
Two?

484
00:41:35,967 --> 00:41:39,527
My surgery. Why did you help?

485
00:41:42,347 --> 00:41:45,467
Why did you do that surgery?

486
00:41:45,467 --> 00:41:47,967
It's because of the patient.

487
00:41:49,917 --> 00:41:52,317
Ultimately, was it because of the same reason?

488
00:41:52,317 --> 00:41:57,917
I'm sorry. If I had done it in the first place, you wouldn't have been in a difficult position from the beginning.

489
00:41:57,917 --> 00:42:00,237
I heard from Doctor Oh.

490
00:42:00,237 --> 00:42:03,427
Thanks to you... Thank you.

491
00:42:03,427 --> 00:42:05,417
It's not like I did anything that great.

492
00:42:05,417 --> 00:42:09,797
Did you stop the lawsuit because you were worried about me?

493
00:42:09,797 --> 00:42:12,647
This is the second question I want to ask you.

494
00:42:12,647 --> 00:42:14,597
A little.

495
00:42:14,597 --> 00:42:15,857
It's unexpected.

496
00:42:15,857 --> 00:42:19,837
It's unexpected for me, too, that I'd be worried about you.

497
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:21,747
Why?

498
00:42:22,737 --> 00:42:25,887
Why were you worried about me when we were uncomfortable with each other?

499
00:42:25,887 --> 00:42:28,537
You really have an unique hobby.

500
00:42:28,537 --> 00:42:32,347
This is getting embarrassing. Do you really have to hear this?

501
00:42:32,347 --> 00:42:33,907
Yes.

502
00:42:34,737 --> 00:42:37,347
You know already.

503
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:39,667
I need to hear it personally from your own mouth.

504
00:42:39,667 --> 00:42:42,027
This is really...

505
00:42:47,757 --> 00:42:52,577
I thought you were an okay doctor. Satisfied?

506
00:43:01,887 --> 00:43:05,597
Let's have a drink. It'll be my treat.

507
00:43:09,867 --> 00:43:11,387
This is hard.

508
00:43:11,387 --> 00:43:13,447
Have you never made curry before?

509
00:43:13,447 --> 00:43:14,877
Since I don't like it all that much.

510
00:43:14,877 --> 00:43:17,827
Why did you make so much of something you don't even like?

511
00:43:21,087 --> 00:43:25,177
Wow! You're really good.

512
00:43:32,157 --> 00:43:33,357
Aren't you going to eat?

513
00:43:33,357 --> 00:43:36,697
I wonder how long it takes to get to Dr. Park's clinic from here.

514
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,927
- Why?
- It seems like he likes curry.

515
00:43:39,927 --> 00:43:43,867
Since it looks like there would be a lot of leftovers, should we invite him here?

516
00:43:45,317 --> 00:43:47,267
Is that why you made so much?

517
00:43:47,267 --> 00:43:49,977
No.

518
00:43:49,977 --> 00:43:54,667
It looked like he just adds instant curry on top of rice.

519
00:43:57,817 --> 00:44:00,257
How do you know that?

520
00:44:00,257 --> 00:44:04,297
I just... Is that okay?

521
00:44:22,147 --> 00:44:29,547

522
00:44:34,767 --> 00:44:37,007
- Aiyoo.
- Aiyoo.

523
00:44:39,767 --> 00:44:46,787
So we fervently fought to do the Prime Minister's surgery but then BAM the hospital's been eliminated from the outside!

524
00:44:46,787 --> 00:44:51,877
Not even knowing it'd turn out like this, do you know how fast my heart was racing when I failed the first patient's surgery?

525
00:44:51,877 --> 00:44:53,407
Even the sky turned yellow (feeling devastated).

526
00:44:53,407 --> 00:44:55,837
Your words are becoming a little short.
(It means that he's starting to speak informally.)

527
00:44:55,837 --> 00:44:58,267
Did I?

528
00:44:58,267 --> 00:44:59,907
I'm very sorry.

529
00:44:59,907 --> 00:45:04,557
It's okay. You've aged a lot more than me anyway.

530
00:45:11,387 --> 00:45:13,207
So that's why I was curious.

531
00:45:13,207 --> 00:45:15,997
How did you get such amazing skills

532
00:45:15,997 --> 00:45:19,157
at such a young age, and on top of that from North Korea?

533
00:45:21,187 --> 00:45:23,397
My father was a doctor.

534
00:45:23,397 --> 00:45:25,577
Then is he still there?

535
00:45:25,577 --> 00:45:28,197
He died.

536
00:45:28,197 --> 00:45:30,297
That's unfortunate.

537
00:45:31,457 --> 00:45:32,587
Then what about your mother?

538
00:45:32,587 --> 00:45:36,137
Let's stop talking about gloomy stuff.

539
00:45:36,137 --> 00:45:39,827
I need to pee.  I'll go pee and come back.

540
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,447
 Hey! Why aren't you answering the phone?

541
00:46:07,447 --> 00:46:09,547
You haven't eaten dinner right?

542
00:46:09,547 --> 00:46:11,917
I was making some curry and I have a lot of leftovers.

543
00:46:11,917 --> 00:46:14,187
So come here and handle the leftovers.

544
00:46:18,427 --> 00:46:20,367
Are you mad?

545
00:46:22,167 --> 00:46:27,577
Well, I was a little sad after you left like that.

546
00:46:29,067 --> 00:46:32,287
I have something to tell you, so can you come over?

547
00:46:32,287 --> 00:46:34,977
Doctor Park went to the restroom.

548
00:46:36,737 --> 00:46:38,967
Jae Joon!

549
00:46:41,697 --> 00:46:43,497
I'm having a drink with Doctor Park.

550
00:46:43,497 --> 00:46:46,067
Ah, I see.

551
00:46:47,367 --> 00:46:49,097
Why Doctor Park?

552
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:50,947
No.

553
00:46:50,947 --> 00:46:56,797
Doctor Han made some curry, I mean food, and there are a lot of leftovers.

554
00:46:56,797 --> 00:46:58,297
I'll call you back after I ask him.

555
00:46:58,297 --> 00:47:00,807
Okay.

556
00:47:06,297 --> 00:47:07,507
What happened?

557
00:47:07,507 --> 00:47:09,977
Jae Joon picked it up.

558
00:47:09,977 --> 00:47:11,317
I think they are together.

559
00:47:11,317 --> 00:47:13,047
But why are you so flustered?

560
00:47:13,047 --> 00:47:15,197
I am not.

561
00:47:16,677 --> 00:47:19,657
Then, tell Chief Han to come over, too.

562
00:47:19,657 --> 00:47:23,247
Oh, should I?

563
00:47:37,757 --> 00:47:41,727
What do you think about Dr. Oh?

564
00:47:44,007 --> 00:47:46,627
Dr. Oh...

565
00:47:46,627 --> 00:47:49,427
At first, I thought she was a quack with only a sharp hand.

566
00:47:49,427 --> 00:47:52,597
But after seeing her awhile, she tries hard, too,

567
00:47:52,597 --> 00:47:56,107
and because I think she is slowly becoming a real doctor,

568
00:47:56,107 --> 00:47:58,627
she's also cute.

569
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:05,587
When I keep looking at her, I get reminded of Jae Hee sometimes.

570
00:48:05,587 --> 00:48:09,457
Does Jae Hee look like Dr. Oh?

571
00:48:09,457 --> 00:48:10,967
That's not it.

572
00:48:10,967 --> 00:48:15,407
Just, I wish Jae Hee would be more like Quack.

573
00:48:15,407 --> 00:48:17,267
As a doctor.

574
00:48:17,267 --> 00:48:21,297
How is Dr. Oh as a woman?

575
00:48:22,507 --> 00:48:28,697
Hey you... Do you think I like Quack or something?

576
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:31,447
It can be the opposite.

577
00:48:31,447 --> 00:48:36,837
Wait, by chance, are you concerned Quack would like me?

578
00:48:38,397 --> 00:48:42,097
My goodness... This person is so...

579
00:48:44,577 --> 00:48:46,857
Oh, this is...

580
00:48:48,917 --> 00:48:54,027
This person was worried that I would like you.

581
00:48:54,027 --> 00:48:56,787
How can you pick up someone else's phone?

582
00:48:56,787 --> 00:48:59,027
You kept calling so I picked it up, thinking it might be urgent.

583
00:48:59,027 --> 00:49:01,197
Did you perhaps say you like me over the phone?

584
00:49:01,197 --> 00:49:04,117
Stop sprouting nonsense.

585
00:49:06,227 --> 00:49:07,657
Stop and please eat.

586
00:49:07,657 --> 00:49:11,487
Hey, Quack. Honestly, we just can't be.

587
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:15,077
I'm sorry when your beloved man is here, but

588
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:18,117
the people I hate the most are ones with a bad temper.

589
00:49:18,117 --> 00:49:22,057
On top of that, your violence, vanity, and whoa...

590
00:49:22,057 --> 00:49:25,587
Hey, did I say I like you?

591
00:49:26,867 --> 00:49:29,987
I was trying to act kindly because I took pity on you for getting kicked out of the hospital. You're seriously...

592
00:49:29,987 --> 00:49:31,397
Relax.

593
00:49:31,397 --> 00:49:33,127
How can I relax?

594
00:49:33,127 --> 00:49:37,837
I called you because I thought you weren't even eating properly, but your words are too harsh.

595
00:49:37,837 --> 00:49:40,917
The one being too harsh is you, Soo Hyeon.

596
00:49:40,917 --> 00:49:44,617
- Stop.
- How am I being too harsh?

597
00:49:51,017 --> 00:49:53,357
I'll go.

598
00:50:04,177 --> 00:50:06,547
You were too harsh.

599
00:50:06,547 --> 00:50:09,087
It's okay.

600
00:50:09,087 --> 00:50:11,827
You got along well at the hospital.

601
00:50:11,827 --> 00:50:14,647
How did you know I liked curry?

602
00:50:14,647 --> 00:50:18,817
I'm curious, too. How did Dr. Oh know that?

603
00:50:19,747 --> 00:50:22,007
Quack did?

604
00:50:23,897 --> 00:50:26,477
Forget it.  Just eat.

605
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:39,577
Are you okay?

606
00:50:39,577 --> 00:50:43,297
What a jerk! Can he disregard a person's good will like this?

607
00:50:43,297 --> 00:50:45,787
- Do you, by chance, like him?
- What?

608
00:50:45,787 --> 00:50:47,867
It's not like Dr. Park has acted like that for only a day or two.

609
00:50:47,867 --> 00:50:49,537
It's something you could've just laughed over.

610
00:50:49,537 --> 00:50:53,867
So, are you saying I'm overreacting?

611
00:50:53,867 --> 00:50:55,937
First off, calm down a bit.

612
00:50:57,047 --> 00:51:00,567
I get it, so can you leave me alone for a bit?

613
00:51:00,567 --> 00:51:03,747
Okay. Once you calm down a little, come downstairs.

614
00:51:11,137 --> 00:51:13,507
Jerk!

615
00:51:35,727 --> 00:51:38,647
I guess there won't be a reason to see each other in the future.

616
00:51:38,647 --> 00:51:40,777
I guess so.

617
00:51:48,137 --> 00:51:50,347
They are my parents.

618
00:51:53,927 --> 00:51:56,957
Are your parents in the US?

619
00:51:56,957 --> 00:51:59,817
You can say so.

620
00:51:59,817 --> 00:52:01,927
You must be sad since you can't see them often.

621
00:52:01,927 --> 00:52:04,397
It's not so bad for me compared to others.

622
00:52:04,397 --> 00:52:07,347
In North Korea, Dr. Park's father was...

623
00:52:10,437 --> 00:52:14,037
Then is your mother still there?

624
00:52:14,957 --> 00:52:17,227
You are asking me many strange questions.

625
00:52:17,227 --> 00:52:19,157
Did I?

626
00:52:19,777 --> 00:52:23,627
Would you mind if I ask your father's name?

627
00:52:23,627 --> 00:52:25,387
I want to know who he was.

628
00:52:25,387 --> 00:52:29,427
In truth, there aren't that many skillful thoracic surgeons even worldwide.

629
00:52:29,427 --> 00:52:34,527
If he's someone who raised someone like you, I was wondering if per chance I might know him as well.

630
00:52:37,937 --> 00:52:40,457
His name is Park Chul.

631
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:42,347
Is that enough?

632
00:52:44,447 --> 00:52:46,277
Who?

633
00:52:49,797 --> 00:52:51,487
Yeah, you arrived?

634
00:52:51,487 --> 00:52:54,667
Am I a call taxi? Why do you call me out when I'm busy?

635
00:52:54,667 --> 00:52:57,757
Sorry, sorry. I'll be out soon.

636
00:53:22,907 --> 00:53:26,707
 How is Park Hoon's mother here?

637
00:53:26,707 --> 00:53:29,897
 I am soon going to let her meet with Park Hoon.

638
00:53:32,807 --> 00:53:34,627
Why?

639
00:53:35,487 --> 00:53:37,947
It's the Prime Minister's order.

640
00:53:46,727 --> 00:53:49,777
Why was he so curious about someone else's family history?

641
00:53:49,777 --> 00:53:51,417
Family history?

642
00:53:51,417 --> 00:53:53,197
Who?

643
00:53:54,367 --> 00:53:57,577
It's nothing, so just drive.

644
00:54:23,447 --> 00:54:25,377
 How was your father's wedding?

645
00:54:25,377 --> 00:54:29,947
 Not bad, but now I have a stepmother who is two years younger than me.

646
00:54:29,947 --> 00:54:32,757
 I have a favor to ask.

647
00:54:32,757 --> 00:54:34,677
 What is it?

648
00:54:35,437 --> 00:54:38,007
 It's about Professor Park Chul.

649
00:54:38,007 --> 00:54:39,637
 Didn't you say he went missing?

650
00:54:39,637 --> 00:54:42,067
 Find out if he went to North Korea, by any chance.

651
00:54:42,067 --> 00:54:43,817
 North Korea?

652
00:54:44,567 --> 00:54:47,247
 Work pertaining to there is costly...

653
00:54:47,247 --> 00:54:48,907
 I'll compensate for it.

654
00:54:48,907 --> 00:54:50,667
 Compensate?

655
00:54:52,027 --> 00:54:55,237
 Okay. I'll find out and call you back.

656
00:55:13,997 --> 00:55:16,587
 Are you still waiting for Professor Park Chul?

657
00:55:16,587 --> 00:55:18,467
 Did the professor still not return?

658
00:55:18,467 --> 00:55:20,287
 Just go home.

659
00:55:20,287 --> 00:55:24,277
 The trial was cancelled because Professor Park didn't show up.

660
00:55:29,397 --> 00:55:31,257
 No...

661
00:55:36,797 --> 00:55:40,197
 Please open the door. Professor, answer me.

662
00:55:40,197 --> 00:55:42,667
 You said you would tell them that my dad died a wrongful death.

663
00:55:42,667 --> 00:55:44,847
 You said you would testify!

664
00:55:44,847 --> 00:55:47,367
 - Seung Hoon.
- You heard it too, Mom.

665
00:55:47,367 --> 00:55:48,917
 Professor said he would testify!

666
00:55:48,917 --> 00:55:52,297
  Seung Hoon. I am...

667
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:57,147
 Mom, Mom!

668
00:55:57,147 --> 00:55:59,997
 Mom, come to your senses! Mom!

669
00:55:59,997 --> 00:56:02,197
 Help! Mom!

670
00:56:02,197 --> 00:56:04,897
 Come to your senses!  Come to your senses, Mom!

671
00:56:04,897 --> 00:56:06,887
 Help!

672
00:56:06,887 --> 00:56:09,517
 Mom, Mom!

673
00:56:57,237 --> 00:56:59,527
 Are you waiting for someone?

674
00:56:59,527 --> 00:57:02,157
 My son...

675
00:57:04,407 --> 00:57:08,527
 There is no one here. I will escort you to your room.

676
00:57:35,897 --> 00:57:37,607
  Dad.

677
00:57:52,357 --> 00:57:55,107
  I will go to school.

678
00:58:18,727 --> 00:58:20,637
 Mom  001-1-949-2419-25

679
00:58:46,117 --> 00:58:47,957
 Hello?

680
00:58:48,737 --> 00:58:50,687
 Hello?

681
00:58:53,787 --> 00:58:55,757
 Hello?

682
00:58:56,827 --> 00:59:00,637
 Are you perhaps Hoon?

683
00:59:03,877 --> 00:59:05,457
Yes.

684
00:59:05,457 --> 00:59:07,997
I am Hoon.

685
00:59:08,067 --> 00:59:09,467
