 Episode 11

2
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,770
 I want to raise Myeongwoo to be the best hospital.

3
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,190
 Ahjusshi, I won't leave you alone.

4
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,500
 I don't want to lose Soo Hyeon, Chairman.

5
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,600
 Okay fine, no matter what, I will get my revenge.

6
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,600
 Please give me a chance. If you give me a chance,

7
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,030
 I will serve you with my whole life.

8
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,330
 At Myeongwoo, so I can do the thing I need to do,

9
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,070
 please give me one more chance, Chairman!

10
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,640
 Please.

11
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,920
 Please give me one more chance! Please!

12
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,360
 I'll give you one more chance.

13
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,670
 Thank you.

14
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,830
 Chairman.

15
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,720
 I'm giving you this chance for Soo Hyeon's sake.

16
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,060
 Park Hoon, that punk, committed a serious crime.

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,600
 He looked into some medical records without permission.

18
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:33,870
 With this, you are given another chance to compete with that boy.

19
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,020
 For authorized personnel only.

 ♪ I become a woman. I am no longer a girl.

21
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,400
 ♪ So don't hesitate any longer.

22
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,050
Ah, I sang "Coming of Age" again.

23
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,040
 Drink!

24
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,980
 Excuse me.

25
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,670
 Ah, so pretty. Your face is so pretty.

26
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:48,770
 How much does your back hurt?  This won't do. Hmm?

27
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,040
 Chief Han Jae Joon

28
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,530
Yes, Hyung.

29
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,870
I heard you guys drank a lot.

30
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,180
Oh. No, we're fine, Hyung.

31
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,890
Doctor Oh went home safely, right?

32
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,800
Yes. She probably did.

33
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,270
Yes, I'll go to the hospital soon. I'm hanging up!

34
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,950
Who is this touching me?

35
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,030
Oh my God! Oh my God! God!

36
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,260
Go away!

37
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,970
Where are you touching me?

38
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,260
You're crazy!  Crazy!

39
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,420
Oh my!

40
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,060
 Hey...

41
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,490
 Hey.

42
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,170
 Stop moving around, you're heavy!

43
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,710
 Aigoo, come inside!

44
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,700
 Don't treat her like that.

45
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,220
 Come inside!

46
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,730
- Aish, really!
- Aish!

47
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,490
Let go of me! Let go!

48
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,650
Oh my. Is Water Bottle, by chance, sleeping with Doctor Oh?

49
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,020
No way, what is he thinking?

50
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,870
Hey!

51
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,480
Oh my God!

52
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,690
Hey, you!

53
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,230
Oh my!

54
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,280
Hey.

55
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,030
Why is everyone in their underwear? Get out!

56
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,410
Hey!

57
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,490
Aigoo.

58
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,630
Why in the world are you all here?

59
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,880
Who's the one that didn't let us go when we wanted to?

60
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,790
I did?

61
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,150
Yeah!

62
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,740
 Why did we bring her here?

63
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,400
 Where do you think you're going?

64
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,180
 Okay okay okay.

65
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,420
 I'm going to personally take care of those who are planning to run away.

66
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,150
 I'm Oh Soo Hyeon!

67
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,260
Hurry and get out.

68
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,190
Get out, hurry!

69
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,350
Hey, hey. Let's go.

70
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,730
Gosh, this kid.

71
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,010
Hey, Chi Gyu. Let's go.

72
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,270
Who are you?

73
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,360
I heard that someone was moving in today.

74
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,860
What do you mean?

75
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,860
Doctor Han?

76
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,500
What is everybody doing here?

77
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,150
What are you doing here, Doctor Han?

78
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,000
This is the house that I signed a contract for.

79
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,100
Doctor Han did? I also signed for this place.

80
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,280
What to do? I clearly said that this place was taken.

81
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,580
She must have made a mistake.

82
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,100
Even if you did, you should have told us earlier--

83
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:15,150
I've looked into it, and it turns out that I signed after you.

84
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:18,270
- I'll move out first.
- Will that be okay?

85
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:22,210
I've been looking around, and there  aren't any open houses around here.

86
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,230
Because it's close to the hospital, it is the ideal location, but...

87
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,240
There's nothing else we can do.

88
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,530
Then should we do it like this?

89
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,720
Until you find a place, you can stay for a while.

90
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,850
No, then I feel too bad.

91
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:44,000
No, it's fine. I've stayed for a long time at your mother's house.

92
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,460
Will that really be okay?

93
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,290
Of course. It's lonely being alone anyway.

94
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:54,670
Thank you. Instead, I'll look for a place as soon as possible.

95
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,260
What do you think you're doing?

96
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,200
What do you mean?

97
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,880
Why are you living with Quack?

98
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,960
It's only until she finds a place.

99
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,580
Don't drag in someone else.

100
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,600
Are you worrying for Doctor Oh?

101
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,910
What do you mean?

102
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,920
Ah, hey!

103
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,590
- It hurts! 
- What? It hurts?

104
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,110
Let go!

105
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,780
It hurts! It hurts!

106
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,480
Ai, what?!

107
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,820
What in the world did you do?

108
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,380
Huh?

109
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,830
 Aigoo, Father.

110
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,670
 No more.

111
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,730
 One more drink, one more!

112
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:04,460
Oh, Quack was so drunk that I had to piggy back her.

113
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,160
You were the one who said to go and play.

114
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,350
Were you the only one there?

115
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:12,150
Okay, okay. I'll tell someone else to piggy back her next time. Okay?

116
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,750
Okay.

117
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:20,050
Can't you relax your face a little bit? You used to smile really well.

118
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,070
We're not in any situation to.

119
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,100
Gosh, this little... She's dead.

120
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,620
Hey Quack!

121
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,430
Can you stop calling me a "quack"?

122
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:50,280
Okay, I'll say it softly from now on. Why do you leave your hair everywhere?

123
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,770
Why are you carrying around a girl's hair? Are you a pervert?

124
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,540
This is yours. Look.

125
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,930
What are you talking about?

126
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,520
I mean, you can be drunk, but do you have to leave evidence of it everywhere? Are you already becoming bald?

127
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,410
Hey.

128
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,490
 I said let's get another drink.

129
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,840
A person can make that kind of mistake.

130
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,210
You have to apply pressure like this to prevent balding.

131
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,910
Okay? Whenever you have time, make sure to do this.

132
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:18,300
- I didn't like your perm from the beginning. 
- If you lose hair, you won't be able to get married.

133
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,920
- Omo, if I do get married, are you going to take responsibility for your words?
- Chief Han will-

134
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:48,810
I'm sorry for my harsh words. I'll apologize instead for my mouth.

135
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,130
Car key.

136
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,280
Truck is safely parked at the parking lot.

137
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,150
Okay.

138
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,290
I need a favor.

139
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,300
To keep my mouth shut?

140
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,550
Okay? Okay?

141
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:07,030
Why should I keep my mouth shut when it's there for talking?

142
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,050
Can you make some time for me?

143
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,410
You surprised me.

144
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,720
Hey, Doctor Oh. Are you going to be living with Doctor Han?

145
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,730
For now, I think so.

146
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:27,520
Two beauties under one roof. Can I come over?

147
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,540
It sounds like you've already found a place.

148
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,530
I was going to tell you soon.

149
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:45,470
Just what is the reason? Why are you suddenly trying to move out?

150
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,670
Because I thought it would be okay to.

151
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,290
Honestly, before...

152
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:58,190
With every one of my actions, I tried to make you like me.

153
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:01,830
So I always tried to be where you would be able to see me,

154
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:05,180
and thought that I had to do whatever you wanted me to.

155
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,460
But now, even if I didn't,

156
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,960
I know that your heart is by my side.

157
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,120
You're good at saying these heartwarming things.

158
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,240
Then I'll understand it as you have given me permission. Thank you, Father.

159
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,210
But there is a condition.

160
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,130
Get engaged to Chief Han.

161
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,610
Why?

162
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,270
It's just... Jae Joon,

163
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,960
I heard you were sending him to the branch office.

164
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,570
Where would I send a capable future son-in-law?

165
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:59,620
 Wait a minute, perhaps Quack, you're my fate?

166
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,830
 Shall we try to match the sound of our heartbeats? To see if we're one's fate?

167
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,350
 Why?

168
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,530
 Just stay still.

169
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:35,710

170
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:43,210
2 out of 3? What are you talking about?

171
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,850
It's simple.

172
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:49,960
I'm saying that we should decide the Prime Minister's surgery team that will represent Myeongwoo after two more competitions.

173
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,380
Gosh, are you kidding?

174
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,570
If you said let's decide with one battle, then it's already decided with the last surgery. What else do you want to do?

175
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,760
The situation has changed a bit.

176
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,800
There's nothing that has changed for me.

177
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,820
I'm not going to compete or whatever using patients any further, so just know that.

178
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,500
 100 million won

179
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:22,080
If you don't want to compete, then take that and give up being on the Prime Minister's surgery team.

180
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,320
This is a bit tempting, but

181
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,740
I don't want it.

182
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:34,050
I heard that you need quite a lot to bring your girlfriend.

183
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:37,770
The way I understood it, you want the Prime Minister's surgery team position for money as well.

184
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,290
I really don't understand this.

185
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:45,340
My master and you, too, just how much do you make that you can spend money like water?

186
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,110
It's not because I have a lot of money,

187
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:50,300
but understand that there is something more important than money.

188
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,180
You mean being on the Prime Minister's surgery team?

189
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,130
Let's just say that.

190
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:58,530
What's your reason? The reason why it's so important to you.

191
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:01,030
Because the Chairman wants it.

192
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,930
That's it?

193
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,870
People live for different values.

194
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,570
Dr. Park, for the person in North Korea.

195
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:12,440
And me, to be the best of this hospital.

196
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,560
This is definitely not a small sum for me either.

197
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,610
But I'm giving this to you, Dr. Park, because the thing I want to accomplish

198
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,800
is more important than  money.

199
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:32,210
So, you're saying that you want to look good to the head of this hospital to become the director?

200
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,900
Why? Can't I do that?

201
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,390
There's no reason why you can't. My master does too.

202
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:42,380
Then can I assume we have resolved it?

203
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,680
I'm sorry, but I can't.

204
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,480
Why do you say that?

205
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:05,210
The reason that I have offered, was it too boring for you?

206
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:10,420
That you want to be the director of this hospital, I would never think of it as boring.

207
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:15,280
As you have said, I do agree that people live for different values.

208
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,620
But

209
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,580
I have a reason why I must open up the Prime Minister's heart.

210
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,080
I'm sorry.

211
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,060
Doctor Park,

212
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:40,440
my offer, it's probably best that you take it.

213
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,860
This, for some reason, sounds like a threat.

214
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,570
I need a little more time regarding Jae Joon.

215
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,230
I'll give you time.

216
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:51,010
Until Chief Han finishes with the Prime Minister's surgery, you'll have enough time.

217
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:54,760
The Prime Minister's surgery, isn't Dr. Park's team doing it?

218
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,380
Dr. Park won.

219
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,200
He did.

220
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,380
I'm offering this for your sake.

221
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,010
You should do as I say.

222
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:11,770
I didn't see you like this, but you're strangely a bit stubborn.

223
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,900
I ask of you one more time.

224
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,580
The Prime Minister's surgery team. Give it up.

225
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,950
No need.

226
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,830
You will regret it.

227
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,380
Gosh, so scary.

228
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,210
Have a good day.

229
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,270
Doctor Park.

230
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,340
Call the police.

231
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,320
 Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery Moon Hyung Wook

232
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,020
You are really pretty.

233
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,700
There's another one.

234
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:05,320
 Director of Myeongwoo University Hospital Moon Hyung Wook

235
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,490
Director? Isn't that a little too early?

236
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:10,430
What's early about it? Do you know how old I am?

237
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:13,130
Hey, Director Moon Hyung Wook.

238
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:17,230
It's fate. Destiny!

239
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,580
Don't you think so?

240
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,470
Excuse me.

241
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:27,020
Are you Park Hoon?

242
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,500
Yes I am.

243
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,980
We are the police.

244
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,020
Can you come with us for a moment?

245
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,950
There was a report that you violated regulation by looking at a medical record.

246
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:45,010
 Give me a moment. Just give a moment.

247
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,510
 Let go of me.

248
00:19:55,510 --> 00:20:00,260
Hey! No, it's not me. Gosh, you people.

249
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,810
Oh there he is. Yes, him. Him.

250
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:05,910
He's the one who ripped the envelope and looked at the files inside of the CD.

251
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:09,390
I have  not committed any wrong.

252
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:14,740
Look at him. He's running away.

253
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,510
When you said that I'll regret it, this is what you meant?

254
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,640
Are you regretting it a bit?

255
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,140
A bit. But it won't ever happen the way you want it to.

256
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,820
It'll happen the way I want it to.

257
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,750
To me, there's something more important

258
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,970
than looking for a girl.

259
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,820
Let go of me!

260
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,720
Chairman!

261
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,780
Chairman, I really did not do it.

262
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,480
I swear.

263
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,110
I did not see it. It's the truth.

264
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:02,450
Let go, you people! I can't go!

265
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:05,730
Let go!

266
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,100
I did not see it, Chairman!

267
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,160
Let go!  I'm not the one.

268
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,860
- Aigoo. 
- Aish.

269
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:28,190
Are we really going to jail straight from here? Why aren't they handcuffing us?

270
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,110
Is this your first time getting into a police car?

271
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:34,080
Of course. Why would a patriotic democratic citizen like me ever get into a police car?

272
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,340
Don't worry. It doesn't seem like we'll be imprisoned right away either.

273
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,530
How do you know that?

274
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:44,070
There's nothing to boast but... I have some experience.

275
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,920
Do you have previous convictions, too?

276
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,070
Anyway, at times like this, you only need to remember  the 3 most important things.

277
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,300
3 things? What are they?

278
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,210
It's called one-run, two-deny, three-fink.

279
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,980
One-run, two-deny, three-fink? What is that?

280
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,380
- One-run.
- Yeah.

281
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,490
You run away.

282
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,140
One-run isn't going to work.

283
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,160
Then, what about two-deny?

284
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,890
It's denying everything.  No matter what, deny.

285
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,530
It's not. I definitely didn't do it.

286
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,820
But that person said that you're the one who did it.

287
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:23,530
That's not true, I've never said that. I do not recall that at all!

288
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:26,200
Right? Did you hear me say it?

289
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,120
They said they will bring the ripped physical exam results.

290
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,640
The team leader from the  personnel department who witnessed it is coming too.

291
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,010
What is the last three-fink?

292
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,060
Forgive me, sir.

293
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,670
I will confess everything.

294
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,130
It was me who did it, but,

295
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,100
in truth, I did it because he ordered me to do it.

296
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,400
Hey.

297
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,000
I am like a servant to him.

298
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,110
If you ask other people you'll find out, but I call this person, "Master."

299
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,880
Hey!

300
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,640
Master.

301
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,530
What's wrong with you?

302
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:19,010
I am sorry, Master, but you should have obeyed the law.

303
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,460
Hey!!!

304
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,210
Master...

305
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,330
Master, you are so bad.

306
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:30,070
I'm... Oh... I'm going crazy. Hey!!!

307
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:43,100

308
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,910
There will be a surgery on a patient with AS (Aortic Valvular Stenosis) in an hour. Get ready.

309
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:52,460
You also knew that someone reported Dr. Park to the police, right?

310
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,920
I was the one who told the Chairman that we should tell the police.

311
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,220
You did?

312
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,750
Dr. Park did something he shouldn't have done.

313
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,840
He is just a pitiful guy who is blinded because of his girlfriend.

314
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,770
It happened because Dr. Han looked like his girlfriend. Did you really have to go this far?

315
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:09,490
Personal feelings cannot justify every criminal act.

316
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:14,090
Why did you do it? The surgery battle... Because you lost in that?

317
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,750
I really can't understand you.

318
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,700
The Jae Joon I knew at least wasn't this kind of a person.

319
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,070
Then what about the Soo Hyeon I used to know?

320
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,770
You're asking why I reported it?

321
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:32,740
Right. I am angry for losing the surgery competition, but the thing I can't hold in even more is that

322
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,030
Soo Hyeon, you are always thinking about that jerk.

323
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,230
Are you being jealous right now?

324
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,020
You made me into a person who does that kind of thing.

325
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,220
Jae Joon, you are mistaken about something.

326
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,890
There is no place at all in his heart for me to be in.

327
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:46,140
To him, the only woman that matters is Jae Hee.

328
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,080
So are you mad?

329
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,150
Because there's no place for you in his heart?

330
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,010
Jae Joon.

331
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,610
Come back to me, Soo Hyeon.

332
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,440
To my team.

333
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,040
Come back to me.

334
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:23,980
I also want to.  I'm being sincere.

335
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,410
But you are blocking me.

336
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:31,050
You keep pushing me away.

337
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:48,240
Doctor Han, do you have some time?

338
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,430
Is there something wrong?

339
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,050
Go to the police station with me.

340
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,830
Why do we need to go to the police station?

341
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,620
Doctor Park got arrested.

342
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:59,160
You are the victim, Dr. Han.

343
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,420
That's true, but...

344
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:05,070
Go and put in a good word, huh?  So that Dr. Park can get out.

345
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,800
Why do I have to hide?

346
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,180
Yeah, Water Bottle will be gone after this. I searched online and

347
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,730
it's 3 years of imprisonment.

348
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:35,250
What are you talking about? Did something happen to my hyung?

349
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,670
Yes, tomboy.

350
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:41,620
Your hyung, Punk, was dragged to the police station, Punk.

351
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,370
Hyung did? Why?

352
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:46,600
It's because he was showing off, just because he has some skills.

353
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,870
It's a good thing because I was sick of looking at him.

354
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:54,150
Given this situation, it will be really great if he could rot in prison for a few  years.

355
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:56,550
Are you done talking?!

356
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:06,940
If you get caught again saying nonsense, the next time I will really kick your ass, so do as you wish, got it?

357
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:14,620
She does that sometimes. Go back to your work.

358
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:21,290
Hey, how can you do this to me?

359
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:25,080
When did I do that? I told you not to do it,

360
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,020
But you were the one who did it, you bastard!

361
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:33,570
Dr. Han. You're just the person I wanted to see.

362
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,510
Tell them.

363
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:38,760
Did I order him to see your medical records?

364
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,030
It's not, huh?

365
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:44,590
No, you ordered me to do it, Master.

366
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:48,370
I'm going crazy. Do you want to die?

367
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:52,250
It was her medical records. If she requests for favorable arrangements, won't that solve it?

368
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:55,900
This cannot be dropped unless the person who reported it steps up, himself.

369
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,960
Ah, he is here.

370
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:04,450
Hey, betrayer.  You!

371
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:18,620
Chief Han, are you really going to be like this?

372
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,420
I gave him a chance but this is the result of refusing it.

373
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,650
What chance?

374
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:25,590
Choosing the Prime Minister's surgery team.

375
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:28,710
What are you talking about? Because we won,

376
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,400
we were chosen like this.

377
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:35,880
You won, but for the two of you, your medical licenses are about to be taken away, aren't they?

378
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:41,230
How are you going to be on the Prime Minister's surgery team without a medical license?

379
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,770
So...

380
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,730
So, what are you proposing?

381
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:49,970
I'm asking for 3 matches, with you winning the last one.

382
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:54,400
Us, 1. You, 0?

383
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,190
Okay. Let's do it.  I will do it, so get me out of here.

384
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:04,290
I'll suffocate and die if I remain in a place like this for too long.

385
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:06,830
What about you, Dr. Park?

386
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:11,510
I clearly told you that I didn't want to.

387
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:16,570
If you consent to it, we'll make it so that you can choose the patient for the second match.

388
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:21,220
This is my last offer.

389
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:26,140
Hey, just quickly tell him you will do it.

390
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:40,250
Damn it all...

391
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,510
Alright.

392
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,500
Let's do it.

393
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:04,070
Jae Joon, see me for a bit.

394
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,030
Where is this punk going, huh?

395
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,510
Hey, aren't you going to stop right there?!

396
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:18,540
Even so, this is too cowardly.

397
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,920
Cowardly? What is?

398
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,820
You created this situation to overturn the victory.

399
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,900
I thought you would say thank you.

400
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,770
If we followed the regulation, those two people would've gone to prison immediately.

401
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,720
Then, there is no need to have another match.

402
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,710
But I gave him a chance because we are doctors from same hospital.

403
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,920
Is it that foul?

404
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,720
Get in. I'll drive you back to the hospital.

405
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,030
No need. I'll go in a  taxi.

406
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,130
Can I ask you something?

407
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,950
What?

408
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:19,000
Why are you telling me to perform a surgery on Jang Seok Joo's heart?

409
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,990
I'll tell you later.

410
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:24,730
But first, let's do whatever Cha Jin Soo asks.

411
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:27,850
Even if we do that, he won't let go of us.

412
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:30,290
Please believe in me.

413
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,540
I also want to protect you.

414
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,460
How?

415
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,840
I have a plan.

416
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,970
Plan?

417
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,620
Yes,

418
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:48,230
a plan that can let us stay together.

419
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:52,480
We won't be watched by someone else and will live happily.

420
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,110
A plan like that.

421
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,470
To do that, you need to lead the Prime Minister's surgery team.

422
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,350
Okay.

423
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:11,630
I'll do anything you ask.

424
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,150
Thank you.

425
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,950
Instead, I have to a favor to ask.

426
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,580
What is it?

427
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,020
Let me hear you laugh once.

428
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,020
A big smile.

429
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,230
Ah, a big one.

430
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,090
Hyung!

431
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:57,950
Go in first.

432
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,420
Yes.

433
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,180
Are you okay? Why did you go to the police station?

434
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,010
Don't worry. I'm okay now.

435
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,900
Really?

436
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:12,550
Why is your face suddenly like that? It was fine in the morning.

437
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:15,260
The workplace told me to do so.

438
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,200
Aigoo, why are you hiding it?

439
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,600
Let's see. You're pretty.

440
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,920
Really?

441
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,100
Chang Yi, you are all grown up, you can even get married.

442
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,220
If I stand next to a car, they are going to give me ₩200,000.

443
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,180
I wore a pretty dress. Do you want to see it?

444
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:32,480
Later, okay? I'm going.

445
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,690
But the dress is so pretty...

446
00:33:55,110 --> 00:34:00,460
♬  When you held me in your arms, I learned about warmth.  ♬

447
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:05,010
♬  When you watched over my eyes, I realized that I was precious.  ♬

448
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:10,080
♬  Burying into me, it's your smiley face  ♬

449
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:15,820
♬  Now that you're not here, I can't live. Let's go!  ♬

450
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,380
What are you looking at, you perverted bastard!

451
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:22,040
♬  Deleting all of the hard memories  ♬

452
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:28,660
♬  The tearful days, baby, you can wipe the memory  ♬

453
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:31,080
♬  The memory  ♬

454
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:39,060
Is he trying to kill me in front of the hospital? This ahjussi!

455
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:49,790
Are you okay?

456
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:52,920
Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.

457
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,610
Honey!

458
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:03,310
Honey, Jae Cheol, how is your leg?

459
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,990
You shouldn't have come.

460
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,350
How about you, Honey?

461
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,360
I'm okay.

462
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,290
Why are you sweating?

463
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:14,810
I came because the doctor told me to visit.

464
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,910
I missed you, my puppy.

465
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:20,920
The doctor says Jae Cheol has improved a lot.

466
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,680
Honey.

467
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:29,940
- Honey. Honey!
- Mom!

468
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,070
Jae Cheol's mom!

469
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,280
Honey!

470
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,510
Let me take a look.

471
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,620
I'm a doctor at this hospital.

472
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:51,520

473
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:00,130
Help me out here. Quickly!

474
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,540
Prepare for pericardiocentesis. Quickly.

475
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,290
Move aside!

476
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:13,860
I called in that patient.

477
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,480
Move aside.

478
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,900
If you prolong the surgery, the heart will stop. Perform pericardiocentesis now.

479
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,310
Move aside. I told you she is my patient.

480
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,110
There is no "your patient", "my patient" bull crap.

481
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,150
Let go of that hand.

482
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:26,010
Take the patient quickly.

483
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:26,910
Move aside.

484
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:29,030
Move aside.

485
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:32,650
Quickly prepare an operating room.

486
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:35,600
What's up with them? Did they cause an accident?

487
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,400
Follow me.

488
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:45,000
You are Park Chul's son, right?

489
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,610
20 years ago, do you know why your father went through all that?

490
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,100
How can I not know?

491
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,860
Fine.

492
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:58,170
It's because he wanted to be the witness to medical malpractice.

493
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:03,670
If the lawsuit were to take place, what do you think what would've happened?

494
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,910
This place would have gone down.

495
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:11,160
Yes. You're right.

496
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,680
The hospital wouldn't have escaped the damage

497
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,980
and it would've been a third-rated hospital.

498
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,560
But do you know this?

499
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,600
Myeongwoo Hospital has saved tens of thousands of lives for 20 years.

500
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,730
If Myeongwoo didn't exist, what would've happened to those people?

501
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:29,410
I think you are mistaken.

502
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:31,840
It's not the hospital that saves lives, but the doctors.

503
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,850
Can doctors heal people with bare hands?

504
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:39,810
Starting from scalpels costing more than millions of won, to diagnostic equipment costing more than billions of won...

505
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:43,710
If the hospital does not provide them, don't you know that doctors cannot see patients?

506
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:46,270
Did the money to buy all that fall from the sky?

507
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,780
No, it does not.

508
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:50,920
They are bought with the money paid by the patients who come here.

509
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:54,770
Will there be doctors who think like that?

510
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:57,520
Patients want doctors who think like that.

511
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,710
That's why my father wanted to be the witness.

512
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:06,070
So what happened? What happened to your father who was prancing around to be a witness?

513
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:10,220
Don't be cocky with your skills.

514
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:13,020
Young people like you often mistakenly think skill is enough, but

515
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:16,540
old people like me who have lived for decades

516
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:19,770
did not live wasting their lives.

517
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:33,510
Doctor, what happened to my wife?

518
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:39,230
Other doctors are looking after her.

519
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:43,140
Are you Lee Gyu Eun's guardian?

520
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,400
Is my mom okay?

521
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,120
Yes, I got a call that she woke up. Follow me.

522
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,720
Three matches?

523
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,510
He's planning to pick the team that wins two matches first.

524
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,300
Did you cause this chaos to do that?

525
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,040
Whether it's Park Hoon or Han Jae Joon,

526
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,500
you are just going to take money. Why does it matter?

527
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:19,820
How can I believe in Han Jae Joon and continue to act for my task?

528
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,700
Then pray that

529
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,980
Park Hoon will win.

530
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,300
Really?

531
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,840
Finally, the game has become interesting. Isn't that right?

532
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,010
Yes.

533
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:44,060
Secretary Kim, do you want to bet on this? About the second match.

534
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:47,400
Will it be Park Hoon or Han Jae Joon?

535
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,850
Who will you pick, Prime Minister?

536
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:52,110
Me? Of course Han Jae Joon.

537
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:56,110
A game is more fun if there is a final match.

538
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,970
You know?

539
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,850
Is she okay?

540
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:09,230
Yes, Doctor.

541
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:23,450
It won't be a big problem, so you don't need to worry.

542
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:25,440
Thank you.

543
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,970
Why are you looking at a Cardiovascular Department's patient chart?

544
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:43,510
It's the patient I saw in the Emergency Room today.

545
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:46,280
In three of the coronary arteries, they've put in stents.

546
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,650
But do you see the bleeding here?

547
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:50,690
There's bleeding? Where?

548
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,580
Right here, don't you see it?

549
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,780
I can't see it.

550
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:58,680
Gosh, look closely right here. Because of the hemorrhage, she even has a cardiac tamponade.

551
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:03,850
If you came, then you should've came straight to my office. Why are you chit chatting here?

552
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:07,090
Didn't we break up? The atmosphere before...

553
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,310
Don't say anything and follow me.

554
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:12,260
If we're going to compete, then we have to strategize. Strategy.

555
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,250
Then let's go.

556
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:28,170
Hey, let's not forget how we were almost handcuffed because of you, okay?

557
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:30,400
- But we weren't. 
- Fine.

558
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,080
Since we're at it, let's enjoy it.

559
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,600
Hard working guy?

560
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,100
He can never win over a guy who enjoys it.

561
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:43,260
We won once. 1-0. We are at an advantage.

562
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,090
We just need to win once more.

563
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,390
Listen to me.

564
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:02,210
This time, you know the surgical lights, should we say that we should compete without them?

565
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:06,750
You do it well like a ghost. You close your eyes and...

566
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:11,620
Easily, one by one, you perform anastomosis like-

567
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:17,980
He's so fast.

568
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,330
The doctors won't explain to you well?

569
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:25,470
Yes, that's why I came to look for you.

570
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:29,060
These guys. Do they have something they feel guilty about?

571
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,140
You see the coronary artery here, right?

572
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:39,270
You are seeing this for the first time, right?

573
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:41,020
Yes.

574
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:45,610
This red blood vessel provides nutrients so that the heart will beat well.

575
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:48,860
But for Ahjumoni, this became too narrow which is why they added something to widen it.

576
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:52,230
Ah, the stent?

577
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:55,820
Yes. These three areas.

578
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,680
But there's a bleeding from where they inserted the stent.

579
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:02,700
The blood from there went towards the heart which is why she collapsed.

580
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,660
Doctor then is this perhaps...

581
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:09,700
Is this what they call medical malpractice?

582
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,820
I'm not sure yet.

583
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:19,550
The cardiovascular doctors said that the bleeding will naturally stop.

584
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:24,310
Do you also think so?

585
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,370
It would be nice if it did,

586
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:29,810
but it'll become difficult once the amount of hemorrhage increases.

587
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:32,460
If hemorrhage increases, blood will fill up in the pericardium.

588
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,350
Then the pressure applied to the heart will cause a shock

589
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:37,700
which will make her situation worse.

590
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,360
A worse situation?

591
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:43,700
Yes, well... the heart will stop or something like that.

592
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:59,500
What did you say?

593
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,730
200 Joules, charge.

594
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,290
Move away!

595
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:15,070
Charge!

596
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:34,060
What happened?

597
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:36,380
- What are you?
- Doctor.

598
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,260
Oh, she's fine.

599
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:41,340
There was an increase in bleeding, so she just had a shock.

600
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,840
Well, the bleeding is small

601
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,530
so it'll stop on its own.

602
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:48,110
So, don't worry too much.

603
00:44:53,480 --> 00:45:01,560

604
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,890
You want me to do surgery?

605
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:11,120
Please Doctor.

606
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,070
They won't stay still.

607
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,300
You are going to do it, right?

608
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:33,020
Okay, then let me get permission first from Master.

609
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,440
Master?

610
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,560
There's something like that.

611
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:46,700
I said you can't do the surgery.

612
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:51,240
Hyungnim it's that... the guardian also wants the surgery so he...

613
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,940
That patient... the bleeding will naturally stop.

614
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,480
It won't stop naturally.

615
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,890
Aren't you the guy in the emergency room before?

616
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:00,170
I'll do the surgery or she'll end up in a dangerous...

617
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:02,680
Danger? The surgery is more dangerous right now.

618
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,880
What if I say I'm still going to do it?

619
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:09,680
You know that taking a patient from another department merits a disciplinary action, right?

620
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,150
Of course I do.

621
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:13,200
It might escalate to a dismissal.

622
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,870
If you want to get kicked out why don't you do it?

623
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:16,920
No we won't.

624
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,080
Also, you keep in mind

625
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:22,100
that patient is under our control.

626
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,720
So mind your own business.

627
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,110
Understand?

628
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,400
I still have to do it.

629
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,670
Crazy guy.

630
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:41,210
If you take their patient you are going to get kicked out.

631
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:43,170
Why would I get kicked out for saving a patient?

632
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:46,760
If the Disciplinary Committee is called, then we're mostly likely going to be fired. Get your mind together.

633
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,520
So you want me to leave a patient who'll end up in a worse condition if I just look the other way?

634
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,420
Just pretend you didn't see it even if you did.

635
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:54,560
Even if you know, you pretend you don't know. This is life.

636
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,100
If a doctor does that a person will die, Master.

637
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,570
Hey we will die first!

638
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:02,320
This patient... it's just a medical malpractice.

639
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,640
I'm trying to do the surgery because I know that there was medical malpractice.

640
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,340
Why would you do surgery on another department's patient?

641
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:09,100
The guardian wants me to do it.

642
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,140
Then, get permission first!

643
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:12,540
It's because they won't let me!

644
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,650
Then don't do it!

645
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,350
I'm not going to play with you. I'm leaving.

646
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:25,040
Seriously, that guy.

647
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:52,100
Seriously.

648
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:56,370
It's hot.

649
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,330
What happened? Did you get permission from Master?

650
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,360
No.

651
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:09,430
Then you can't do my mom's surgery?

652
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,270
It's all because of me.

653
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:19,940
It's my fault that mom ended up that way.

654
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:23,660
 Yes, 1229 Yangjae Road, Complex 3, Apartment 102.

655
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:27,050
 My mom suddenly collapsed! Please hurry.

656
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:30,050
 Mom, are you okay?

657
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:42,850
 Are you okay? Mom.

658
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,290
 Mom, Mom.

659
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:53,090
 My mom was sick and having a hard time, but I couldn't do anything.

660
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:59,090
If my leg was okay...

661
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,620
You don't need to blame yourself.

662
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:06,890
She's fine right now because you called fast.

663
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:08,990
I'm really a bad son.

664
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:11,110
I'm the worst.

665
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:19,090
Well if you say it that way then, I'm a worse son.

666
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:29,490
What are you saying?

667
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:33,060
Anyway, don't say or think those thoughts.

668
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,800
Also your mom will be fine.

669
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,080
How? She'll be in danger if she can't get the surgery.

670
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:49,970
You want me to be the anesthesiologist?

671
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:53,580
Yes. There's a hemorrhage in only one of the coronary arteries.

672
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:56,500
But, I don't know what will go wrong once I open it up.

673
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,180
I see, a medical accident.

674
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,700
Basically.

675
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:04,240
It's another department's patient. Will it be okay without their consent?

676
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,040
I can't ignore a hurt patient.

677
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:10,690
What are you going to do?

678
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:14,210
Alright, I'll do it.

679
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,300
Thank you, Doctor Han.

680
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:30,030
Oh, Doctor Park. Did you get back well from the police station?

681
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:33,700
Where did Nurse Min go?

682
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:39,920
Nurse Min,  you need to help me out with something.

683
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,410
What?

684
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:46,050
- Okay, okay. 
- Doctor!

685
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:50,440
If the Cardiovascular Department finds out, then the surgery will cause chaos.

686
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:54,080
That's why I'm asking you for a favor like this.

687
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:57,700
Myeongwoo has good working conditions for a hospital.

688
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,930
What are you going to do if I get fired?

689
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:03,710
Can't you just make up something like I've forced you into this?

690
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:09,290
Nurse Min, you are going to do it for me, right? Please.

691
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:12,580
I do feel sorry about the last surgery.

692
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:14,550
I will do it.

693
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:17,520
Thank you, Nurse Min.

694
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,770
Doctor Park, what are you doing?

695
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:22,350
Ah, I'm sorry.

696
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:28,000
Instead, don't use Doctor Yang as the First and use someone else.

697
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,150
Another First?

698
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:36,550
Why can't I see it?

699
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:39,220
Because you are a quack.

700
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,780
You said you were thankful. Are you just going to pass it with words?

701
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:46,700
What? Do you have something you want to eat?

702
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:49,550
Well, no but I have something I want to do.

703
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:51,810
Something you want to do?

704
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,510
Why are you like this?

705
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:56,670
What?

706
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:58,930
Don't joke around.

707
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:02,520
What do you mean joking in such a serious situation?

708
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:09,470
Let me borrow your hand.

709
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:13,170
You need to help me out on a surgery.

710
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:15,490
Surgery?

711
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:17,460
Which surgery?

712
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,610
That patient.

713
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:35,700
♬  Where this place is  ♬

714
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:41,600
♬  Can someone tell me?  ♬

715
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,950
Please take good care of her, Doctor.

716
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:50,360
Let's go.

717
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:58,750
♬  Although it's hard, I take a step  ♬

718
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:06,340
♬  I try to live somehow  ♬

719
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:10,520
♬  Until I meet you  ♬

720
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,350
She's a patient from the Cardiovascular Department. Are you operating with permission?

721
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:15,070
No.

722
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:18,750
Are you crazy?

723
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:20,600
If you're scared, it's not too late to leave now.

724
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,300
It's not about being scared.

725
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:25,050
It's a given that you need to get permission to do surgery on another doctor's patient.

726
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:28,070
Why do I need permission when they are ignoring the patient's state like this?

727
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:30,100
Hey, Doctor Park.

728
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,480
Ah, seriously you talk a lot.

729
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,080
So are you going to do it or not?

730
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:41,090
Hurry.

731
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:44,400
This patient will really be in danger if she doesn't get the surgery, right?

732
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,670
I already told you.

733
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:48,790
Okay then.

734
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,120
Let's go.

735
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:04,820
Where did this patient go?

736
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:07,370
She is about to have a surgery.

737
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:09,810
What? Surgery?

738
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:18,280
Can you please tell me your name and birth date?

739
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:23,100
Lee Gyu Eun. November 15, 1969.

740
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:49,050
Are you going to perform off-pump CABG?

741
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:52,350
To reduce hemorrhage as much as possible, I have to do it without the bypass machine.

742
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:55,630
- I got it. 
- Get your mind together.

743
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:08,940
Is there another surgery in the afternoon?

744
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:11,990
This patient is the last.

745
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:19,230
Water Bottle and Dr. Oh are going into the next operating room.

746
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:20,960
What?

747
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:23,810
Suction correctly.

748
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:25,740
Yes, Chief.

749
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,630
It's almost done.

750
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:31,570
Doctor Eun, check the vital signs.

751
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:33,610
Yes, Chief.

752
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:41,260
This bastard. He's finally causing a accident.

753
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:45,780
Yeah, it's me. What surgery room is Doctor Park in?

754
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:54,550
Hey, Moon Hyung Wook!

755
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:00,200
Hey, Moon Hyung Wook. Do you want to die?

756
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:04,230
I really didn't know about it, Hyung. Really.

757
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:08,910
 Report about certificate for best employee

758
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:15,460
Yes, it's Oh Joon Gyu.

759
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,030
What?

760
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:24,990
Anyway, thanks.

761
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:28,120
- For what?
- You could be in a tough situation if you do this surgery.

762
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:31,470
Are you worrying about me right now?

763
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:34,750
I'm worried for everyone on our team.

764
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:36,670
Our team?

765
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:42,130
Aish. I'm not late, right?

766
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,740
You've lost your sense of fear recently, huh?

767
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,280
What are you doing?

768
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,710
What am I doing?

769
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:53,920
You.

770
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,400
Since I did this, you can't perform the surgery, right?

771
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:00,920
Let go.

772
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:14,560
Crazy bastard. Why are you trying to perform a surgery on our patient without our consent?

773
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,210
What are you doing? Hurry up and move her.

774
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:18,010
Okay.

775
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:20,510
Let me make a request.

776
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:25,110
- What request?
- If the patient has another shock it'll be dangerous so...

777
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,490
I have done more surgeries than you.

778
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:33,310
How dare you flap your mouth?

779
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:36,480
Professor Choi isn't this too harsh?

780
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,510
Oh Soo Hyeon, shut your mouth.

781
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:40,400
Your words are out of hand Professor Choi.

782
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,470
How dare you...

783
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:45,400
What are you doing in the surgery room right now?

784
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:51,050
Hey, Chief Han. Is this how you train your kids?

785
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:56,220
In the Cardiovascular Department, do you train people by beating them up?

786
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:58,610
What did you just say?

787
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:00,170
Let go!

788
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:02,250
- He didn't start the surgery.
- Let go you bastard!

789
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:07,020
Aren't you going to let go of me?

790
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,430
Let go of me!

791
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,590
Are you okay?

792
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:33,070
What the heck are you doing?

793
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:37,070
I found the patient.

794
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:41,010
Our second competition.

795
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,480
I found the patient that you're going to take.

796
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:05,600
