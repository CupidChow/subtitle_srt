1
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:29,433

2
00:00:31,643 --> 00:00:33,533
Is it this woman?

3
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,403
Yes.

4
00:00:49,073 --> 00:00:50,753
Hoon.

5
00:01:02,223 --> 00:01:03,703
Jae Hee.

6
00:01:09,383 --> 00:01:10,923
Jae Hee.

7
00:01:41,813 --> 00:01:43,463
Jae Hee.

8
00:01:51,023 --> 00:01:54,063
 Episode 3

9
00:01:54,063 --> 00:01:55,743
Is it her?

10
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:00,823
When can you bring her here?

11
00:02:00,823 --> 00:02:03,213
You know...

12
00:02:05,913 --> 00:02:08,503
I suppose only they would know.

13
00:02:09,313 --> 00:02:10,413
How much do you need?

14
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:13,543
But this lady is a bit expensive.

15
00:02:13,543 --> 00:02:14,853
How much is it?

16
00:02:14,853 --> 00:02:16,503
$500,000.

17
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:17,173
What?

18
00:02:17,173 --> 00:02:20,933
They said this lady is at some concentration camp. That's why it's expensive.

19
00:02:21,723 --> 00:02:22,513
Concentration camp?

20
00:02:22,513 --> 00:02:25,793
So earn some money quickly.

21
00:02:25,793 --> 00:02:30,683
If you are a doctor, aren't there many ways to earn money?

22
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:43,913
This is  the list of hospital candidates for your surgery.

23
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:52,833
 Myeongwoo University Hospital

24
00:02:56,803 --> 00:02:59,843
 Meongwoo University Hospital
The Board Chairman/MD Oh Joon Gyu

25
00:03:02,463 --> 00:03:05,563
I'm sorry for making you wait.

26
00:03:08,073 --> 00:03:09,963
What happened to that patient earlier?

27
00:03:09,963 --> 00:03:13,503
It's the Myeongwoo University Hospital. Do I need to say more?

28
00:03:13,503 --> 00:03:18,633
More than that, Board Chairman, I think I have seen that Professor Han somewhere before.

29
00:03:18,683 --> 00:03:21,163
That young professor? This is the first time I've seen him.

30
00:03:21,163 --> 00:03:22,603
No.

31
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:27,523
I saw the article about the youngest Asian adjunct professor of cardiothoracic surgery  at Harvard Medical School last year.

32
00:03:27,523 --> 00:03:29,043
Chairman, by any chance ...

33
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,603
That's right.

34
00:03:30,603 --> 00:03:32,313
Not only is he the youngest adjunct professor,

35
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:36,643
but he also did more than 1,000 cardiac surgeries without a single failure.

36
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:40,053
Why don't you come in?

37
00:03:47,643 --> 00:03:49,253
I will introduce him to you.

38
00:03:49,253 --> 00:03:53,293
He is our new Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Myeongwoo University Hospital.

39
00:03:53,293 --> 00:03:55,013
I'm Han Jae Joon.

40
00:03:56,523 --> 00:03:58,183
A jerk who graduated from a regional university!

41
00:03:58,183 --> 00:04:00,363
Who do you think you are?

42
00:04:00,363 --> 00:04:03,113
I made you a fellow, so how dare you mess me up!

43
00:04:03,113 --> 00:04:04,973
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:04,973 --> 00:04:07,193
I couldn't see the obtuse marginal artery due to the hidden location.

45
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:10,683
I was kicked out to a lower position because of you.

46
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:15,323
Chief, no... even my potential position as Director is about to be gone!

47
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:17,703
- I'm sorry.
- Get out!

48
00:04:17,703 --> 00:04:22,423
You... You're finished at this hospital as of tomorrow... you know that?!

49
00:04:22,423 --> 00:04:24,343
Leave,  you bastard!

50
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:10,903
Do you have to go in today when it's your day off?

51
00:05:10,903 --> 00:05:12,583
I want to take a look at my surgery patient.

52
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:16,223
They have reasons for giving doctors days off.

53
00:05:16,223 --> 00:05:18,893
So just rest for today.

54
00:05:18,893 --> 00:05:20,683
On my next day off, I'll treat you out grandly.

55
00:05:20,683 --> 00:05:23,383
I have something to say to you, Jae Joon.

56
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,303
Later, hm?

57
00:06:03,193 --> 00:06:05,383
Okay, fine.

58
00:06:07,373 --> 00:06:09,723
- Go inside.
- Okay.

59
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,293
Ah, Professor.

60
00:06:32,293 --> 00:06:34,083
I told you to call me Hyung in the call room.

61
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,283
Ah, Hyung. Yes.

62
00:06:37,793 --> 00:06:39,883
Aren't you off today?

63
00:06:39,883 --> 00:06:43,163
I just came by. Sleep.

64
00:06:43,163 --> 00:06:45,013
Yes, Professor.

65
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,893
Do you want to die?

66
00:06:47,893 --> 00:06:49,873
Alright, Hyungnim.

67
00:06:49,873 --> 00:06:51,213
Okay.

68
00:06:51,213 --> 00:06:52,883
Goodbye.

69
00:07:01,293 --> 00:07:03,003
Professor Han is totally cool.

70
00:07:03,003 --> 00:07:05,193
Why are you doing this inside my bed?

71
00:07:05,193 --> 00:07:09,643
Well, it's true. "I told you to call me Hyung in the call room."

72
00:07:09,643 --> 00:07:11,093
Ah, charisma.

73
00:07:11,093 --> 00:07:14,923
Turn your attention off. He is already taken.

74
00:07:14,923 --> 00:07:18,173
What? Who? Doctor Oh?

75
00:07:18,173 --> 00:07:20,653
Truthfully, am  I not  better?

76
00:07:21,963 --> 00:07:24,153
Stop saying nonsense.

77
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:27,873
Should we continue what we were doing, Dr. Min?

78
00:07:27,873 --> 00:07:29,253
You have pretty ears.

79
00:07:30,693 --> 00:07:32,443
Shall we?

80
00:07:33,073 --> 00:07:35,503
Let's begin the medical examination.

81
00:07:48,163 --> 00:07:51,263
It improves concentration.

82
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:55,823
It's a task that is delicate unlike how it looks, so I think it's okay for surgeons like us.

83
00:07:55,823 --> 00:07:58,083
Regarding Chief Moon's surgery...

84
00:07:59,593 --> 00:08:01,843
I did what you told me.

85
00:08:04,983 --> 00:08:06,433
Next year..

86
00:08:07,713 --> 00:08:09,003
Being appointed as the assistant professor...

87
00:08:09,003 --> 00:08:11,413
You see the mounted knight in front of the castle?

88
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:18,273
I think of this knight as you.

89
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:21,743
Don't worry about the appointment.

90
00:08:21,743 --> 00:08:25,923
Giving rewards to a knight who distinguished himself is the castle owner's bounden duty.

91
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,723
Don't you think so?

92
00:08:41,113 --> 00:08:43,433
You trash like bastard.

93
00:08:46,313 --> 00:08:48,043
 Hoon.

94
00:08:52,293 --> 00:08:54,303
 Hoon.

95
00:08:56,893 --> 00:08:58,493
 Hoon.

96
00:08:59,863 --> 00:09:02,773
 Stop looking. I'm right here.

97
00:09:04,363 --> 00:09:05,993
 Sorry.

98
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:22,453
 You earned $500,000 at this hospital?

99
00:09:22,453 --> 00:09:26,153
 Yes. I thought I was going to die earning that.

100
00:09:28,313 --> 00:09:31,193
 It's a bit of a waste, isn't it?

101
00:09:31,883 --> 00:09:35,033
 What do you mean a waste? Let's eat.

102
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,873
 Ah, it's hot!

103
00:09:46,463 --> 00:09:48,483
 Here, let's eat.

104
00:09:48,483 --> 00:09:49,833
 Let's eat.

105
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,473
 It tastes amazing if you wrap it in seaweed.

106
00:10:02,883 --> 00:10:04,643
 It's delicious.

107
00:10:06,013 --> 00:10:08,163
 - Hurry up and eat too. 
 - Okay.

108
00:10:20,073 --> 00:10:22,013
 Hoon.

109
00:10:22,013 --> 00:10:25,633
♬  I love you to death, until I'm driven crazy,  ♬

110
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:30,043
♬  I will love you through eternity.  ♬

111
00:10:30,043 --> 00:10:35,423
♬  I'm not letting go. I must find you.  ♬

112
00:10:35,423 --> 00:10:42,603
♬  I’m just a stranger without you my love~  ♬

113
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:25,643
Hey, your car is killer.

114
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,173
- Did you come, Oppa?
- Oppa?

115
00:11:28,173 --> 00:11:32,683
I don't understand why I have to be called by a daughter of a mistress.  Right?

116
00:11:32,683 --> 00:11:35,983
-Then what should I call you?
-Why would you need to call me anything?

117
00:11:35,983 --> 00:11:38,233
Don't you have keys?

118
00:12:00,793 --> 00:12:02,823
You can just keep it.

119
00:12:12,173 --> 00:12:14,363
You bit**!

120
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:24,203
Where is Soo Hyeon's spot?

121
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:25,673
It is a family discussion.

122
00:12:25,673 --> 00:12:28,213
Why would there be a spot for her?

123
00:12:29,163 --> 00:12:31,363
What are you doing?

124
00:12:32,243 --> 00:12:34,443
Stop right there.

125
00:12:35,783 --> 00:12:38,093
What are you doing right now?

126
00:12:38,093 --> 00:12:41,053
- Director of the branch. 
 - How did you become the director?

127
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:43,503
Mom told me to go there.

128
00:12:43,503 --> 00:12:45,083
- Stand up?
- What?

129
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,403
Didn't you hear what I said?

130
00:13:01,493 --> 00:13:04,243
You have to know what is going on in the hospital to learn management.

131
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:05,863
What does that mean?

132
00:13:05,863 --> 00:13:08,103
Who is going to learn the management  beside Sang Jin?

133
00:13:08,103 --> 00:13:10,643
It is something Soo Hyeon requested and I am permitting it.

134
00:13:10,643 --> 00:13:14,333
Honey, Sang Jin is your child.

135
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:18,173
Whether he is my child or not, I don't need anyone who is useless.

136
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,993
- Report!
- Yes sir!

137
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:28,393
I am going to report the Myeongwoo Medical Foundation's financial status of the first half of this year first.

138
00:13:28,393 --> 00:13:29,993
Myeongwoo University Hospital?

139
00:13:29,993 --> 00:13:33,413
That's right.  I will give you one day's wage, so please do that for me.

140
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:36,673
Forget it. I'm not going there.

141
00:13:37,323 --> 00:13:40,383
I heard it takes $500,000 to find Jae Hee.

142
00:13:41,223 --> 00:13:44,413
Are you going to give me $500,000 for one day's wage, or what?

143
00:13:44,413 --> 00:13:45,923
Many a mickle makes a muckle. Don't you know?

144
00:13:45,923 --> 00:13:48,423
I am not interested in that kind of mickle, so find someone else.

145
00:13:48,423 --> 00:13:51,813
Please~ Let me go sight-seeing in Seoul with Mom!

146
00:13:51,813 --> 00:13:55,713
I told you I am not interested!  Move, you punk.

147
00:14:01,113 --> 00:14:03,903
Hello.

148
00:14:03,903 --> 00:14:07,043
I was going to go.

149
00:14:07,043 --> 00:14:09,743
You should hurry.  Where are you going?

150
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,393
Where should we go?

151
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:21,423
Should we go to Gyeongbok Palace?

152
00:14:21,423 --> 00:14:24,013
Yes! Oh and I was wondering...

153
00:14:24,013 --> 00:14:26,183
Is that person from earlier Park Hoon?

154
00:14:26,183 --> 00:14:29,483
- Yeah, why?
- Because it seems like a name I've heard before.

155
00:14:29,483 --> 00:14:32,203
It's a common name. Hoon.

156
00:14:32,203 --> 00:14:34,083
Taxi!

157
00:14:38,223 --> 00:14:42,153
  Myeongwoo University Hospital

158
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:16,963
 15th: Hospital Director Choi Byeong Cheol

159
00:15:32,163 --> 00:15:33,633
  Ahjusshi.

160
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:37,313
 Hoon, you want to go to your Dad, right?

161
00:15:37,313 --> 00:15:38,663
 Yes, Ahjusshi.

162
00:15:38,663 --> 00:15:41,963
 Then let's go with Ahjusshi.

163
00:15:53,843 --> 00:15:59,293
I don't know who did the first aid, but he did such a great job!

164
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:01,393
If you just left it, you wouldn't have been able to use your finger.

165
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:02,893
Really?

166
00:16:02,893 --> 00:16:06,043
  If something goes wrong, you may never be able to use your finger.

167
00:16:06,563 --> 00:16:08,533
First, let's take an x-ray.

168
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:10,943
- Nurse Lee!
- Just a moment.

169
00:16:10,943 --> 00:16:14,213
You always say "Just a moment." She needs an x-ray here. Quickly.

170
00:16:14,213 --> 00:16:17,643
You will see a blue line on the floor after passing two doors.

171
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,073
Follow the blue line to get to Department of Radiology.

172
00:16:26,483 --> 00:16:28,913
Hey 500 won.

173
00:16:35,223 --> 00:16:38,233
What?  Which is the front side?

174
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:40,513
Who are you?

175
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:44,813
I am a foolish man who was scammed by this little girl.

176
00:16:44,813 --> 00:16:47,383
You're dumb for being fooled.

177
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:50,953
Don't you feel short of breath when you sleep these days?

178
00:16:53,343 --> 00:16:54,943
Just a moment.

179
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,743
I'm okay.

180
00:16:59,743 --> 00:17:01,963
- Where are you looking for?
- Department of Radiology.

181
00:17:01,963 --> 00:17:03,563
Oh, I'm going there too.

182
00:17:03,563 --> 00:17:05,923
I am not sure where it is.

183
00:17:05,923 --> 00:17:09,173
So complicated.

184
00:17:09,173 --> 00:17:11,943
Where is the Department of Radiology?

185
00:17:15,363 --> 00:17:16,983
Let's go.

186
00:17:16,983 --> 00:17:19,563
Hut~

187
00:17:40,573 --> 00:17:42,403
What is this?

188
00:17:45,343 --> 00:17:48,573
Nurse, where is the Department of Radiology?

189
00:17:48,573 --> 00:17:50,913
You can see the blue line, right? Follow the line all the way down.

190
00:17:50,913 --> 00:17:53,013
Excuse me.  We followed all the way, right to here.

191
00:17:53,013 --> 00:17:56,963
Not this line. Follow that blue line.

192
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,293
Let's go.

193
00:18:17,773 --> 00:18:20,273
 Emergency Stairs

194
00:18:38,513 --> 00:18:41,203
Let's go together.

195
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,533
Dammit.

196
00:19:02,343 --> 00:19:04,543
Aigoo, my back.

197
00:19:12,983 --> 00:19:15,313
- What's the matter? 
- Where is the Department of Radiology?

198
00:19:15,313 --> 00:19:16,913
Follow that blue line.

199
00:19:16,913 --> 00:19:20,533
We returned after following that line back and forth.

200
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:22,263
Not that one but the blue line in the middle.

201
00:19:22,263 --> 00:19:25,843
You should clearly mark it.

202
00:19:27,173 --> 00:19:29,383
Can't you see?
 ⬅︎Department of Radiology ⬆︎ECG Room

203
00:19:29,383 --> 00:19:32,673
You have to make that sign bigger. How can we...

204
00:19:34,693 --> 00:19:37,123
It's that way.

205
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,913
Aish.

206
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:42,383
Ah, seriously. Aish.

207
00:19:48,573 --> 00:19:51,083
  The Department of Radiology

208
00:19:59,683 --> 00:20:01,553
500 won!

209
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:31,453
Ahjusshi, you should get checked out, too.

210
00:20:32,703 --> 00:20:35,343
I should change the water bottle.

211
00:20:37,883 --> 00:20:38,743
What is it?

212
00:20:38,743 --> 00:20:40,793
A bus and a truck were in a collision, I heard it's a huge mess.

213
00:20:40,793 --> 00:20:43,313
- Why did they call us? 
 - Doctors of General Surgery are all gone for a conference.

214
00:20:43,313 --> 00:20:45,363
Why on a day like this of all days?

215
00:20:45,363 --> 00:20:48,263
- How many patients?
- There are 15 coming to our hospital.

216
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:54,983
- Did they arrive?
- They are coming in 2-3 minutes.

217
00:20:54,983 --> 00:20:58,713
Go try to get all the beds and bring all the blood right now.

218
00:20:58,713 --> 00:21:01,003
Please notify  Radiology, Orthopedics, and Neurosurgery.

219
00:21:01,003 --> 00:21:02,493
Yes, understood.

220
00:21:04,123 --> 00:21:07,043
Now it's our turn.

221
00:21:17,963 --> 00:21:20,603
-Patient, you have to leave... 
-Wait.

222
00:21:20,603 --> 00:21:22,443
Have you had the x-ray?

223
00:21:22,443 --> 00:21:24,203
Yes. But...

224
00:21:24,203 --> 00:21:27,563
Then, can you please wait a little while? When a doctor comes, I'll ask them to look at it right away.

225
00:21:27,563 --> 00:21:29,073
Excuse me.

226
00:21:29,073 --> 00:21:33,103
Not me, but can you take a look at my dad?

227
00:21:33,103 --> 00:21:34,863
Why your dad?

228
00:21:34,863 --> 00:21:38,803
My dad said that it's been difficult to breathe since a few days ago.

229
00:21:38,823 --> 00:21:42,423
Even when we went for the x-ray, he was struggling to breathe.

230
00:21:42,423 --> 00:21:44,143
Is that so?

231
00:21:44,143 --> 00:21:47,053
Wait a moment. Excuse me, Doctor.

232
00:22:12,323 --> 00:22:15,143
BP 80/60. We've infused 2 medications. He's floating in and out of consciousness.

233
00:22:15,143 --> 00:22:18,873
Patient, what is your name? Patient?

234
00:22:20,483 --> 00:22:23,263
Cardiac Arrest. Perform CPR.

235
00:22:23,263 --> 00:22:25,923
Give him an ampoule of Epinephrine.

236
00:22:31,263 --> 00:22:33,693
Get a line.

237
00:22:40,803 --> 00:22:42,803
BP 80/40 and pulse 115.

238
00:22:42,803 --> 00:22:45,083
He said he is okay, but ...

239
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,703
Check if the artery is damaged.

240
00:22:52,323 --> 00:22:54,863
BP 95/60, pulse 60.

241
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,563
I think he has an open femoral fracture and a pelvic fracture.

242
00:23:00,563 --> 00:23:02,753
Get a CT scan, order labs and give him normal saline.

243
00:23:02,753 --> 00:23:04,903
Check the CT to determine whether there is internal bleeding.

244
00:23:04,903 --> 00:23:06,613
Yes. Let's go.

245
00:23:06,613 --> 00:23:07,923
Ow!

246
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,923
- Level of consciousness?
- Unconscious!

247
00:23:24,983 --> 00:23:26,783
Connect a monitor and start a line and give normal saline.

248
00:23:26,783 --> 00:23:28,643
Okay.

249
00:23:39,863 --> 00:23:42,613
Prepare for irrigation.

250
00:23:44,703 --> 00:23:46,383
Forceps.

251
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:57,733
CPR, CPR!

252
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:03,963
There we go.

253
00:24:40,483 --> 00:24:42,853
Dad, are you okay?

254
00:24:44,033 --> 00:24:46,033
Yes.

255
00:24:50,223 --> 00:24:53,013
- Please help me.
- Just a moment.

256
00:25:12,273 --> 00:25:14,233
Doctor Yoo.

257
00:25:16,413 --> 00:25:17,493
Are you in pain?

258
00:25:17,493 --> 00:25:20,133
We said that we were hurt first, but why didn't you see to us first?

259
00:25:20,133 --> 00:25:23,293
It's because that's the hospital's procedure.  The ambulance comes first.

260
00:25:23,293 --> 00:25:25,463
Ah, Jung Min?

261
00:25:25,463 --> 00:25:29,833
Your finger is slightly fractured. The splint was done well.  It'll heal in no time.

262
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:31,793
Take a look at my dad, please.

263
00:25:31,793 --> 00:25:33,683
Your dad?

264
00:25:36,343 --> 00:25:37,543
Where are you in pain?

265
00:25:37,543 --> 00:25:38,963
Doctor Oh, have a look here please!

266
00:25:38,963 --> 00:25:40,183
Okay.

267
00:25:40,183 --> 00:25:43,353
Since a couple of days ago, he's been saying that even if he moves a little, it's hard to breathe.

268
00:25:43,373 --> 00:25:45,693
Last night he was unable to sleep.

269
00:25:45,693 --> 00:25:47,143
Do you take any medication regularly?

270
00:25:47,143 --> 00:25:50,093
He is taking medicine for high blood pressure and his stomach isn't that healthy, so

271
00:25:50,093 --> 00:25:52,943
he also takes stomach medicine in the morning and at night.

272
00:25:52,943 --> 00:25:56,213
Since a few days ago, he said his back hurt, so he used a pain relief patch.

273
00:25:56,213 --> 00:25:59,043
But he keeps saying that he is sore.

274
00:25:59,053 --> 00:26:00,993
Really...

275
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:03,123
Is it pneumothorax?

276
00:26:03,123 --> 00:26:05,743
Can you please breathe in deeply?

277
00:26:07,213 --> 00:26:09,383
I don't think it is pneumothorax.

278
00:26:09,423 --> 00:26:10,363
The heart.

279
00:26:10,363 --> 00:26:12,183
Sorry?

280
00:26:12,193 --> 00:26:13,303
Are you his guardian?

281
00:26:13,303 --> 00:26:15,763
Not really.

282
00:26:16,823 --> 00:26:17,663
Doctor Oh!

283
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:19,163
Okay.

284
00:26:19,173 --> 00:26:21,023
-Doctor Kim.
-Yes?

285
00:26:21,023 --> 00:26:23,713
- Can you order a thoracic X-ray and the blood labs for this patient?
- Sure.

286
00:26:23,713 --> 00:26:26,833
Please clean the wound.

287
00:26:27,733 --> 00:26:30,283
- Are you able to stand up?
 - Yes.

288
00:26:30,283 --> 00:26:34,813
If you take that elevator and get off at the 3rd floor, you'll see a green sign-

289
00:26:34,813 --> 00:26:38,033
Whether it's green or blue, stop yapping and take him there personally, huh?

290
00:26:38,033 --> 00:26:39,283
Shall I?

291
00:26:39,283 --> 00:26:41,963
Stand up please.

292
00:26:41,963 --> 00:26:43,603
Come this way!

293
00:26:50,513 --> 00:26:52,403
Aigoo...

294
00:26:59,933 --> 00:27:01,683
Since when was your dad's ankle swollen like this?

295
00:27:01,683 --> 00:27:04,443
I'm seeing it for the first time, too.

296
00:27:04,443 --> 00:27:05,893
Does he urinate often?

297
00:27:05,893 --> 00:27:08,573
He almost never goes to the bathroom.

298
00:27:08,573 --> 00:27:10,923
- When did he start taking medication for high blood pressure?
 - Mister.

299
00:27:12,403 --> 00:27:14,553
What are you doing right now?

300
00:27:14,553 --> 00:27:17,113
His condition doesn't seem too good.

301
00:27:17,113 --> 00:27:18,533
Are you a doctor?

302
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:22,243
Well, I am but I'm not.

303
00:27:23,053 --> 00:27:24,853
Dad!

304
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:27,273
Are you okay?

305
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:31,413
We have to get an X-ray.

306
00:27:31,413 --> 00:27:34,133
He's not breathing.

307
00:27:36,603 --> 00:27:39,753
Over here!

308
00:27:57,263 --> 00:27:59,683
What are you doing? Put in the intubation.

309
00:27:59,683 --> 00:28:01,113
It's a heart arrest! Start CPR right now!

310
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:03,093
Who are you to tell me what to do?

311
00:28:03,093 --> 00:28:04,203
I'm telling you, it's his heart!

312
00:28:04,203 --> 00:28:08,053
Please call the ER right now! Hurry up!

313
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:09,233
Look at his heart.

314
00:28:09,233 --> 00:28:11,543
Really!

315
00:28:13,103 --> 00:28:17,013
Why is it like this? Why can't I hear anything?

316
00:28:17,013 --> 00:28:18,853
Bring a defilbrillator!

317
00:28:18,853 --> 00:28:19,833
Perform cardiac massage.

318
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:20,673
Massage what?

319
00:28:20,673 --> 00:28:23,723
Are you a doctor or a thug? I said to do CPR!

320
00:28:34,653 --> 00:28:36,553
Charge 200 joules.

321
00:28:36,553 --> 00:28:37,933
Ahjusshi, what are you doing?!

322
00:28:37,933 --> 00:28:39,843
Get back!

323
00:28:41,483 --> 00:28:43,463
Once more!

324
00:28:49,183 --> 00:28:52,403
The heartbeat has returned. He's had a myocardial infarction and is in renal failure. Surgery is needed right away!

325
00:28:52,403 --> 00:28:54,363
Get an operating room.

326
00:28:54,363 --> 00:28:57,183
But who's going to do the surgery?

327
00:29:03,513 --> 00:29:05,453
Shock.

328
00:29:07,213 --> 00:29:09,933
Once more. Shock!

329
00:29:12,683 --> 00:29:13,893
Prepare for surgery immediately.

330
00:29:13,893 --> 00:29:15,583
Yes, understood.

331
00:29:17,553 --> 00:29:21,113
- What?
- Chief, we have a patient in need of an urgent surgery.

332
00:29:21,113 --> 00:29:24,453
- What's wrong?
- He's a patient Doctor Oh sent after doing a blood test.

333
00:29:24,453 --> 00:29:26,413
The patient has had a myocardial infarction (heart attack) and is in renal (kidney) failure.

334
00:29:26,413 --> 00:29:28,353
Renal failure?

335
00:29:30,283 --> 00:29:33,583
Doctor Oh! What's with the patient you sent after taking a blood test?

336
00:29:35,843 --> 00:29:39,453
Order coronary angiography and Echocardiogram first.  Call Dr. Eun first.

337
00:29:39,493 --> 00:29:41,453
Huh? Aren't you coming?

338
00:29:41,453 --> 00:29:43,393
Calm down.

339
00:29:44,303 --> 00:29:46,963
I'll deal with an amputation patient and will be right there.

340
00:29:51,313 --> 00:29:53,243
I get it.

341
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:15,233
- But who's going to do the surgery?
- Chief Han said he's coming.

342
00:30:15,243 --> 00:30:18,133
The Chief? But the amputation patient is serious.

343
00:30:18,133 --> 00:30:19,743
The patient will be able to last till then, right?

344
00:30:19,743 --> 00:30:21,363
You said the patient has had a myocardial infarction (MI) and a septal rupture.

345
00:30:21,363 --> 00:30:23,243
I thought he was going to die from the arrest little while ago.

346
00:30:23,243 --> 00:30:26,273
- It'll be really dangerous if he goes into cardiac arrest again.
- What?

347
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:33,483
Oh, Chief, please pick up the phone.

348
00:30:34,383 --> 00:30:36,373
Oh, Chief, please!

349
00:30:39,123 --> 00:30:41,693
Oh gosh!

350
00:30:46,433 --> 00:30:48,403
Chief! Please!

351
00:30:57,243 --> 00:31:00,943
If we don't hurry,  the patient might expire (die).

352
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:03,243
Should we call Professor Moon?

353
00:31:03,243 --> 00:31:05,863
There's nothing else we can do.

354
00:31:05,863 --> 00:31:08,543
What's expire?

355
00:31:10,913 --> 00:31:12,833
Professor?

356
00:31:13,553 --> 00:31:15,593
I can't do it!

357
00:31:15,593 --> 00:31:17,553
Don't you know I'm banned from medical treatment?

358
00:31:17,553 --> 00:31:22,453
Hey, Kim Chi Gyu, if the patient expires, Han Jae Joon is the one on duty.

359
00:31:22,453 --> 00:31:25,883
It's the new chief of the  Cardiothoracic Department, Han Jae Jun's fault.

360
00:31:25,883 --> 00:31:27,983
Hang up!

361
00:31:30,653 --> 00:31:34,983
Pro...Professor. Ah!

362
00:31:35,933 --> 00:31:37,853
That patient is unlucky.

363
00:31:37,853 --> 00:31:40,263
Doctor Eun, please help me.

364
00:31:40,263 --> 00:31:41,603
Please help me.

365
00:31:41,603 --> 00:31:43,903
Is that something that'll work the way I want it to?

366
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:45,593
Doctor Eun.

367
00:31:48,983 --> 00:31:53,583
Expire...that's a bad word, right?

368
00:31:54,683 --> 00:31:57,053
It's not a good word.

369
00:31:57,633 --> 00:32:00,293
Please do it, Ahjusshi.

370
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:03,853
If I act recklessly and fool around, my doctor's license will be suspended.

371
00:32:03,853 --> 00:32:06,403
I still need to earn lots of money.

372
00:32:07,433 --> 00:32:09,823
Please do it.

373
00:32:14,723 --> 00:32:17,663
I can't really say I am a doctor, but

374
00:32:17,663 --> 00:32:20,233
I'm kind of an expensive guy.

375
00:32:37,743 --> 00:32:40,223
Is this enough?

376
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:46,233
Of course not.

377
00:33:02,503 --> 00:33:06,913
I want to be with my dad, Ahjusshi.

378
00:33:35,803 --> 00:33:37,673
- What is this?
- It's a water bottle.

379
00:33:37,673 --> 00:33:39,863
Move it quickly.

380
00:33:41,183 --> 00:33:43,813
Where did this ahjusshi go?

381
00:33:46,683 --> 00:33:50,613
Ah, I'm going to go crazy. Why isn't he coming?

382
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:53,213
Why isn't he coming?

383
00:33:53,213 --> 00:33:56,233
It's okay. Chief Han came.

384
00:34:06,653 --> 00:34:08,953
  From now on,

385
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:12,693
  do not ever forget the fact

386
00:34:15,693 --> 00:34:21,083
  that you are a doctor.

387
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:26,953
Ah, Father. Seriously.

388
00:34:29,963 --> 00:34:34,553
If the patient expires, Han Jae Joon is going to be blamed for it.

389
00:34:34,553 --> 00:34:36,573
It's his fault.

390
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:05,403
I am going to start CABG and Septal Rupture repair.

391
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:08,703
Wait, are you Chief Han?

392
00:35:10,363 --> 00:35:11,993
Chief Han?

393
00:35:11,993 --> 00:35:13,283
Scalpel.

394
00:35:13,283 --> 00:35:15,913
Wait a minute. Stop the scalpel.

395
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:18,633
Look here!

396
00:35:24,383 --> 00:35:25,953
Bovie!

397
00:35:36,373 --> 00:35:38,673
Are you doing the surgery on a corpse?

398
00:35:38,673 --> 00:35:40,513
Why isn't he bleeding even though a cut was made?

399
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,823
This is the first time I'm seeing something like this too, Professor.

400
00:35:51,923 --> 00:35:54,323
You worked hard, Director Han.

401
00:36:04,473 --> 00:36:07,883
I will be right there after going to see a patient with GI issue.  Go to the surgery room #1.

402
00:36:07,883 --> 00:36:08,833
Surgery room #1?

403
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:12,493
I heard that the patient who you ordered the blood labs for seems to have had an MI.

404
00:36:19,733 --> 00:36:21,833
  Surgeon for operation: Han Jae Joon

405
00:36:33,123 --> 00:36:34,683
What happened?

406
00:36:34,683 --> 00:36:36,483
Doctor Oh.

407
00:36:38,323 --> 00:36:40,903
-Thug, hold tightly.
-Okay.

408
00:36:42,013 --> 00:36:43,663
Who's the surgeon performing the surgery?

409
00:36:43,663 --> 00:36:45,853
Give me bigger forceps.

410
00:36:46,843 --> 00:36:48,873
- Who are you?!
- Back away.

411
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,653
- I'm asking who you are.
- Me?

412
00:36:50,653 --> 00:36:52,313
Yes, you.

413
00:36:52,313 --> 00:36:54,343
A doctor. Satisfied?

414
00:36:54,343 --> 00:36:56,003
Cut.

415
00:36:59,723 --> 00:37:01,553
If you're not going to perform the surgery, stay still.

416
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:04,633
Doctor Eun, stop the procedure right now.

417
00:37:07,463 --> 00:37:10,173
Okay, I understand. If you're going to perform the surgery, I'll move.

418
00:37:10,173 --> 00:37:12,783
I don't care as long as the patient is safe.

419
00:37:12,783 --> 00:37:16,363
I am done with the septal rupture repair. You just need to work on the CABG.

420
00:37:16,363 --> 00:37:18,953
It's not a surgery you can handle, Doctor Oh.

421
00:37:18,953 --> 00:37:21,433
- Doctor Eun.
- Calm down.

422
00:37:21,433 --> 00:37:24,263
He's not Chief Han, but

423
00:37:24,263 --> 00:37:25,663
I think he is trustworthy.

424
00:37:25,683 --> 00:37:28,153
You can't leave a patient's surgery to someone we don't even know.

425
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:31,013
We need to save the patient first. We can reveal his identity afterwards.

426
00:37:31,013 --> 00:37:33,193
Okay?

427
00:37:33,193 --> 00:37:35,573
Okay, let's continue.

428
00:37:37,033 --> 00:37:38,823
Gauze.

429
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:50,723
- Is it the security office?
 -Yes, please speak.

430
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:13,493

431
00:38:25,463 --> 00:38:27,793
- Yes.
- Just a moment.

432
00:38:33,753 --> 00:38:35,273
Did it end already?

433
00:38:35,273 --> 00:38:39,763
It was quick. Whoever it was, he was amazing.

434
00:38:52,113 --> 00:38:54,953
Excuse me, Doctor! Just a moment.

435
00:38:59,493 --> 00:39:01,003
Excuse me, Doctor.

436
00:39:01,003 --> 00:39:03,823
Excuse me. Excuse me!

437
00:39:07,063 --> 00:39:09,503
Catch him!

438
00:39:13,023 --> 00:39:16,473
What is this? Press the buttons first.

439
00:39:16,533 --> 00:39:18,903
This way!

440
00:39:29,893 --> 00:39:31,823
Dad!

441
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:41,753
Don't worry. Your dad will be fine.

442
00:39:43,073 --> 00:39:45,153
Want to go together?

443
00:39:46,823 --> 00:39:48,453
Gosh!

444
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:52,993
Who's the surgeon that performed the surgery?

445
00:39:52,993 --> 00:39:55,263
Ah, I don't know either.

446
00:39:55,263 --> 00:39:59,113
Why don't you know? You were with the patient the whole time.

447
00:39:59,113 --> 00:40:00,533
That's true, but...

448
00:40:00,533 --> 00:40:03,023
  Look at his heart!

449
00:40:03,893 --> 00:40:07,203
Huh?  Wait...

450
00:40:08,753 --> 00:40:11,033
Aish!

451
00:40:11,563 --> 00:40:13,323
Oh!

452
00:40:14,523 --> 00:40:19,213
I am crazy. Why did I do this crazy thing?

453
00:40:21,773 --> 00:40:23,973
My money. Aish.

454
00:40:43,533 --> 00:40:47,623
Maybe you saw it wrong. How can a person who delivers water bottles perform that kind of surgery?

455
00:40:47,623 --> 00:40:50,773
Aish, he was definitely holding a water bottle.

456
00:40:50,773 --> 00:40:52,753
Really?

457
00:40:52,753 --> 00:40:58,393
But ... his skill was clearly that of a person who's done hundreds of open-heart surgeries.

458
00:41:06,303 --> 00:41:09,043
Great! I saved the patient and got slapped.

459
00:41:09,043 --> 00:41:12,623
A person, who's not even a doctor, performing a surgery on a patient is attempting murder. Don't you know that?

460
00:41:12,623 --> 00:41:14,133
I said I'm a doctor.

461
00:41:14,133 --> 00:41:15,443
How can something like you be a doctor?

462
00:41:15,443 --> 00:41:17,543
Well, I guess I'm not really a doctor.

463
00:41:17,543 --> 00:41:20,193
But do you think you can say that?

464
00:41:20,193 --> 00:41:23,823
- What?
- You ran away after seeing the patient.

465
00:41:26,073 --> 00:41:29,273
Do you know what they call someone like you or me?

466
00:41:29,273 --> 00:41:30,743
A quack.

467
00:41:30,743 --> 00:41:34,943
Not just a quack. A real quack! Understand?

468
00:41:38,813 --> 00:41:42,583
You... really? Aish.

469
00:41:44,633 --> 00:41:46,193
What's the matter?

470
00:41:46,193 --> 00:41:51,513
Dr. Oh, the patient has torsades de pointes and the pressure in the pulmonary artery is going up.

471
00:41:52,873 --> 00:41:54,083
What's the problem?

472
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:55,153
Doctor Keum, hi.

473
00:41:55,153 --> 00:41:58,833
Hello.

474
00:41:58,853 --> 00:42:00,503
What...what's the problem?

475
00:42:00,503 --> 00:42:02,763
It's the patient the water bottle delivery man performed a surgery on.

476
00:42:02,763 --> 00:42:05,043
Water bottle?

477
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:16,633
The patient you did surgery on is in a critical state right now.

478
00:42:16,633 --> 00:42:19,353
Call the police immediately.

479
00:42:19,353 --> 00:42:22,413
- What are the symptoms?
- Why should I tell you?

480
00:42:22,413 --> 00:42:26,563
Torsades de pointes and high pressure in the pulmonary artery, right?

481
00:42:26,563 --> 00:42:29,153
You are truly a quack.

482
00:42:29,153 --> 00:42:31,223
Tell him to inject magnesium.

483
00:42:31,223 --> 00:42:32,823
Inject 20 mL of magnesium.

484
00:42:32,823 --> 00:42:34,683
Yes.

485
00:42:43,893 --> 00:42:46,533
Yes, that's what Chief Han said to do too.

486
00:42:46,533 --> 00:42:48,383
His general condition wasn't too good,

487
00:42:48,383 --> 00:42:51,693
so after surgery, there is an imbalance of minerals in his body.

488
00:42:53,053 --> 00:42:55,293
It's not a common occurrence, but it does happen.

489
00:42:55,293 --> 00:42:58,483
A quack will never know, right?

490
00:42:59,413 --> 00:43:00,813
Let me talk to the Chief.

491
00:43:00,813 --> 00:43:02,543
Hey, there's no point in asking.

492
00:43:02,543 --> 00:43:05,323
Jae Joon, is the patient okay?

493
00:43:05,323 --> 00:43:08,463
Yeah. He is stable now.

494
00:43:18,933 --> 00:43:23,383
-Hey, hey! Let go!
-Where do you think you're going?

495
00:43:23,383 --> 00:43:26,453
What did I do wrong?

496
00:43:26,453 --> 00:43:29,343
I seriously need to go out for delivery.

497
00:43:29,343 --> 00:43:32,113
I'm going to get in trouble with Chang Yi.

498
00:43:32,113 --> 00:43:34,523
If you're done with me, you should just let me go.

499
00:43:34,523 --> 00:43:38,763
Coincidentally you happen to be right, but you can't just leave.

500
00:43:39,513 --> 00:43:43,123
- Why? 
 - It's because you did something wrong.

501
00:43:45,563 --> 00:43:47,553
What did I do?

502
00:43:47,553 --> 00:43:49,533
Even though you have a doctor's license,

503
00:43:49,533 --> 00:43:53,183
if this isn't your hospital, you need to get permission ahead of time.

504
00:43:53,183 --> 00:43:55,233
That was because it was urgent.

505
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:59,383
So your doctor's license can be suspended.

506
00:43:59,383 --> 00:44:02,713
It's seriously getting twisted.

507
00:44:09,973 --> 00:44:13,203
It has been 2 years since you've gotten your doctor's degree.

508
00:44:15,043 --> 00:44:16,933
Which medical school did you graduate from?

509
00:44:16,933 --> 00:44:19,823
I'm from a "which"  medical school. Is it okay now?

510
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,313
Gladly, the patient is okay.

511
00:44:22,313 --> 00:44:27,033
But I hope that you don't come to our hospital again.

512
00:44:27,033 --> 00:44:30,303
There is a normal doctor here.

513
00:44:30,303 --> 00:44:33,733
Don't worry. I don't ever want to come again.

514
00:44:34,543 --> 00:44:36,883
By the way...

515
00:44:39,653 --> 00:44:41,363
My money.

516
00:44:42,053 --> 00:44:43,713
You took my surgery fee.

517
00:44:43,713 --> 00:44:46,453
Surgery fee?

518
00:44:46,453 --> 00:44:51,633
Okay, let's just say you stole it. Stole.

519
00:44:53,053 --> 00:44:55,223
Work hard.

520
00:45:01,033 --> 00:45:02,443
Are you really going to just send him off like this?

521
00:45:02,443 --> 00:45:04,573
Either way, we almost lost the patient.

522
00:45:04,573 --> 00:45:08,853
If the public finds out, then we're going to end up admitting that Myeongwoo Hospital is lacking doctors.

523
00:45:08,853 --> 00:45:10,273
But still...

524
00:45:10,273 --> 00:45:12,893
But what does he mean by surgery fee?

525
00:45:12,893 --> 00:45:15,413
I don't know either.

526
00:45:39,673 --> 00:45:43,103
I get slapped and get bullied out of my money.  Darn it.

527
00:45:43,103 --> 00:45:45,063
Hyung.

528
00:45:46,373 --> 00:45:49,963
I told you I wasn't going to come here. Aish.

529
00:45:49,963 --> 00:45:52,883
Did something happen?

530
00:45:52,933 --> 00:45:54,943
Never mind, never mind.

531
00:45:54,943 --> 00:45:59,043
Thank you for coming here. I'm going.

532
00:45:59,043 --> 00:46:04,193
No way, Hyung. I came here because my mom said she was feeling dizzy.

533
00:46:04,193 --> 00:46:06,613
Why'd you come here when you have me?

534
00:46:08,163 --> 00:46:10,813
Hey, you. Wait a minute!

535
00:46:11,853 --> 00:46:15,393
Are they joking? They just let me go.

536
00:46:15,393 --> 00:46:17,473
You, call me. You're dead.

537
00:46:17,473 --> 00:46:20,363
Stop! Stop! Just a moment!

538
00:46:20,363 --> 00:46:24,823
Stop! Hey, water boy!

539
00:46:31,523 --> 00:46:34,403
Sorry, excuse me.

540
00:46:52,693 --> 00:46:55,493
Here's number 76!

541
00:46:58,233 --> 00:47:01,603
Just a moment! Stop for a moment!

542
00:47:03,183 --> 00:47:04,883
Stop!

543
00:47:04,883 --> 00:47:08,783
Stop! Stop! Stop!

544
00:47:08,783 --> 00:47:12,173
Stop! Stop!

545
00:47:12,173 --> 00:47:14,483
Stop!

546
00:47:14,483 --> 00:47:16,733
Sto...

547
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:34,273
Come here immediately.

548
00:47:34,273 --> 00:47:36,103
Hyung, that's not it. Previously...

549
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:38,783
If you don't come here right now, I'm going to get rid of all the water containers, got it?

550
00:47:38,783 --> 00:47:41,313
- Hyung, listen to me for a second.
- I'm hanging up.

551
00:47:41,313 --> 00:47:44,063
What karma!

552
00:47:52,593 --> 00:47:54,683
 Garibong Clinic

553
00:47:54,683 --> 00:47:57,563
My car's super fast.

554
00:48:18,433 --> 00:48:20,163
- What are you?
- Me? Oh.

555
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:22,763
I am Moon Hyung Wook from Myeongwoo University Hospital.

556
00:48:22,763 --> 00:48:24,683
Aish.

557
00:48:33,053 --> 00:48:35,743
I have something to say! Please open the door.

558
00:48:35,743 --> 00:48:39,003
We've already settled everything, so just leave. Okay?

559
00:48:39,003 --> 00:48:42,063
I think there was a misunderstanding earlier. Hey there!

560
00:48:42,063 --> 00:48:45,663
I didn't come here to bother you.

561
00:48:47,953 --> 00:48:50,513
Oh, wow.

562
00:48:50,533 --> 00:48:53,743
I came here to give you an opportunity.

563
00:48:53,743 --> 00:48:55,693
Open the door!

564
00:48:55,693 --> 00:48:57,783
Who are you?

565
00:49:05,643 --> 00:49:07,623
Hyung.

566
00:49:18,543 --> 00:49:21,463
Why is a doctor from Myeongwoo University Hospital here?

567
00:49:22,433 --> 00:49:24,543
Thanks to you, I've went through a lot.

568
00:49:24,543 --> 00:49:26,563
Ah, let go and speak. It hurts.

569
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:28,603
- It hurts!
- A day's wage won't be enough. Give me at least a week's worth.

570
00:49:28,603 --> 00:49:32,063
Ow, ow. More than that, let me look at Jae Hee's face again.

571
00:49:32,063 --> 00:49:34,023
Why?

572
00:49:36,353 --> 00:49:37,973
Hoon.

573
00:49:37,973 --> 00:49:39,043
Why?

574
00:49:39,043 --> 00:49:42,823
Hyung, I think I saw this unni.

575
00:49:42,823 --> 00:49:45,773
This jerk, who do you think you're fooling?

576
00:49:45,773 --> 00:49:48,543
Seriously. At the hospital earlier.

577
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:50,693
What?

578
00:49:55,763 --> 00:49:58,063
Oh gosh!

579
00:50:06,783 --> 00:50:09,463
Let's go to the hospital together.

580
00:50:11,023 --> 00:50:12,983
Really?

581
00:50:13,733 --> 00:50:15,193
You want me to recruit more doctors?

582
00:50:15,193 --> 00:50:17,453
There's a big lack of doctors.

583
00:50:17,453 --> 00:50:21,913
But there aren't even 20 people who majored in the thoracic department this year in the whole country.

584
00:50:21,913 --> 00:50:26,383
Because we're Myeongwoo University Hospital, we're able to get specialized doctors each year.

585
00:50:26,383 --> 00:50:30,033
The reason why I came here is because you said that

586
00:50:30,033 --> 00:50:32,713
you want to establish Myeongwoo as the world's best hospital.

587
00:50:32,713 --> 00:50:34,793
I believe that Myeongwoo, without any internal opposition,

588
00:50:34,793 --> 00:50:38,293
should have more than enough doctors.

589
00:50:38,293 --> 00:50:41,253
Well, since Doctor Oh will be transferring to Management Planning,

590
00:50:41,253 --> 00:50:44,243
I guess we should recruit more doctors.

591
00:50:45,843 --> 00:50:48,673
Alright. I will do something about the budget,

592
00:50:48,673 --> 00:50:51,683
so look for someone who will be worthwhile.

593
00:51:03,483 --> 00:51:04,883
Do you know?

594
00:51:04,883 --> 00:51:08,963
Ahjumma's daughter gave me a fabulous car as a present.

595
00:51:08,963 --> 00:51:12,713
So I brought a present to give her.

596
00:51:12,713 --> 00:51:14,823
Do you know what it is?

597
00:51:15,983 --> 00:51:18,313
It's you, Ahjumma.

598
00:51:18,313 --> 00:51:21,933
So until you see her, you can't die.

599
00:51:21,933 --> 00:51:23,993
Okay?

600
00:51:31,413 --> 00:51:32,743
What do you mean the management planning office?

601
00:51:32,743 --> 00:51:34,243
It's not decided yet.

602
00:51:34,243 --> 00:51:36,323
Does the Board Chairman ever say something that's not decided yet?

603
00:51:36,323 --> 00:51:38,333
Jae Joon, that...

604
00:51:40,823 --> 00:51:44,483
Hey! Doctor Oh!

605
00:51:58,683 --> 00:52:00,493
What are you doing here?

606
00:52:00,493 --> 00:52:02,753
What do you mean what am I doing here?

607
00:52:02,753 --> 00:52:06,173
Since you gave me a present, I came to give you one. Give and take.

608
00:52:06,173 --> 00:52:09,373
Let's just say I received it. Thanks.

609
00:52:09,373 --> 00:52:12,583
If someone older tells you something, just listen.

610
00:52:12,583 --> 00:52:14,553
The present I want to give you is...

611
00:52:14,553 --> 00:52:19,063
If you want to continue your role as a director of a branch office, then stop acting up.

612
00:52:19,063 --> 00:52:20,313
What?

613
00:52:20,313 --> 00:52:23,233
Do you still not know why I asked

614
00:52:23,233 --> 00:52:25,863
if I could move to the management planning office?

615
00:52:25,863 --> 00:52:28,233
You...

616
00:52:35,303 --> 00:52:38,553
Fine. You just wait.

617
00:52:38,553 --> 00:52:42,553
I have a present that will flatten your smug nose.

618
00:52:47,083 --> 00:52:50,573
I've transferred you to the main hospital wing, so you have to stay healthy, okay?

619
00:52:50,573 --> 00:52:56,613
By the way... you said you wanted this, right?

620
00:52:58,913 --> 00:53:02,423
But you can not lose it.

621
00:53:37,823 --> 00:53:40,993
Hey, hey. It's back here.

622
00:53:42,913 --> 00:53:44,583
- Did you check it?
- Pardon?

623
00:53:44,583 --> 00:53:46,493
I told you to check on Doctor Song Jae Hee.

624
00:53:46,493 --> 00:53:48,393
Ah, Doctor Song Jae Hee?

625
00:53:48,393 --> 00:53:51,023
- Where is she right now?
- She's in the drug room.

626
00:53:51,023 --> 00:53:52,793
Drug room.

627
00:53:53,953 --> 00:53:57,093
Aigoo, let's go.

628
00:54:00,873 --> 00:54:03,403
Oh, where's the drug room?

629
00:54:03,403 --> 00:54:05,963
Over there.

630
00:54:25,523 --> 00:54:28,433
 Doctor Song Jae Hee

631
00:54:51,953 --> 00:54:54,413
Who are you?

632
00:54:55,853 --> 00:54:58,113
Water bottle?

633
00:54:59,913 --> 00:55:02,403
Ah, who's Song Jae Hee?

634
00:55:02,403 --> 00:55:04,463
Me. Why?

635
00:55:14,303 --> 00:55:15,743
Please do it quickly.

636
00:55:15,743 --> 00:55:18,343
It will be ready soon, Doctor.

637
00:55:19,243 --> 00:55:22,743
Hyung...the doctor I saw...

638
00:55:24,813 --> 00:55:27,693
You said you were Doctor Park. Since you came here,

639
00:55:27,693 --> 00:55:30,283
let's talk for a moment at my laboratory.

640
00:55:30,283 --> 00:55:32,433
It seems like you're looking for a person.

641
00:55:32,433 --> 00:55:34,243
I can help you with all of that.

642
00:55:34,243 --> 00:55:36,183
You know her name and you said you even have a picture.

643
00:55:36,183 --> 00:55:39,133
If I use my money and ask people to find her, they will find her soon.

644
00:55:39,133 --> 00:55:42,083
- Do you really have that much money?
- Me?

645
00:55:42,083 --> 00:55:46,163
Of course. Do you know how many years I was a department chief here?

646
00:55:46,163 --> 00:55:49,433
- Can you give me $500,000?
- $500,000?

647
00:55:49,433 --> 00:55:53,433
Hey, if we're going to talk about money, let's at least try to reason it out. Even though it might not be right now--

648
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:54,743
Right now.

649
00:55:54,743 --> 00:55:57,533
