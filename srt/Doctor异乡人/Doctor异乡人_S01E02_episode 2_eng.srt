1
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:31,534

2
00:00:46,404 --> 00:00:48,664
Father.

3
00:01:03,034 --> 00:01:07,284
Father! Father! Father!

4
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:12,194
Father! Father! Father!

5
00:01:21,534 --> 00:01:25,174
No, Father.

6
00:02:02,884 --> 00:02:05,554
Father!

7
00:02:20,104 --> 00:02:22,224
Father!

8
00:02:23,704 --> 00:02:25,644
No...

9
00:02:33,734 --> 00:02:38,654
Get the operating room ready. Get ready for surgery! Surgery!

10
00:02:39,144 --> 00:02:40,924
Hoon.

11
00:02:53,224 --> 00:02:56,334
Make me

12
00:02:56,334 --> 00:02:59,954
just one promise.

13
00:02:59,954 --> 00:03:01,984
Father...

14
00:03:01,984 --> 00:03:04,634
From now on...

15
00:03:05,634 --> 00:03:09,424
The fact that you are a doctor,

16
00:03:11,114 --> 00:03:13,914
don't ever

17
00:03:14,734 --> 00:03:18,064
forget that.

18
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:40,704
Father. Father.

19
00:03:41,914 --> 00:03:48,224
Father! Father.

20
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:44,664
Hey, Dr. Park.

21
00:04:46,334 --> 00:04:50,574
The government has high expectations of you to bring in foreign funding, Dr. Park.

22
00:04:50,574 --> 00:04:53,174
Do your best.

23
00:04:54,244 --> 00:04:59,034
If not, you'll end up like your father.

24
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:18,234
What's the name of the girl Dr. Park just operated on?

25
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,874
I believe it's Song Jae Hee.

26
00:05:19,874 --> 00:05:24,374
Find out for sure. In particular what her relationship is to Park  Hoon.

27
00:05:24,374 --> 00:05:27,204
Find out the specifics.

28
00:05:27,204 --> 00:05:31,854
 Episode 2

29
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:53,394
Jang Seok Joo! Jang Seok Joo!

30
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:58,214
Jang Seok Joo!

31
00:06:28,744 --> 00:06:31,034
Dr. Park.

32
00:06:35,884 --> 00:06:39,234
The weather here is pretty chilly.

33
00:06:39,234 --> 00:06:41,334
What kind of work brings you here, Comrade?

34
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,164
What work?

35
00:06:43,164 --> 00:06:46,594
I came here to help you obtain foreign funding.

36
00:06:55,384 --> 00:06:57,424
Oh, also,

37
00:06:57,934 --> 00:07:03,304
I was wondering who that girl was, and it turns out that she was your classmate from Pyongyang Medical School.

38
00:07:03,304 --> 00:07:06,144
Fate is really odd.

39
00:07:11,934 --> 00:07:13,594
As our nation, the Republic of Korea,

40
00:07:13,594 --> 00:07:17,724
used IMF crisis as an opportunity to improve our economy,

41
00:07:17,724 --> 00:07:24,304
this Korean community in Hungary can become one of the largest influences to the economy here.

42
00:07:24,304 --> 00:07:29,064
I, Jang Seok Joo, dare to say it.

43
00:07:42,664 --> 00:07:46,034
Even for the presidential candidate election, a lot of funds will be needed.

44
00:07:50,664 --> 00:07:55,164
We're all-in for Assemblyman Jang at this upcoming candidate election.

45
00:07:55,814 --> 00:07:58,874
We'll prepare another meeting sometime.

46
00:08:08,624 --> 00:08:11,624
These are the pictures that the Embassy acquired.

47
00:08:12,434 --> 00:08:14,224
It is Cha Jin Soo.

48
00:08:14,224 --> 00:08:15,194
Is it someone that you know?

49
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:17,004
He is from the North Korean Intelligence Service.

50
00:08:17,004 --> 00:08:19,794
He came here to negotiate an agreement to obtain medical supplies.

51
00:08:19,794 --> 00:08:22,774
Medical equipment...

52
00:08:22,774 --> 00:08:24,874
Wait.

53
00:08:24,874 --> 00:08:27,654
- This man? 
- I heard that he's a doctor from that side.

54
00:08:27,654 --> 00:08:30,814
But why is the Embassy watching over these men?

55
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:33,944
Out of these, there is someone who has requested political refuge.

56
00:08:33,944 --> 00:08:36,204
Political refuge?

57
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,314
Doctor Park!

58
00:08:44,914 --> 00:08:49,164
This is the ampoule you asked for.

59
00:09:58,134 --> 00:10:00,294
Jae Hee.

60
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:03,834
Hoon.

61
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,414
Do you...

62
00:10:07,444 --> 00:10:09,964
recognize me?

63
00:10:11,864 --> 00:10:14,294
Hoon.

64
00:10:20,344 --> 00:10:23,004
What about my father?

65
00:10:34,604 --> 00:10:36,384
Jae Hee.

66
00:10:38,754 --> 00:10:41,244
Regardless of what happens,

67
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:43,084
you have to trust in me.

68
00:10:43,084 --> 00:10:44,974
Do you understand?

69
00:11:07,614 --> 00:11:10,184
Has she regained consciousness yet?

70
00:11:11,674 --> 00:11:13,714
Not yet.

71
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:17,284
There is someone who requested political refuge to the S. Korean Embassy.

72
00:11:17,284 --> 00:11:19,764
It's not possibly you, right Dr. Park?

73
00:11:24,044 --> 00:11:27,674
Don't even dream about it. You and this girl

74
00:11:27,674 --> 00:11:30,634
could die without anyone knowing about it.

75
00:11:50,614 --> 00:11:52,664
It's Park Hoon, that bastard, without a doubt.

76
00:11:52,664 --> 00:11:54,034
I'll drag him out immediately.

77
00:11:54,034 --> 00:11:56,014
Don't make a move.

78
00:11:56,014 --> 00:11:59,494
If we do that, this deal might completely fall apart.

79
00:12:00,434 --> 00:12:03,964
If we go back empty-handed, we will not be able to avoid getting sent to the concentration camps.

80
00:12:03,964 --> 00:12:07,654
So watch him carefully, understand?

81
00:12:45,804 --> 00:12:49,714
 This will stop your heart for a moment in 3 hours.

82
00:12:49,714 --> 00:12:52,654
 You have to endure it Jae Hee.

83
00:13:12,974 --> 00:13:15,994
It was worth coming this far.

84
00:13:18,934 --> 00:13:24,204
Whether it is the candidate selection or the presidential election, the winner is decided by the swing voters.

85
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,274
Those assemblymen

86
00:13:26,274 --> 00:13:30,804
who have not yet decided which candidate to support.

87
00:13:33,154 --> 00:13:35,084
No, no, no.

88
00:13:35,084 --> 00:13:37,574
Guys who are waiting to see which candidate will give them the money.

89
00:13:37,574 --> 00:13:40,334
Those kind of guys.

90
00:13:40,334 --> 00:13:42,444
Handle it as you see fit.

91
00:13:45,704 --> 00:13:48,434
Do you remember the name Park Hoon by chance?

92
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:53,514
He's the son of Park Chul that was sent to the North.

93
00:13:53,514 --> 00:13:54,364
And?

94
00:13:54,364 --> 00:13:58,094
He is currently here.

95
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:03,364
Code blue, code blue, code blue.

96
00:14:03,364 --> 00:14:04,264
What happened?

97
00:14:04,264 --> 00:14:06,064
That girl is dead.

98
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,674
Charge.

99
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:13,684
Get those handcuffs off of her now!

100
00:14:20,024 --> 00:14:21,644
Stand back!

101
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,254
 If the monitor is turned off,

102
00:14:31,254 --> 00:14:35,734
 you have no way to confirm if the heartbeat has come back.

103
00:14:41,124 --> 00:14:42,574
What's this?

104
00:14:42,574 --> 00:14:44,364
She's dead.

105
00:14:44,364 --> 00:14:46,964
 It is very dangerous

106
00:14:46,964 --> 00:14:49,354
 if the heartbeat does not return.

107
00:14:49,984 --> 00:14:51,994
Tell me. What happened?!

108
00:14:51,994 --> 00:14:53,164
You saw what happened.

109
00:14:53,164 --> 00:14:55,584
The heart has stopped and her pupils aren't reacting to light.

110
00:14:55,584 --> 00:15:00,234
Am I asking because I don't know? She was doing fine but what happened so suddenly?!

111
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,284
Do we have time for this?

112
00:15:02,284 --> 00:15:03,814
I don't think we'll be able to complete that deal for the medical equipment.

113
00:15:03,814 --> 00:15:05,424
Doctor!

114
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:07,864
Is the patient dead?

115
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,284
The surgery was successful.

116
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:19,084
The patient died due to another reason.

117
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,404
There's no way!

118
00:15:21,404 --> 00:15:22,894
I can't believe the patient has died...

119
00:15:22,894 --> 00:15:24,324
Come! Translate!

120
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:25,914
Doctor!

121
00:15:32,084 --> 00:15:34,734
 I will confirm for you.

122
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:37,714
 If the heart did stop,

123
00:15:37,714 --> 00:15:41,814
  then you have to save her within 5 minutes.

124
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:51,084
- 5 minutes. 
- What?

125
00:16:25,604 --> 00:16:27,604
- It's an emergency.
- Jae Hee.

126
00:16:27,604 --> 00:16:29,384
Where are you?

127
00:16:31,004 --> 00:16:32,544
Song Jae Hee.

128
00:16:33,704 --> 00:16:35,504
 3 minutes.

129
00:18:01,804 --> 00:18:03,444
 1 minute.

130
00:18:27,264 --> 00:18:28,394
Jae Hee!

131
00:18:28,394 --> 00:18:31,574
Jae Hee! Please Jae Hee.

132
00:18:40,674 --> 00:18:41,804
Jae Hee.

133
00:18:41,804 --> 00:18:43,534
Jae Hee.

134
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,614
Jae Hee...

135
00:19:50,544 --> 00:19:52,764
Park Hoon, this bastard!

136
00:19:53,504 --> 00:19:55,774
Kill them!

137
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:34,604
We've cornered him into an alley.

138
00:24:18,414 --> 00:24:19,734
Are you alright?

139
00:24:19,734 --> 00:24:21,104
Let go.

140
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:26,324
The S. Korean Embassy. Follow them.

141
00:24:30,894 --> 00:24:34,264
A request for political refuge...

142
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:37,694
Does the Embassy know that he's the son of Park Chul?

143
00:24:37,694 --> 00:24:40,574
It seemed like they didn't know.

144
00:24:40,584 --> 00:24:43,954
That was more than ten years ago.

145
00:24:43,954 --> 00:24:46,044
Park Hoon.

146
00:24:46,044 --> 00:24:49,844
This friend here, I wonder how much he knows.

147
00:25:02,804 --> 00:25:08,144
♬  Is there no such thing as an everlasting promise?  ♬

148
00:25:08,144 --> 00:25:13,254
♬  As we looked at one another, those words that we whispered to each other  ♬

149
00:25:13,254 --> 00:25:19,024
♬  To become shattered into pieces like dust in the air  ♬

150
00:25:19,024 --> 00:25:24,534
♬  We've missed each other and became strangers  ♬

151
00:25:24,534 --> 00:25:29,634
♬  To the point of death, to the point I'm going crazy,  ♬

152
00:25:29,634 --> 00:25:35,404
♬  I love you, I love you. Forever.  ♬

153
00:25:35,404 --> 00:25:40,714
♬  I won't let go of you, I'm going to find you  ♬

154
00:25:40,714 --> 00:25:46,134
♬  I'm just a stranger without you my love  ♬

155
00:25:46,134 --> 00:25:50,594
♬  Without you, I'm...  ♬

156
00:26:06,114 --> 00:26:09,014
Please open the door. Open the door!

157
00:26:16,694 --> 00:26:20,414
Open the door please. I'm Park Hoon who requested political refuge.

158
00:26:57,414 --> 00:27:01,194
The reason why I was able to become the sole candidate from my party

159
00:27:01,194 --> 00:27:05,954
is due to the nuclear threat from the North in 1994.

160
00:27:05,954 --> 00:27:09,934
The only hero who saved South Korea from the war,

161
00:27:09,934 --> 00:27:12,204
Jang Seok Joo.

162
00:27:12,204 --> 00:27:14,074
If that didn't happen,

163
00:27:14,074 --> 00:27:19,454
I would have remained as a mere assemblyman who has to worry about reelection.

164
00:27:19,454 --> 00:27:22,454
Do you think it was necessary to kill him.

165
00:27:23,464 --> 00:27:25,814
It was a sacrifice for a higher purpose.

166
00:27:25,814 --> 00:27:28,484
I'm sorry, Assemblyman.

167
00:27:28,484 --> 00:27:32,834
That's why you killed that lady.

168
00:27:40,244 --> 00:27:42,764
 My son...

169
00:27:42,764 --> 00:27:44,974
 My son...

170
00:27:45,824 --> 00:27:48,824
 Where is my son?

171
00:27:48,824 --> 00:27:52,374
 Where is my son?

172
00:28:03,464 --> 00:28:05,434
Wait.

173
00:28:20,234 --> 00:28:22,424
Let's run!

174
00:28:40,024 --> 00:28:42,254
W-What are you doing?

175
00:28:42,844 --> 00:28:45,224
What are you doing? Open the door!

176
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:47,514
Open it!

177
00:28:47,514 --> 00:28:50,974
Open it, open it!

178
00:28:52,674 --> 00:28:55,334
Open the door!

179
00:29:05,194 --> 00:29:07,184
Park Hoon!

180
00:29:11,804 --> 00:29:13,524
Let's go.

181
00:29:23,504 --> 00:29:27,534
The election that's going on in our Korean land right now is pretty much a presidential election.

182
00:29:27,534 --> 00:29:30,674
If I win in that election, I'll be the president.

183
00:29:30,674 --> 00:29:33,984
In another words, I'll be the leader of the  Republic of Korea.

184
00:29:39,394 --> 00:29:41,614
Until then,

185
00:29:42,444 --> 00:29:46,694
this Jang Seok Joo cannot have any weakness.

186
00:29:47,394 --> 00:29:52,264
But a person, who can become my fatal flaw, appeared.

187
00:29:53,594 --> 00:29:56,864
Then, what should you do?

188
00:30:30,434 --> 00:30:31,384
Jae Hee.

189
00:30:31,384 --> 00:30:34,584
Hoon, I'm alright so

190
00:30:34,584 --> 00:30:36,454
you should at least escape.

191
00:30:36,454 --> 00:30:38,394
Endure it just a little bit. Just a little more.

192
00:30:38,394 --> 00:30:39,584
But...

193
00:30:39,584 --> 00:30:42,334
Stop being stupid.

194
00:31:17,824 --> 00:31:22,204
Jae Hee, run away! Run away!

195
00:31:23,334 --> 00:31:25,194
Hoon!

196
00:33:01,734 --> 00:33:11,134

197
00:33:30,674 --> 00:33:33,674
Jae Hee.

198
00:33:33,674 --> 00:33:36,114
Hoon.

199
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:40,594
Yes, it's alright. It's alright.

200
00:33:53,944 --> 00:33:57,074
No...

201
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:21,664
It's alright. It's alright.

202
00:35:21,664 --> 00:35:23,314
Just a little longer.

203
00:35:23,314 --> 00:35:26,014
- Endure it just a little longer.
- I can't.

204
00:35:27,854 --> 00:35:29,694
Hoon.

205
00:35:38,884 --> 00:35:41,124
You can't. You can't.

206
00:35:41,124 --> 00:35:45,244
Please remember me.

207
00:35:46,314 --> 00:35:48,614
Don't do it. Don't do it!

208
00:35:48,614 --> 00:35:52,104
Don't do it, Jae Hee. Don't.

209
00:35:52,104 --> 00:35:57,104
Comrade Park Hoon, my doctor,

210
00:35:58,834 --> 00:36:01,194
goodbye.

211
00:36:05,014 --> 00:36:07,184
No, you can't.

212
00:36:12,794 --> 00:36:14,514
You can't!

213
00:36:21,874 --> 00:36:25,054
Jae Hee!

214
00:36:59,464 --> 00:37:02,144
Jae Hee!

215
00:37:24,954 --> 00:37:29,004
 2 years later, Seoul

216
00:37:29,804 --> 00:37:34,084
If the coronary artery, which supplies blood to  the heart, becomes stenotic (narrowed),

217
00:37:34,084 --> 00:37:38,434
angina pectoris (chest pain) or myocardial infarction (M.I.) can occur.

218
00:37:38,434 --> 00:37:43,364
In the past, we used a bypass machine to stop the heart before we performed the operation.

219
00:37:43,364 --> 00:37:47,344
But these days, it's more popular to perform an OPCAB (Off Pump Coronary Artery Bypass) without stopping the heart.

220
00:37:47,344 --> 00:37:51,134
This is what you, the reporters are seeing right now.

221
00:37:51,134 --> 00:37:53,624
Irrigation.

222
00:37:54,984 --> 00:37:58,634
Is this team the strongest candidate to operate on Prime Minister Jang?

223
00:37:58,634 --> 00:38:00,574
Jaeil University Hospital is also a strong candidate.

224
00:38:00,574 --> 00:38:03,484
Yet he could have gotten the surgery at the hospital he frequented,

225
00:38:03,484 --> 00:38:05,424
why is he making this fuss saying he wants to choose the surgical team.

226
00:38:05,424 --> 00:38:07,304
I guess you could consider it as a special event.

227
00:38:07,304 --> 00:38:09,114
- An event?
 - Yeah.

228
00:38:09,114 --> 00:38:12,894
Medical students these days are avoiding the Cardio-Thoracic Surgical Department because they hear that it's hard.

229
00:38:12,894 --> 00:38:16,564
At a time like this, if we announce that we're putting a team together for the Prime Minister's heart surgery,

230
00:38:16,564 --> 00:38:18,134
then it becomes an issue.

231
00:38:18,134 --> 00:38:22,264
And then the medical students will at least consider this path one more time.

232
00:38:22,264 --> 00:38:28,694
Ah, and from what I heard, even the Blue House is watching over this event carefully.

233
00:38:28,694 --> 00:38:29,664
The Blue House?

234
00:38:29,664 --> 00:38:34,114
Even the President is worrying about the Prime Minister's health. Don't you think that's what it means?

235
00:38:34,114 --> 00:38:36,324
I don't think that's it.

236
00:38:36,324 --> 00:38:39,334
Right.  They fought so hard during the election.

237
00:38:39,334 --> 00:38:42,024
But they're in the same party.

238
00:38:42,024 --> 00:38:46,594
If the President appointed him to be Prime Minister, you can probably say that their relationship has been restored.

239
00:38:46,594 --> 00:38:50,344
Okay, let's stop talking about politics that cause headaches and go out.

240
00:38:50,344 --> 00:38:54,014
I'll treat you guys really well tonight.

241
00:38:55,274 --> 00:38:59,024
 Code blue, code blue, ICU, code blue.

242
00:38:59,024 --> 00:39:02,354
 Code blue, code blue, ICU, code blue. 
ICU: Intensive Care Unit

243
00:39:02,354 --> 00:39:06,254
 Code blue, code blue, ICU, code blue.

244
00:39:26,794 --> 00:39:29,334
This is  cardio thoracic surgeon, Han Jae Joon.

245
00:39:30,244 --> 00:39:33,174
Clear.

246
00:39:33,174 --> 00:39:36,434
Charge 200 joules.

247
00:39:36,434 --> 00:39:38,634
Clear.

248
00:39:38,634 --> 00:39:39,914
What's going on?

249
00:39:39,914 --> 00:39:41,474
There was sudden ventricular fibrillation.

250
00:39:41,474 --> 00:39:43,644
Move aside.

251
00:39:43,644 --> 00:39:46,104
1 ampoule of epinephrine, charge 200 Joules.

252
00:39:46,104 --> 00:39:48,354
Move him to the Operating Room.

253
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:54,004
What are you talking about, Professor Han? We just need to get his heartbeat back.

254
00:39:54,004 --> 00:39:57,174
Dr. Moon, was there a mistake during the surgery?

255
00:39:57,174 --> 00:39:58,764
What happened you bastard?!

256
00:39:58,764 --> 00:40:01,104
People always tend to make mistakes.

257
00:40:01,104 --> 00:40:02,134
Chairman.

258
00:40:02,134 --> 00:40:05,404
Chairman, are you acknowledging that there was a medical error?

259
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:08,534
Isn't saving the patient more important than that right now?

260
00:40:08,534 --> 00:40:12,064
I can do it Chairman. I can do it.

261
00:40:23,614 --> 00:40:26,294
Get the team ready.

262
00:40:26,294 --> 00:40:29,034
Yes, Professor Yang.

263
00:40:31,034 --> 00:40:33,654
- You can finish it, right?
- Don't worry about it.

264
00:40:44,864 --> 00:40:47,064
I'm going right now.

265
00:40:47,064 --> 00:40:49,264
How can the anesthetist leave during a surgery?

266
00:40:49,264 --> 00:40:51,594
There's Doctor Choi, am I not right?

267
00:40:51,594 --> 00:40:53,894
Yes, Doctor Oh.

268
00:41:55,974 --> 00:41:58,354
It's my patient! I'll do it!

269
00:41:58,354 --> 00:42:01,534
This is my operating room!

270
00:42:01,534 --> 00:42:03,764
Please leave.

271
00:42:14,844 --> 00:42:17,034
Scalpel.

272
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:24,504
Chairman, I just made one mistake.

273
00:42:24,504 --> 00:42:27,554
That's right. In fact right in front of the reporters.

274
00:42:27,554 --> 00:42:31,304
But to suspend medical practice and to leave my position as an attending...

275
00:42:31,304 --> 00:42:34,824
We are the hospital that has to operate on the Prime Minister Jang Seok Joo.

276
00:42:34,824 --> 00:42:38,654
Isn't that more of a reason for me to be in charge of that?

277
00:42:39,694 --> 00:42:41,864
I know your skills very well, Dr. Moon.

278
00:42:41,864 --> 00:42:45,044
But the surgery is done as a team, not alone.

279
00:42:45,044 --> 00:42:47,644
- Chairman.
- If you want to get your position back,

280
00:42:47,644 --> 00:42:49,694
prepare a team that'll rival Doctor Han's team.

281
00:42:49,694 --> 00:42:53,744
How can I make a team when Doctor Han took all the doctors that are even remotely good?

282
00:42:53,744 --> 00:42:56,204
Figure that out on your own.

283
00:43:04,894 --> 00:43:07,844
 Seoul Prison

284
00:43:13,654 --> 00:43:15,584
Hyung.

285
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,634
 Seoul Prison
-You can start over again if you have a dream-

286
00:43:19,634 --> 00:43:22,074
Why is a girl calling me Hyung?

287
00:43:30,004 --> 00:43:33,434
Do you think I'll be fooled again? Let's go.

288
00:43:45,884 --> 00:43:50,144
- What about the deposit fee for the hospital?
- We didn't put the hospital on sale.

289
00:43:50,144 --> 00:43:51,634
I told you to get the money prepared.

290
00:43:51,634 --> 00:43:55,094
Truthfully, I invested half of your hospital deposit fee.

291
00:43:55,094 --> 00:43:58,184
Put it up for sale and take half!

292
00:43:58,184 --> 00:43:59,934
You're going to take that and go to China?

293
00:43:59,934 --> 00:44:03,614
And get caught trying to enter North Korea?

294
00:44:03,614 --> 00:44:06,354
But, what's with your accent?

295
00:44:06,354 --> 00:44:10,474
I'm practicing Seoul dialect. If I'm going to live here I have no choice but to practice.

296
00:44:10,474 --> 00:44:12,514
How is it? I seem a little like a Seoul person, right?

297
00:44:12,514 --> 00:44:15,854
Yeah. You're really amazing.

298
00:44:15,854 --> 00:44:19,324
So, bring the hospital deposit fee right away.

299
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:23,264
You should really stop now, Hyung. It's your third time in prison already.

300
00:44:23,264 --> 00:44:25,284
We don't even know if she's dead or alive.

301
00:44:25,284 --> 00:44:28,014
Dr. Hyun definitely told me that she was taken alive to North Korea.

302
00:44:28,014 --> 00:44:31,914
What are you going to do if she's alive? I tried so many things to get my mom out of there but there's no use.

303
00:44:31,914 --> 00:44:33,294
You said you're practicing Seoul dialect.

304
00:44:33,294 --> 00:44:36,704
Anyway, Mr. Im said he won't be a broker for defectors anymore.

305
00:44:36,704 --> 00:44:39,714
Hey, I don't believe in that guy anymore either.

306
00:44:39,714 --> 00:44:43,744
There are so many brokers near the Yalu River but he always gets caught by the Chinese.

307
00:44:43,744 --> 00:44:46,074
I hear there's a different method.

308
00:44:46,074 --> 00:44:47,524
Different method?

309
00:44:47,524 --> 00:44:50,534
Hey, what is it?

310
00:44:50,534 --> 00:44:52,334
If I give them money, they will deliver her to here.

311
00:44:52,334 --> 00:44:54,244
Is your mom a bottle of water that they'd deliver her to here?

312
00:44:54,244 --> 00:44:56,414
I already

313
00:44:56,414 --> 00:44:58,854
gave 30,000 dollars.

314
00:44:58,854 --> 00:45:02,644
30,000 dollars? You already gave 30,000 dollars to that con-man?

315
00:45:02,644 --> 00:45:05,194
Wow, you are really crazy.

316
00:45:05,194 --> 00:45:07,894
We'll find out who's the crazy one soon enough.

317
00:45:07,894 --> 00:45:11,994
Ahjussi said you should also go to him with all the money you have.

318
00:45:11,994 --> 00:45:13,984
Did he?

319
00:45:13,984 --> 00:45:15,704
So, hurry up and work hard to earn money.

320
00:45:15,704 --> 00:45:18,784
Over there. You see that stationery shop, right?

321
00:45:20,664 --> 00:45:26,104
That's right. I have to earn some money.

322
00:45:33,624 --> 00:45:36,574
I saw it first.

323
00:45:38,464 --> 00:45:40,174
I dropped it.

324
00:45:40,174 --> 00:45:42,344
Stop lying.

325
00:45:42,344 --> 00:45:43,304
Which coin is it?

326
00:45:43,304 --> 00:45:45,174
500 won.

327
00:45:45,174 --> 00:45:47,684
Heads or tails?

328
00:45:48,714 --> 00:45:51,084
- Head!
- Tail!

329
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,634
It's the tail.

330
00:45:57,634 --> 00:46:00,004
Isn't the picture the head?

331
00:46:00,004 --> 00:46:02,424
Look.

332
00:46:06,554 --> 00:46:07,454
Why is your finger like this?

333
00:46:07,454 --> 00:46:10,304
I'm fine. Let go.

334
00:46:13,344 --> 00:46:14,634
It's broken.

335
00:46:14,634 --> 00:46:17,004
I'm fine.

336
00:46:36,164 --> 00:46:38,824
If something goes wrong, you'll never be able to use your finger again.

337
00:46:38,824 --> 00:46:40,494
Let's go to the hospital first.

338
00:46:40,494 --> 00:46:42,074
I don't want to.

339
00:46:42,074 --> 00:46:44,454
Then give me the treatment fee.  500 won.

340
00:46:44,454 --> 00:46:46,574
I didn't ask you to treat me.

341
00:46:46,574 --> 00:46:48,734
Anyway, I did.  Give it to me!

342
00:46:48,734 --> 00:46:49,934
Jeong Min!

343
00:46:49,934 --> 00:46:51,484
Dad.

344
00:46:52,534 --> 00:46:55,574
You, 500 won!

345
00:46:55,574 --> 00:46:59,154
Why are you playing with a kid when I asked you to deliver water?

346
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:06,594
Hey, what is on the head of a coin?

347
00:47:06,594 --> 00:47:11,104
Are you stupid? The picture is on the head and the number is on the tail.

348
00:47:22,044 --> 00:47:24,484
 Garibong Clinic

349
00:47:25,104 --> 00:47:27,214
 Garibong Clinic

350
00:47:29,314 --> 00:47:30,524
You punk!

351
00:47:30,524 --> 00:47:33,994
I advertised that the hospital is opening again...

352
00:47:33,994 --> 00:47:35,624
Let's hurry and open up.

353
00:47:35,624 --> 00:47:39,184
I cleaned it and prepared some things you would need.

354
00:47:39,184 --> 00:47:42,944
Aish. What did you prepare?

355
00:47:50,604 --> 00:47:52,994
Did you prepare these guys as well?

356
00:47:59,394 --> 00:48:01,484
- I will call you, Hyung.
- Hey.

357
00:48:01,484 --> 00:48:05,854
- Maybe he's a patient!
- You, Lee Chang Yi!

358
00:48:13,034 --> 00:48:16,294
Wow, it's like Moses' miracle (parting the Red Sea).

359
00:48:29,684 --> 00:48:32,274
Where are you unwell?

360
00:48:32,274 --> 00:48:38,524
I didn't come here because I'm unwell.

361
00:48:38,524 --> 00:48:42,364
Then why are you hanging out at someone else's hospital?  Get lost right now!

362
00:48:42,364 --> 00:48:47,114
There's someone the doctor must check.

363
00:48:51,164 --> 00:48:54,284
There was a patient. You should have told me earlier.

364
00:48:54,284 --> 00:48:57,424
He's someone who can't go to the hospital due to reasons we can't say.

365
00:48:57,424 --> 00:48:59,414
Where is he?

366
00:49:03,104 --> 00:49:04,694
Where are you hurting?

367
00:49:04,694 --> 00:49:09,304
Since yesterday, he said his lower stomach hurt as if someone was stabbing him.

368
00:49:09,304 --> 00:49:11,804
Let's see...

369
00:49:11,804 --> 00:49:15,974
Aigoo, it hurts because he doodled all over his body like this.

370
00:49:15,974 --> 00:49:18,934
You have a fever.

371
00:49:18,934 --> 00:49:21,474
Does it hurt here?

372
00:49:25,624 --> 00:49:30,344
We should do a surgery right now. It's appendicitis. If it bursts, he will die.

373
00:49:33,344 --> 00:49:36,494
Hyungnim, he will do surgery right now.

374
00:49:36,494 --> 00:49:38,514
Endure just a bit longer.

375
00:49:39,964 --> 00:49:43,274
But looks like gangsters these days have a lot of money.

376
00:49:43,274 --> 00:49:46,644
Your  clothes look nice.

377
00:49:48,154 --> 00:49:49,734
It's cheap.

378
00:50:03,344 --> 00:50:06,174
- Wow, it's done. 
- Are you done?

379
00:50:06,174 --> 00:50:09,384
No, it's not done yet. You have to pay the treatment fee.

380
00:50:13,254 --> 00:50:17,354
Wow, you hoodlum bastards.

381
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,964
Do you see this?

382
00:50:20,964 --> 00:50:25,104
- Ow!
- Okay, I get it! How much is it?

383
00:50:25,104 --> 00:50:27,294
The treatment fee is ₩1,500,000 ($1500)

384
00:50:27,294 --> 00:50:29,994
Hey, I don't accept cards.

385
00:50:31,024 --> 00:50:34,134
- Here, ₩1,500,000.
- Sign and fill in your contact information.

386
00:50:34,134 --> 00:50:37,154
Contact information? Hey, give it to me.

387
00:50:38,794 --> 00:50:41,474
Here.

388
00:50:41,474 --> 00:50:43,454
One stitch is ₩100,000 ($100)

389
00:50:43,454 --> 00:50:45,114
Oh wow.

390
00:50:45,114 --> 00:50:49,384
I think I have to make ten stitches, so ₩ 1,000,000 ($100)?

391
00:50:49,384 --> 00:50:53,094
Hey, wow.

392
00:50:53,094 --> 00:50:56,734
Okay, ₩1,000,000 ($100). Quickly start stitching.

393
00:50:56,734 --> 00:50:58,484
Hey, pay ₩500 (50¢ )  more.

394
00:50:58,484 --> 00:50:59,734
Hey, what's with the ₩500 (50¢)?

395
00:50:59,734 --> 00:51:02,224
If I tell you to pay, just pay. Why are you talking so much?

396
00:51:02,224 --> 00:51:05,474
- Ow!
- Hey!

397
00:51:05,474 --> 00:51:07,884
₩500 (50¢). Here.

398
00:51:07,884 --> 00:51:09,244
I will stitch.

399
00:51:09,244 --> 00:51:11,214
Hey, the phone.

400
00:51:11,214 --> 00:51:14,354
Wow, this is too much.

401
00:51:16,644 --> 00:51:19,494
Your phone.

402
00:51:19,494 --> 00:51:22,224
Yeah, why?

403
00:51:22,224 --> 00:51:24,094
What?

404
00:51:32,204 --> 00:51:33,444
Hyung!

405
00:51:33,444 --> 00:51:34,974
What happened? He found your mom?

406
00:51:34,974 --> 00:51:37,984
It's not time yet.

407
00:51:37,984 --> 00:51:41,434
You think I just found her? You should pay the rest.

408
00:51:41,434 --> 00:51:43,494
Money.

409
00:51:48,414 --> 00:51:53,124
♪ Nilniriya

410
00:51:56,214 --> 00:51:58,334
It's time now.

411
00:52:12,204 --> 00:52:14,504
Mom!

412
00:52:14,504 --> 00:52:16,314
Chang Yi!

413
00:52:16,314 --> 00:52:22,464
Aigo, Chang Yi!

414
00:52:31,984 --> 00:52:33,954
Wow, wow.

415
00:52:33,954 --> 00:52:39,034
Stop crying and take your mom and treat her to some meat soup and white rice.

416
00:52:43,524 --> 00:52:48,854
Please be sure to deliver this message to Teacher Choi.

417
00:52:48,854 --> 00:52:53,344
Thank you so much, Teacher Choi.

418
00:52:53,344 --> 00:52:55,964
Thank you so much.

419
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:58,814
It's not Teacher Choi, Mom.

420
00:52:58,814 --> 00:53:01,444
Teacher Im.

421
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:05,644
That's right. I'm Teacher Im.

422
00:53:05,644 --> 00:53:09,304
What are you doing? Take your mom out for a treat.

423
00:53:09,304 --> 00:53:11,264
Here.

424
00:53:11,264 --> 00:53:16,374
- Let's go. 
- Hey, is this real, or am I dreaming?

425
00:53:16,374 --> 00:53:19,254
Good job.

426
00:53:19,254 --> 00:53:21,564
Wait, how is it possible?

427
00:53:21,564 --> 00:53:23,604
It's simple.

428
00:53:23,604 --> 00:53:28,124
If I send this to the Chinese brokers,

429
00:53:28,124 --> 00:53:32,864
 a guy in N. Korea will make a call confirming that they received the money from the Chinese.

430
00:53:32,864 --> 00:53:37,594
  Then, that man will find the person we want.

431
00:53:37,594 --> 00:53:41,324
  Then, they take out the person who we want through the route they know.

432
00:53:41,324 --> 00:53:44,544
 Putting cash into the hands of those N. Korean bastards.

433
00:53:48,174 --> 00:53:50,684
Socialism?

434
00:53:50,684 --> 00:53:52,844
That's all bullshit.

435
00:53:52,844 --> 00:53:55,044
Hey, if you just give them money,

436
00:53:55,044 --> 00:53:59,204
they can even get Kim Il Sung's statue.

437
00:54:00,484 --> 00:54:03,754
Did you say that woman's name

438
00:54:03,754 --> 00:54:06,654
was Song Jae Hee?

439
00:54:09,124 --> 00:54:12,154
Did you find Jae Hee?

440
00:54:16,654 --> 00:54:18,684
Did you find her?

441
00:54:19,734 --> 00:54:23,764
You know that I only accept dollars.

442
00:54:24,634 --> 00:54:27,134
I'm asking you if you found her!

443
00:54:42,894 --> 00:54:44,974
I came back, Prime Minister.

444
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:53,014
- Prime Minister.
- It was so close, Secretary Kim. Don't you think so?

445
00:54:53,014 --> 00:54:55,774
But didn't you become the Prime Minister?

446
00:54:55,774 --> 00:54:59,554
There's only the King higher than me. The rest are beneath me.

447
00:54:59,554 --> 00:55:02,874
If we were in the Joseon Period, would I be called the "Chief State Councillor"? (Present-day Prime Minister)

448
00:55:02,874 --> 00:55:06,704
People come up with songs to memorize the names of Kings,

449
00:55:06,704 --> 00:55:11,344
but they don't care who the Chief State Councillors were.

450
00:55:17,174 --> 00:55:19,284
Prime Minister.

451
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:31,404
What about Park Hoon?

452
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:34,074
He was released today.

453
00:55:34,074 --> 00:55:38,654
- How is he?
- Like they said, he's on the move.

454
00:55:58,334 --> 00:56:02,284
I can't believe I, Jang Seok Joo,

455
00:56:02,284 --> 00:56:05,764
have to receive help from that bastard.

456
00:56:05,764 --> 00:56:07,614
We've become the laughingstock.

457
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:12,104
Anyways, he is the best cardiac thoracic surgeon in the North.

458
00:56:12,104 --> 00:56:14,354
That's true.

459
00:56:14,354 --> 00:56:19,794
But still, he won't give in that easily.

460
00:56:22,424 --> 00:56:24,624
He won't.

461
00:56:42,794 --> 00:56:46,024
This, this. This is not enough for the initial payment.

462
00:56:46,024 --> 00:56:49,434
I will earn money and give you more, so hurry up and tell me if they found Jae Hee.

463
00:56:49,434 --> 00:56:53,654
Okay. If the doctor says so, I'll give you something.

464
00:57:24,394 --> 00:57:25,734
Is it this woman?

465
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:27,514
Yes.

466
00:57:44,354 --> 00:57:46,604
Hoon.

467
00:57:57,624 --> 00:57:59,434
Jae Hee.

468
00:58:04,864 --> 00:58:06,654
Jae Hee.

469
00:58:21,494 --> 00:58:23,504
Jae Hee.

470
00:58:45,494 --> 00:58:47,264
Jae Hee.
