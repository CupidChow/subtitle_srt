1
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:41,834

2
00:00:42,534 --> 00:00:49,674
♬  Like the sun which comes through the window late in the morning waking me  ♬

3
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:56,534
♬  You gently approach.  ♬

4
00:00:56,534 --> 00:01:03,384
♬  When I open my eyes, I wonder whether it is a dream.
  I wonder whether I am allowed to feel this joy.  ♬

5
00:01:03,384 --> 00:01:09,654
♬   I ask myself over and over.   ♬

6
00:01:12,964 --> 00:01:20,044
♬   I love you like a tomorrow which may not come.  ♬

7
00:01:20,044 --> 00:01:26,744
♬  I love you as if I  may not see you again.  ♬

8
00:01:26,744 --> 00:01:31,134
♬  Every moment of my day  ♬

9
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:37,654
♬  Will be filled with memories instead of tears  ♬

10
00:01:37,654 --> 00:01:44,434
♬   I love you like a tomorrow which may not come.  ♬

11
00:01:44,434 --> 00:01:54,204
♬  Day by day for me I heal with love instead of wounds.  ♬

12
00:01:54,204 --> 00:01:57,004
 Episode 10

13
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,424
You must be observing them.

14
00:02:11,424 --> 00:02:13,234
Would there be a reason for me to keep watch?

15
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:15,934
It's time to go ahead with the second plan.

16
00:02:15,934 --> 00:02:20,434
Don't worry. The Republic has already started moving.

17
00:02:21,694 --> 00:02:25,934
When it becomes morning, the bastards in South Korea

18
00:02:25,934 --> 00:02:29,054
will all cower in fear.

19
00:02:46,944 --> 00:02:50,234
 Sejong Government Complex

20
00:02:56,804 --> 00:02:59,354
Prime Minister, is it true that North Korea is doing a nuclear test?

21
00:02:59,354 --> 00:03:02,624
Is it true that the size of the test is incomparable to the last one?

22
00:03:02,624 --> 00:03:04,724
- Do you know the accurate time frame? 
- Please tell us.

23
00:03:04,724 --> 00:03:08,124
What's the reason for them to do a nuclear test, Prime Minister?

24
00:03:08,924 --> 00:03:11,274
Ah, Prime Minister.

25
00:03:14,704 --> 00:03:17,834
- What's going on?
 - That's what I'm saying.

26
00:03:21,344 --> 00:03:24,984
 To protect our Republic's safety and independence,

27
00:03:24,984 --> 00:03:26,894
 we are taking practical measures.

28
00:03:26,894 --> 00:03:31,104
 Before the coming 30th day of this month, we are preparing a big one

29
00:03:31,104 --> 00:03:33,734
 which no one has ever seen before.

30
00:03:33,734 --> 00:03:35,884
 This upcoming nuclear test will

31
00:03:35,884 --> 00:03:39,884
 will greatly boost our nation's fighting spirit

32
00:03:39,884 --> 00:03:41,764
 that has helped

33
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:45,514
 develop our nation into a stronghold.

34
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:51,084
It's the Blue House, Prime Minister.

35
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,994
Yes, this is Jang Seok Joo.

36
00:03:55,994 --> 00:03:57,984
What just happened?

37
00:03:57,984 --> 00:04:00,194
What is this nuclear test all of a sudden?

38
00:04:00,194 --> 00:04:02,944
I'm sorry, it's something I did not expect. . .

39
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,414
Come here right now.

40
00:04:04,414 --> 00:04:06,014
I got it. I'll come right after the meeting.

41
00:04:06,014 --> 00:04:08,534
Come up immediately!

42
00:04:13,334 --> 00:04:17,264
While talking about having an Inter-Korean summit, they are doing a nuclear test?

43
00:04:20,464 --> 00:04:24,514
How could they threaten with such thing at this time and age!

44
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:34,274
The guys from the North are desperate, really desperate.

45
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,864
Seeing how quickly they're moving.

46
00:04:39,064 --> 00:04:40,344
What is it?

47
00:04:41,264 --> 00:04:44,434
I thought it would be about the level of shooting missiles.

48
00:04:45,474 --> 00:04:48,084
If they're going to threaten us, they should do it strongly.

49
00:04:48,084 --> 00:04:52,014
It could bring unnecessary tension.

50
00:04:52,014 --> 00:04:56,234
Prime Minister, if by chance, the same thing happens like 20 years ago...

51
00:04:56,234 --> 00:04:58,664
There's nothing to worry about.

52
00:04:58,664 --> 00:05:03,694
They have done nuclear testing  before and America didn't do anything.

53
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:07,094
It's just going to be noisy for a moment and stop.

54
00:05:10,804 --> 00:05:14,364
 The stock market is plummeting after the news of a nuclear test but

55
00:05:14,364 --> 00:05:17,924
 the majority of the population is spending a peaceful everyday life.

56
00:05:17,924 --> 00:05:21,814
 We are finding that there won't be a panic-buy out of necessities.

57
00:05:21,814 --> 00:05:25,234
 Compared to that from the past

58
00:05:25,234 --> 00:05:28,824
 some people are expressing that

59
00:05:28,824 --> 00:05:32,064
 the sense of national defensiveness has gone down.

60
00:05:39,164 --> 00:05:42,194
It tastes really good with seaweed.

61
00:05:48,074 --> 00:05:49,964
It's delicious.

62
00:05:49,964 --> 00:05:55,154
♬  I love you to death, until I'm driven crazy.  ♬

63
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:57,534
♬  I will love you through eternity.  ♬

64
00:05:57,534 --> 00:05:58,484
 Don't do it.

65
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:02,654
 Comrade Park Hoon, my doctor,

66
00:06:05,244 --> 00:06:06,964
 goodbye.

67
00:06:07,904 --> 00:06:10,314
 Jae Hee!

68
00:06:21,234 --> 00:06:23,354
Jae Hee.

69
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:33,764
Jae Hee.

70
00:06:35,514 --> 00:06:37,504
Jae Hee!

71
00:06:54,864 --> 00:06:59,284
♬  I love you to death, until I'm driven crazy,  ♬

72
00:06:59,284 --> 00:07:01,354
What's wrong?

73
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,054
Nothing.

74
00:07:03,054 --> 00:07:05,784
♬  I will love you through eternity.  ♬

75
00:07:05,784 --> 00:07:11,534
♬  I'm not letting go. I must find you.  ♬

76
00:07:11,534 --> 00:07:12,954
Put me down!
♬  I'm just a stranger  ♬

77
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:16,264
Stay still.
♬   without you my love. ♬

78
00:07:16,264 --> 00:07:18,274
Hey.
♬  I, who am without you.  ♬

79
00:07:18,334 --> 00:07:21,634
Hoon.
♬  I, who am without you.  ♬

80
00:07:46,014 --> 00:07:48,614
When did you first know?

81
00:07:48,614 --> 00:07:51,254
Since the first time I saw you.

82
00:07:58,264 --> 00:08:00,394
Really?

83
00:08:02,494 --> 00:08:04,414
Where should we go?

84
00:08:04,414 --> 00:08:06,494
I'll take you to the hospital.

85
00:08:06,494 --> 00:08:07,424
The hospital?

86
00:08:07,424 --> 00:08:10,454
You have to go there.

87
00:08:12,304 --> 00:08:17,354
You mean that if I don't show up at the hospital without a reason, 
people will be suspicious that you are Jae Hee, right?

88
00:08:18,274 --> 00:08:20,574
I'm sorry, Hoon.

89
00:08:26,204 --> 00:08:28,684
Yes, I'm Moon Hyung Wook.

90
00:08:28,684 --> 00:08:30,754
Ah, Hoon?

91
00:08:30,754 --> 00:08:33,004
Ah, yes, yes.

92
00:08:33,004 --> 00:08:35,444
I understand. You'll be late a little?

93
00:08:35,444 --> 00:08:37,394
I had a surgery until midnight.

94
00:08:37,394 --> 00:08:40,144
Okay, okay. I'll let you go today specially.

95
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:45,204
Still, there's a party today!

96
00:08:45,204 --> 00:08:48,334
Come quickly in the afternoon! Okay, okay.

97
00:08:48,334 --> 00:08:51,354
See you later? Okay!

98
00:08:54,954 --> 00:08:57,334
Happy?

99
00:08:59,314 --> 00:09:00,704
Let's go.

100
00:09:00,704 --> 00:09:01,834
Where?

101
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:04,034
Wherever.

102
00:09:04,034 --> 00:09:07,504
Alright, wherever.

103
00:09:39,384 --> 00:09:45,324
♬  At the end of this road. At the end of this strange road,   ♬

104
00:09:45,324 --> 00:09:51,704
♬   If you find me, you will be crying.   ♬

105
00:09:51,704 --> 00:09:57,434
♬   Even though time will create rust   ♬

106
00:09:57,434 --> 00:10:05,504
 Hoon   Jae Hee 
♬   As you love, you will wait at the end of this road.  ♬

107
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:11,794
♬   At this strange place, if you call me    ♬

108
00:10:11,794 --> 00:10:17,284
♬   After I find you from that hiding place, I will go   ♬

109
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,934
♬   Wherever you are  ♬

110
00:10:19,934 --> 00:10:23,584
♬   Wait for me a little bit  ♬

111
00:10:23,584 --> 00:10:29,174
♬   At this strange place, if you call me    ♬

112
00:10:29,174 --> 00:10:32,894
♬   After I find you from that hiding place  ♬

113
00:10:32,894 --> 00:10:37,744
♬  I will go there wherever you are  ♬

114
00:10:37,744 --> 00:10:43,634
♬  Wait for me a little bit  ♬

115
00:10:53,354 --> 00:10:54,894
Yes.

116
00:11:01,734 --> 00:11:03,284
Why aren't you asking?

117
00:11:03,284 --> 00:11:04,484
About what?

118
00:11:04,484 --> 00:11:07,484
Why I'm not Song Jae Hee and instead Han Seung Hee.

119
00:11:07,484 --> 00:11:10,104
Why I came here.

120
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:11,404
Do you want to tell me?

121
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:14,304
I think I'll have to tell you.

122
00:11:14,304 --> 00:11:16,104
That's not important.

123
00:11:16,104 --> 00:11:17,674
To me it's important.

124
00:11:17,674 --> 00:11:20,554
To me, the fact that you're here is more important.

125
00:11:21,854 --> 00:11:23,934
Hoon.

126
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:27,094
Let's go. There's somewhere I want to go with you.

127
00:11:30,054 --> 00:11:30,914
Get in.

128
00:11:30,914 --> 00:11:32,234
Are you going to the hospital?

129
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:34,434
Get in without asking.

130
00:11:40,244 --> 00:11:42,394
Don't worry.

131
00:11:56,834 --> 00:11:58,304
It's me.

132
00:11:58,304 --> 00:12:00,414
Yeahhh, it's me.

133
00:12:00,414 --> 00:12:02,804
Give me the best no matter what.

134
00:12:02,804 --> 00:12:04,304
The best, okay?

135
00:12:04,304 --> 00:12:07,264
Don't worry about the money.

136
00:12:11,044 --> 00:12:13,084
What are you doing here?

137
00:12:14,224 --> 00:12:16,824
This was my office originally.

138
00:12:16,824 --> 00:12:21,734
I'm thinking about changing the interior because I don't like it.

139
00:12:22,984 --> 00:12:26,334
This is my office. Please leave.

140
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:30,174
For now.

141
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:40,294
There's a dinner party today.

142
00:12:41,084 --> 00:12:43,314
Why don't you make time to come?

143
00:12:44,104 --> 00:12:48,704
I heard you were going to the local branch. As your senior,

144
00:12:48,704 --> 00:12:51,094
I should at least give you a farewell party.

145
00:12:51,094 --> 00:12:53,384
See you later.

146
00:13:20,924 --> 00:13:23,504
- Was there no call?
- No, there wasn't.

147
00:13:33,234 --> 00:13:36,194
Chairman isn't here.

148
00:13:49,744 --> 00:13:53,734
If you can't come in, there's a reason for that. Get out!

149
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:55,204
I won't make any excuses.

150
00:13:55,204 --> 00:13:57,504
I don't want to hear it either.

151
00:14:23,534 --> 00:14:26,024
 You said that it would be a simple surgery.

152
00:14:26,024 --> 00:14:29,804
 But why is he unconscious all of a sudden?

153
00:14:29,804 --> 00:14:33,594
 We did our best.

154
00:14:33,594 --> 00:14:36,124
 What happened during the surgery?

155
00:14:36,124 --> 00:14:37,114
 I'm sorry.

156
00:14:37,114 --> 00:14:40,004
 When he arrived at the hospital, we couldn't do anything.

157
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:44,614
 Seung Hoon's father walked in on his own when coming to the hospital.

158
00:14:44,614 --> 00:14:46,564
 Say something, please!

159
00:14:46,564 --> 00:14:50,344
 Anyway, we did our best.

160
00:14:50,344 --> 00:14:52,154
 Go back in.

161
00:14:53,254 --> 00:14:56,024
 Save my dad. You have to save him, I said.

162
00:14:56,024 --> 00:14:58,444
 Save my dad!

163
00:14:59,194 --> 00:15:01,554
 Save Dad. Save Dad!

164
00:15:01,554 --> 00:15:03,794
 Save my dad.

165
00:15:03,794 --> 00:15:05,914
 Save him.

166
00:15:05,914 --> 00:15:08,614
 Save my dad!

167
00:15:10,214 --> 00:15:12,694
 Save my dad.

168
00:15:19,374 --> 00:15:22,614
 Save Dad.

169
00:15:35,474 --> 00:15:37,414
I lost this time.

170
00:15:37,414 --> 00:15:39,284
This time?

171
00:15:41,934 --> 00:15:44,444
There is no next time. Didn't you know that?

172
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,734
As the Chairman, you can make one.

173
00:15:46,734 --> 00:15:50,574
It was my decision to make it one match. You are telling me to overturn it?

174
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,514
You have to.

175
00:15:52,514 --> 00:15:54,684
It is not the time to think about your pride.

176
00:15:54,684 --> 00:15:55,524
Chief Han!

177
00:15:55,524 --> 00:16:00,034
If you want to continue to see me at Myeongwoo Hospital, you have to make another opportunity, Chairman.

178
00:16:00,034 --> 00:16:01,644
Are you threatening me?

179
00:16:01,644 --> 00:16:04,034
Then do you want to give Myeongwoo's future to a doctor like Doctor Park?

180
00:16:04,034 --> 00:16:07,654
I don't intend to leave it to someone like you either.

181
00:16:09,054 --> 00:16:10,754
Fine.

182
00:16:10,754 --> 00:16:13,994
I asked to make a space for you in the branch hospital.

183
00:16:13,994 --> 00:16:17,044
Whether you leave or not, do whatever you want.

184
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:32,294

185
00:16:48,534 --> 00:16:50,454
Stop fooling around and follow me.

186
00:16:50,454 --> 00:16:51,864
Where are you going?

187
00:16:51,864 --> 00:16:55,284
Do you think Chief Han will stay at Myeongwoo if he goes to the branch?

188
00:16:55,284 --> 00:16:56,874
He'll most likely leave.

189
00:16:56,874 --> 00:17:01,124
I can't let that happen. We have to hold on to him by persuading the Chairman.

190
00:17:01,124 --> 00:17:03,644
- Why?
- Myeongwoo needs a person like Chief Han.

191
00:17:03,644 --> 00:17:06,074
Why do we need him?

192
00:17:06,074 --> 00:17:09,774
And you, Hyung Wook, don't be like that to your junior.

193
00:17:09,774 --> 00:17:13,584
I never had a junior like him. I really hate him! I'm scared of him.

194
00:17:13,584 --> 00:17:14,874
Follow me.

195
00:17:14,874 --> 00:17:16,934
Ai, seriously.

196
00:17:17,674 --> 00:17:19,494
That hyungnim...

197
00:17:24,134 --> 00:17:25,764
Don't worry.

198
00:17:25,764 --> 00:17:30,644
It's just because Father is mad right now. He won't actually send you to the branch.

199
00:17:31,204 --> 00:17:34,714
Don't comfort me. I have no plans of going to the branch.

200
00:17:34,714 --> 00:17:38,194
It won't be bad to go for a short while. Think of it as cooling your head a bit.

201
00:17:38,194 --> 00:17:42,064
I'm not going anywhere. My place is here.

202
00:17:42,064 --> 00:17:44,034
Jae Joon.

203
00:17:44,034 --> 00:17:46,484
After I decide to accomplish something,

204
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:50,954
not once, have I thought of doing it somewhere else other than here.

205
00:17:50,954 --> 00:17:52,714
Do you know why?

206
00:17:53,354 --> 00:17:56,074
It's because I have something I must do here.

207
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:58,804
I know that you want to make Myeonwoo into the best. But-

208
00:17:58,804 --> 00:18:00,934
The best...

209
00:18:04,444 --> 00:18:06,954
 I have to tear it down.

210
00:18:09,634 --> 00:18:13,104
 It was a castle I built in order to tear it down.

211
00:18:16,334 --> 00:18:20,714
That's right. I wanted to make it the best hospital.

212
00:18:20,714 --> 00:18:25,054
But Park Hoon butted in and everything became disorderly.

213
00:18:25,054 --> 00:18:27,134
You know too that it's not because of Doctor Park.

214
00:18:27,134 --> 00:18:30,934
Then even you went to Doctor Park and ruined me.

215
00:18:30,934 --> 00:18:32,854
- Jae Joon.
- Why is that?

216
00:18:32,854 --> 00:18:35,684
You said you will go to the Business Management team.

217
00:18:35,684 --> 00:18:38,254
Why did you want to impersonate a doctor all of a sudden?

218
00:18:38,254 --> 00:18:39,994
Impersonate a doctor?

219
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,904
Jae Joon, how-

220
00:18:41,904 --> 00:18:43,764
At that moment, at that time, why did you have to become that guy's First?

221
00:18:43,764 --> 00:18:47,104
If it wasn't me, he wouldn't have a First. How can you do a surgery without a First?

222
00:18:47,104 --> 00:18:50,604
You wanted to save the baby? Stop joking.

223
00:18:50,604 --> 00:18:53,854
You wanted to show me, who chose Bong Hyun,

224
00:18:53,854 --> 00:18:58,584
that you could do it too. That's why you went to that guy.

225
00:18:59,214 --> 00:19:01,334
Can't I do that?

226
00:19:06,794 --> 00:19:09,364
Why do you think you can?

227
00:19:09,364 --> 00:19:12,624
Because of that nonsense reason, I lost.

228
00:19:12,624 --> 00:19:15,944
Because of that guy who has no background, I lost!

229
00:19:15,944 --> 00:19:18,924
Why does that make sense?

230
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:30,844
I now know why you lost.

231
00:19:30,844 --> 00:19:34,024
I already know that. Get out.

232
00:19:34,024 --> 00:19:36,194
You lost because you wanted to win.

233
00:19:36,194 --> 00:19:37,304
Does that make sense?

234
00:19:37,304 --> 00:19:39,414
It was a surgery to save the baby!

235
00:19:39,414 --> 00:19:43,264
Since you tried to win the surgery like a game, I mean, a competition

236
00:19:43,264 --> 00:19:45,874
you lost.

237
00:19:45,874 --> 00:19:48,194
It's not me who is trying to impersonate a doctor but you.

238
00:19:48,194 --> 00:19:50,184
So you lost to a real doctor.

239
00:19:50,184 --> 00:19:53,764
It was a fake doctor who lost to the real doctor, Doctor Park.

240
00:19:53,764 --> 00:19:56,114
Do you understand?

241
00:20:09,134 --> 00:20:11,674
 Garbage

242
00:20:16,364 --> 00:20:22,054
 That's right. Bong Hyun does have skills where he doesn't need help from a doctor like Doctor Park.

243
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,604
 Why did you all of a sudden want to impersonate a doctor?

244
00:20:42,384 --> 00:20:44,064
 I'm sorry.

245
00:20:52,204 --> 00:20:54,244
Why aren't you answering the phone?

246
00:20:56,624 --> 00:20:58,774
Father wants to see you so-

247
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:20,244
Stay there!

248
00:21:51,154 --> 00:21:53,094
Doctor Park.

249
00:21:55,964 --> 00:21:57,984
Are you there?

250
00:22:45,804 --> 00:22:52,754

251
00:23:18,524 --> 00:23:22,114
 Thank you for all those times, Chang Yi. I'm leaving.

252
00:23:23,614 --> 00:23:25,984
What are you thankful for?

253
00:23:36,574 --> 00:23:38,654
Hey, Park Hoon!

254
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:44,624
- Hyung!
- Chang Yi.

255
00:23:45,454 --> 00:23:46,874
Have you seen Hyung?

256
00:23:46,874 --> 00:23:48,104
Is something wrong?

257
00:23:48,104 --> 00:23:49,944
I'm going crazy!

258
00:23:49,944 --> 00:23:51,874
Where in the world is he going?

259
00:23:51,874 --> 00:23:53,534
He's leaving?

260
00:24:15,594 --> 00:24:16,714
Why here?

261
00:24:16,714 --> 00:24:19,634
I'm not interested in why you came here.

262
00:24:19,634 --> 00:24:21,734
But I know that the reason you came here is dangerous.

263
00:24:21,734 --> 00:24:22,594
Hoon.

264
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:25,854
I know that in this place, you can't escape from that thing.

265
00:24:25,854 --> 00:24:27,834
Are you by chance...

266
00:24:28,674 --> 00:24:30,224
I'll protect you.

267
00:24:30,224 --> 00:24:32,234
Hoon!

268
00:24:50,304 --> 00:24:52,874
I've ridden a boat here secretly before.

269
00:24:52,874 --> 00:24:57,374
I called this morning, and they say that there is a freighter leaving this morning.

270
00:24:58,564 --> 00:25:00,474
We can't, Hoon.

271
00:25:00,474 --> 00:25:02,554
We have to go back.

272
00:25:02,554 --> 00:25:03,534
Why?

273
00:25:03,534 --> 00:25:06,274
We can never leave this place.

274
00:25:07,324 --> 00:25:10,014
Trust me. I'll protect you.

275
00:25:10,014 --> 00:25:10,824
Hoon!

276
00:25:10,824 --> 00:25:14,474
Don't worry. I asked a favor of a person I can trust.

277
00:25:14,474 --> 00:25:16,054
Doctor Park.

278
00:25:16,054 --> 00:25:18,704
- Ajusshi.
- Long time no see.

279
00:25:18,704 --> 00:25:20,244
Is this the lady?

280
00:25:21,154 --> 00:25:22,024
What about the boat?

281
00:25:22,024 --> 00:25:25,554
I told them, so let's go. The boat is going to leave soon.

282
00:25:27,604 --> 00:25:29,484
We can't, Hoon.

283
00:25:37,094 --> 00:25:39,394
Look at me, Jae Hee.

284
00:25:44,784 --> 00:25:46,424
Let's go.

285
00:25:52,754 --> 00:25:57,534
Why is this guy not answering the phone?

286
00:25:57,534 --> 00:26:00,894
I clearly told him to come early in the afternoon.

287
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:02,694
I'm going crazy.

288
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:08,124
What is it?

289
00:26:09,304 --> 00:26:10,934
Have you seen Doctor Han?

290
00:26:10,934 --> 00:26:12,784
Why are you looking for Doctor Han here?

291
00:26:12,784 --> 00:26:13,904
She is in your team.

292
00:26:13,904 --> 00:26:16,594
I don't know. All I know is about the dinner party.

293
00:26:17,354 --> 00:26:20,664
Where did she go, without answering her phone?

294
00:26:21,424 --> 00:26:23,264
She's not answering either?

295
00:26:33,744 --> 00:26:36,494
Prime Minister, I heard that Park Hoon disappeared.

296
00:26:37,254 --> 00:26:39,284
He disappeared?

297
00:26:39,284 --> 00:26:41,084
What about Han Seung Hee?

298
00:26:41,084 --> 00:26:43,434
I think they're together.

299
00:26:44,434 --> 00:26:47,454
Can they escape safely?

300
00:27:00,814 --> 00:27:04,394
Hurry up and run away! Run away!

301
00:27:04,394 --> 00:27:07,774
Run away! Hurry!

302
00:27:26,404 --> 00:27:28,504
Hey Park Hoon!

303
00:27:34,874 --> 00:27:37,064
It's been a long time.

304
00:27:44,694 --> 00:27:46,674
Cha Jin Soo.

305
00:27:54,484 --> 00:27:56,494
Do you want to leave?

306
00:27:58,964 --> 00:28:01,054
I'll help you leave.

307
00:28:35,774 --> 00:28:39,694
I just told you we will have a get-together. Why do you look so sour?

308
00:28:39,694 --> 00:28:42,214
I am on duty today.

309
00:28:42,214 --> 00:28:45,654
I'm telling you I already took care of that.

310
00:28:45,654 --> 00:28:47,114
What about you?

311
00:28:48,634 --> 00:28:51,484
Well I...if gender ratio is right...

312
00:28:51,484 --> 00:28:53,774
You sly people...

313
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:58,264
You must know very well, but the chief will change soon.

314
00:28:59,194 --> 00:29:02,114
Decide well, okay?

315
00:29:06,114 --> 00:29:07,204
Did Hoon Hyung come here?

316
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:10,754
Not yet. Why isn't he answering his phone?

317
00:29:12,154 --> 00:29:15,324
Hey! If you find him, tell him to call me immediately!

318
00:29:16,614 --> 00:29:18,814
 On the other hand, because North Korea has announced a nuclear test,

319
00:29:18,814 --> 00:29:24,134
 we are expecting the nation's credit rating to go down...

320
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,344
Why are you like this?

321
00:29:29,344 --> 00:29:31,984
What should I do, Mom?

322
00:29:31,984 --> 00:29:34,334
What's wrong?

323
00:29:34,334 --> 00:29:36,554
Hyung disappeared all of a sudden.

324
00:29:36,554 --> 00:29:39,344
Doctor Park? Why?

325
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,654
I don't know either.

326
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,634
What if he is dragged back to North Korea?

327
00:29:43,634 --> 00:29:45,464
What are you talking about?

328
00:29:45,464 --> 00:29:47,804
Why would he be dragged back to North Korea all of a sudden?

329
00:29:47,804 --> 00:29:50,544
There's something like that.

330
00:29:50,544 --> 00:29:52,264
What should I do, Mom?

331
00:29:52,264 --> 00:29:55,514
What should I do if he's dragged back, Mom?

332
00:29:55,514 --> 00:29:57,894
What should I do?

333
00:30:29,734 --> 00:30:33,084
 ...is the eternal leader of the nation and of the people.

334
00:30:41,154 --> 00:30:44,034
 For our dear Supreme Commander Kim Il Sung...

335
00:30:55,384 --> 00:30:58,484
How does it feel, having returned to your homeland?

336
00:30:58,484 --> 00:31:00,554
Where is Jae Hee?

337
00:31:01,984 --> 00:31:05,194
WHERE IS JAE HEE?

338
00:31:15,094 --> 00:31:18,834
Jae Hee ... Jae Hee, are you okay?

339
00:31:21,224 --> 00:31:24,384
Don't do it. Don't do it!

340
00:31:29,384 --> 00:31:33,154
Don't do it! Don't do it! Don't do it!

341
00:31:35,924 --> 00:31:39,414
Stop it, you bastard! Stop it, you bastard!

342
00:31:39,414 --> 00:31:42,344
I'll kill you.

343
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:53,064
Don't do it. Don't do it.

344
00:32:00,264 --> 00:32:02,364
Stop it.

345
00:32:02,364 --> 00:32:04,584
I did everything wrong!

346
00:32:04,584 --> 00:32:06,604
I did wrong!

347
00:32:07,644 --> 00:32:12,214
I'll do everything you tell me to, so please stop.

348
00:32:27,884 --> 00:32:32,484
 Don't worry. Don't worry, Jae Hee. I ... I ...

349
00:32:48,074 --> 00:32:50,254
Listen carefully.

350
00:32:50,254 --> 00:32:56,434
First, you have to do surgery on Prime Minister Jang's heart.

351
00:32:57,034 --> 00:33:03,084
Second, no one must know that Han Seung Hee is Song Jae Hee.

352
00:33:03,854 --> 00:33:09,344
Third, know that I am always watching over you.

353
00:33:15,904 --> 00:33:19,954
"Yes, I understand." Say it.

354
00:33:19,954 --> 00:33:21,784
Doctor Park.

355
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:28,024
Yes ... yes, I understand.

356
00:34:11,474 --> 00:34:13,194
You worked hard.

357
00:34:16,004 --> 00:34:17,944
I'll go back.

358
00:34:57,714 --> 00:35:01,124
Things are going to get bad if people know that both of them disappeared.

359
00:35:01,124 --> 00:35:03,384
You used too much time.

360
00:35:04,374 --> 00:35:07,294
Don't you think it was a meaningful time?

361
00:35:07,964 --> 00:35:09,234
A meaningful time?

362
00:35:09,234 --> 00:35:13,314
I found out what Song Jae Hee means to Park Hoon.

363
00:35:13,314 --> 00:35:16,744
With that we can

364
00:35:16,744 --> 00:35:19,754
make him do whatever we want about the heart surgery.

365
00:35:26,344 --> 00:35:28,924
After they suggest having an inter-Korean summit,

366
00:35:28,924 --> 00:35:31,964
why are they doing a nuclear test?

367
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:36,354
North Korea wants a summit conference as soon as possible.

368
00:35:36,354 --> 00:35:39,384
If you relay the message that you agree to have the summit,

369
00:35:39,384 --> 00:35:42,324
I think they will not mention a nuclear test.

370
00:35:42,324 --> 00:35:44,784
We can't do it in this condition.

371
00:35:44,784 --> 00:35:48,664
I heard that North Korea wants something. Is that why...

372
00:35:48,664 --> 00:35:52,624
They are asking for $2 billion in exchange for the summit.

373
00:35:52,624 --> 00:35:56,104
$2 billion is  ₩2 trillion.

374
00:35:56,104 --> 00:36:00,604
With that money, we can feed our nation's starving children for 10 years.

375
00:36:00,604 --> 00:36:04,384
But that is only 5% of the national defense budget.

376
00:36:04,384 --> 00:36:07,524
For peace on the Korean peninsula and approval rating...

377
00:36:07,524 --> 00:36:09,514
Stop saying frustrating stuff.

378
00:36:09,514 --> 00:36:13,334
Don't you realize that if we agree to this, we have to give whatever they ask for each time afterward?

379
00:36:13,334 --> 00:36:17,154
Then, you can release this news to the public and get public opinion.

380
00:36:17,154 --> 00:36:19,254
There's only certain things that the citizens must know.

381
00:36:19,254 --> 00:36:21,824
If the opinion splits into two,

382
00:36:21,824 --> 00:36:24,554
it will only cause confusion, Prime Minster Jang.

383
00:36:24,554 --> 00:36:29,744
But this kind of  tension is not good for the polls.

384
00:36:29,744 --> 00:36:34,244
Are you suggesting wasting taxpayers' money to get a higher approval rating?

385
00:36:46,334 --> 00:36:50,694
How can he manage Korea by having a petty mind?

386
00:36:50,694 --> 00:36:54,234
President Hong...

387
00:36:55,844 --> 00:37:00,444
But peace bought with money does not last long, Prime Minister.

388
00:37:00,444 --> 00:37:03,744
Anything can be bought with money.

389
00:37:03,744 --> 00:37:05,364
You still don't understand?

390
00:37:05,364 --> 00:37:08,684
We live in a world where we can buy war with money.

391
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:15,124
And in Korea we need to have a leader who knows that well.

392
00:37:21,814 --> 00:37:23,094
What about Park Hoon?

393
00:37:23,094 --> 00:37:24,434
He returned to the hospital.

394
00:37:24,434 --> 00:37:28,734
Watch carefully. If things like this continues, then the deal might break.

395
00:37:28,734 --> 00:37:30,234
Yes.

396
00:37:36,894 --> 00:37:38,394
I got it.

397
00:37:39,894 --> 00:37:41,594
Prime Minister.

398
00:38:09,574 --> 00:38:12,644
Hyung! Hyung!

399
00:38:13,654 --> 00:38:17,074
Hyung! Hey! Park Hoon!

400
00:38:18,994 --> 00:38:20,634
Hyung!

401
00:38:21,314 --> 00:38:22,734
Hyung!

402
00:38:27,064 --> 00:38:28,554
Hyung!

403
00:38:29,464 --> 00:38:31,324
Hyung! Hyung!

404
00:38:31,994 --> 00:38:33,724
Hyung!

405
00:38:41,914 --> 00:38:43,584
Hyung!

406
00:38:48,414 --> 00:38:50,404
Jae Hee.

407
00:38:51,844 --> 00:38:54,094
Jae Hee!

408
00:38:59,334 --> 00:39:02,704
Why the hell were you not answering your phone?

409
00:39:06,024 --> 00:39:08,014
Jae Hee!

410
00:39:13,454 --> 00:39:16,214
Do you know how much I worried?

411
00:39:26,884 --> 00:39:28,554
He-hello?

412
00:39:28,554 --> 00:39:30,484
Doctor Park!

413
00:39:30,484 --> 00:39:31,424
Who are you?

414
00:39:31,424 --> 00:39:34,454
What do you mean who am I? It's Quack.

415
00:39:34,454 --> 00:39:35,624
I'm hanging up.

416
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:39,004
 We're all waiting for you. Why aren't you coming?

417
00:39:40,384 --> 00:39:42,254
Everyone?

418
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,033
Is Doctor Han there?

419
00:40:00,905 --> 00:40:03,004
She's here.

420
00:40:12,313 --> 00:40:16,083
You said you were going somewhere. Why were you sleeping there?

421
00:40:17,403 --> 00:40:19,663
Is that car, Jae Hee's?

422
00:40:19,663 --> 00:40:22,343
She bought that expensive car with her task fund?

423
00:40:22,343 --> 00:40:23,633
Shut up and stay still.

424
00:40:23,633 --> 00:40:27,323
Stay still? Jae Hee unni is a spy and you want me to stay still?

425
00:40:27,323 --> 00:40:28,553
She's not a spy!

426
00:40:28,553 --> 00:40:32,373
If she's not, why is that unni here? Why did she change her name? Why?!

427
00:40:32,373 --> 00:40:35,453
You said you saw her with the Prime Minister. Why is a spy with the Prime Minister?

428
00:40:35,453 --> 00:40:37,993
Maybe he's also a spy!

429
00:40:55,443 --> 00:40:56,293
Why?

430
00:40:56,293 --> 00:40:58,903
Don't come around me anymore.

431
00:40:58,903 --> 00:41:00,653
Why?

432
00:41:00,653 --> 00:41:02,853
I can't stand the sight of you.

433
00:41:04,613 --> 00:41:08,523
I can't stand the sight of you either, Hyung, so get lost.

434
00:41:23,553 --> 00:41:25,513
Hey!!

435
00:41:34,723 --> 00:41:37,063
You would like an opportunity?

436
00:41:37,063 --> 00:41:40,053
Yes, Prime Minister.

437
00:41:40,053 --> 00:41:42,433
I can't understand.

438
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:48,383
With a Harvard degree, it doesn't necessarily have to be Myeongwoo.

439
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:53,453
I'm not saying that Myeongwoo is small but

440
00:41:53,453 --> 00:41:58,923
isn't that dream you keep referring to achievable anywhere?

441
00:41:58,923 --> 00:42:01,863
It's because I want to win.

442
00:42:01,863 --> 00:42:04,133
You want to win.

443
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:07,073
This is my request.

444
00:42:07,073 --> 00:42:09,523
Give me another chance.

445
00:42:09,523 --> 00:42:13,413
I don't know. It's Myeongwoo's internal affairs ...

446
00:42:13,413 --> 00:42:16,293
It's a little odd for me to get involved.

447
00:42:20,033 --> 00:42:24,123
Since you came all the way here, enjoy the tea while it's hot before leaving.

448
00:42:24,123 --> 00:42:27,133
Prime Minister, Park Hoon was kicked out of the hospital but

449
00:42:27,133 --> 00:42:29,663
you made him come back.

450
00:42:33,433 --> 00:42:36,033
Why do you think such a thing?

451
00:42:41,343 --> 00:42:45,933
The Chairman is not wishy-washy enough

452
00:42:45,933 --> 00:42:48,653
that he would take back someone who was once kicked out.

453
00:42:50,503 --> 00:42:55,633
That means there was someone else who was able to move the Chairman.

454
00:42:58,823 --> 00:43:01,213
You have a great imagination.

455
00:43:01,213 --> 00:43:03,933
I won't ask why it happened.

456
00:43:03,933 --> 00:43:07,333
But as you did towards Dr. Park Hoon,

457
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:10,433
I'm asking for just one more chance.

458
00:43:15,903 --> 00:43:17,723
Do me this favor, Prime Minister.

459
00:43:42,043 --> 00:43:44,333
Cocky punk.

460
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:47,073
How dare he threaten me.

461
00:43:47,073 --> 00:43:49,283
There is something you must see.

462
00:43:50,383 --> 00:43:51,113
What is it?

463
00:43:51,113 --> 00:43:53,713
It is about Chief Han Jae Joon.

464
00:43:53,713 --> 00:43:54,913
What's there to see?

465
00:43:54,913 --> 00:43:59,123
Han Jae Joon is not his real name.

466
00:44:33,494 --> 00:44:35,154
Hey, why are you here so late?

467
00:44:35,154 --> 00:44:37,884
Water Bottle!

468
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:40,174
Doctor Park!

469
00:44:47,924 --> 00:44:49,694
Doctor Park.

470
00:44:53,474 --> 00:44:55,094
Where are you going?

471
00:44:55,094 --> 00:44:59,234
Doc Park! Doc Han!

472
00:45:00,584 --> 00:45:02,144
- Let go of me. 
- Come.

473
00:45:02,144 --> 00:45:04,494
Where are we going?

474
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:06,124
Anywhere.

475
00:45:07,324 --> 00:45:08,754
You still don't get it after going through what you did?

476
00:45:08,754 --> 00:45:10,934
That's right. I don't know.

477
00:45:11,614 --> 00:45:15,054
Go inside. If those people find out-

478
00:45:15,054 --> 00:45:17,484
- It'll be alright if we leave now.
 - What will be alright?

479
00:45:17,484 --> 00:45:20,444
We can just hide. How can they find us in this large place?

480
00:45:20,444 --> 00:45:25,524
They'll find us. Those people will definitely find us.

481
00:45:25,524 --> 00:45:28,454
Then let's go to the police. Let's turn ourselves in instead.

482
00:45:28,454 --> 00:45:30,154
You think we'll be safe in prison?

483
00:45:30,154 --> 00:45:31,744
At least we won't die!

484
00:45:31,744 --> 00:45:35,434
South Korea's Prime Minister is on their side!

485
00:45:35,434 --> 00:45:38,394
There's nowhere safe in this world.

486
00:45:39,254 --> 00:45:41,324
Let's go inside.

487
00:45:41,324 --> 00:45:43,754
You'll be in danger too if people see.

488
00:45:45,754 --> 00:45:47,574
Who asked you to worry about me?

489
00:45:47,574 --> 00:45:50,654
How could I not worry about you?

490
00:45:52,394 --> 00:45:54,094
Jae Hee.

491
00:45:54,094 --> 00:45:57,824
Please let's go inside. Please Hoon.

492
00:45:57,824 --> 00:46:00,414
I don't want to. Let's go.

493
00:46:00,414 --> 00:46:05,144
We can run away. I can protect you.

494
00:46:10,214 --> 00:46:13,044
I wanted to see you so much.

495
00:46:14,794 --> 00:46:18,654
I waited so long to meet you.

496
00:46:20,464 --> 00:46:22,634
Jae Hee.

497
00:46:22,634 --> 00:46:25,454
We barely met again now.

498
00:46:25,454 --> 00:46:28,014
Why won't you listen to me?

499
00:46:32,774 --> 00:46:35,694
I don't want us to be separated again.

500
00:46:35,694 --> 00:46:38,254
I don't want you to be in danger either.

501
00:46:43,544 --> 00:46:45,994
So...

502
00:46:45,994 --> 00:46:49,234
Listen to what I'm saying, you dummy.

503
00:46:51,804 --> 00:46:53,604
Alright.

504
00:46:54,774 --> 00:46:57,404
I'll do whatever you say.

505
00:47:05,264 --> 00:47:09,384
What should I do? Should I go inside and have a blast?

506
00:47:24,334 --> 00:47:32,234

507
00:48:11,194 --> 00:48:13,544
 US Department of Homeland Security Fax Message

508
00:48:17,634 --> 00:48:18,744
Is this true?

509
00:48:18,744 --> 00:48:23,614
Yes. I already confirmed with the Holt Children's Service office in the US.

510
00:48:23,614 --> 00:48:25,624
His real name is Lee Seung Hoon.

511
00:48:25,624 --> 00:48:29,454
And his father  died at Myeongwoo

512
00:48:29,454 --> 00:48:32,394
twenty years ago due to a surgical accident.

513
00:48:32,394 --> 00:48:34,574
Then, perhaps...

514
00:48:34,574 --> 00:48:36,734
That lawsuit by Park Chul was for

515
00:48:36,734 --> 00:48:42,854
Lee Seung Hoon ... no, Chief Han Jae Joon's father.

516
00:48:57,044 --> 00:48:59,374
Why did you let him in?

517
00:48:59,374 --> 00:49:03,034
Well...he was pleading so intently.

518
00:49:03,034 --> 00:49:04,914
Send him back!

519
00:49:08,724 --> 00:49:10,734
I beg of you, Chairman.

520
00:49:11,594 --> 00:49:15,284
You...keep disappointing me.

521
00:49:15,284 --> 00:49:17,784
At least when you threatened me to leave Myeongwoo

522
00:49:17,784 --> 00:49:20,824
you had an unyielding spirit.

523
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:24,644
Please give me just one more chance, Chairman.

524
00:49:25,964 --> 00:49:27,774
Go back!

525
00:49:30,464 --> 00:49:31,524
 Go back!

526
00:49:31,524 --> 00:49:34,534
 I won't leave until you answer me. Tell me.

527
00:49:34,534 --> 00:49:37,894
 Why did you kill my father? Why did you kill him?

528
00:49:37,894 --> 00:49:41,014
 Kill? I'm a doctor who saves lives.

529
00:49:41,014 --> 00:49:44,254
 Liar! You killed my father.

530
00:49:44,254 --> 00:49:46,614
  Insolent brat.

531
00:49:46,614 --> 00:49:49,154
 Even if you act like this, your dead father won't come back to life.

532
00:49:49,154 --> 00:49:50,954
 Go back.

533
00:50:19,914 --> 00:50:22,734
This is all because of Soo Hyeon, Dad.

534
00:50:22,734 --> 00:50:25,454
Because that girl sided with Park Hoon.

535
00:50:25,454 --> 00:50:28,544
What entitles you  to be talking like that?

536
00:50:35,134 --> 00:50:37,224
Hello?

537
00:50:37,224 --> 00:50:38,824
What?

538
00:50:41,624 --> 00:50:43,734
It's the Prime Minister.

539
00:50:46,754 --> 00:50:48,824
Why are you calling in this time of day, Prime Minister?

540
00:50:48,824 --> 00:50:52,024
 Today Han Jae Joon came to me.

541
00:50:52,024 --> 00:50:53,354
That guy.

542
00:50:53,354 --> 00:50:55,074
What do you think about it?

543
00:50:55,074 --> 00:50:57,844
How about giving him another chance?

544
00:50:57,844 --> 00:51:03,184
I'm sorry, but I wish you wouldn't get involved in our business.

545
00:51:03,184 --> 00:51:07,404
Anyway, it's about fixing my heart.

546
00:51:07,404 --> 00:51:11,054
I promised that I would make a decision with the outcome of the last surgery.

547
00:51:11,054 --> 00:51:15,864
A promise can be changed anytime, don't you think?

548
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:18,344
I am not a politician, Prime Minister.

549
00:51:18,344 --> 00:51:20,724
There are bone inside those words, Chairman.

550
00:51:20,724 --> 00:51:22,764
Does it sound like that?

551
00:51:22,764 --> 00:51:27,424
Anyway, I don't want to change my decision without reason.

552
00:51:27,424 --> 00:51:31,064
Fine then. Then how about this?

553
00:51:31,064 --> 00:51:33,754
I will make a plausible reason for you to do so.

554
00:51:33,754 --> 00:51:35,134
A plausible reason?

555
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:37,534
Without ruining your reputation,

556
00:51:37,534 --> 00:51:41,524
I will help you raise a faithful dog.

557
00:51:42,754 --> 00:51:45,654
Then, I will take it that you have accepted it.

558
00:51:45,654 --> 00:51:48,484
I will send you a reason soon.

559
00:51:48,484 --> 00:51:51,294
I will hang up now.

560
00:52:22,664 --> 00:52:25,024
He stole Han Seung Hee's medical information?

561
00:52:25,024 --> 00:52:28,474
Professor Moon forcefully threatened an employee...

562
00:52:28,474 --> 00:52:31,824
If something like that happened, you should have reported it to me!

563
00:52:31,824 --> 00:52:34,854
Didn't you know taking other people's medical files is against the law?

564
00:52:34,854 --> 00:52:39,384
I'm sorry. The Director said he would figure it out on his own. . .

565
00:52:39,384 --> 00:52:41,074
Director Choi?

566
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:43,654
And the person involved said to just forget about it.

567
00:52:43,654 --> 00:52:46,494
In any case, I'm sorry, Chairman.

568
00:52:50,784 --> 00:52:52,034
Really?

569
00:52:52,034 --> 00:52:55,834
I don't know if I'll get fired too like this.

570
00:52:55,834 --> 00:52:59,404
I think Park Hoon would be the one getting fired.

571
00:53:00,964 --> 00:53:03,444
What are you doing not leaving?

572
00:53:19,594 --> 00:53:21,434
Should I tell him to come in now?

573
00:53:21,434 --> 00:53:23,064
Leave him be.

574
00:53:23,064 --> 00:53:26,404
Why? We found a way to get rid of Professor Moon and Park Hoon.

575
00:53:26,404 --> 00:53:29,004
I have to train him.

576
00:53:29,004 --> 00:53:32,324
Earlier this afternoon, he looked like he was ready to bite his owner.

577
00:53:32,324 --> 00:53:34,484
Chief Han?

578
00:53:35,404 --> 00:53:37,924
 If you want to continue to see me at Myeongwoo Hospital,

579
00:53:37,924 --> 00:53:40,244
 you have to make another opportunity, Chairman.

580
00:53:40,244 --> 00:53:45,604
This is the time to fix his bad habits so he won't ever bare his teeth again.

581
00:53:46,984 --> 00:53:51,774
But Father, how did Prime Minister

582
00:53:51,774 --> 00:53:54,844
know that Park Hoon looked at the medical records?

583
00:53:57,564 --> 00:54:00,044
Yes, I did.

584
00:54:00,044 --> 00:54:02,194
I understand.

585
00:54:15,114 --> 00:54:17,234
What kind of phone call was it?

586
00:54:17,234 --> 00:54:19,314
The hospital.

587
00:54:19,314 --> 00:54:21,044
Did they tell you to come in?

588
00:54:21,044 --> 00:54:22,854
No.

589
00:54:23,694 --> 00:54:26,434
Then, I will go in first.

590
00:54:27,584 --> 00:54:30,064
You should play a little bit more.

591
00:54:30,794 --> 00:54:33,774
You said you left Seung Min with a neighbor.

592
00:54:33,774 --> 00:54:36,694
It's uncomfortable.

593
00:54:36,694 --> 00:54:41,381
Everyone except Doctor Moon looks depressed.

594
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:50,473
Will Chairman Oh Joon Gyu change his decision?

595
00:55:50,473 --> 00:55:52,393
He has to.

596
00:55:52,393 --> 00:55:55,023
Then, what about Park Hoon and Han Jae Joon...

597
00:55:55,023 --> 00:56:00,003
The score right now is 1 to 0.

598
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:18,293
Didn't I tell you to go back?

599
00:56:20,133 --> 00:56:22,443
If you don't go back, I will call the police.

600
00:56:22,443 --> 00:56:25,163
I was wrong, Chairman.

601
00:56:26,353 --> 00:56:28,703
Please give me one more chance.

602
00:56:30,803 --> 00:56:33,703
What's your reason for going this far?

603
00:56:38,343 --> 00:56:40,683
  Insolent brat.

604
00:56:40,683 --> 00:56:43,243
 Even if you act like this, your dead father won't come back to life.

605
00:56:43,243 --> 00:56:45,203
 Go back!

606
00:56:47,133 --> 00:56:48,453
 Why did you kill my father?

607
00:56:48,453 --> 00:56:50,843
Because there are still things

608
00:56:50,843 --> 00:56:54,133
I have left to do at Myeongwoo.

609
00:56:54,133 --> 00:56:55,003
Things to do?

610
00:56:55,003 --> 00:56:56,343
 Save my father!

611
00:56:56,343 --> 00:56:58,333
Yes.

612
00:56:58,333 --> 00:57:00,473
I want to raise Myeongwoo to be the best hospital.

613
00:57:00,473 --> 00:57:02,033
 I won't leave you alone!

614
00:57:02,033 --> 00:57:04,163
 What are you doing?

615
00:57:04,163 --> 00:57:08,403
I don't want to lose Soo Hyeon, Chairman.

616
00:57:08,403 --> 00:57:11,513
 Okay fine, no matter what, I will get my revenge.

617
00:57:11,513 --> 00:57:14,433
Please give me a chance. If you do so,

618
00:57:14,433 --> 00:57:17,873
I will serve you with my whole life.

619
00:57:17,873 --> 00:57:19,953
 I will take revenge on you!

620
00:57:19,953 --> 00:57:23,803
So please, give me one more chance.

621
00:57:25,783 --> 00:57:27,183
I'm begging you.

622
00:57:27,183 --> 00:57:28,733
 Don't forget me! 
I, Han Jae Joon,

623
00:57:28,733 --> 00:57:31,653
 My father is Lee Jo Seon and I'm Lee Seung Hoon.

624
00:57:31,653 --> 00:57:33,853
 Please remember me!

625
00:57:36,373 --> 00:57:37,463
At Myeongwoo

626
00:57:37,463 --> 00:57:40,103
 Remember the person who is going to take revenge on you!

627
00:57:40,103 --> 00:57:43,023
so I can do the thing I need to do,

628
00:57:43,023 --> 00:57:46,833
please give me one more chance, Chairman.

629
00:57:46,833 --> 00:57:48,963
Please.

630
00:57:50,093 --> 00:57:54,433
Please give me one more chance! Please!
