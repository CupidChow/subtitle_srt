1
00:00:25,767 --> 00:00:27,267

2
00:00:28,167 --> 00:00:30,857
Try to do something, huh?

3
00:00:31,897 --> 00:00:34,807
Why isn't Han Jae Hoon coming?

4
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:46,267
Chief Han! Quickly, come here. Hurry.

5
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,347
Doctor Park.

6
00:01:02,447 --> 00:01:05,377
Aigoo, what is all this, Master?

7
00:01:05,377 --> 00:01:07,197
Park Hoon.

8
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:14,107
Let's change players.

9
00:01:33,187 --> 00:01:35,867
Isn't that Doctor Park Hoon? Doctor Park Hoon came.

10
00:01:35,867 --> 00:01:37,147
Oh, Doctor Park came.

11
00:01:37,147 --> 00:01:39,697
- Really?
- Let me see. Yes, really.

12
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:55,947
Needle holder. Forceps.

13
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:21,727
It's done.  The patient is alive.  The patient is alive, rascal!

14
00:02:21,727 --> 00:02:25,147
It's not finished yet. Don't relax.

15
00:02:25,147 --> 00:02:27,377
I understand.

16
00:02:48,857 --> 00:02:50,327
Why are you back?

17
00:02:50,327 --> 00:02:53,937
Did Professor Moon handle it?

18
00:02:55,327 --> 00:02:59,257
No, Park Hoon came.

19
00:03:03,157 --> 00:03:07,067
 Episode 17

20
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:09,217
Doctor Yang Jung Han.

21
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,817
This is Yang Jung Han.

22
00:03:20,817 --> 00:03:23,177
You didn't forget what I said, right?

23
00:03:23,177 --> 00:03:27,227
This surgery, Park Hoon absolutely cannot win.

24
00:03:27,227 --> 00:03:30,087
Make him lose at all cost!

25
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:43,277
I understand.

26
00:03:55,757 --> 00:03:59,537
Septum and valves are a mess.

27
00:03:59,537 --> 00:04:01,257
Even the arteries are damaged.

28
00:04:01,257 --> 00:04:03,157
I know.  There isn't a part that's not damaged.

29
00:04:03,157 --> 00:04:06,037
What are we going to do? This really is a major construction.

30
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:09,907
What do you mean? We have to suture prettily and super fast.

31
00:04:09,907 --> 00:04:14,437
Now, then we'll start with the ventricular septum.

32
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:57,517
You're blocking my vision.

33
00:04:57,517 --> 00:05:00,557
I'm sorry. I was trying to make it more visible...

34
00:05:04,017 --> 00:05:06,477
Please continue.

35
00:05:12,607 --> 00:05:15,637
Instead of agonizing, move aside.

36
00:05:15,637 --> 00:05:18,497
This is where my patience ends.

37
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,537
Master, please change to first.

38
00:05:21,537 --> 00:05:24,747
- Why me?
- Quickly change!

39
00:05:46,167 --> 00:05:48,117
Cut.

40
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:51,407
Please turn off the pump.

41
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:57,157
Anesthesiologist!  What are you doing?

42
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:59,657
His vitals are unstable. They're fluctuating too much.

43
00:05:59,657 --> 00:06:03,637
- Focus! 
 - We have to call a cardiovascular anesthesiologist.

44
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:15,077
I'll do it.

45
00:08:23,777 --> 00:08:28,907
You reallyâ€¦ Do you really have no thought of becoming my adopted son?

46
00:08:28,907 --> 00:08:31,367
Your wife won't like it.

47
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:32,917
I can leave the rest to you, right?

48
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:34,737
Okay.

49
00:08:34,737 --> 00:08:36,767
Doctor Park.

50
00:08:44,297 --> 00:08:46,037
You can laugh?

51
00:08:46,037 --> 00:08:49,857
I should laugh since I am here anyway. Should I cry?

52
00:08:49,857 --> 00:08:51,287
Hoon.

53
00:08:51,287 --> 00:08:52,777
Stop it.

54
00:08:52,777 --> 00:08:54,887
Why did you come? I told you not to.

55
00:08:54,887 --> 00:08:57,297
I told you that I'd never send you into any operating room alone.

56
00:08:57,297 --> 00:08:59,277
Are you being like this because you don't know what kind of operating room that is?

57
00:08:59,277 --> 00:09:03,287
I know. It is dangerous, so let's go together.

58
00:09:04,247 --> 00:09:06,437
It's not too late yet so go back.

59
00:09:06,437 --> 00:09:08,657
I'm not leaving you alone.

60
00:09:08,657 --> 00:09:11,727
Go! Please.

61
00:09:11,727 --> 00:09:14,577
If you're really thinking of me, then don't do this.

62
00:09:14,577 --> 00:09:18,027
At that bridge in Budapest, when you let go of my hand,

63
00:09:18,027 --> 00:09:20,097
I really hated you.

64
00:09:20,097 --> 00:09:23,497
The time I spent without you was too painful.

65
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:27,807
I really hated myself for not being able to fall into the river together with you.

66
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,367
Don't do that again.

67
00:09:33,207 --> 00:09:35,007
The last competition,

68
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:39,527
I will win no matter what. So let's go together.

69
00:09:39,527 --> 00:09:44,337
We're going to make the surgery team you first thought of  and will go in together.

70
00:09:44,337 --> 00:09:47,807
I will win so that you can meet the President.

71
00:09:50,177 --> 00:09:53,007
And Han Jae Joon is a good doctor.

72
00:09:53,007 --> 00:09:56,217
We can't ruin him by getting him involved in this conspiracy.

73
00:09:56,217 --> 00:09:58,287
Do you have time to worry about others?

74
00:09:58,287 --> 00:10:02,387
In fact, there are mountain loads of my worries too.  So I'm wondering,

75
00:10:02,387 --> 00:10:04,447
can you take one of those away?

76
00:10:04,447 --> 00:10:06,807
What?

77
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,527
Mom.

78
00:10:11,717 --> 00:10:13,897
I'm begging you.

79
00:10:32,087 --> 00:10:33,587
Yes.

80
00:10:35,497 --> 00:10:37,527
It seems Park Hoon went back.

81
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:42,447
Even so, he is going to be left out of the plan.

82
00:10:43,237 --> 00:10:47,597
I will be on the surgery team with Chief Han.

83
00:10:59,907 --> 00:11:02,787
Should I wash it in the washing machine?

84
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,977
Hyung!

85
00:11:12,657 --> 00:11:14,627
What about Mom?

86
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:17,627
Whose mom?

87
00:11:41,587 --> 00:11:48,697

88
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,887
Mom.

89
00:11:58,407 --> 00:12:00,417
Hoon, you're back?

90
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:16,877
Where did you go?

91
00:12:16,877 --> 00:12:19,427
I was looking for you.

92
00:12:21,437 --> 00:12:23,707
I'm sorry, Hoon.

93
00:12:23,707 --> 00:12:26,327
I'm really sorry.

94
00:12:27,437 --> 00:12:31,747
No, I was wrong.

95
00:12:37,747 --> 00:12:40,047
Who are you?

96
00:12:41,397 --> 00:12:44,847
It's me, Hoon.

97
00:12:48,347 --> 00:12:51,627
My Hoon is only 8 years old.

98
00:12:52,877 --> 00:12:54,667
I'm sorry.

99
00:12:55,487 --> 00:12:57,387
I'm really sorry.

100
00:12:59,807 --> 00:13:05,877
I just thought that you had abandoned me, so

101
00:13:05,947 --> 00:13:08,097
I resented you.

102
00:13:09,847 --> 00:13:12,517
I didn't even know you became like this.

103
00:13:17,727 --> 00:13:19,837
I'm sorry, Mom.

104
00:13:43,357 --> 00:13:45,837
Should I keep taking care of her?

105
00:13:45,837 --> 00:13:49,197
- I'm counting on you.
- I'm scared.

106
00:13:49,197 --> 00:13:52,107
I'm not saying your mom is scary.

107
00:13:52,107 --> 00:13:56,637
Jae Hee is acting like that too. It must mean that there are people looking for her if you're hiding her here.

108
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:59,897
That's why I'm asking you, the person I trust the most in the world.

109
00:13:59,897 --> 00:14:02,797
- Stop saying nonsense.
 - Then the second?

110
00:14:02,797 --> 00:14:05,007
You can joke around right now?

111
00:14:05,007 --> 00:14:07,147
The jokes are coming out well.

112
00:14:08,677 --> 00:14:10,887
I'm going.  Take care of her.

113
00:14:18,967 --> 00:14:23,597
It's unexpected for you to come here personally, Chairman.

114
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:27,577
Park Hoon, that jerk... I heard you said he wouldn't be able to come?

115
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,427
I know.

116
00:14:30,427 --> 00:14:33,327
Fine, what exactly is this?

117
00:14:33,327 --> 00:14:37,037
It should be the end of the story if you get your surgery by the doctor you want.

118
00:14:37,037 --> 00:14:40,227
Park Hoon or whatever, why are you being so fickle about him?

119
00:14:40,267 --> 00:14:44,367
I'm thinking about withdrawing Myeongwoo now from Prime Minister's surgery altogether!

120
00:14:44,377 --> 00:14:47,407
The heart that'll be getting the surgery

121
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:50,687
isn't mine.

122
00:14:52,217 --> 00:14:55,947
It's not for mine but the person above me.

123
00:14:56,847 --> 00:14:59,597
Coul...d it be?

124
00:14:59,597 --> 00:15:02,877
Yes, it's the President's.

125
00:15:04,097 --> 00:15:07,227
But why?

126
00:15:07,227 --> 00:15:11,537
Wouldn't the President's health be a top secret?

127
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:13,957
There's nothing good if it gets known

128
00:15:13,957 --> 00:15:16,587
when his approval rating has fallen already.

129
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:21,207
Then, when the surgery ends...

130
00:15:21,207 --> 00:15:25,197
Yes, well, you'll receive support funds from here and there,

131
00:15:25,827 --> 00:15:30,477
and the fact that the hospital is in charge of the President is a bonus.

132
00:15:37,847 --> 00:15:41,327
I really thought I was dying, crap.

133
00:15:41,327 --> 00:15:44,687
It's because you haven't held a scapel in a while.

134
00:15:44,697 --> 00:15:49,527
Why did Park Hoon tell you to move from being First?

135
00:15:49,527 --> 00:15:53,027
He must have thought that you were much better than me.

136
00:15:53,027 --> 00:15:56,287
Come to think of it, you left during the last surgery for good.

137
00:15:56,287 --> 00:15:58,787
The day that Park Hoon hurt his hand.

138
00:15:59,827 --> 00:16:02,677
Anyway, what's going to happen to this match?

139
00:16:02,677 --> 00:16:04,097
The match?

140
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,517
It must be a tie, right?

141
00:16:05,517 --> 00:16:08,377
Of course!

142
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:14,667
Chairman hasn't come back yet.

143
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:17,317
I will contact you when he comes back.

144
00:16:19,537 --> 00:16:21,367
Chief Han.

145
00:16:24,757 --> 00:16:26,997
We tied, right?

146
00:16:28,357 --> 00:16:30,657
Am I right or wrong?

147
00:16:32,897 --> 00:16:35,787
It is something that Chairman will decide.

148
00:16:38,007 --> 00:16:43,027
Geez, the answer is right in your expression, as being tied.

149
00:16:44,597 --> 00:16:46,327
You came?

150
00:16:57,747 --> 00:16:59,967
It's constriction of the mitral valve.

151
00:16:59,967 --> 00:17:02,477
I think the valve has arterial plaque (been calcified) a bit.

152
00:17:02,477 --> 00:17:05,507
Let's go with that patient this time.

153
00:17:05,507 --> 00:17:07,287
Isn't this too simple?

154
00:17:07,287 --> 00:17:10,097
It's just putting in an artificial valve.

155
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:13,657
What is this?

156
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:16,677
Chief Han's patient is much easier.

157
00:17:19,487 --> 00:17:24,267
As with the twins, the one who  finishes the fastest will be the winner.  We'll look at the prognosis too.

158
00:17:24,267 --> 00:17:26,577
Chairman this is too lopsided.

159
00:17:26,577 --> 00:17:30,327
For us, it's a man over 40, and Chief Han's patient is a young lady in her 20s.

160
00:17:30,327 --> 00:17:33,967
It's much harder for us because the valve has plaque.

161
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:35,357
If you don't like it, speak now.

162
00:17:35,357 --> 00:17:36,497
- Of course I don't like it-
- Then,

163
00:17:36,497 --> 00:17:39,667
just end the competition as Chief Han being the winner.

164
00:17:42,337 --> 00:17:45,387
- Chairman.
- Prime Minister is telling us to select a surgery team quickly.

165
00:17:45,387 --> 00:17:47,347
Until when are you going to keep talking about the competition?

166
00:17:47,347 --> 00:17:49,717
- Even so-
- What?

167
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:53,097
Say it!

168
00:18:13,157 --> 00:18:14,347
Let's just do it.

169
00:18:14,347 --> 00:18:15,807
What? Hey!

170
00:18:15,807 --> 00:18:17,047
Should we not do it?

171
00:18:17,047 --> 00:18:18,177
Hey!

172
00:18:18,177 --> 00:18:19,767
Have we ever had the advantage?

173
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:22,487
But this time, he's too blatantly helping the other side!

174
00:18:22,487 --> 00:18:25,257
- I will win so don't worry.
- Really?

175
00:18:25,257 --> 00:18:28,367
Yes. But I need to organize my team first.

176
00:18:28,367 --> 00:18:30,217
Tell me now.

177
00:18:30,217 --> 00:18:32,957
Exactly what happened.

178
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:36,357
I definitely told you.

179
00:18:36,357 --> 00:18:40,287
If you ever do anything strange in the operating room, I wouldn't just let it pass again.

180
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:43,407
What strange thing did I do?

181
00:18:43,407 --> 00:18:45,797
Are you going to keep lying?

182
00:18:48,597 --> 00:18:53,967
That's fine. Doctor Yang, don't enter my operating room from now on.

183
00:18:58,427 --> 00:19:00,397
Doctor Park.

184
00:19:03,957 --> 00:19:07,327
It's not only about money.

185
00:19:07,327 --> 00:19:10,307
I hate your arrogance.

186
00:19:11,407 --> 00:19:12,637
Jung Han.

187
00:19:12,637 --> 00:19:18,257
Someone like you would never know how an ordinary person like me has to make

188
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,637
a desperate effort to survive in this world.

189
00:19:20,637 --> 00:19:23,727
That cashier's check you threw at me saying it was to pay for the patient's hospital fee,

190
00:19:23,727 --> 00:19:26,097
it was from Professor Moon, right?

191
00:19:27,137 --> 00:19:30,797
That money you can have if you so wish it,

192
00:19:31,747 --> 00:19:34,407
I have to make an effort for months.

193
00:19:35,277 --> 00:19:37,677
Or do dirty work.

194
00:19:39,487 --> 00:19:41,157
Jung Han.

195
00:19:41,157 --> 00:19:44,657
I have actually done many dirty things myself too.

196
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:48,647
Because I know well how painful and regrettable that is,

197
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:51,467
I'm telling you to get out of my operating room.

198
00:19:52,897 --> 00:19:57,237
Also, you are absolutely not an ordinary person either.

199
00:19:57,237 --> 00:20:00,697
Just the fact that you have a doctor's gown on,

200
00:20:00,757 --> 00:20:03,537
people willingly put their life in your hands.

201
00:20:04,357 --> 00:20:08,047
Let's not disappoint those people anymore,

202
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:09,987
Doctor Yang.

203
00:20:20,937 --> 00:20:23,637
Doctor Park's words are right.

204
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:28,227
Jung Hanâ€¦ if you stay here any longer,

205
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,707
you'll end up losing everything.

206
00:20:36,007 --> 00:20:38,017
Just do the surgery.

207
00:20:38,017 --> 00:20:39,797
Will the Prime Minister acknowledge it?

208
00:20:39,797 --> 00:20:42,217
You don't have to worry about that.

209
00:20:43,737 --> 00:20:45,637
I got it.

210
00:20:46,757 --> 00:20:50,327
You, after the surgery team is chosen,

211
00:20:50,327 --> 00:20:53,517
you will have to be an acting chairman.

212
00:20:54,327 --> 00:20:57,777
I'm telling you in advance since you'll win the competition.

213
00:20:59,257 --> 00:21:01,357
How can I...

214
00:21:02,187 --> 00:21:06,657
You don't need to worry too much since Sang Jin will help you with the things you don't know.

215
00:21:22,427 --> 00:21:25,067
 Complaint

216
00:21:25,937 --> 00:21:29,587
 Just wait and see. I will do whatever I can do get revenge on you!

217
00:21:29,587 --> 00:21:33,457
 I will get revenge on you!

218
00:21:40,537 --> 00:21:43,577
 Complaint

219
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:47,727
I'm there. Almost there.

220
00:21:49,647 --> 00:21:51,837
Do you have time?

221
00:21:51,837 --> 00:21:54,577
What's the matter?

222
00:21:54,577 --> 00:21:57,087
The tie was a shame.

223
00:21:58,597 --> 00:22:00,417
Did you come here to say that?

224
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:02,157
No, it's not like that.

225
00:22:02,157 --> 00:22:05,197
Since you're busy, I'll keep it short.

226
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:10,057
I would like it if you'd take your hands off of this match.

227
00:22:11,517 --> 00:22:15,067
I think that I at least asked you to take your hands off while offering some money.

228
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:18,177
If your life as a doctor is at stake, then don't you think it's a stronger reason than money?

229
00:22:18,177 --> 00:22:19,967
You're saying things I can't understand as time goes on.

230
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:23,767
Also understand how I feel for not being able to say everything.

231
00:22:25,267 --> 00:22:28,337
My answer is "no."

232
00:22:28,337 --> 00:22:30,587
Do you understand?

233
00:22:34,127 --> 00:22:36,457
Taking your hands off from the Prime Minister's surgery team...

234
00:22:36,467 --> 00:22:39,597
I'm sincerely saying it for your sake. Trust me.

235
00:22:39,597 --> 00:22:42,687
If you care about me,  then you should take your hands off of it.

236
00:22:42,687 --> 00:22:46,577
Don't be like that, and can't you just say yes for this one?

237
00:22:46,577 --> 00:22:51,747
Honestly,  the Prime Minister's surgery team is brimming with  dirty things.

238
00:22:53,197 --> 00:22:56,267
Is it as much as your father?

239
00:22:56,267 --> 00:22:59,727
Why are you bringing up that story here?

240
00:22:59,727 --> 00:23:02,557
Let's just say it's the process of  association.

241
00:23:03,567 --> 00:23:06,747
Anyway, if you're done talking, please leave.

242
00:23:06,747 --> 00:23:10,237
Come to think of it, you seem to have a lot of interest in my father.

243
00:23:10,237 --> 00:23:12,387
- How did you know?
- About what?

244
00:23:12,387 --> 00:23:18,287
About him going to North Korea. Honestly, I don't think I ever told you that.

245
00:23:20,397 --> 00:23:22,537
Out of the friends I've met at Harvard,

246
00:23:22,537 --> 00:23:25,647
there was a friend named Lee Seung Hoon.

247
00:23:42,717 --> 00:23:43,997
How are you...

248
00:23:43,997 --> 00:23:46,507
That friend asked me to do a favor.

249
00:23:46,507 --> 00:23:51,087
If I go to Korea, to find out definitely what happened to Park Chul.

250
00:23:52,137 --> 00:23:55,427
Because of his desire for fame in performing surgery on North Korea's greatest leader,

251
00:23:55,427 --> 00:23:59,127
the person who abandoned his father and family.

252
00:23:59,127 --> 00:24:03,707
If I find him, my friend wants definitely to repay him.

253
00:24:04,957 --> 00:24:07,627
It seems like that person has the story wrong.

254
00:24:07,627 --> 00:24:08,717
Has it wrong?

255
00:24:08,717 --> 00:24:11,087
My dad didn't go to North Korea for fame.

256
00:24:11,087 --> 00:24:12,967
He went there to block a war... no,

257
00:24:12,967 --> 00:24:15,997
he went because he was deceived by Chairman Oh Joon Gyu and Jang Seok Joo.

258
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:17,977
Lies.

259
00:24:21,237 --> 00:24:24,667
Do you think my friend will believe an excuse like that?

260
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:27,107
I want to make him believe it, so I must contact him.

261
00:24:27,107 --> 00:24:30,717
The director of this hospital has also gone to the States because of him.

262
00:24:30,717 --> 00:24:33,837
I haven't talked to him recently.

263
00:24:44,507 --> 00:24:46,597
Hey, Quack.

264
00:24:58,387 --> 00:25:02,667
Where are you running away to like that?

265
00:25:07,897 --> 00:25:10,987
 Where are you running away to like that?

266
00:25:13,007 --> 00:25:16,107
 What do you mean I'm running away?

267
00:25:16,107 --> 00:25:19,237
 - Then, why are you in such a hurry?

268
00:25:20,567 --> 00:25:23,767
 When did I?

269
00:25:26,217 --> 00:25:30,157
I thought I was dying catching up to you. What do you mean you weren't!

270
00:25:30,157 --> 00:25:31,887
What?

271
00:25:31,887 --> 00:25:33,727
Don't you have anything to tell me?

272
00:25:33,727 --> 00:25:34,987
There isn't.

273
00:25:34,987 --> 00:25:36,557
Then, I'll do it.

274
00:25:36,557 --> 00:25:39,677
First, I'm really sorry.

275
00:25:40,537 --> 00:25:43,187
Second, you don't have to concern yourself with what your father did.

276
00:25:43,187 --> 00:25:46,357
It's not something you did, anyway.

277
00:25:46,357 --> 00:25:51,597
Third, are you doing your hair loss prevention exercises?

278
00:25:51,597 --> 00:25:53,247
Stop!

279
00:25:53,957 --> 00:25:56,547
- Why? 
 - What are you trying to do here?

280
00:25:56,547 --> 00:25:59,727
- I'm trying to get along well with you. 
 - You think we can get along well?

281
00:25:59,727 --> 00:26:01,727
- Of course we can! 
 - Stop it!

282
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:04,367
- Of course we can! 
 - Stop!

283
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:06,257
 Stop!~

284
00:26:07,267 --> 00:26:09,807
Seriously, you rascal!

285
00:26:09,867 --> 00:26:12,267
Seriously, you rascal!

286
00:26:14,177 --> 00:26:16,917
 Aigoo!~

287
00:26:23,727 --> 00:26:32,027

288
00:26:53,297 --> 00:26:56,367
In order not to infuriate Chairman,

289
00:26:56,367 --> 00:27:00,077
I can always make it appear that nothing is wrong between us.

290
00:27:02,027 --> 00:27:04,457
But it can't be Park Hoon.

291
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:05,837
I know.

292
00:27:05,837 --> 00:27:07,997
When you know, you were like that with him earlier?

293
00:27:07,997 --> 00:27:11,447
We're just trying to be comfortable with each other.

294
00:27:11,447 --> 00:27:14,447
He's a person for whom there is no one except Jae Hee.

295
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:18,787
I'm sorting my feelings out too, so

296
00:27:18,787 --> 00:27:21,387
you don't have to worry about me like that.

297
00:27:38,687 --> 00:27:41,217
That day, I was really out of it.

298
00:27:41,217 --> 00:27:43,257
I didn't have the confidence to handle it either.

299
00:27:43,257 --> 00:27:46,297
Honestly, I was embarrassed towards you too.

300
00:27:47,097 --> 00:27:48,557
I'm sorry for deceiving you.

301
00:27:48,557 --> 00:27:50,677
Then tell me.

302
00:27:50,677 --> 00:27:55,597
Doctor Han--no, Jae Hee, did you come from North Korea?

303
00:27:56,637 --> 00:28:00,327
By any chance, is there an ulterior motive behind trying to operate on the Prime Minister with Doctor Park?

304
00:28:00,327 --> 00:28:01,177
Doctor Oh.

305
00:28:01,177 --> 00:28:05,877
If it's like that, even if you're Jae Hee, I won't stay still.

306
00:28:05,877 --> 00:28:08,867
Don't put Doctor Park in danger.

307
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:11,337
It's true that I met Hoon in North Korea.

308
00:28:11,337 --> 00:28:15,417
But strictly speaking, I'm a Japanese citizen.

309
00:28:16,157 --> 00:28:19,797
After separating with Hoon I got moved to Japan.

310
00:28:19,797 --> 00:28:24,197
I received medical treatment there, and also finished medical school.

311
00:28:24,197 --> 00:28:27,807
Then why did you pretend not to know him when you met him?

312
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:31,857
Honestly, I didn't have the confidence to meet him.

313
00:28:31,857 --> 00:28:35,737
What are you saying? Doctor Park only has you.

314
00:28:35,737 --> 00:28:38,347
- You've seen the picture of my kidney, right? 
 - Yes.

315
00:28:39,137 --> 00:28:41,647
That kidney...

316
00:28:41,647 --> 00:28:44,017
belonged to my father.

317
00:28:47,557 --> 00:28:51,357
The person who did the transplant surgery was Hoon.

318
00:28:53,007 --> 00:28:56,317
He was trying to save me, but, Hoon...

319
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:59,117
made my father pass away.

320
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:01,287
So I had no confidence.

321
00:29:01,287 --> 00:29:05,137
If we met again, would we be able to love each other like before?

322
00:29:05,137 --> 00:29:07,957
No. Doctor Park loves you.

323
00:29:07,957 --> 00:29:09,987
I hoped that he would.

324
00:29:09,987 --> 00:29:12,947
But the emotions that  Hoon feels,

325
00:29:12,947 --> 00:29:17,027
I think they might be out of guilt or obligation.  Especially,

326
00:29:17,027 --> 00:29:19,697
moreso when he is with you.

327
00:29:19,697 --> 00:29:20,807
No, I...

328
00:29:20,807 --> 00:29:23,107
I will return to Japan soon.

329
00:29:23,107 --> 00:29:24,257
Japan?

330
00:29:24,257 --> 00:29:25,887
Hoon...

331
00:29:27,297 --> 00:29:30,787
no, Doctor Park

332
00:29:30,787 --> 00:29:33,057
likes you, Doctor Oh.

333
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:37,387
Not out of guilt or obligation,

334
00:29:37,387 --> 00:29:39,267
but genuinely.

335
00:29:39,267 --> 00:29:40,547
What are you talking about?

336
00:29:40,547 --> 00:29:43,837
If he hadn't made my father pass away,

337
00:29:43,837 --> 00:29:47,197
and if he had no past with your father,

338
00:29:47,197 --> 00:29:51,587
Hoon would choose you.

339
00:29:51,587 --> 00:29:56,047
No. Doctor Park only loves you.

340
00:29:56,047 --> 00:30:00,227
When I go back to Japan, please wait little bit.

341
00:30:00,227 --> 00:30:03,447
If you wait by his side,

342
00:30:03,447 --> 00:30:06,037
you will also know Doctor Park's heart.

343
00:30:20,267 --> 00:30:22,577
You've also done some part-time jobs at restaurants, right?

344
00:30:22,577 --> 00:30:24,577
Of course.

345
00:30:24,577 --> 00:30:25,707
But, why?

346
00:30:25,707 --> 00:30:28,577
That's good then.  That's good.

347
00:30:34,307 --> 00:30:36,667
I thought you worked at a restaurant before?

348
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:40,137
I've only watched them making the food.

349
00:30:40,137 --> 00:30:42,397
My specialty is delivery.

350
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,877
In any case, go on and eat, Mom.

351
00:30:52,287 --> 00:30:55,867
See.  She only eats a bit if I make porridge.

352
00:30:55,867 --> 00:30:58,287
Do you think she'd get an appetite by looking at this, you idiot?

353
00:30:59,047 --> 00:31:02,117
I really did my best making it. Are you seriously going to be like this?

354
00:31:02,867 --> 00:31:04,957
What can we do?

355
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:15,667
Eat. Eat your food.

356
00:31:51,737 --> 00:31:59,197

357
00:32:36,787 --> 00:32:38,737
I will eat well.

358
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:03,157
Kim Min Joo's blood analysis still hasn't come out yet?

359
00:33:03,157 --> 00:33:05,457
It came out. I really made a fuss!

360
00:33:05,457 --> 00:33:06,627
You did well.

361
00:33:06,627 --> 00:33:10,277
Everyone, hello. Quack, hello!

362
00:33:12,607 --> 00:33:15,817
 When I go to Japan, wait for awhile.

363
00:33:15,817 --> 00:33:19,037
 If you wait by his side Doctor Oh, you will also

364
00:33:19,037 --> 00:33:21,517
 come to know Doctor Park's feelings.

365
00:33:23,757 --> 00:33:26,727
Did you two fight again?

366
00:33:26,727 --> 00:33:30,027
Even so, you should accept his greetings, Doctor Oh.

367
00:33:30,027 --> 00:33:32,237
Don't call me a quack.

368
00:33:32,237 --> 00:33:35,227
My patients really think that I'm a quack.

369
00:33:35,227 --> 00:33:37,897
Sorry, Quac... Aigoo.

370
00:33:38,837 --> 00:33:40,987
What can I do when it has become a habit?

371
00:33:40,987 --> 00:33:43,267
Hey, Qua-

372
00:33:43,267 --> 00:33:45,077
Oh my.

373
00:33:46,347 --> 00:33:48,267
Forget it,  just forget it.

374
00:33:48,267 --> 00:33:51,037
I'll let it go because I'm kind.

375
00:33:55,257 --> 00:33:58,297
Over there... we've got to go.

376
00:34:00,077 --> 00:34:04,517
Joking around like we used to is a bit hard for me now.

377
00:34:04,517 --> 00:34:06,407
Please be careful.

378
00:34:06,407 --> 00:34:08,807
I'm doing it so we can be comfortable with each other.

379
00:34:08,807 --> 00:34:11,147
Is that possible overnight?

380
00:34:16,377 --> 00:34:19,187
Aigoo, that girl...seriously...

381
00:34:22,507 --> 00:34:25,067
That Unni... she likes you, Beanpole, right?

382
00:34:25,067 --> 00:34:28,267
What is the relationship between you two? Do you two have something going on?

383
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:29,227
Who are you?

384
00:34:29,227 --> 00:34:32,997
Me? "Flaming Skewer" from Moonamdong.

385
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:35,747
What? What is burning?

386
00:34:35,747 --> 00:34:40,917
Oh right, a patient who has settled that and is trying to live beautifully.

387
00:34:40,917 --> 00:34:44,477
You know, that everyone has a past that they want to hide.

388
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,867
A patient can't be doing this here.

389
00:34:48,867 --> 00:34:52,767
Here, hurry and go back to your room.

390
00:34:54,767 --> 00:34:56,797
Good luck, Beanpole.

391
00:34:58,567 --> 00:35:00,557
What is she?

392
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,027
What is it?

393
00:35:03,027 --> 00:35:05,927
You little wench!  Why did you tell Mom about her?

394
00:35:05,927 --> 00:35:07,517
I told her because it was necessary!

395
00:35:07,517 --> 00:35:10,087
What's wrong with a girl who delivers water?

396
00:35:10,087 --> 00:35:14,327
It's not about what she does. It's because you hit on every girl out there!

397
00:35:14,327 --> 00:35:16,187
Did you not hit on every guy, too?

398
00:35:16,187 --> 00:35:18,557
But I settled down when it was time to settle down.

399
00:35:18,557 --> 00:35:20,397
Didn't you know? About my wedding next month?

400
00:35:20,397 --> 00:35:24,937
Wow, does that man know? That many guys got crushed with the backs of your heels?

401
00:35:24,937 --> 00:35:27,627
You are an ex-con!

402
00:35:27,627 --> 00:35:32,297
Wow, seriously, you are really again firing up the extinguished "skewer!"

403
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,667
You (informal)? How dare you say "you" to your older brother?

404
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:37,767
You have to act like an older brother to be one!

405
00:35:37,767 --> 00:35:41,347
Hey! Come, come!

406
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,737
This is a hospital!

407
00:35:44,027 --> 00:35:45,487
Hey!

408
00:35:45,487 --> 00:35:47,817
This is a hospital. This is a hospital.

409
00:35:47,817 --> 00:35:51,107
Live properly.  Live properly!

410
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:53,767
Stop it... stop!

411
00:35:53,767 --> 00:35:55,647
Hey.

412
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:57,267
Chief.

413
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:05,787
What are you doing with the patient?

414
00:36:05,787 --> 00:36:09,367
Ah, right, she is a patient but...

415
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:13,707
Hello. I'm this delinquent doctor's younger sister.

416
00:36:13,707 --> 00:36:16,497
Oh, the chief is really cool!

417
00:36:18,227 --> 00:36:20,847
- You, really...! 
- You, really...!

418
00:36:23,637 --> 00:36:24,937
A valve surgery?

419
00:36:24,937 --> 00:36:26,467
Yes.

420
00:36:26,467 --> 00:36:28,727
You have a disease called mitral valve stenosis.

421
00:36:28,727 --> 00:36:32,057
You mean mitral stenosis?

422
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:33,747
Yes.

423
00:36:33,747 --> 00:36:37,937
If you leave it alone, it might lead to a left atrial aneurysm and even atrial fibrillation.

424
00:36:37,937 --> 00:36:40,257
You're talking about auricular fibrillation of the left ventricle.

425
00:36:40,257 --> 00:36:43,167
How do you know that? Are you preparing for medical school?

426
00:36:43,797 --> 00:36:46,837
Everybody knows that except you.

427
00:36:48,237 --> 00:36:52,127
The reason why you're out of breath and dizzy is because blood didn't flow to your left ventricle properly, so

428
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,507
it resulted in left ventricular failure.

429
00:36:54,507 --> 00:36:59,347
Enough of that, but is there any other method besides a surgery?

430
00:36:59,347 --> 00:37:01,847
Can't I take medicine?

431
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:05,577
You have to have the surgery.

432
00:37:05,577 --> 00:37:07,957
Explain to her well.

433
00:37:09,767 --> 00:37:11,757
Goodbye.

434
00:37:13,137 --> 00:37:16,107
Hey, what is this? Are you really preparing for medical school?

435
00:37:16,107 --> 00:37:19,377
You try going to over 10 hospitals, too.  You end up memorizing it automatically.

436
00:37:19,377 --> 00:37:21,057
Why did you go to 10 different hospitals?

437
00:37:21,057 --> 00:37:23,927
I don't want to have the surgery. Why?

438
00:37:45,467 --> 00:37:49,017
Simply put, there are 4 chambers in a heart where the blood flows through.

439
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:51,917
In the wall between the left and right chambers

440
00:37:51,917 --> 00:37:54,757
and in the wall between the upper chamber and the lower chamber, there is a door on each side.

441
00:37:54,757 --> 00:37:59,067
That wall is a septum and the doors are valves, right?

442
00:37:59,067 --> 00:38:01,177
Oh, you know it well.

443
00:38:01,177 --> 00:38:04,577
I studied because it's my illness.

444
00:38:04,577 --> 00:38:07,187
If that's the case then it'll be easy to understand.

445
00:38:07,267 --> 00:38:09,907
One of those doors broke in your case.

446
00:38:09,907 --> 00:38:12,627
When that happens, because the blood doesn't flow properly,

447
00:38:12,627 --> 00:38:15,667
the upper left chamber has enlarged and it causes stress on your heart.

448
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:19,017
It's dangerous because your heart is beating erratically.

449
00:38:19,987 --> 00:38:22,717
I'm going to do a surgery that changes out that door.

450
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,907
It's not a difficult surgery so don't worry too much.

451
00:38:25,907 --> 00:38:27,467
Okay.

452
00:38:27,467 --> 00:38:29,347
Get some rest.

453
00:38:33,767 --> 00:38:36,077
Hello, Beanpole.

454
00:38:36,077 --> 00:38:37,577
Hello, Skewer.

455
00:38:37,577 --> 00:38:40,517
Why are you bringing up my past?

456
00:38:40,517 --> 00:38:43,237
You're good at explaining it.  It's really easy to understand.

457
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,507
Oh, it's nothing.

458
00:38:44,507 --> 00:38:47,697
Can I ask you something too?

459
00:38:47,697 --> 00:38:49,377
What?

460
00:38:51,967 --> 00:38:55,967
So what you are saying is that there is no other way except surgery?

461
00:38:55,967 --> 00:39:00,717
Right. You must get a surgery for constriction of the mitral valve.

462
00:39:00,717 --> 00:39:02,327
Got it?

463
00:39:02,327 --> 00:39:06,317
Do you by any chance know a person named Han Jae Joon? I heard he's a chief who graduated from Harvard.

464
00:39:06,317 --> 00:39:09,017
- Why?
- Is he trustworthy?

465
00:39:09,017 --> 00:39:11,367
His skills are good.

466
00:39:11,977 --> 00:39:13,707
I will ask one last time.

467
00:39:13,707 --> 00:39:17,707
Are you sure there isn't any other way?

468
00:39:18,867 --> 00:39:20,057
There isn't.

469
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:21,437
Really?

470
00:39:21,437 --> 00:39:23,677
Why? Are you afraid of the surgery?

471
00:39:23,677 --> 00:39:27,357
That is true too, but I'm getting married next month.

472
00:39:27,357 --> 00:39:30,417
I found my destined mate.

473
00:39:30,417 --> 00:39:35,817
Well, if I say this you might mock me, but our heartbeats even beat at the same time.

474
00:39:37,927 --> 00:39:41,167
Want to see? Look.

475
00:39:50,967 --> 00:39:52,307
It's pretty.

476
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:54,747
These... they seem similar yet different.

477
00:39:54,747 --> 00:39:57,937
And then they seem different, yet they're similar.  They're like that.

478
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:01,457
Do you know how many days I agonized to pick one that's pretty?

479
00:40:01,457 --> 00:40:03,427
I wouldn't know.

480
00:40:03,427 --> 00:40:07,497
I really want to live happily with this person.

481
00:40:07,497 --> 00:40:12,277
I want to live a lovey-dovey life with him and with our baby.

482
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:16,867
So then  I heard I can't get pregnant if I have this surgery.

483
00:40:18,867 --> 00:40:22,757
Well, it's not always but it's just a bit difficult, that's all.

484
00:40:22,757 --> 00:40:26,027
My fiancÃ© is saying who cares if we don't have a baby?

485
00:40:26,027 --> 00:40:28,167
He said that our happiness is the only thing that matters.

486
00:40:28,167 --> 00:40:30,947
But I really want to have a baby.

487
00:40:30,947 --> 00:40:34,197
I bought baby clothes already.

488
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:42,917
I'm going to put them on our junior.

489
00:40:42,917 --> 00:40:46,757
So, do you think I want the surgery or not?

490
00:40:46,757 --> 00:40:51,017
I know you don't want it, but since it's a necessary surgery, get it.

491
00:41:00,707 --> 00:41:04,857
That doorâ€¦ show it to me too.

492
00:41:04,857 --> 00:41:05,777
What door?

493
00:41:05,777 --> 00:41:09,747
The door to heart's upper left side. The door that needs to be fixed.

494
00:41:09,747 --> 00:41:10,687
Why?

495
00:41:10,687 --> 00:41:14,687
I'm so angry that I want to curse at it to my heart's content.

496
00:41:18,717 --> 00:41:20,797
Your name?

497
00:41:20,797 --> 00:41:23,287
Kim Ah Young. Isn't my name pretty?

498
00:41:23,287 --> 00:41:25,877
Kim Ah Young.

499
00:41:31,747 --> 00:41:34,317
Where is it?! That damn door!

500
00:41:34,317 --> 00:41:36,327
Here-

501
00:41:41,887 --> 00:41:45,127
Hey! Because of you, my dream is shattered!

502
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:48,657
I'm going to destroy you soon too, you bastard!

503
00:41:51,517 --> 00:41:55,867
Thanks. I feel a bit better now.

504
00:42:21,087 --> 00:42:23,377
Hold on.

505
00:42:23,377 --> 00:42:25,297
Did you see it, too?

506
00:42:25,297 --> 00:42:27,067
What are you talking about?

507
00:42:27,067 --> 00:42:30,487
This patient's aortic valve.

508
00:42:33,917 --> 00:42:37,737
Marfan Syndrome. I saw it, too. So what?
 An inherited disorder than affects connective tissue.

509
00:42:37,737 --> 00:42:39,097
What do mean "So what?"

510
00:42:39,097 --> 00:42:42,527
A patient with Marfan Syndrome can have the surgery at same time as an aortic aneurysm anyway.

511
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:45,197
I'm saying you don't have to do a surgery right now.

512
00:42:45,197 --> 00:42:49,297
The width of the mitral valve has constricted to a point where it needs surgery. Can't you see it?

513
00:42:49,297 --> 00:42:51,567
It's still at a state where she can certainly withstand it

514
00:42:51,567 --> 00:42:55,347
as long as she doesn't exercise too vigorously. On top of that,  she says she's getting married soon.

515
00:42:55,347 --> 00:42:58,727
After the surgery, she needs to take Warfarin but it could be deadly to get pregnant.

516
00:42:58,727 --> 00:42:59,837
So?

517
00:42:59,837 --> 00:43:04,567
- I'm saying you can delay the surgery-
- Are you telling me to give up on the competition or what?

518
00:43:06,037 --> 00:43:08,297
Once pregnant, an aortic aneurysm progresses quicker.

519
00:43:08,297 --> 00:43:12,297
Then if an aortic dissection occurs suddenly  and a blood vessel ruptures, she dies immediately.

520
00:43:12,297 --> 00:43:14,087
It's not that severe yet.

521
00:43:14,087 --> 00:43:15,277
You want to bet her life on luck?

522
00:43:15,277 --> 00:43:17,557
You also know that this surgery doesn't need to be done right away.

523
00:43:17,557 --> 00:43:21,787
After getting married and giving birth to a child... it's possible to go without it for over 10 years.

524
00:43:21,787 --> 00:43:23,867
A patient's life could be completely changed by this.

525
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:26,887
After the surgery, she just needs to regain her health. Who cares what she does after that?

526
00:43:26,887 --> 00:43:28,987
If possible, you should also think about a patient's life after surgery.

527
00:43:28,987 --> 00:43:33,397
You can do that kind of thing. I am going to do a surgery on this patient.

528
00:43:33,397 --> 00:43:36,217
Is it because of the competition? We can call it a tie then.

529
00:43:36,217 --> 00:43:39,367
There is no tie. This is the last time.

530
00:43:43,567 --> 00:43:47,077
If you really want to pretend to be a good doctor, then we can change the patient.

531
00:43:47,077 --> 00:43:50,347
- What?
- We can exchange our patients.

532
00:43:52,687 --> 00:43:56,867
You can't do that, right? You will lose if you don't do the surgery.

533
00:43:57,847 --> 00:44:01,747
Tell me anytime if you change your mind. I'll exchange with you.

534
00:44:11,717 --> 00:44:13,417
Is it true?

535
00:44:14,647 --> 00:44:18,147
I heard it all. Water Bottle, is it true what you just said?

536
00:44:19,067 --> 00:44:21,337
Yes. Why?

537
00:44:21,337 --> 00:44:25,187
Kim Ah Young is my younger sister.

538
00:44:26,967 --> 00:44:28,887
Is it true?

539
00:44:29,597 --> 00:44:33,747
In my judgment, yes. It's true.

540
00:44:38,037 --> 00:44:41,447
So, you don't want her to have the surgery?

541
00:44:41,447 --> 00:44:42,877
It's not that.

542
00:44:42,877 --> 00:44:46,547
I just want to hear your honest opinion.

543
00:44:46,547 --> 00:44:50,657
She needs to have the surgery.  Because it's gotten so narrow, it'll be too much to lead a normal daily life.

544
00:44:50,657 --> 00:44:52,547
Of course, it is.

545
00:44:52,547 --> 00:44:55,617
That girl, because she doesn't want to have the surgery,

546
00:44:55,617 --> 00:44:56,927
she must have been to every hospital.

547
00:44:56,927 --> 00:45:00,357
When the wedding is next month, she's worried that she might ruin it,

548
00:45:00,357 --> 00:45:03,337
and she's worried about possibly not being able get pregnant if she has the surgery.

549
00:45:03,337 --> 00:45:06,317
She was such a play girl  in the past, but I guess she's a woman.

550
00:45:06,317 --> 00:45:10,867
When the right time comes, they must all change like that.

551
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:15,897
If you understand, you can leave.

552
00:45:20,607 --> 00:45:22,447
But Hyungnim,

553
00:45:22,447 --> 00:45:27,457
Water Bottle says that she doesn't have to have the surgery.

554
00:45:27,457 --> 00:45:29,967
Are you really a thug?

555
00:45:29,967 --> 00:45:32,537
What are the symptoms of MS? 
 Marfan Syndrome

556
00:45:32,537 --> 00:45:34,817
What are they?

557
00:45:34,817 --> 00:45:36,997
That is...

558
00:45:36,997 --> 00:45:39,427
uh... breathing difficulties and...

559
00:45:39,427 --> 00:45:41,997
Atrial fibrillation, sleep apnea, chest pains,

560
00:45:41,997 --> 00:45:44,837
aortic aneurysm, or a stroke!

561
00:45:44,837 --> 00:45:47,537
You said the condition wasn't that bad.

562
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:49,727
- Then, when does it get worse?
- Pardon?

563
00:45:49,727 --> 00:45:51,487
Does it give you a notice and get worse?

564
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:54,437
I'm saying to have the surgery because we don't know when she'll get worse.

565
00:45:57,597 --> 00:45:59,867
By chance,

566
00:45:59,867 --> 00:46:03,187
are you doing this because of the competition?

567
00:46:03,187 --> 00:46:06,387
She came here with the same diagnosis from all the other hospitals, too.

568
00:46:06,387 --> 00:46:10,637
My diagnosis is the same as theirs.  MS needs to be repaired.

569
00:46:11,557 --> 00:46:13,237
I understand, Hyungnim.

570
00:46:15,377 --> 00:46:18,187
Even after surgery, if she tries, she could conceive.

571
00:46:19,547 --> 00:46:20,807
Your sister can

572
00:46:20,807 --> 00:46:23,897
live the desired married life.

573
00:46:23,897 --> 00:46:26,857
It's a judgment I made as a doctor who'll do the surgery.

574
00:46:26,857 --> 00:46:30,347
My judgment and Water Bottle's judgment.

575
00:46:31,077 --> 00:46:35,397
Consider carefully which side you should believe.

576
00:46:40,377 --> 00:46:47,307

577
00:46:49,997 --> 00:46:53,437
Hey, I heard this patient has Marfan Syndrome.

578
00:46:53,437 --> 00:46:54,347
Who said that?

579
00:46:54,347 --> 00:46:56,467
What do you mean "who"? Kim Chi Gyu did.

580
00:46:56,467 --> 00:46:59,647
He's going around asking this person and that person.

581
00:47:02,627 --> 00:47:04,847
This is an opportunity from God... you know that, right?

582
00:47:04,847 --> 00:47:06,697
What is an opportunity from God again?

583
00:47:06,697 --> 00:47:09,037
You need to tell his younger sister.

584
00:47:09,037 --> 00:47:11,617
"You can do this surgery later!"  Something like this.

585
00:47:11,617 --> 00:47:14,877
Then discharge. The competition is over! We win.

586
00:47:14,877 --> 00:47:17,437
Chief Han is saying he's going to do it so don't tell the patient yet.

587
00:47:17,437 --> 00:47:19,217
I already did.

588
00:47:27,717 --> 00:47:28,947
She's here.

589
00:47:28,947 --> 00:47:33,047
Hey, Beanpole.  I really don't need the surgery?

590
00:47:33,987 --> 00:47:35,857
Talk.

591
00:47:36,917 --> 00:47:41,527
Talk or I'll put a hole in your head.

592
00:47:42,807 --> 00:47:45,537
That's my opinion.  Later,

593
00:47:45,537 --> 00:47:47,657
you can do it together when you see signs of aortic aneurysm.

594
00:47:47,657 --> 00:47:49,937
Water Bottle, shut your mouth.

595
00:47:50,947 --> 00:47:54,187
You heard it too, right?  He said that I don't have to have the surgery.

596
00:47:54,187 --> 00:47:55,547
I can be discharged.

597
00:47:55,547 --> 00:47:57,557
I told you that you need the surgery.

598
00:47:57,557 --> 00:47:59,517
Beanpole said that I don't need it!

599
00:47:59,517 --> 00:48:00,527
You just trust his words?

600
00:48:00,527 --> 00:48:01,877
He is this hospital's doctor.

601
00:48:01,877 --> 00:48:03,767
How can you trust this Wattle Bottle bastard?

602
00:48:03,767 --> 00:48:07,167
Do you know where he went to medical school?  He graduated from Pyongyang.  Pyongyang!

603
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:10,327
So what?  He is still a doctor.

604
00:48:10,327 --> 00:48:14,377
Hey, our chief who graduated from Harvard said that you need to have the surgery.

605
00:48:14,377 --> 00:48:16,027
And you said that you've been to other hospitals too.

606
00:48:16,027 --> 00:48:20,157
You said that all the doctors there said you needed to get surgery, too!

607
00:48:20,157 --> 00:48:22,827
So you want me to have the surgery?

608
00:48:22,827 --> 00:48:25,447
I also looked into it.

609
00:48:25,447 --> 00:48:29,997
If I have the surgery and a valve is replaced, they said that it's too hard to conceive a baby.

610
00:48:31,737 --> 00:48:36,607
If something goes wrong, there are cases where you have to give up getting pregnant.

611
00:48:38,357 --> 00:48:43,107
They say you could conceive if you try.  Then you can have a baby.

612
00:48:43,107 --> 00:48:47,637
Why do I have to be the only one who has to try when everyone else just does it?

613
00:48:48,837 --> 00:48:53,377
I just want to live like other people, that's all.

614
00:48:53,377 --> 00:48:58,037
If I have the surgery later like Beanpole said, I can live like that.

615
00:49:00,657 --> 00:49:04,917
Then tell me.  I'll do what you tell me to do.

616
00:49:10,217 --> 00:49:12,527
I will do as you say.

617
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:20,377
Should I get the surgery?

618
00:49:23,267 --> 00:49:29,577
Should I not?  You tell me!  What am I suppose to do?!

619
00:49:29,577 --> 00:49:31,567
Accept it.

620
00:49:36,227 --> 00:49:38,077
Get the surgery.

621
00:50:22,257 --> 00:50:24,697
Do you have something you need me to hold onto?

622
00:50:29,617 --> 00:50:34,857
Take the call if I get a phone call.  I told the wedding hall that I was going to cancel it.

623
00:50:34,857 --> 00:50:36,957
Okay.

624
00:50:44,787 --> 00:50:47,157
Okay, let's go.  Go.

625
00:51:05,507 --> 00:51:09,397
If it's a tie again here, what's going to happen?

626
00:51:09,397 --> 00:51:12,487
Then it's been decided that the hospital will select the doctor.

627
00:51:12,487 --> 00:51:13,937
Who will?

628
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:17,947
That's something... that the Chairman there has to do.

629
00:51:27,917 --> 00:51:29,917
I trust you with the anesthesia.

630
00:51:31,257 --> 00:51:34,257
Why? What's wrong?

631
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,907
I'm going into Chief Han's operating room.

632
00:51:35,907 --> 00:51:38,147
What are you saying all of a sudden?

633
00:51:39,827 --> 00:51:41,687
You really don't know?

634
00:51:42,827 --> 00:51:46,157
Think hard. About what you did to me.

635
00:51:46,157 --> 00:51:48,797
What do you mean what I did to you? Tell me so that I can understand.

636
00:51:48,797 --> 00:51:51,247
Let's talk after the surgery.

637
00:51:58,047 --> 00:52:00,657
What are you doing? You should get ready quickly.

638
00:52:00,657 --> 00:52:01,977
Why is Doctor Han going in there?

639
00:52:01,977 --> 00:52:04,187
She did that last time, too.

640
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:06,467
Don't worry about it, and focus on the surgery instead!

641
00:52:06,467 --> 00:52:10,307
If we win, I'll do whatever it takes to bring her back.

642
00:52:10,307 --> 00:52:11,787
Hurry.

643
00:53:06,507 --> 00:53:07,907
Chi Gyu, you can stay out.

644
00:53:07,907 --> 00:53:09,187
Will that be okay?

645
00:53:09,187 --> 00:53:10,587
Yes.

646
00:53:18,797 --> 00:53:20,147
Hyungnim.

647
00:53:22,297 --> 00:53:25,407
- Ah Youngâ€¦ please take good care of her.

648
00:53:25,407 --> 00:53:26,977
Okay.

649
00:53:34,787 --> 00:53:36,647
Tell them we are ready.

 Myeongwoo University Hospital
00:00:00

651
00:53:47,417 --> 00:53:51,547
Hey, this was over after the twins' surgery.

652
00:53:56,397 --> 00:54:00,317
 Think hard. About what you did to me.

653
00:54:26,567 --> 00:54:29,127
 I cancelled the reservation for the wedding hall, Ah Young. .

654

 Kim Ah Young

655
00:54:35,377 --> 00:54:36,637
 LINE

656
00:54:37,547 --> 00:54:40,887
 Home

657
00:55:03,537 --> 00:55:05,717
They said they're finished with the preparations.

658
00:55:15,087 --> 00:55:16,637
I trust you with the vitals.

659
00:55:16,637 --> 00:55:18,037
Yes.

660
00:55:21,487 --> 00:55:23,117
Master, you stay focused, too.

661
00:55:23,117 --> 00:55:26,207
I'm nervous since it's the last one.

662

00:00:00

663
00:55:31,767 --> 00:55:33,917
Hey, Water Bottle.

664
00:55:33,917 --> 00:55:39,987
Iâ€¦ Ah Youngâ€¦ I told her not to cancel the reservation for the wedding hall.

665
00:55:39,987 --> 00:55:43,077
That timeâ€¦ Chief Han

666
00:55:43,077 --> 00:55:44,687
said that you can change patients, right?

667
00:55:44,687 --> 00:55:46,777
Kim Chi Gyu, what are you doing?

668
00:55:46,777 --> 00:55:52,017
After my sister marries, please make her live a normal life like everyone else.

669
00:55:54,087 --> 00:55:55,477
Hey, Water Bottle.

670
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,007
Aren't you going to get out!

671
00:55:57,007 --> 00:56:00,597
Just once...

672
00:56:00,597 --> 00:56:03,667
Just once, please help me act like her older brother.

673
00:56:04,887 --> 00:56:07,967
What are you doing? Take him out!

674
00:56:07,967 --> 00:56:10,147
Hey! Wait!

675
00:56:10,147 --> 00:56:13,987
Hey, Water Bottle! Hey! Water Bottle!

676
00:56:13,987 --> 00:56:18,387
Water Bottle!

677
00:56:19,057 --> 00:56:22,037
Hey, Park Hoon! If you listen to him, it's game over.

678
00:56:22,037 --> 00:56:24,067
We're going to lose!

679
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:42,737
Scalpel.

680
00:56:51,037 --> 00:56:53,177
Grasp the scalpel!

681
00:57:07,867 --> 00:57:11,837
 Hoonâ€¦ From now onâ€¦

682
00:57:13,017 --> 00:57:17,587
 never forget the fact that â€¦

683
00:57:17,587 --> 00:57:23,797
 you're a doctor.

684
00:57:23,797 --> 00:57:28,137
 The final competition... I'll do whatever it takes to win, so let's go in together.

685
00:57:28,137 --> 00:57:31,837
 Just like how you thought initially, let's make the surgery team together,

686
00:57:31,837 --> 00:57:34,657
 and we'll go into the same surgery room together.

687
00:57:38,417 --> 00:57:45,487

688
00:57:49,887 --> 00:57:52,007
What is this?

689
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,747
What are you doing, Doctor Park?

690
00:58:11,467 --> 00:58:12,997
What? Doctor Park...

691
00:58:12,997 --> 00:58:15,317
The scalpel...

692
00:58:16,667 --> 00:58:21,867
â™¬  Will someone tell me please  â™¬

693
00:58:21,867 --> 00:58:27,647
â™¬  I cannot see a single place to rest  â™¬

694
00:58:27,647 --> 00:58:29,587
â™¬  Every time I open my eyes, there's not a single light  â™¬

695
00:58:29,587 --> 00:58:31,037
What is it?
â™¬  Every time I open my eyes, there's not a single light  â™¬

696
00:58:31,037 --> 00:58:33,517
What do you think it is?
â™¬  Every time I open my eyes, there's not a single light  â™¬

697
00:58:33,517 --> 00:58:39,327
â™¬  At the end of this road. At the end of this strange road,  â™¬
