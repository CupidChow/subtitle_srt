1
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,800

2
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,810
I'm Han Jae Joon.

3
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,400
I'm Jang Seok Joo.

4
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,570
Who are you looking for?

5
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,080
Ah, I heard at Myeongwoo, 2 teams are competing.

6
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:58,300
Yes, Chief Han's team and Doctor Park Hoon's team will be competing.

7
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,370
Doctor Park Hoon said that he's going to  give up on the competition.

8
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,400
Give up?

9
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,660
 Cardiothoracic surgeon, Park Hoon.

10
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,990
Now, you seem like a doctor.

11
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,040
Doctor Park Hoon.

12
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,650
The person you are looking for is probably expecting this aspect of you.

13
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,520
You sure are joking.

14
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,100
About what?

15
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,660
I understand, so you will be the anesthesiologist for the twins, right?

16
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,050
Of course.

17
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,790
Didn't you give up?

18
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,190
I have a condition.

19
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:14,150
- A condition?
- Competition or contest, whatever it is,

20
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,880
the hospital will take responsibility for the expense no matter what.

21
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,870
- Is that the only condition? 
 - Then I will assume you accept it.

22
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,690
Please take good care of me.

23
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,420
 Are you Professor Park Chul?

24
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,050
 Episode 8

25
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,800
What's the matter, Prime Minister?

26
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,930
Oh... it's nothing much.

27
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,450
I just need to use the restroom.

28
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,970
Is he really Park Hoon?

29
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,400
Yes, Prime Minister.

30
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,710
But he just left. Even after seeing me?

31
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,660
What a soft-hearted wimp.

32
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,580
Seeing you here like this, you really took after your father.

33
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,940
I heard about your father. It's very regretful.

34
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,470
Why did you do it?

35
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,790
Why do you think I did it?

36
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,970
 Father! Father!

37
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,940
 Father!

38
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,140
Prime Minister!

39
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:46,800
Do you know that? I suddenly want to win this competition or whatever you call this bullshit. I'm curious.

40
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,320
About what your heart looks like.

41
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,300
I'm also curious about how you will fix my heart.

42
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:00,570
Just pray it won't be me.

43
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,850
When I open this, and take out your heart... I'll make a hole in that instantly.

44
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,680
If you want to see my heart, then you will have to work very hard.

45
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:19,110
If you don't, you may never get to meet your girlfriend up in North Korea.

46
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,520
Prime Minister, what happened?

47
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,170
It's nothing, nothing.  It's nothing at all.

48
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:33,780
I was dizzy for a bit.  It's okay, it's okay.

49
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,810
Doctor Park Hoon!

50
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,210
Park Hoon!

51
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,180
♪  Omona (oh my gosh),

52
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,650
♪ Tell me one more time,

53
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:04,070
♪ Tell me, tell me ...

54
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,710
Just what happened?

55
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,710
Nothing happened. I was just dizzy for a moment.

56
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:21,800
I should have told you before.

57
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:27,130
Park Hoon, that friend, he's someone you know too.

58
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,980
Me?

59
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,410
He's that person's son.

60
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:36,500
Yes, Park Chul's son.

61
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,000
So scary.

62
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,210
Is the men's bathroom atmosphere usually like this?

63
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,420
No, you usually hear the sound of water only... drip, drip, drip.

64
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,800
Let's concentrate. Come in, it's cold.  Come in.

65
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:13,090
Aigoo, you're working hard.  Yes.

66
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,510
Oh, that's right,

67
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,230
- You said you were Chief Han?
- Yes.

68
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:47,410
Does Chief Han have a special motive, a reason why you want to perform a surgery on my heart?

69
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,730
It's so that I can become the owner of Myeongwoo.

70
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:59,760
- Chief Han!
- After I prove to Chairman that I am the best,

71
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,710
if Chairman allows it, I want to be sit in the best seat of this hospital.

72
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:10,540
How can you say that in front of the Prime Minister?

73
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,100
It's okay.

74
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,130
For me,

75
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:23,140
I really like a person with a clear motive like this.

76
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,190
Like our Chairman.

77
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,050
Well, work hard.

78
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,730
Work hard everyone.

79
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,490
That friend, Chief Han, is really reliable.

80
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,250
I did pick him as my son-in-law but I think he was a bit rash.

81
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:51,610
No, no. A person has to be that resolute, so I can trust him to take care of my heart.

82
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,570
Is that so?

83
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,560
Then, Park Hoon, that friend...

84
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,330
Well, since he is going to compete with Chief Han,

85
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:06,330
wouldn't it be a bit hard?

86
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,200
Does it make any sense?

87
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,060
Why is Park Chul's son in my hospital?

88
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,040
He is just a doctor with excellent skills.

89
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,620
Just like how Professor Park Chul was.

90
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,790
Director Choi!

91
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:43,670
He has some deficiencies, but while competing with Chief Han, he will become a great doctor.

92
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,120
Do you think I'll let him stay in Myeongwoo?

93
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,460
You're going to have to.

94
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,460
I know too much about Myeongwoo, don't you think?

95
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,580
Director Choi, what are you talking about?

96
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,850
It was Prime Minister Jang's idea to look over the competition too.

97
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,050
Are you leaving me because of the cheap guilt, Director Choi?

98
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,350
It's okay to think whatever you want.

99
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:08,980
But I'm just asking you to have a fair competition.

100
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,850
Fine, instead, I can't see him being here for a long time.

101
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:20,410
Without dragging this along, we'll do the competition just once. One match!

102
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,200
Hello?

103
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,570
 Is this Professor Choi?

104
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,960
Yes. I'm Choi Byeong Cheol.

105
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:36,340
 Hello. I am Mr. Chang from the Holt Children's Services.

106
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,930
 You requested for us to find Mr. Lee Seung Hoon who was adopted to the US about 20 years ago?

107
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,660
Yes. Did you find him?

108
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,660
 Yes. I hear that he has recently returned to Korea.

109
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:54,620
Is Mr. Lee Seung Hoon really in Korea?

110
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:59,050
Yes. I have found someone who we think to believe is Mr. Lee.

111
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:04,710
First, I will confirm if it's really him and then contact you.

112
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,030
 Chief of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery

113
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,280
Lee Seung Hoon.

114
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,260
There's a proverb saying that you look for a donkey while sitting on a donkey's back.

115
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,910
Over here, do they say, it's dark under the candle stick?
(It's right under your nose)

116
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:46,040
You didn't perhaps meet with Director Choi, right?

117
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,040
That's up to how you behave.

118
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,460
How long will you stay in Korea?

119
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,390
I have to go to Beijing...

120
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,060
I think today will be hard, right?

121
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,490
Why Beijing?

122
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,180
You fixed my father's heart so well

123
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,030
that he is having a third marriage already.

124
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,500
I reserved a 6 o'clock plane for you.

125
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,080
You have to do your duty as a son.

126
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,920
You seem like a person who's antsy to kick me out of Korea.

127
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,840
Give my greetings to your father.

128
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,390
You're almost finished building it.

129
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,430
Almost...

130
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,080
What are you going to do when you finish building it?

131
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,370
I'm going to destroy it.

132
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:48,970
From the beginning, I only built this castle so I could destroy it.

133
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:08,800

134
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,890
What happened?

135
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,060
I have something I want to ask you.

136
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,630
The ABGA results are getting worse.
(Arterial Blood Gasses Analysis)

137
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:17,500
I think we have to do the surgery soon.

138
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,690
 If you want to see my heart, you'll have to really work hard.

139
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:25,800
 Otherwise, you may never get to meet

140
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,110
 your girlfriend in North Korea.

141
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,440
Why did you say that you want to do this surgery?

142
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,110
We are trying to save the babies.

143
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,840
Is that really all? Why exactly?

144
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,580
Doctor Park!

145
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,330
What happened?

146
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,590
What do you mean what happened? I'm going to do it.

147
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,900
That's great.

148
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,940
How much will you receive this time?

149
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,870
Receive, receive what?

150
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,930
What do you mean?

151
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,340
That is...

152
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,600
A doctor receives money from a patient?

153
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,860
I just got 500 won (50 cents). Is that so wrong?

154
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,020
You did wrong. It was a child's pocket money.

155
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:14,420
That was already mine. I saw it first, but that girl stole it by fooling me.

156
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,910
Was that really it?

157
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,390
It's only that, of course!

158
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,120
 One stitch is 100,000 won. (100 dollars)

159
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,710
 Really...

160
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,170
Aish...

161
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,980
Why in the world did you do that?

162
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,180
The girlfriend who looks like you...

163
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,400
to bring that person here, he said it'll take a lot of money. How much was it?

164
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,380
I don't know.

165
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:38,900
That's pathetic. What would your girlfriend say if she found out what you're doing?

166
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,890
What will she say?

167
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:40,900
Are you asking because you don't know?

168
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,840
Do you still see her as Jae Hee?

169
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,390
Why do you keep doing that to Doctor Han?

170
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,070
Aishee.  I'm going.

171
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,600
Where are you going? You have to eat what you ordered.

172
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,420
How dare you be like this when you have Jae Hee Unnie?

173
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,700
You!

174
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,070
Yeah, just sit down.

175
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,800
I'm curious. How you met Jae Hee.

176
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,470
I just met her.

177
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,990
 I'm Song Jae Hee.

178
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,660
 How about you?

179
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,330
You just met her and it became a relationship where you can't live without her?

180
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,390
It must have been love at first sight, right?

181
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,080
You said she smiles a lot.

182
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,890
Smiling my as*.

183
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,480
You once said she smiles a lot.

184
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:38,260
What about her personality?

185
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:44,110
 Wait, wait. Are you really going to do this to your fated destiny?

186
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,890
She had a temper. She seems like a bitch, too.

187
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:53,110
 I'll marry you. After a hundred years?

188
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,530
And you still like her that much?

189
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,330
Because she's Jae Hee.

190
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,800
I'm jealous.

191
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,240
I wonder if Jae Hee  knows this heart of yours too?

192
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,670
How can she know? She can't even hear it.

193
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,130
I'm going.

194
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,290
When you meet her later, what are you going to say to her?

195
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,780
"I missed you"?

196
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,770
No.

197
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,760
Then?

198
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:31,170
I will save the babies, so don't worry.

199
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:33,770
But what's your real reason?

200
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:37,100
The real reason you want to do this surgery?

201
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,930
I want to tell her that.

202
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,220
I'm going.

203
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,740
I'm going to excuse myself first.

204
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,590
Yes.

205
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,390
Why did you come here? What if Park Hoon sees you?

206
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,100
Park Hoon, that bastard,

207
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,730
what did he do to Prime Minister Jang?

208
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,900
What do you mean?

209
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,850
I got a call.

210
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,980
To keep our hands off of him.

211
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,290
Then what about the surgery team?

212
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,490
The bastard named Han Jae Joon,

213
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:36,090
go into his team.

214
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,320
There is less possibility for Park Hoon to win if we send the anesthesiologist to Dr. Han Jae Joon.

215
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,480
What's wrong with that?

216
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,560
By any chance, did you throw away Park Hoon's card?

217
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,500
I think Han Jae Joon's card is okay, too.

218
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,260
- Prime Minister.
- Yes, nice to meet you.

219
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,370
- It's been a long time.
- Yes. You're working hard.

220
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,680
Who do you want to choose?

221
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,350
I don't care who it is, so let's hurry up and do it.

222
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,200
Is it okay, even if it's tonight?

223
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,180
That's fine.

224
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,470
Will you be okay?

225
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,090
There will only be one competition.

226
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:39,610
I like how it's simple. Just one match.

227
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:43,360
Then, I will look forward to a good competition.

228
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,790
Sit down.

229
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,270
This competition will-

230
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:14,950
- But why is it just one match?
- It's okay, we just have to win.

231
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,540
Are you really confident?

232
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,640
I'm kind of scared, should I just throw the scalpel?

233
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,660
Hey!

234
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,710
Anyway, this surgery has to be super fast 45 minutes.  Not any more or less,

235
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:29,160
we have to finish in the first half of a soccer game.

236
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,050
If we don't finish it in that time, we lose. There is no second half.

237
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:36,000
But, why is the surgery time so short?

238
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,080
The core of Norwood surgery is to make an aorta for the baby.
 Norwood procedure corrects a cardiac defect

239
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,580
We have to stop the bypass at that time. If we take longer, the baby will die.

240
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,670
That'll be the end.

241
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:50,330
That's why we need the help of team members with great skills.

242
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,560
They have to move like the operating surgeon's hands and feet.

243
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:15,330
Especially, First (surgeon) is the key position to determine the outcome of a surgery.

244
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:25,140
Don't worry. I've already been an assistant and just in case, I'm looking up more materials on it.

245
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,740
Yeah, you two work together as one.

246
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,310
No, be hermaphroditic and win this.

247
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,160
Here.

248
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,400
- What is that?
- What do you think? It's a reward!

249
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,270
Here, with this,

250
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:45,600
if you want to be hit with the blow of the money,

251
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,100
you have to absolutely win this!

252
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,900
Here!

253
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,390
But, who is going to be our First?

254
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,370
It's Doctor Oh.

255
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:01,120
I'm sorry to say this right in front of her, but Doctor Oh shouldn't be the one.

256
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,320
What are you saying?

257
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,260
The Anesthesiology Department knows a surgeon's skills the best.

258
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:11,570
Truthfully, Doctor Oh showed an embarrassing moment before.

259
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:16,180
 Okay, I understand. If you're going to perform the surgery, I'll move. I don't care as long as the patient is safe.

260
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:19,560
 It's not a surgery you can handle, Doctor Oh.

261
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,840
There's only handful of people in this hospital who can easily do an atrial septal rupture repair and CABG.

262
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,090
Doctor Keum is one of those few.

263
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,450
Doctor Eun.

264
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:33,270
Chief, you can only win this competition if the First can perform the surgery  as well as the operating surgeon.

265
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,170
Isn't that so?

266
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:40,780
I think Doctor Keum should be the First of this surgery.

267
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,080
Doctor Oh

268
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,420
is just an ordinary doctor except that she's the Chairman's daughter.

269
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,430
Your words too harsh, Dr. Eun.

270
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,370
What's harsh?

271
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,860
Please stop, Doctor Eun.

272
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:55,120
Stay still! I didn't say anything wrong.

273
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,300
Stop!

274
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,670
I'm the one who decides the First.

275
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:05,510
And our team's First is Doctor Oh.

276
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,060
Know that, and leave now.

277
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,800
Yes.

278
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:22,590
Doctor Oh, remain here a bit.

279
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,990
Don't mind what Doctor Eun said.

280
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,730
If you think I'm lacking, say it now.

281
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,110
I don't want to hear that you lost because of me.

282
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,590
I said it before,

283
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:42,430
our team's First is you.

284
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,110
You meant it, right?

285
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:48,800
Instead, you have to be well prepared.

286
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,520
Okay, I will really prepare well.

287
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:58,020
Hey, we have our First. What about the anesthesiologist?

288
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,220
Doctor Han said she'll do it.

289
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,000
Really?

290
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,580
 I understand, so you'll be the anesthesiologist for the twins, right?

291
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,700
 Of course.

292
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,740
You are the operating surgeon, Yang Jo Hwan is the First.

293
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,610
Anesthesiologist is Doctor Han. We have our team!

294
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:14,620
We have to pick a scrub nurse.

295
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,510
Why a scrub nurse?

296
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,850
The shorter the time is for the surgical instrument to be handed over, the probability of the baby living is higher.

297
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:21,710
Right, because the time of the first half of a soccer game is already set.

298
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,710
But, why do we have to go out of the hospital?

299
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:27,160
She's outside the hospital right now.

300
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,480
She's outside...

301
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,860
Let's go.

302
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,680
Let's go, let's go...

303
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,200
Let's go!

304
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,910
If you want me to go to Chief Han's team, you're telling me to give up on Doctor Park.

305
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,790
I don't know what they're thinking either.

306
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:52,600
However,  the competition has started

307
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,580
and Park Hoon, that bastard has to win there.

308
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,210
How can you win without an anesthesiologist?

309
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:00,680
He has to win!

310
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,940
He's just a useless trash if he loses.

311
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,670
I, also,

312
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,520
you, too,

313
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,400
and that bastard will all die.

314
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:21,770

315
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,370
Ah, I'm so annoyed.

316
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:31,110
Is something wrong?

317
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:35,240
The twin's surgery...  he said Dr. Oh will be his First.

318
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,780
Not Doctor Keum?

319
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,190
That's what I'm saying.

320
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:44,350
There's a limit to protecting her because she's his girlfriend.

321
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,790
Excuse me, Doctor Eun.

322
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,240
What?

323
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,080
Then, should we change Doctor Han's heart?

324
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:05,180
Why are we at Min Soo Ji's house, when we're looking for a scrub nurse?

325
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:09,410
I hear that Nurse Min was a senior in the operating room before coming here.

326
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:13,040
 If there is a small atrial septal defect, then isn't it really dangerous as the repair is more difficult?

327
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,220
And it looks like she has some experience.

328
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:23,220
Nurse Min.

329
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:33,500
 The baby just fell asleep. Don't ring the doorbell.

330
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,820
What kind of dog sh** situation is this?

331
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,600
She says that the baby is sleeping.

332
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,160
Baby or not..

333
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,040
What is it that you're doing?

334
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,120
Get out immediately. Hurry up!

335
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,760
My hips... The baby will wake up, Nurse Min.

336
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:23,430
- Oh my!
- Let's go.

337
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:32,060
Do you want to beat Chief Han that badly that you came all the way here?

338
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,610
It's because the surgery is tonight.

339
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:37,000
It's been a long time since I left the surgery room.

340
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,850
And there are a lot of scrub nurses at Myeongwoo even if it's not me.

341
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,710
He's very good looking. What's his name?

342
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:59,610
Seung Min.

343
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,050
The twin babies don't even have names.

344
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,890
They're the same age as Seung Min.

345
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:11,030
The same kindergarten, the same school,

346
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:14,580
they might even be Seung Min's school seat partner.

347
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,110
I'm begging you, Nurse Min.

348
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,750
It was very touching.

349
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,160
Did it not work?

350
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,210
I almost fell for it.

351
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,190
Which part is it?

352
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:35,170
The same school, Seung Min's seat partner...

353
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:44,970
Hey, you are going through all this for a mere scrub nurse?

354
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,240
I'm doing this because it's worth it.

355
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,450
So is she going to do it?

356
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:49,800
I don't know.

357
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,240
How can you not know when you went through hell to get in?

358
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,890
Why are you getting irritated when I'm the one who did all the suffering?

359
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:58,090
I can be irritated because I was turned away at the door.

360
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,380
Give me 10,000 won. (about 10 dollars)

361
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,540
- Why?
- So that I can buy some ice cream.

362
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,070
Gosh this unconcerned punk... I'll give you 100,000 won. (100 dollars)

363
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,990
Here! Here it is!

364
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,380
You did well.

365
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,140
It's been a long time since you've stopped being a scrub nurse.

366
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,760
What do you think will happen to the surgery tonight?

367
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,100
Seung Min's dad, you are Doctor Park's First.

368
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,500
I probably won't be able to.

369
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,340
Doctor Park Hoon

370
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,350
will never beat Chief Han.

371
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:46,990
Hey, Park Hoon!

372
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:50,480
Park Hoon, wasn't our anesthesiologist Doctor Han?

373
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,260
- Yes, why? 
 - What do you mean why?

374
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,070
She said she isn't going to do it!

375
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,860
Hurry and go!

376
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,430
- I'm sorry, I'm taking a day off. 
 - Off?

377
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,180
I had something else come up.

378
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,980
What more important thing could have come up before a big surgery?

379
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,590
There's no reason for me to tell you.

380
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,850
You said you wanted to save the babies.

381
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:09,890
I said that, but I'm in a difficult situation today.

382
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,360
What are you trying to do right now?

383
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,330
I didn't rest a single day after coming here.

384
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:16,540
So I finally was able to get a day off and I want to rest.

385
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,540
Then what about the kids?

386
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:22,440
I'm not the only anesthesiologist.

387
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,470
You're the only one to me.

388
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:28,360
You know that an anesthesiologist is important for this surgery. I beg you.

389
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,030
Sorry.

390
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:37,080

391
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,690
That's right. The surgery for today is at 10 o'clock. What you got off work?

392
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,810
How can a department chief get off work already?

393
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:47,490
Whenever I call an anesthesiologist, you guys always say you are on your way home. Hey!

394
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:53,270
 I understand, so you will be the anesthesiologist for the twins, right?

395
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,550
  Of course.

396
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,300
  Why did you say that you want to do this surgery?

397
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,840
 We are trying to save the babies.

398
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,210
  Is that really all?

399
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:01,080
  I'm sorry.

400
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,450
Doctor Moon?

401
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,440
What is it?

402
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:17,750
Don't you, by chance, need an anesthesiologist for the surgery?

403
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,170
Did you come to fan a house on fire?

404
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:25,930
What do you mean fan a house? I'm here to be an anesthesiologist for this team.

405
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,730
Doctor Eun is being an anesthesiologist for Doctor Park?

406
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:37,490
Exactly. She's saying that all of a sudden.

407
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:39,990
- It's because of you. 
 - What?

408
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:44,230
She's doing that to make you the First.

409
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,920
I'm sorry, Chief. Because of me-

410
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,940
You don't have to be sorry.

411
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,050
We can look for another anesthesiologist.

412
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,840
Well, I guess so.

413
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,880
For today's surgery?

414
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,090
That's right. I wish you would do it.

415
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:05,640
They are twins with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome. (Left ventricle, aorta, mitral &amp; aortic valvess under-developed.)

416
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:11,070
 Get into Han Jae Joon's team.

417
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:16,260
What should I do, Chief? I'm getting off early.

418
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,010
Getting off?

419
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:19,220
Yes, I have an important appointment.

420
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:22,450
I don't know what appointment you have, but you should postpone it.

421
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,870
We need to hurry and do the surgery.

422
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:28,150
I heard that Doctor Park's anesthesiologist has been chosen already.

423
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:30,130
Instead of my surgery room...

424
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,920
Are you telling me to go into Chief Han's team?

425
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:43,160
What is this? I heard that you two are competing against each other.

426
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,690
That's why it needs to be fair, or I would feel sorry for winning.

427
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:50,690
What you say is interesting. But not today.

428
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,220
Doctor Han!

429
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:59,520
Are you joking after stealing our anesthesiologist?

430
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,240
That's why I'm trying to get you another doctor.

431
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,730
Do I look that easy to you?

432
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:07,350
Do you think I'll lose because I don't have an anesthesiologist?

433
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:15,410
Don't you know that you'll have a hard time if you don't have a skilled anesthesiologist?

434
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:20,280
The result will ultimately come from the operating surgeon's hands.

435
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:27,040
I really like your spirit. Then let's do our best.

436
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,000
Doctor Han.

437
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,350
Chairman.

438
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,990
Is this castle, Myeongwoo?

439
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:54,110
It's just a toy to relieve my tension.

440
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:57,030
Who do you think the owner of this castle is right now?

441
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:00,810
If it is Myeongwoo, then of course it would be-

442
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:04,130
Me? It's not.

443
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:07,540
The owner of the castle is the castle itself.

444
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:13,220
At the castle named Myeongwoo, I'm just a person Myeongwoo tolerates for the time being.

445
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:18,350
If I don't have the qualification to protect it, then Myeongwoo will kick me out anytime.

446
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:23,370
You said you want to become the owner of the castle? Then show that you have the qualification

447
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,030
to Myeongwoo.

448
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,070
Get rid of the stranger who entered the castle.

449
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,140
Are you talking about Park Hoon?

450
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:43,150
Bear in mind. It is not me, but it is Myeongwoo which is looking at you.

451
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:48,180
How are you going to get rid of that invader?

452
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:02,870
 I think it right for Doctor Keum to be the First of this surgery.

453
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:09,020
 Doctor Oh is just an ordinary doctor except for the fact that she is the Chairman's daughter.

454
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:13,740
 I said it before, our team's First is you.

455
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,960
Scalpel.

456
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:51,560
There was something I was curious about since last time.

457
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:00,390
Is there something between here?

458
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,540
- There's a quack!
- Stop joking around.

459
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,890
It's image training. Move, go!

460
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:10,350
Can you tell me what a First needs to do?

461
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,620
Are you asking me to train the other team's First?

462
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,720
Why are you picking on the details?

463
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,160
I see, if you don't have any self-reliance, you should at least have parasitism.

464
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,680
Hey, Doctor Park! What are you doing?

465
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,990
You told me tell you.

466
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,860
What's so funny?

467
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:32,320
Quack, did you think that I would touch you here and there?

468
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,370
Forget it, let's stop.

469
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:37,990
I understand, I'm sorry. We have to save the twins.

470
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:40,050
Let go of me!

471
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,170
Close your eyes.

472
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:53,730
Look, do you see the baby's heart on the tips of your fingers?

473
00:36:53,730 --> 00:37:00,500
♬  I'm going to meet you right now. Let's meet again.  ♬

474
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:07,460
♬  When we meet again, we'll be really happy.  ♬

475
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:16,060
♬  Me, without you, I can't do anything.  ♬

476
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:22,670
♬  Right now, I'm going to meet you again.  ♬

477
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:29,390
♬  After struggling to run and run again  ♬

478
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:36,280
♬  Finally you appear    ♬

479
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:42,950
♬  Sad tears in my eyes form and  ♬

480
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:50,170
♬  Are falling down into my heart  ♬

481
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:53,910
♬  I'm going to meet you now  ♬

482
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:56,360
What on earth are you doing, Doctor Oh?

483
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,510
Give me some of your time.

484
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,980
Thank you, Doctor Park.

485
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,650
Did you forget that Doctor Oh is the other team's First?

486
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:33,590
You are competing with Chief Han right now!

487
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,380
Doctor Park, is this competition laughable?

488
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,100
You're the one who thinks it as laughable.

489
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:47,490
You said you'd be the anesthesiologist, then you said you don't want to. And you said you didn't want to for the other team too.

490
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,660
I'll give you some advice.

491
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,930
There are a lot of things at stake in this competition.

492
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:56,010
What is at stake?

493
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,190
If I lose, am I going to die?

494
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:02,770
I thought for a moment that you might be Jae Hee.

495
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:08,390
But you're not.

496
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:12,850
- Why?
- If you were Jae Hee,

497
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,720
you would say that it doesn't matter if I win or lose.

498
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,430
Because it's important to you.

499
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:19,470
What is more important than those kids right now?

500
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:25,910
Don't you see those kids there? They're not even 1 month old,

501
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:29,320
they have respirators on instead of mother's nipples and they can't even say they are hurting.

502
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,050
That milky skin

503
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:33,090
will be cut by a knife soon.

504
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:37,990
Why is the competition so important when we don't even know if they will live or die after the surgery?

505
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:40,590
What's so important about losing or winning?

506
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,540
But Doctor Park...

507
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,990
I've got it, so go. You said you are tired.

508
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:49,990
I will do well on that stupid competition or whatever, so go.

509
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,740
Don't worry too much about the anesthesiologist for the surgery.

510
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,970
I said go.

511
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,770
What are you saying?

512
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:37,100
Are you telling me to give up being the First?

513
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,540
Yes. Let's have Keum Bong Hyun do this surgery.

514
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,960
What's the reason?

515
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,210
Doctor Eun will be the anesthesiologist for Doctor Park.

516
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:48,310
- So what?
- If I put Bong Hyun as the First, she will come back.

517
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:52,630
- I don't want to.
- Soo Hyeon.

518
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:54,370
I really want to do this surgery!

519
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:57,990
I prepared so hard, to the point where I embarrassingly asked Doctor Park for help.

520
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:00,550
And now you're telling me to compromise?

521
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,630
I'm sorry, Jae Joon.

522
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:05,350
Was that the face of being embarrassed?

523
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:09,780
To my eyes, it looked like you were so happy that you didn't know how to contain it.

524
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,260
Are you jealous right now?

525
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:16,170
As a chief to a staff, I'm ordering you.

526
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,430
Give the First to Bong Hyun for this surgery.

527
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:21,830
- I said I'll do it.
- Listen to me!

528
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,710
This is why they say that it's because you are the Chairman's daughter.

529
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:29,050
You know very well that isn't the reason why.

530
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:31,980
Every doctor wants to participate in a surgery as hard as Norwood.

531
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,490
A person who can do it, rather than a person who wants to, has to do it.

532
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:39,430
What did you just say?

533
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:42,220
Then, I'm not a person who can do it?

534
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,210
That's right.

535
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:49,590
Bong Hyun has the skills where he doesn't need to ask for help from a doctor like Doctor Park.

536
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,910
Jae Joon...

537
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:05,230
I understand.

538
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,970
Put Doctor Keum as the First.

539
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,760
Of course, Doctor Eun.

540
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:26,330
Yes, I'm going to the operating room right now.

541
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,900
I heard that Doctor Keum would be the First for tonight's surgery.

542
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,110
Wasn't Quack, I mean Doctor Oh the First?

543
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:38,220
Well, I heard that happened.

544
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:46,270
What is this?

545
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:59,800
Can you do it somewhere else?

546
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,580
Let's go to some other place.

547
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:10,820
 Norwood

548
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,840
 I need the knight's help.

549
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:38,400

550
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:33,140
Is this what you meant when you said you wouldn't be standing in as the first surgeon?

551
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,080
I can't forever be an unpaid fellow.

552
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:42,080
If I do what Chief Han commands,

553
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,300
I can be an assistant professor by next year.

554
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,740
Then our lives will become better.

555
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:50,840
How can you do this when you know that if you don't do surgery on the twin babies they will be in danger?

556
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,740
If Doctor Park can't do it, then Chief Han will do it.

557
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:56,890
Are you saying this because you don't know the reason they are rushing the surgery?

558
00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:01,250
You are a parent too. A father.

559
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,110
I'm doing this because I want to become a better father, Soo Ji.

560
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,230
Then what about a better doctor?

561
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:17,160
I came here because I had to discuss something with you, but I don't think there is need anymore.

562
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,280
Get out! Get out!

563
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,860
Get out immediately!

564
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:28,270
Aihoo... that enemy (someone who isn't a help in your life)... seriously!

565
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:30,780
How did this happen?

566
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,880
I'm sorry. The surgery is so near...

567
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:41,880
Did I betray the country in my past life?

568
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,350
Why do these kinds of things keep happening to me?

569
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:46,740
We have no choice, you have to do it.

570
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,780
Hey, don't you know that I'm prohibited from medical practice?

571
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:50,360
Then who will be my First?

572
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,780
Why would I be like this if I knew?

573
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:55,160
Ah really!

574
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:06,120
I'm truly going to go crazy!

575
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,000
Hey, Quack.

576
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:24,610
- Are you sleeping?
- I don't have the time to play with you, so go.

577
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:28,230
- I heard you were fired from being the First.
- I told you to get lost!

578
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:40,580
Help me. Our First got hurt.

579
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,140
Don't you know that I'm on Chief Han's team?

580
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:43,770
Is your side or my side important?

581
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:46,380
Then what is important?

582
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:49,090
We have to save the babies.

583
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:56,980
How can you save a baby with  a quack with no skills?

584
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:01,330
I'm doing this because I think it's possible if it's our quack who tries.

585
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:08,750
I don't have time. Are you going to help or not?

586
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:26,000
That's right. You have the hands of a cardiothoracic surgeon.

587
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:32,990
Instead, you have something you need to know.

588
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:38,560
What are you doing right now?

589
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,110
What do you mean? I need to get ready for the surgery.

590
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:42,410
- Whose surgery?
- Chief Han's.

591
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:44,920
What about my surgery? You said you'll take the responsibility of being the anesthesiologist.

592
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,390
- I said that.
- Doctor Eun!

593
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:49,820
Stay calm, Dr. Park.

594
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:53,290
I am the highest senior in the Anesthesiology Department.

595
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:57,050
The Anesthesiology Department's discipline is really strong, Dr. Park.

596
00:48:57,610 --> 00:48:59,790
Where are you, Doctor Han?

597
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:02,430
I'm looking for houses.

598
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:05,080
There is an urgent surgery, so come back.

599
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,330
I guess the issue is solved well?

600
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:11,470
Right now is 8 o'clock. The surgery is at 10 o'clock, so you can come right?

601
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:12,770
Yes, Doctor.

602
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:16,300
 And, wait.

603
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,170
It's me.

604
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,980
Yes.

605
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:26,770
I'm sorry.

606
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:30,520
It's okay, Doctor.

607
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,390
Can you come?

608
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:34,960
We have to save the baby.

609
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,290
Then you will be refusing Jang Seok Joo's demand.

610
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:44,380
I didn't go into Park Hoon's team because I wanted to

611
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:46,850
but it is an order from a senior of the Anesthesiology Department.

612
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:51,650
If I go to Chief Han's team at this point, that would be more suspicious.

613
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:55,210
I don't know what their plan is

614
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:58,170
but we have to move according to our plan.

615
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,120
What's wrong, Hyung?

616
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,750
You're following her well, right?

617
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:27,180
But why are you telling me to follow her?

618
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:28,460
Where are you?

619
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,440
 Pyeongtaek Lake Tourism Park

620
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,250
I'm in Pyeongtaek.

621
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:36,780
Watch her well. If anything happens, contact me.

622
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,830
Yes.

623
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:53,970
The Prime Minister just went into his quarters.

624
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:55,910
I understand.

625
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:21,110
 The Prime Minister just went into his quarters..

626
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:23,250
 I understand.

627
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:27,250
Then, shall we go to my quarters together?

628
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:05,380
 Pyeongtaek Lake Art Center

629
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,330
Is he her boyfriend?

630
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:38,540
That's good. If it's Doctor Han, it's someone you  wanted as well.

631
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:40,620
What about the scrub nurse?

632
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:42,550
I found one.

633
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,440
When will Doctor Han come?

634
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:00,630
What? Is something wrong?

635
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:06,910
 What will you do if I disappear all of a sudden?

636
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:11,110
 What will I do? I will search for you all over the world.

637
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:12,920
 Really?

638
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:36,350
What is this atmosphere?

639
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,240
Do you have to do this?

640
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,770
You don't need to worry because I'm not better than Doctor Keum.

641
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:29,390
Does that mean you go to Park Hoon?

642
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:37,830
I asked her.

643
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,570
Do you now take our side's First too?

644
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:45,540
I will return her to you later. So let's just worry about the surgery.

645
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:49,130
That's a low blow. Do you want to win that much that you're doing this?

646
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:54,420
Gosh, how did you know? So don't lose or anything because that'll be embarrassing.

647
00:54:55,620 --> 00:55:00,250
I'm saying don't hold back on any means or methods and just save the child. Okay?

648
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,560
Chairman.

649
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,200
 Lee Chang Yi

650
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:26,020
Are you still in Pyeongtaek?

651
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:31,720
Yes, Hyung. But what is this?

652
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:49,640
What are you doing?

653
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:03,180
What?

654
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:06,600
 Hyung, the atmosphere is weird.

655
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,360
Is Doctor Han okay?

656
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,980
 Jae Hee.

657
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:41,370
What is the reason for wanting to meet us?

658
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:47,780
We want to change the plan a little.

659
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:49,510
Change?

660
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:51,300
That's right.

661
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:56,380
We will use Han Jae Joon's card for the Prime Minister's surgery team.

662
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,630
Hyung!

663
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:09,780
What is the matter?

664
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:12,540
The girl that looks like Unni...

665
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:16,040
Yes, Doctor Han Seung Hee!

666
00:58:21,950 --> 00:58:24,330
 I think they are going to kill her.
