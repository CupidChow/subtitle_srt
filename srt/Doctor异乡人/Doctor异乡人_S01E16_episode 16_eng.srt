1
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:42,643

2
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:09,253
 Jae Hee got a kidney transplant about two years ago.

3
00:01:09,253 --> 00:01:11,383
 A kidney transplant?

4
00:01:25,133 --> 00:01:28,033
  Myeongwoo University Hospital
Medical examination record; Han Seung Hee (F)

5
00:01:48,013 --> 00:01:53,383
 Both sides were in such a bad state that she got a transplant on one side.  (showing only 1 good kidney)

6
00:02:12,343 --> 00:02:14,793
 I'm sorry, Doctor Oh.

7
00:02:23,253 --> 00:02:25,323
Doctor Oh.

8
00:02:43,213 --> 00:02:45,413
I...

9
00:02:45,413 --> 00:02:50,243
came to apologize to Doctor Park for what my father did.

10
00:02:50,243 --> 00:02:52,963
It's not something you should apologize for.

11
00:02:53,943 --> 00:02:56,193
Thank you for saying that.

12
00:02:56,953 --> 00:02:59,053
I'll be going.

13
00:03:06,243 --> 00:03:08,423
Wait, I have something to say.

14
00:03:08,423 --> 00:03:09,163
Later.

15
00:03:09,163 --> 00:03:10,143
Listen to it now.

16
00:03:10,143 --> 00:03:12,363
Later!

17
00:03:12,363 --> 00:03:14,893
I told you I'll listen to it later...

18
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:34,873
Why didn't you tell me that Doctor Han was Jae Hee?

19
00:03:34,873 --> 00:03:37,103
I'll sincerely apologize for not being able to tell you sooner.  But-

20
00:03:37,103 --> 00:03:38,553
Sincerely?

21
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:40,213
Do you even have such a thing?

22
00:03:40,213 --> 00:03:41,253
There was a situation.

23
00:03:41,253 --> 00:03:42,313
What kind of situation?

24
00:03:42,313 --> 00:03:43,313
I can't say that.

25
00:03:43,313 --> 00:03:46,203
What is there that you can say then?

26
00:03:53,143 --> 00:03:55,283
When did you know?

27
00:03:57,183 --> 00:03:59,473
Back at the hospital staff's room.

28
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,503
Right.

29
00:04:08,503 --> 00:04:10,463
I'm sure you'd have known at the staff's room.

30
00:04:10,463 --> 00:04:12,853
I knew then that she was trying to hide her identity.

31
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,253
I thought that there was some kind of reason.

32
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:16,003
You should have told me.

33
00:04:16,003 --> 00:04:18,203
You should have told me even if it's later.

34
00:04:18,203 --> 00:04:20,173
- To you?
- That's right, me!

35
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:22,193
Why to you?

36
00:04:22,193 --> 00:04:23,263
Are you asking because you don't know?

37
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,483
How would I know?

38
00:04:26,563 --> 00:04:28,873
Jerk.

39
00:04:41,713 --> 00:04:45,373
 Episode 16

40
00:04:45,373 --> 00:04:47,003
What about Doctor Oh?

41
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:48,073
She left.

42
00:04:48,073 --> 00:04:49,003
Did you apologize?

43
00:04:49,003 --> 00:04:51,353
What apology? What did we do wrong?

44
00:04:51,353 --> 00:04:53,073
We deceived Doctor Oh.

45
00:04:53,073 --> 00:04:54,413
We didn't do it on purpose.

46
00:04:54,413 --> 00:04:56,413
But still, she was nice to us.

47
00:04:56,413 --> 00:04:57,773
Let's go together. So-

48
00:04:57,773 --> 00:04:59,573
Forget it.

49
00:04:59,573 --> 00:05:00,543
Hoon.

50
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,723
I said it's fine.

51
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:02,543
Doctor Oh.

52
00:06:02,543 --> 00:06:04,313
Doctor Han, I mean,

53
00:06:04,313 --> 00:06:07,833
I was really startled that you were Jae Hee.

54
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,013
I'm sorry. I had a situation...

55
00:06:10,013 --> 00:06:11,643
It's fine.

56
00:06:11,643 --> 00:06:13,803
Seeing that, I'm really tactless.

57
00:06:13,803 --> 00:06:16,533
Not even sensing the relationship between you two.

58
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:19,153
By chance, there isn't a mistake I made, right?

59
00:06:19,153 --> 00:06:22,253
Are you going somewhere? I have something to tell you.

60
00:06:22,253 --> 00:06:25,553
Kim Chi Gyu suddenly asked me to switch night duty with him.

61
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:27,853
This guy is probably trying to seduce another girl.

62
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:28,883
Doctor Oh.

63
00:06:28,883 --> 00:06:33,333
Let's talk later. Okay?

64
00:06:39,913 --> 00:06:46,723
♬  While people gathered on a nice day like this they laughed and rejoiced.  ♬

65
00:06:46,723 --> 00:06:50,653
♬  While people gathered on a nice day like this they laughed and rejoiced.  ♬

66
00:06:50,653 --> 00:06:57,983
♬  Because the tears are flowing and I am in pain only by myself  ♬

67
00:06:57,983 --> 00:06:59,703
♬  I’m thinking of you.  ♬

68
00:06:59,703 --> 00:07:02,043
Please get him a cardiothoracic x-ray and blood test.

69
00:07:02,043 --> 00:07:02,973
Yes.

70
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:05,733
Tell me after you're done with the tests.

71
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:06,403
Yes.

72
00:07:06,403 --> 00:07:07,413
Please follow me.

73
00:07:07,413 --> 00:07:11,113
Yes.
♬  It should be easy to forget you like that.  ♬

74
00:07:11,113 --> 00:07:17,723
♬  I’m sorry. Without you it seems I can’t survive.  ♬

75
00:07:17,723 --> 00:07:21,193
♬  I can neither eat nor sleep.  ♬

76
00:07:21,193 --> 00:07:27,713
♬  I can neither laugh nor cry. That’s right.  ♬

77
00:07:30,623 --> 00:07:32,793
Doctor Oh.

78
00:07:32,793 --> 00:07:34,033
Oh.

79
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:37,923
I would really like it if a situation like this happened occasionally in the future too.

80
00:07:37,923 --> 00:07:38,533
About what?

81
00:07:38,533 --> 00:07:41,873
I'm really happy and grateful that

82
00:07:41,873 --> 00:07:44,903
you're saying you'd even be on night duty instead of me.

83
00:07:44,903 --> 00:07:48,383
You know right? Then I'll be leaving.

84
00:07:55,513 --> 00:07:58,353
♬  On a nice day like this, the day we broke up.  ♬

85
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:01,903
 Doctor Park Hoon. 
♬  On a nice day like this, the day we broke up.  ♬

86
00:08:01,903 --> 00:08:08,813
♬  I tried to smile, but it was no good.  ♬

87
00:08:08,813 --> 00:08:12,823
Doctor Oh, can you take a look at this CT?
♬  Even though I try to pretend I’m fine, I’m the same.  ♬

88
00:08:12,823 --> 00:08:15,553
♬  Even though I try to pretend I’m fine, I’m the same.  ♬

89
00:08:15,553 --> 00:08:18,643
Don't you think there is inflammation on the chest area?

90
00:08:21,943 --> 00:08:28,113
♬  On a good day like this, the day we broke up.  ♬

91
00:08:28,113 --> 00:08:36,053
♬  I tried to bear it but that didn’t work.  ♬

92
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:39,173
 The number you have dial-

93
00:08:39,173 --> 00:08:41,203
Aish.

94
00:08:45,683 --> 00:08:48,563
Oh, how is Quack? Is she alright?

95
00:08:48,563 --> 00:08:51,763
If you were that worried, you should have come with us.

96
00:08:51,763 --> 00:08:53,903
Is Quack really mad?

97
00:08:53,903 --> 00:08:55,343
I don't know.

98
00:08:55,343 --> 00:08:56,713
Why?

99
00:08:56,713 --> 00:09:00,533
She said that she's fine but it doesn't seem like it.

100
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:02,373
Put her on the phone if she's there.

101
00:09:02,373 --> 00:09:03,893
Why isn't she picking up her phone?

102
00:09:03,893 --> 00:09:05,273
She went to the hospital.

103
00:09:05,273 --> 00:09:06,423
Hospital?

104
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:09,423
It just seemed like she was avoiding me.

105
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,553
Aish, seriously.

106
00:09:11,553 --> 00:09:14,193
Did we commit a deadly sin?

107
00:09:14,193 --> 00:09:16,503
She'll be okay, right?

108
00:09:16,503 --> 00:09:20,633
Don't worry too much. She wouldn't have gone to the police station.

109
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:21,913
That's not it.

110
00:09:21,913 --> 00:09:25,663
I'm worried that Doctor Oh's heart   might have been hurt.

111
00:09:28,593 --> 00:09:31,803
I'll try talking to her tomorrow, so you try talking to her too.

112
00:09:31,803 --> 00:09:33,913
Forget it.

113
00:09:58,183 --> 00:10:00,463
 Hey, Quack

114
00:10:05,443 --> 00:10:08,863
 Huh?

115
00:10:17,143 --> 00:10:21,013
Aigoo, damn it.

116
00:10:26,183 --> 00:10:28,333
There wasn't any problem

117
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,933
looking at the image and blood pressure check.

118
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:34,693
It seems like you are exhausted because you've worked all night for several nights.

119
00:10:34,693 --> 00:10:40,003
For now, you should go home and have a good rest and if the same symptoms come up again,  you should come back again.

120
00:10:40,003 --> 00:10:43,643
Yes, I got it. Thank you, Doctor.

121
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,633
Thank you.

122
00:10:48,493 --> 00:10:50,813
It hurts so much, I might die.

123
00:10:50,813 --> 00:10:55,063
Why do you just keep telling me to wait when I'm telling you to treat me first.

124
00:10:55,063 --> 00:10:59,573
Since it's a simple laceration, I'm asking you to just wait for a little bit.

125
00:10:59,573 --> 00:11:01,933
Does this look simple to you?

126
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:04,603
We first have to look at the urgent patients, don't you think?

127
00:11:04,603 --> 00:11:08,303
Do you really want to die? Didn't I tell you I'm more urgent?

128
00:11:08,303 --> 00:11:10,253
Why are you like this?

129
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:13,033
- Won't you let go of this hand?
- What are you?

130
00:11:15,003 --> 00:11:17,273
- Go do your work.
- Look at you!

131
00:11:17,273 --> 00:11:22,303
Wait. There are a lot of patients way more serious than you.

132
00:11:22,303 --> 00:11:25,073
Then, why doesn't a pretty doctor look at it?

133
00:11:25,073 --> 00:11:26,633
I told you to wait!

134
00:11:26,633 --> 00:11:30,703
Why is this young wench regularly speaking informally, damn it?!

135
00:11:41,503 --> 00:11:44,593
Is this your bedroom? Why are you using violence at the hospital?!

136
00:11:44,593 --> 00:11:48,523
Aish, did you lose your mind because you have a death wish?

137
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:54,883
Ouch!  Maybe because it's a blockhead, it really hurts!

138
00:11:54,883 --> 00:11:56,483
Are you okay?

139
00:11:57,173 --> 00:11:59,213
You bastard!

140
00:11:59,213 --> 00:12:00,783
What a savage.

141
00:12:00,783 --> 00:12:03,223
Stop it.

142
00:12:10,713 --> 00:12:13,693
Are you a thug?

143
00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:17,463
Look at your mustache.

144
00:12:21,523 --> 00:12:22,943
Stay quiet.

145
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:26,563
I'm sorry.

146
00:12:26,563 --> 00:12:29,253
Work hard.

147
00:12:29,253 --> 00:12:32,103
Give me one too.

148
00:12:32,103 --> 00:12:33,423
I'm going.

149
00:12:33,423 --> 00:12:34,913
Okay then.

150
00:12:34,913 --> 00:12:37,293
Bye.

151
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,313
Are you alright?

152
00:12:46,103 --> 00:12:48,433
What's it to you?

153
00:12:49,983 --> 00:12:51,903
Wait.

154
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,673
Are you okay?

155
00:13:05,043 --> 00:13:07,513
Why did you come?

156
00:13:07,513 --> 00:13:10,203
Because I have something to tell you.

157
00:13:10,203 --> 00:13:11,903
Tell me.

158
00:13:14,273 --> 00:13:16,133
I said tell me.

159
00:13:23,013 --> 00:13:26,133
Choose who you're lashing your temper out at.

160
00:13:30,183 --> 00:13:31,403
Does it hurt a lot?

161
00:13:31,403 --> 00:13:33,893
Wouldn't it hurt if it were you?

162
00:13:34,873 --> 00:13:38,243
- So then why-
 - If it were you

163
00:13:38,243 --> 00:13:40,833
wouldn't your heart be hurting?

164
00:13:50,553 --> 00:13:52,433
Tell me.

165
00:13:54,173 --> 00:13:56,593
Why did you do that to me?

166
00:13:56,593 --> 00:14:00,103
Why did you make a person into a fool?

167
00:14:01,703 --> 00:14:04,003
Tell me.

168
00:14:04,003 --> 00:14:07,063
What am I supposed to do now?

169
00:14:17,863 --> 00:14:19,663
I'm sorry.

170
00:14:28,803 --> 00:14:30,503
I'm sorry.

171
00:14:48,813 --> 00:14:50,283
Oh, why?

172
00:14:50,283 --> 00:14:54,103
 Is Doctor Oh still not answering her phone?

173
00:14:55,443 --> 00:14:57,223
I don't know.

174
00:14:57,223 --> 00:15:00,123
 Shouldn't you go see her?

175
00:15:01,953 --> 00:15:04,953
Quack is spirited so she'll be alright.

176
00:15:04,953 --> 00:15:07,593
Try talking to her at home later.

177
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:10,083
 Okay.

178
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:20,493

179
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:51,593
♬  Like the sun which comes through the window late in the morning waking me  ♬

180
00:15:51,593 --> 00:15:57,523
♬  You gently approach.  ♬

181
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:01,153
 Did you people see him? I'm asking if you people saw him do it intentionally!

182
00:16:01,153 --> 00:16:05,193
 If you don't know, stay still. Why are you thoughtlessly talking when you don't know anything?

183
00:16:05,193 --> 00:16:10,983
♬  I wonder whether I am allowed to feel this joy.  ♬

184
00:16:10,983 --> 00:16:16,993
 I got dumped after confessing to Doctor Park.

185
00:16:16,993 --> 00:16:19,653
 Don't do that to me.

186
00:16:20,803 --> 00:16:25,093
 I'm really confused whenever you do that to me.

187
00:16:25,093 --> 00:16:28,753
♬  I love as if I may not see you again.  ♬

188
00:16:28,753 --> 00:16:32,993
♬  Day to day for me  ♬

189
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:38,613
♬  I heal with love  ♬

190
00:16:38,613 --> 00:16:44,583
♬  instead of scars.  ♬

191
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:51,393
♬  Remaining heavily on my lips like the thick taste of coffee  ♬

192
00:16:51,393 --> 00:16:58,533

♬  At some point you became my life.  ♬

193
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:05,153
♬  I wonder if I can dare to endure, even a day without you  ♬

194
00:17:05,153 --> 00:17:11,303
♬  That is something I can't imagine.  ♬

195
00:17:11,303 --> 00:17:18,303

♬  I love like a tomorrow which may not come.  ♬

196
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:25,133
♬  I love as if I may not see you again.  ♬

197
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:29,383
♬  Day to day for me  ♬

198
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:35,623
♬  I heal with love instead of scars.  ♬

199
00:17:55,413 --> 00:17:59,523
Prime Minister, it's Han Seung Hee.

200
00:18:01,183 --> 00:18:06,423
What? You told him that the President is the one getting surgery?

201
00:18:07,123 --> 00:18:09,783
- Yes.
- Are you in the right sense of mind?

202
00:18:09,783 --> 00:18:11,613
You tell him that kind of a thing?

203
00:18:11,613 --> 00:18:15,173
Anyway, that plan was wrong.

204
00:18:15,173 --> 00:18:18,233
That's not a problem you should judge!

205
00:18:18,233 --> 00:18:21,563
 It's not something you guys say is wrong or right!

206
00:18:30,793 --> 00:18:34,633
My plan was perfect. If I kill his mother,

207
00:18:34,633 --> 00:18:39,723
he will pour out his anger on the surgical table ... not on me, but on the President!

208
00:18:39,723 --> 00:18:45,273
You're wrong. No matter what you do, to Park Hoon,

209
00:18:45,273 --> 00:18:49,053
the person on his surgical table is simply his patient.

210
00:18:49,053 --> 00:18:52,153
A patient he needs to treat as a doctor.

211
00:18:55,323 --> 00:18:58,583
Is that why you took his mother?

212
00:19:00,503 --> 00:19:02,993
No, no.

213
00:19:02,993 --> 00:19:06,633
It wasn't because the plan was wrong,

214
00:19:06,633 --> 00:19:11,753
it's because she's his mother. Because she's the mother of the guy you love.

215
00:19:11,753 --> 00:19:13,773
I won't deny that.

216
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,863
Do you think you can hide her?

217
00:19:17,863 --> 00:19:21,613
Do you think I can't find her if I feel like doing it?

218
00:19:21,613 --> 00:19:23,503
If that happens,

219
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:28,883
you'll have to give up becoming the president.

220
00:19:28,883 --> 00:19:32,933
That's a very cheeky threat.

221
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:38,093
But there are only few years left till the next election.

222
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,583
If you want to win the election

223
00:19:41,963 --> 00:19:45,483
you will need an achievement like a summit conference.

224
00:19:47,493 --> 00:19:53,593
Will that be possible without the People's Republic's help?

225
00:20:00,523 --> 00:20:05,123
You probably didn't want to meet me,  just to make me angry.

226
00:20:05,123 --> 00:20:06,833
Get to the point.

227
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:10,333
Why don't you use Chief Han Jae Joon as the point surgeon instead of Park Hoon?

228
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:13,353
It's a talk I'm fed up with.

229
00:20:13,353 --> 00:20:17,443
I will go onto Chief Han Jae Joon's team.

230
00:20:20,023 --> 00:20:23,583
You will go to Han Jae Joon's team?

231
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:28,823
Chief Han Jae Joon's skill is more than acceptable to the president.

232
00:20:28,823 --> 00:20:33,833
Then the President will lie on his surgery table and

233
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:37,333
Chief Han's surgery will be completed perfectly.

234
00:20:38,673 --> 00:20:41,143
That's the end of his role.

235
00:20:41,143 --> 00:20:45,223
After that, I just need to take care of it.

236
00:20:48,443 --> 00:20:54,173
Because having the President in a comatose state is the result you wanted from the beginning.

237
00:20:55,503 --> 00:20:58,683
This is getting a little bit interesting.

238
00:20:58,683 --> 00:21:00,503
Instead,

239
00:21:01,993 --> 00:21:03,713
I have a condition.

240
00:21:03,713 --> 00:21:05,263
A condition?

241
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:08,493
Promise me Park Hoon

242
00:21:08,493 --> 00:21:10,503
and his mother's safety.

243
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:12,763
Ah.

244
00:21:12,763 --> 00:21:14,253
Nice.

245
00:21:15,403 --> 00:21:20,393
But I don't really like Park Hoon that much.

246
00:21:20,393 --> 00:21:24,703
But is there a reason why I should listen to your condition?

247
00:21:24,703 --> 00:21:26,653
Yes, there is.

248
00:21:27,803 --> 00:21:30,783
Having the President in a comatose state

249
00:21:30,783 --> 00:21:33,963
will be impossible without my help.

250
00:21:37,813 --> 00:21:41,093
If he continues to be in a comatose state, it can be viewed as vacant post.

251
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:45,073
You'd have 60 days as an acting President when the President's position is deemed vacant.

252
00:21:45,073 --> 00:21:49,093
The time is far too insufficient to achieve the summit talk.

253
00:21:49,093 --> 00:21:52,553
However , if it is an accident condition where the situation jumps from alert to coma,

254
00:21:52,553 --> 00:21:54,843
the days of acting President

255
00:21:54,843 --> 00:21:58,323
can be prolonged without a limit, Prime Minister.

256
00:21:58,323 --> 00:22:02,493
However, is there a pressing need to pay attention to that woman's condition?

257
00:22:02,493 --> 00:22:05,613
We don't have many days left until the day the president wants to have the surgery.

258
00:22:05,613 --> 00:22:07,383
In that time span,

259
00:22:07,383 --> 00:22:10,253
finding an anesthesiologist whom we can rely on  as much as Han Seung Hee is difficult.

260
00:22:10,253 --> 00:22:12,013
There are many skilled anesthesiologists ...

261
00:22:12,013 --> 00:22:15,353
An anesthesiologist who will act on our orders.

262
00:22:16,263 --> 00:22:20,883
Also that woman has a clear motive.

263
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:23,963
That's right. Park Hoon, that guy.

264
00:22:23,963 --> 00:22:27,693
He will be one of the few things that money cannot buy.

265
00:22:27,693 --> 00:22:29,733
Is that so?

266
00:22:31,803 --> 00:22:33,843
But...

267
00:22:33,843 --> 00:22:36,773
The fact that Park Hoon is alive

268
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:39,383
really is not what I prefer.

269
00:22:42,813 --> 00:22:47,333
 Myeongwoo University Hospital

270
00:22:56,233 --> 00:22:58,333
It's Han Jae Joon.

271
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,303
 It's me.

272
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,073
It'd be nice if you could spare some time.

273
00:23:05,513 --> 00:23:06,853
I have a surgery this morning.

274
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:10,963
I think it would be best to postpone it, Chief Han.
I mean...

275
00:23:10,963 --> 00:23:14,073
Should I call you Chief Lee Seung Hoon?

276
00:23:31,393 --> 00:23:34,433
Since when have you known?

277
00:23:34,433 --> 00:23:38,683
The fact that Chairman Oh Joon Gyu doesn't know about this yet...

278
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:41,653
isn't that the important thing?

279
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:44,783
- What is it that you want?
- Nothing much.

280
00:23:44,783 --> 00:23:48,693
I would like you to fix my heart. How's that?

281
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:52,073
The competition isn't yet over.

282
00:23:52,073 --> 00:23:56,203
Park Hoon, that guy, won't be able to come to the hospital for awhile.

283
00:23:56,203 --> 00:24:01,133
If there is no player, won't you win by forfeit?

284
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:04,613
That's why I'm leaving my heart in your care.

285
00:24:04,613 --> 00:24:07,213
What do you think?

286
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:11,703
Chairman Oh Joon Gyu would like it too, if you win.

287
00:24:11,703 --> 00:24:15,153
Isn't this what you call irony?

288
00:24:17,393 --> 00:24:19,573
Instead...

289
00:24:19,573 --> 00:24:24,623
I want you to swap out a person from your team to someone I want.

290
00:24:25,793 --> 00:24:27,103
The team member?

291
00:24:27,103 --> 00:24:30,673
There's an anesthesiologist named Doctor Han Seung Hee, right?

292
00:24:30,673 --> 00:24:34,843
- That person...
- I know it's not that difficult of a request.

293
00:24:34,843 --> 00:24:37,093
Chief Lee Seung Hoon.

294
00:24:39,403 --> 00:24:42,393
Ah. After the surgery, the patient, I mean

295
00:24:42,393 --> 00:24:46,673
my post-surgical recovery too, I would like that doctor to take care of it.

296
00:24:48,983 --> 00:24:51,363
I understand.

297
00:24:51,363 --> 00:24:54,703
As a way of saying take care of me,

298
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:58,103
I prepared a present for you.

299
00:24:59,613 --> 00:25:05,103
You saw Jaeil University Hospital disappear in a single morning, right?

300
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:10,053
This is the information that can knock out

301
00:25:10,053 --> 00:25:12,643
Chairman Oh Joon Gyu.

302
00:25:12,643 --> 00:25:14,333
Instead,

303
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:17,123
you have to listen to my conditions,

304
00:25:17,123 --> 00:25:20,823
if you want to open this envelope.

305
00:25:38,053 --> 00:25:40,533
What is it?

306
00:25:40,533 --> 00:25:43,193
Shall we get some fresh air together?

307
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,073
It took a long time to get here.

308
00:26:12,123 --> 00:26:16,803
When you betrayed me and ran away to here, how shall I put it?

309
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:21,613
The feeling getting bitten by a dog I raised?

310
00:26:25,903 --> 00:26:28,153
It really hurt.

311
00:26:30,893 --> 00:26:35,643
Since then, I've waited for a chance to get revenge.

312
00:26:35,643 --> 00:26:39,833
Then I got a chance. It was to try to contact

313
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:42,853
South Korea's second man, Jang Seok Joo.

314
00:26:44,043 --> 00:26:48,913
It's quite pitiful that you have to put your life on the line again for a guy like that.

315
00:26:48,913 --> 00:26:50,543
But then you see,

316
00:26:50,543 --> 00:26:54,613
Jang Seok Joo notified me saying he's going to take you out of this plan.

317
00:26:57,013 --> 00:27:00,023
What did you say? What does that mean?

318
00:27:00,023 --> 00:27:02,793
I didn't believe it either, at first.

319
00:27:02,793 --> 00:27:05,973
Does it mean he's giving it all up?

320
00:27:05,973 --> 00:27:07,793
It wasn't.

321
00:27:09,843 --> 00:27:14,803
The mission is still going on ... just without you.

322
00:27:14,803 --> 00:27:17,743
What do you mean by leaving me out?!

323
00:27:17,743 --> 00:27:21,173
Do you know? Because of you alone,

324
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:25,133
everything I fought for became nothing in a single moment.

325
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:29,273
And I had to escape the throes of death numerous times

326
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:32,123
while moving from one concentration camp to another.

327
00:27:32,863 --> 00:27:34,933
However, I endured it.

328
00:27:34,933 --> 00:27:40,483
If I just stayed alive and did not die, an opportunity would come.

329
00:27:40,483 --> 00:27:44,093
An opportunity to get revenge on the bastard Park Hoon.

330
00:27:53,293 --> 00:27:55,303
And just in time,

331
00:27:56,433 --> 00:27:58,843
that moment has come.

332
00:28:20,593 --> 00:28:22,433
Goodbye.

333
00:28:54,163 --> 00:28:57,183
I never thought I'd meet you again like this.

334
00:29:17,893 --> 00:29:21,373
Are you crazy? What are you doing in broad daylight?

335
00:29:21,373 --> 00:29:23,263
Han Seung Hee.

336
00:29:23,263 --> 00:29:27,673
No, it was Song Jae Hee's demand.

337
00:29:30,713 --> 00:29:34,133
Listen carefully to what I say from now on. Song Jae Hee,

338
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:37,323
with the condition to  leave you out of this plan,

339
00:29:37,323 --> 00:29:39,423
has demanded that you and your mother be safe.

340
00:29:39,423 --> 00:29:42,803
- Then, what about Jae Hee?
- She will join Han Jae Joon's team.

341
00:29:44,503 --> 00:29:48,073
That can't be. She said she would do it with me.

342
00:29:51,003 --> 00:29:53,233
Confirm it yourself.

343
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,813
 Jae Hee

344
00:30:03,813 --> 00:30:05,853
 It's me, Hoon.

345
00:30:07,763 --> 00:30:11,603
I'll take care of the surgery team, so you

346
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:16,693
just do as they order you to do. Be patient for a bit.

347
00:30:16,693 --> 00:30:20,543
They will keep your mother safe, too.

348
00:30:23,343 --> 00:30:25,163
You see,

349
00:30:26,393 --> 00:30:29,693
the last one month I was able meet you again

350
00:30:30,403 --> 00:30:33,153
were moments I can never forget.

351
00:30:33,843 --> 00:30:36,763
Especially, that time,

352
00:30:36,763 --> 00:30:40,293
when you hugged me tightly in the staff's room,

353
00:30:40,293 --> 00:30:43,123
I was really happy then.

354
00:30:43,123 --> 00:30:45,873
Even if I didn't tell you,

355
00:30:45,873 --> 00:30:48,123
no matter how much I said I wasn't,

356
00:30:49,743 --> 00:30:52,493
I felt that when you recognized me.

357
00:30:53,993 --> 00:30:59,833
 Hoon, the reason I said I'll do this alone was because of your mother.

358
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:03,403
 If you were in charge of the surgery team and by chance something goes wrong,

359
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:06,323
 no one would be able to look after your mother.

360
00:31:07,153 --> 00:31:10,123
So don't worry about me.

361
00:31:11,093 --> 00:31:13,753
When you meet Mother,

362
00:31:13,753 --> 00:31:15,973
take care of her well.

363
00:31:15,973 --> 00:31:21,183
I'll finish this assignment safely, and I'll be sure to find you.

364
00:31:21,183 --> 00:31:23,943
 I can promise you.

365
00:31:23,943 --> 00:31:25,923
 Hoon.

366
00:31:26,993 --> 00:31:31,063
Until then, you have to be fine.

367
00:31:31,063 --> 00:31:33,143
Definitely.

368
00:31:35,263 --> 00:31:37,543
 I'm sorry, Hoon.

369
00:31:38,693 --> 00:31:40,453
I...

370
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:44,683
won't make things hard for you anymore.

371
00:31:50,123 --> 00:31:57,113

372
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:07,253
I will promise

373
00:32:07,973 --> 00:32:10,703
you and your mother's safety.

374
00:32:12,033 --> 00:32:14,843
How can I believe what you say?

375
00:32:14,843 --> 00:32:17,493
It's your freedom to believe me or not.

376
00:32:17,493 --> 00:32:21,163
But have you ever thought of this?

377
00:32:21,163 --> 00:32:27,763
Where the gunfire which blocked Cha Jin Soo on the bridge in Budapest come from?

378
00:32:39,193 --> 00:32:41,063
 Damn!

379
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,053
And the one who took care of your mother for 20 years.

380
00:32:44,053 --> 00:32:46,483
That's because you were going to threaten me.

381
00:32:46,483 --> 00:32:48,933
I acknowledge a part of it.

382
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:52,133
However, even when you were in North Korea,

383
00:32:52,133 --> 00:32:56,353
do you think I took care of your mother in order to threaten you?

384
00:32:58,023 --> 00:33:02,973
I'm sure it's painful for you because you think that you're leaving Song Jae Hee in a dangerous place.

385
00:33:02,973 --> 00:33:05,903
However that child is not

386
00:33:05,903 --> 00:33:08,103
as weak as you think.

387
00:33:08,103 --> 00:33:13,013
You will become the place that child could come back to after finishing her assignment safely.

388
00:33:13,013 --> 00:33:17,133
That would be a greater strength to Song Jae Hee.

389
00:33:22,543 --> 00:33:24,983
The choice is yours.

390
00:33:24,983 --> 00:33:28,543
Will you follow me or

391
00:33:28,543 --> 00:33:31,663
will you defy the Prime Minister's will

392
00:33:31,663 --> 00:33:36,013
and place yourself, Song Jae Hee, and your mother into danger?

393
00:33:49,133 --> 00:33:57,093
♬  The mornings I wake up without you I feel desolate.  ♬

394
00:33:57,133 --> 00:34:03,333
Hyung, seriously.
♬  I don't like my awkward image smiling without you.  ♬

395
00:34:03,363 --> 00:34:09,063
 The call cannot be connected. After the beep...  
♬  Still even still I am waiting for you.  ♬

396
00:34:09,063 --> 00:34:11,373
Why isn't he picking up his phone again?

397
00:34:11,373 --> 00:34:15,523
♬   Why do you leave me alone this way?   ♬

398
00:34:15,523 --> 00:34:19,063
Hello? Hello?

399
00:34:19,063 --> 00:34:21,463
By any chance, are you looking for me?

400
00:34:22,743 --> 00:34:27,893
Stop frowning on a pretty face like that, and well, what do you think about a dinner part-time together today?

401
00:34:28,993 --> 00:34:31,373
Again, again.

402
00:34:32,643 --> 00:34:33,923
This.

403
00:34:33,923 --> 00:34:38,593
♬  Saying I'm sorry, saying I love you   ♬

404
00:34:38,593 --> 00:34:41,893
♬&nbsp;  I couldn't say anything. Then why &nbsp;♬

405
00:34:41,893 --> 00:34:44,703
Again, again.

406
00:34:47,373 --> 00:34:50,193
When Mom and Dad toiled so much to send you to medical school,

407
00:34:50,193 --> 00:34:53,423
- you're chasing after girls everyday?!
- Hey, what are you doing here?

408
00:34:53,423 --> 00:34:56,483
What do you mean? I told you I was coming to get a check up!

409
00:34:56,483 --> 00:34:59,943
Yeah, a check up. But... how can you

410
00:34:59,943 --> 00:35:02,013
say "you" to your oppa?

411
00:35:03,613 --> 00:35:06,343
What do you mean Oppa? You have to act like an older brother

412
00:35:06,343 --> 00:35:08,843
to be an oppa.

413
00:35:08,843 --> 00:35:10,043
You good for nothing!

414
00:35:10,043 --> 00:35:13,983
Hey, hey. Wear that!

415
00:35:13,983 --> 00:35:15,843
Hey!

416
00:35:25,103 --> 00:35:28,093
You two are getting married?

417
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:31,993
Bong Hyun said there's no need to wait any longer.

418
00:35:31,993 --> 00:35:35,953
I'm sorry when you're busy with so many things.

419
00:35:37,173 --> 00:35:40,523
It's nothing. It's the biggest event of your life.

420
00:35:40,523 --> 00:35:43,973
That can be more important than the surgery team.

421
00:35:47,803 --> 00:35:50,503
Thank you, Chief.

422
00:35:51,363 --> 00:35:53,753
That's why, Chief,

423
00:35:53,753 --> 00:35:56,923
I think I'll be a bit busy from today on.

424
00:35:56,923 --> 00:35:59,723
We have to do a myocardial infarction and septal rupture surgery soon today.

425
00:35:59,723 --> 00:36:03,283
For now, I did ask for another doctor,

426
00:36:04,033 --> 00:36:07,283
but I don't think I'll have time from now on either.

427
00:36:07,283 --> 00:36:10,823
This wedding thing... I realized there are a lot of things to do.

428
00:36:10,823 --> 00:36:13,893
I think you'll be busy even after the wedding

429
00:36:13,893 --> 00:36:17,633
so if it's okay, would it be okay to change the team's anesthesiologist?

430
00:36:18,903 --> 00:36:21,523
I would be thankful if you do that.

431
00:36:21,523 --> 00:36:25,383
If it's not Doctor Eun, then there's only Doctor Han.

432
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:28,503
Will it be okay when she's in Water Bottle's team?

433
00:36:28,503 --> 00:36:30,153
What's wrong with that?

434
00:36:30,153 --> 00:36:33,453
They even took our First and stuff.

435
00:36:34,533 --> 00:36:36,513
Well.

436
00:36:36,513 --> 00:36:38,343
Why don't you speak to her first.

437
00:36:38,343 --> 00:36:40,623
I understand, Chief.

438
00:36:43,653 --> 00:36:47,033
I appointed you to the branch.  Just know that.

439
00:36:47,033 --> 00:36:51,703
I will call you back after Prime Minister's surgery is over so go and wait.

440
00:36:51,703 --> 00:36:55,713
Go and sort out your head and heart.

441
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,653
I will think about it.

442
00:36:57,653 --> 00:37:01,203
What is there to think about? You don't need to think about it. Just go!

443
00:37:01,203 --> 00:37:03,063
Can't you just let me be so I can take care of it on my own?

444
00:37:03,063 --> 00:37:07,793
No! Just do as I tell you to. It's all for your sake!

445
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:20,343
Did you call for me, Chairman?

446
00:37:20,343 --> 00:37:23,013
What kind of a person are you?

447
00:37:23,013 --> 00:37:25,663
How did you treat Soo Hyeon to make her think about other people?

448
00:37:25,663 --> 00:37:28,223
I'm asking why you're letting her fall for a guy like Park Hoon?!

449
00:37:28,223 --> 00:37:29,923
It has nothing to do with Jae Joon.

450
00:37:29,923 --> 00:37:33,103
Why wouldn't he? You two even talked about engagement.

451
00:37:33,103 --> 00:37:36,003
- It's all about the past. 
 - Soo Hyeon,

452
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:39,963
I will take care of her, Chairman.

453
00:37:40,723 --> 00:37:42,473
What are you talking about?

454
00:37:42,473 --> 00:37:43,583
Leave her to me.

455
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:45,703
Jae Joon, I told you clearly already.

456
00:37:45,703 --> 00:37:47,973
Stay still!

457
00:37:47,973 --> 00:37:49,993
What would happen if I leave her to you?

458
00:37:49,993 --> 00:37:52,683
I won't let Soo Hyeon go anywhere.

459
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:56,303
- Please trust in me.
- Don't just say it with words.

460
00:37:56,303 --> 00:37:59,013
You understand what I'm saying, right?

461
00:37:59,623 --> 00:38:01,143
Yes.

462
00:38:02,373 --> 00:38:05,663
I don't want to see you both, so leave.

463
00:38:07,053 --> 00:38:09,263
Hurry!

464
00:38:20,303 --> 00:38:22,553
I told you plainly it's not you.

465
00:38:22,553 --> 00:38:24,543
- I know.
- Then why are you like this?

466
00:38:24,543 --> 00:38:26,593
I will also tell you how I feel clearly, so listen carefully.

467
00:38:26,593 --> 00:38:29,063
- Jae Joon.
- Listen.

468
00:38:33,733 --> 00:38:36,183
Whatever I do in the future,

469
00:38:36,183 --> 00:38:38,473
please forgive me.

470
00:38:39,203 --> 00:38:41,193
What are you saying all of a sudden?

471
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:46,043
And don't forget that I sincerely loved you.

472
00:38:46,043 --> 00:38:48,043
No, you can forget it.

473
00:38:48,043 --> 00:38:50,373
So,

474
00:38:50,373 --> 00:38:53,123
I can acknowledge

475
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:55,383
that you love someone else other than me.

476
00:38:56,313 --> 00:38:58,883
But not ever Park Hoon.

477
00:38:58,883 --> 00:39:00,593
You understand?

478
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:11,073
 Chief, it's the emergency room. There's an emergency patient.

479
00:39:15,963 --> 00:39:17,323
What about the patient's condition?

480
00:39:17,323 --> 00:39:19,463
Myocardial infarction and septal rupture.

481
00:39:19,463 --> 00:39:20,833
What?

482
00:39:20,833 --> 00:39:24,423
He's in the same condition as the patient we will be doing surgery on soon.

483
00:39:29,953 --> 00:39:31,543
Chief.

484
00:39:31,543 --> 00:39:33,813
Move him to the operating room first.

485
00:39:33,813 --> 00:39:35,663
Chief, you have a surgery scheduled.

486
00:39:35,663 --> 00:39:37,293
Someone has to do it.

487
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:40,473
Do a CT scan, ultrasound, and coronary angiography first.

488
00:39:40,473 --> 00:39:42,073
Hurry.

489
00:39:47,253 --> 00:39:49,863
- The last competition?
 -Yes.

490
00:39:49,863 --> 00:39:52,043
What about the patient?

491
00:39:57,673 --> 00:40:00,493
This is a patient with myocardial infarction and septal rupture.

492
00:40:00,493 --> 00:40:02,083
It's the patient

493
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:04,143
you will be operating on in the afternoon.

494
00:40:04,143 --> 00:40:06,753
Another person just came into the emergency room.

495
00:40:06,753 --> 00:40:10,313
- There are two patients with similar symptoms.
 -Yes.

496
00:40:10,313 --> 00:40:12,463
It's a difficult surgery,

497
00:40:12,463 --> 00:40:16,723
but it's the same surgery Park Hoon did when he first came to our hospital.

498
00:40:16,723 --> 00:40:20,203
Doctor Park won't be coming to the hospital for some time.

499
00:40:20,203 --> 00:40:21,603
What do you mean?

500
00:40:21,603 --> 00:40:24,003
I got a call from the Prime Minister's office yesterday.

501
00:40:24,003 --> 00:40:27,113
Telling me that Doctor Park won't be coming to the hospital for some time.

502
00:40:27,113 --> 00:40:30,093
- From the Prime Minister?
- Yes.

503
00:40:31,143 --> 00:40:34,033
He said that he wishes that we hurry up and finish the competition.

504
00:40:34,033 --> 00:40:38,763
You're saying the Prime Minister's office called you directly, right?

505
00:40:38,763 --> 00:40:42,313
He said that he'll contact you soon too.

506
00:40:44,933 --> 00:40:47,353
There's no one else except Park Hoon

507
00:40:47,353 --> 00:40:49,923
on Doctor Moon's team who can do this surgery.

508
00:40:50,943 --> 00:40:55,853
If we do that, there's a possibility that the patient could die.

509
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:59,613
I think the priority is to decide the winner, Chairman.

510
00:41:00,403 --> 00:41:03,443
It seems you're finally working now.

511
00:41:16,053 --> 00:41:18,373
 Chairman

512
00:41:18,373 --> 00:41:20,293
Yes, Chairman.

513
00:41:20,293 --> 00:41:24,263
What? I will go soon.

514
00:41:28,523 --> 00:41:30,043
A last competition?

515
00:41:30,043 --> 00:41:34,273
Yeah. We have to finish deciding the surgery team.

516
00:41:34,273 --> 00:41:36,493
We have to. When shall we do it?

517
00:41:36,493 --> 00:41:37,853
- Today.
- Today?

518
00:41:37,853 --> 00:41:41,303
Yeah. It's this patient.

519
00:41:44,623 --> 00:41:47,353
This is the patient with myocardial infarction and septal rupture.

520
00:41:47,353 --> 00:41:50,213
- Why?
- Truthfully,

521
00:41:50,213 --> 00:41:54,393
it's the same case as the fist patient Park Hoon did the surgery

522
00:41:54,393 --> 00:41:56,333
on when he first came to our hospital, Chairman.

523
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:58,413
So?

524
00:41:58,413 --> 00:42:01,873
It would be fine with us but would Chief Han be fine with it?

525
00:42:01,873 --> 00:42:04,903
Oh. Chief Han said he'll do it too.

526
00:42:04,903 --> 00:42:06,463
I see...

527
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:09,273
As you can see, it's an emergency.  Hurry.

528
00:42:09,273 --> 00:42:10,883
I understand, Chairman.

529
00:42:10,883 --> 00:42:12,893
And also,

530
00:42:12,893 --> 00:42:16,123
on this past human resources board, your suspension of practicing as a physician

531
00:42:16,123 --> 00:42:18,083
is no longer effective.

532
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:20,693
It's okay even if you keep the suspension longer...

533
00:42:20,693 --> 00:42:23,993
No, no.  A doctor is a doctor only if he treats patients. Don't you think?

534
00:42:23,993 --> 00:42:27,263
While I was suspended, a thought came to my head, Chairman.

535
00:42:27,263 --> 00:42:31,133
I'm really a doctor carrying out an independence movement.

536
00:42:31,133 --> 00:42:35,193
You know, like Doctors Yoon Bong Gil and Ahn Joong Geun ( famous independent movement doctors during Japanese colonization).

537
00:42:35,193 --> 00:42:37,903
I'm joking. Yes!

538
00:42:55,443 --> 00:42:58,963
That surgery, Park Hoon will win even if he does it with one hand.

539
00:42:58,963 --> 00:43:02,313
We won.  Aja!

540
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:06,393
- That's great news.
- Hurry up and call Park Hoon

541
00:43:06,393 --> 00:43:08,923
and tell him to go straight to the operating room.

542
00:43:10,903 --> 00:43:15,533
Oh, and this time, check the bone saw properly.

543
00:43:16,583 --> 00:43:18,713
I understand.

544
00:43:22,063 --> 00:43:24,683
  The phone you are calling is off, leave a message ...

545
00:43:24,683 --> 00:43:26,173
He is not answering.

546
00:43:26,173 --> 00:43:29,463
Why? Call him again.

547
00:43:31,293 --> 00:43:32,993
 The phone you are calling is off, leave a message ...

548
00:43:32,993 --> 00:43:35,673
He's not answering. It says that it can't connect to him.

549
00:43:35,673 --> 00:43:39,703
What the heck. Is he screening his calls?

550
00:44:00,003 --> 00:44:02,083
 Master

551
00:44:38,053 --> 00:44:40,913
Hey! Long time no see.

552
00:44:40,913 --> 00:44:42,523
Do you perhaps know where Park Hoon is?

553
00:44:42,523 --> 00:44:43,643
He's not in the hospital?

554
00:44:43,643 --> 00:44:45,733
I'm looking for him because he's not here.

555
00:44:45,733 --> 00:44:49,463
I thought he was in the hospital because I couldn't get in contact with him since yesterday.

556
00:44:49,463 --> 00:44:52,123
Do you not know of any place he would go to?

557
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:53,583
I don't know.

558
00:44:53,583 --> 00:44:55,923
He's not even answering his phone, and hasn't come to work either...

559
00:44:55,923 --> 00:44:58,073
Where in the world is he?

560
00:44:58,073 --> 00:45:00,703
There isn't even an hour left until the surgery.

561
00:45:00,703 --> 00:45:02,463
I'm going crazy.

562
00:45:05,943 --> 00:45:07,213
Doctor Han,

563
00:45:07,213 --> 00:45:09,583
do you per chance know where Park Hoon is?

564
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:11,633
- You can't get in contact with him?
- Yes.

565
00:45:11,633 --> 00:45:14,623
She said that she couldn't get in contact with him since yesterday.

566
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:16,963
Have you by chance seen him in the hospital?

567
00:45:17,823 --> 00:45:19,233
I haven't seen him either.

568
00:45:19,233 --> 00:45:21,483
You really haven't seen him?

569
00:45:22,233 --> 00:45:23,613
Yes.

570
00:45:28,303 --> 00:45:31,263
Where is Hyung? You know right?

571
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:33,233
You do, right?

572
00:45:34,693 --> 00:45:36,873
Answer me!

573
00:45:47,243 --> 00:45:48,823
I don't know where Hoon is either.

574
00:45:48,823 --> 00:45:51,113
Who will know if you don't?

575
00:45:51,113 --> 00:45:55,733
Do you think the man who was with you took Hyung and did something to him?

576
00:45:55,733 --> 00:45:59,013
Hoon will be fine so don't worry.

577
00:45:59,013 --> 00:46:01,383
How can I not worry?

578
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:05,733
I don't what you are planning, but if something happens to Hyung

579
00:46:05,733 --> 00:46:08,893
I won't stay still. I will report right away!

580
00:46:08,893 --> 00:46:11,063
Chang Yi.

581
00:46:11,063 --> 00:46:14,433
I know with what feelings you are worrying about Hoon.

582
00:46:14,433 --> 00:46:17,363
But that feeling... I may have more,

583
00:46:17,363 --> 00:46:19,503
but it's definitely not less.

584
00:46:20,973 --> 00:46:25,403
I'm always thankful for your heart.

585
00:46:25,403 --> 00:46:28,313
But, don't do anything right now.

586
00:46:28,313 --> 00:46:33,513
That'll be good for your sake and also Hoon's sake.

587
00:46:39,023 --> 00:46:41,333
Doctor, aren't you going into surgery?

588
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:43,193
- Surgery?
- Yes.

589
00:46:43,193 --> 00:46:46,603
They said they're doing the final competition again, so even Nurse Min went to the operating room earlier.

590
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:48,963
Then did Doctor Park come too?

591
00:46:48,963 --> 00:46:50,973
I don't know about that,

592
00:46:50,973 --> 00:46:55,363
but by looking at Nurse Min hurrying, it seems like it's an urgent patient.

593
00:47:01,943 --> 00:47:05,623
Ah, where did he really go?

594
00:47:05,623 --> 00:47:08,073
I'm going crazy.

595
00:47:09,573 --> 00:47:11,803
- Professor.
- Yeah, Quack-

596
00:47:11,803 --> 00:47:13,503
I'm sorry. Doctor Oh.

597
00:47:13,503 --> 00:47:15,003
Didn't Doctor Park come?

598
00:47:15,003 --> 00:47:17,503
I'm looking  all over for him because he didn't come.

599
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,263
I heard there is a surgery for an urgent patient.

600
00:47:19,263 --> 00:47:21,193
Yeah, it's the final competition, but this prick...

601
00:47:21,193 --> 00:47:24,003
Where is he that I can't find him?

602
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:33,333
Park Hoon.

603
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:35,223
- Park Hoon!
- Doctor Park!

604
00:47:35,223 --> 00:47:37,643
Doctor Park!

605
00:47:37,643 --> 00:47:41,343
Park Hoon. Park Hoon!

606
00:47:41,343 --> 00:47:43,213
Doctor Park!

607
00:47:44,083 --> 00:47:47,183
Hey, you bastard, wake up!

608
00:47:47,183 --> 00:47:49,363
Aish, seriously.

609
00:47:50,823 --> 00:47:54,693
Where did he go if he's not even here?

610
00:47:58,833 --> 00:48:02,183
- Did Park Hoon arrive?
- No, but the circumstances here are weird.

611
00:48:02,183 --> 00:48:04,183
What is?

612
00:48:04,183 --> 00:48:07,703
What's more weird than Park Hoon not being there?

613
00:48:12,643 --> 00:48:14,583
But, Chief,

614
00:48:16,353 --> 00:48:20,593
who is going to be our anesthesiologist when I heard Doctor Eun has a day off today?

615
00:48:20,593 --> 00:48:21,733
She will come soon.

616
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:23,423
Who?

617
00:48:38,483 --> 00:48:41,623
Doctor Han Seung Hee went into Chief Han's room.

618
00:48:53,753 --> 00:48:55,903
If Doctor Park isn't here you should at least do it.

619
00:48:55,903 --> 00:48:57,373
Hey,

620
00:48:57,373 --> 00:49:01,213
Park Hoon is not here, Dr. Han is gone, so who do I trust to do the surgery?

621
00:49:01,213 --> 00:49:04,273
It's an urgent patient. If you don't do it, something bad will happen!

622
00:49:04,273 --> 00:49:08,873
That's right. Something must not happen to the patient. It must not!

623
00:49:10,953 --> 00:49:13,613
That can't happen.

624
00:49:19,473 --> 00:49:22,103
I'll start the anesthetizing.

625
00:49:22,103 --> 00:49:24,283
We're counting on you.

626
00:49:26,013 --> 00:49:30,753
Doctor Han, how do you know Prime Minister Jan Seok Joo?

627
00:49:34,923 --> 00:49:36,463
What are you talking about?

628
00:49:36,463 --> 00:49:40,533
It seems like Prime Minister Jang knows you very well.

629
00:49:40,533 --> 00:49:42,393
Really?

630
00:49:44,183 --> 00:49:46,153
Do you really not know?

631
00:49:46,153 --> 00:49:47,673
Yes.

632
00:49:47,673 --> 00:49:52,933
But how did you know that Prime Minister Jang knows me very well?

633
00:49:52,933 --> 00:49:55,663
I heard that somehow.

634
00:49:55,663 --> 00:49:57,713
Somehow?

635
00:49:59,003 --> 00:50:01,833
I'm curious all of a sudden.

636
00:50:03,163 --> 00:50:05,923
Please tell me that later.

637
00:50:05,923 --> 00:50:08,213
Because I need to get the medicine.

638
00:50:28,363 --> 00:50:29,603
What about Park Hoon?

639
00:50:29,603 --> 00:50:31,243
Not here.

640
00:50:35,493 --> 00:50:38,763
Fine. I'll perform the surgery.

641
00:50:54,913 --> 00:50:57,913
Dr. Han, is it really okay to do this?

642
00:50:57,913 --> 00:50:58,963
About what?

643
00:50:58,963 --> 00:51:01,163
You're the anesthesiologist for Doctor Park's team.

644
00:51:01,163 --> 00:51:02,943
I was.

645
00:51:02,943 --> 00:51:05,033
I really can't understand.

646
00:51:05,903 --> 00:51:08,133
Are you really Jae Hee?

647
00:51:09,263 --> 00:51:10,963
I'm doing this because I am.

648
00:51:10,963 --> 00:51:12,073
What do you mean?

649
00:51:12,073 --> 00:51:14,153
I am doing this for Dr. Park's sake.

650
00:51:14,153 --> 00:51:15,833
Does that make sense?

651
00:51:15,833 --> 00:51:20,233
If he loses in this surgery competition, the Chairman will kick him out of the hospital.

652
00:51:20,233 --> 00:51:23,363
He has to at least be chosen as the Prime Minister's surgery team to remain at the hospital.

653
00:51:23,363 --> 00:51:25,423
It is his last chance.

654
00:51:26,313 --> 00:51:31,723
Dr. Oh, even if he can't do Prime Minister's surgery or if he gets kicked out from the hospital,

655
00:51:31,723 --> 00:51:34,333
Hoon will come back.

656
00:51:34,333 --> 00:51:36,323
What do you mean by that?

657
00:51:37,313 --> 00:51:39,043
It is just as I have just said.

658
00:51:39,043 --> 00:51:44,403
Hoon will come back to this place where you are.

659
00:51:50,213 --> 00:51:51,613
 Water

660
00:51:55,893 --> 00:51:58,813
Professor Moon will do the surgery?

661
00:51:59,643 --> 00:52:01,173
Yes.

662
00:52:01,173 --> 00:52:03,203
Do your best.

663
00:52:04,693 --> 00:52:08,373
We need your help more than ever since Dr. Park isn't here.

664
00:52:09,163 --> 00:52:11,123
Do you mean...

665
00:52:14,203 --> 00:52:19,173
There absolutely cannot be a table death at the hospital doing the Prime Minister's surgery.

666
00:52:21,403 --> 00:52:22,763
 Water

667
00:52:30,493 --> 00:52:32,223
What about Doctor Park?

668
00:52:32,223 --> 00:52:34,923
Professor Moon will be the point surgeon.

669
00:52:42,693 --> 00:52:44,613
Jung Han.

670
00:52:45,503 --> 00:52:50,393
If something like last time happens again, you'll really have to be prepared at that time.

671
00:52:51,883 --> 00:52:55,523
I am begging you. Don't do anymore shameful things to  Seung Min.

672
00:52:55,523 --> 00:52:59,913
Please don't worry. Because I will do my best.

673
00:53:15,853 --> 00:53:17,453
Scalpel.

674
00:53:23,363 --> 00:53:24,893
Scalpel.

675
00:53:30,513 --> 00:53:32,413
Professor.

676
00:53:34,263 --> 00:53:36,173
Let's begin.

677
00:53:43,893 --> 00:53:45,243
Bovie.

678
00:53:45,243 --> 00:53:46,813
I guess Dr. Han will win.

679
00:53:46,813 --> 00:53:48,323
There's no point in watching.

680
00:53:48,323 --> 00:53:51,983
As expected, Chief Han is the best at our hospital.

681
00:53:57,273 --> 00:54:01,313
 Temperature: 37.2 degrees
Blood Pressure: 105/64
Respiratory Rate: 16

682
00:54:11,233 --> 00:54:15,073
 Temperature: 37.1 degrees
Blood Pressure: 102/62
Respiratory Rate: 15

683
00:54:18,093 --> 00:54:20,503
She's doing very well.

684
00:54:22,583 --> 00:54:26,243
Prepare the epinephrine. Hurry.  
(To maximize the amount of blood flow through the coronary artery)

685
00:54:30,753 --> 00:54:32,653
Please.

686
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:37,923
Please.

687
00:54:39,353 --> 00:54:41,613
Please.

688
00:54:48,383 --> 00:54:50,573
He has come back.

689
00:54:50,573 --> 00:54:52,783
His blood pressure is fine too.

690
00:55:13,083 --> 00:55:16,443
Won't you hold it firmly!? Maintain the blood pressure!

691
00:55:16,443 --> 00:55:18,643
I understand.

692
00:55:18,643 --> 00:55:20,603
Suction.

693
00:55:26,153 --> 00:55:30,033
 Temperature: 37.1 degrees
Blood Pressure: 102/62
Respiratory Rate: 15

694
00:55:31,803 --> 00:55:33,963
Try doing something!

695
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,233
Tsk tsk…

696
00:55:39,233 --> 00:55:42,803
At that rate, he's going to kill a person...

697
00:55:44,963 --> 00:55:48,473
Oh Joon Gyu is probably happy without knowing what's going on...

698
00:55:51,303 --> 00:55:55,253
Not even knowing what will happen if Han Jae Joon wins.

699
00:56:01,533 --> 00:56:05,333
There's nothing more to see.

700
00:56:21,043 --> 00:56:25,143
After Chief Han is finished with his surgery, call him and tell him to go to Room No. 2.

701
00:56:25,143 --> 00:56:26,783
Why?

702
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:29,723
Do you want to release it to the newspaper that a patient died during a surgery?

703
00:56:29,723 --> 00:56:31,133
Then what about the match?

704
00:56:31,133 --> 00:56:35,913
Do you carry your head because it's heavy? Chief Han will be saving both patients.

705
00:56:36,683 --> 00:56:38,233
Yes.

706
00:56:51,233 --> 00:56:52,733
 Temperature: 37.2 degrees
Blood Pressure: 105/64
Respiratory Rate: 16

707
00:56:52,733 --> 00:56:53,843
Stabilize his blood pressure!

708
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:56,293
I could do it.

709
00:56:56,293 --> 00:56:58,903
Then hey, why can't I see this?

710
00:57:02,433 --> 00:57:05,683
It seems Chief Han is finished with his surgery, should I call him?

711
00:57:12,643 --> 00:57:14,473
Professor.

712
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:20,393
Contact him. We have to save the patient.

713
00:57:20,393 --> 00:57:23,863
Contact Chief Han. Hurry!

714
00:57:32,143 --> 00:57:35,363
I understand. I will go there soon.

715
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:48,393
Try doing something, huh?

716
00:57:49,673 --> 00:57:52,493
Why isn't Han Jae Joon coming?

717
00:57:59,223 --> 00:58:03,983
Chief Han!  Quickly come here, quickly!  Hurry.

718
00:58:13,063 --> 00:58:15,093
Doctor Park.

719
00:58:21,203 --> 00:58:23,733
Aigoo, what is all this, Master?

720
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:25,383
Park Hoon.

721
00:58:35,163 --> 00:58:38,273
Let's change players.
