1
00:00:28,246 --> 00:00:33,696
 Episode 4

2
00:00:38,436 --> 00:00:45,506

3
00:01:29,286 --> 00:01:31,316
Jae Hee.

4
00:01:32,816 --> 00:01:34,266
Why are you so late?

5
00:01:34,266 --> 00:01:36,446
I was looking at Patient Kim Eun Hee.

6
00:01:36,446 --> 00:01:38,256
Here is the coffee you asked for.

7
00:01:38,256 --> 00:01:41,096
Yes. Thank you.

8
00:02:00,096 --> 00:02:02,296
Hyung!

9
00:02:03,106 --> 00:02:05,636
She was definitely Jae Hee.

10
00:02:08,616 --> 00:02:12,246
Try being old. You will die if you run like this.

11
00:02:12,246 --> 00:02:14,686
Seriously.

12
00:02:14,686 --> 00:02:18,486
You made this, right? So you know where Jae Hee is, right?

13
00:02:18,486 --> 00:02:22,416
How can I tell you where she is?

14
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,776
You are trying to pull off a scam! Where is Jae Hee?

15
00:02:24,776 --> 00:02:26,946
Did you really see her?

16
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,156
I told you I saw her.

17
00:02:28,156 --> 00:02:32,256
-Maybe you saw her! You saw a different person! 
-What?

18
00:02:32,256 --> 00:02:36,746
Of course. With a phone call, I can get her contact information.

19
00:02:36,746 --> 00:02:40,176
So why would I have not found her yet?

20
00:02:47,316 --> 00:02:49,866
Were you able to get some money?

21
00:02:50,756 --> 00:02:54,506
- Not yet.
- At least prepare the advance.

22
00:02:54,506 --> 00:02:59,376
The Chinese are saying that she's at some special concentration camp.

23
00:02:59,376 --> 00:03:00,796
A special concentration camp?

24
00:03:00,796 --> 00:03:03,906
But it must be a deadly place.

25
00:03:03,906 --> 00:03:07,276
They said it would be good to take her out of there first.

26
00:03:07,276 --> 00:03:08,656
How much?

27
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:11,516
About 50,000 dollars.

28
00:03:20,816 --> 00:03:22,686
You did a good job.

29
00:03:22,686 --> 00:03:24,916
Yes.

30
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:29,386
But that girl....

31
00:03:29,386 --> 00:03:32,026
Isn't she in the North?

32
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:34,846
If you don't mind dying, I'll tell you.

33
00:03:46,616 --> 00:03:50,416
I don't care if I'm going to lose money or not, so get me the deposit as soon as possible.

34
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,436
Yes.

35
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:57,736
How much do you need right now?

36
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:04,736
I heard that it was the money needed to find the girl.

37
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,636
Well, I mean...

38
00:04:07,426 --> 00:04:10,706
I didn't tell him everything, Hyung.

39
00:04:10,706 --> 00:04:15,026
You need money for a girl you love?

40
00:04:15,026 --> 00:04:16,976
Romance is good.

41
00:04:16,976 --> 00:04:21,516
There are a lot of people these days who run away at night due to loan sharks.

42
00:04:21,516 --> 00:04:23,376
I have no business with you, so leave.

43
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:26,026
I like romance. It's pure.

44
00:04:26,026 --> 00:04:27,616
Didn't you hear me say "get out"?

45
00:04:27,616 --> 00:04:29,426
Seriously.

46
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:34,796
₩10,000,000 ($10,000)

47
00:04:34,796 --> 00:04:36,116
Here.

48
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:38,196
₩20,000,000 ($20,000)

49
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:39,636
-Here.
-₩30,000,000 ($30,000)

50
00:04:39,636 --> 00:04:41,116
-Here. 
 -₩40,000,000 ($40,000).

51
00:04:41,116 --> 00:04:42,596
 ₩50,000,000 ($50,000)?

52
00:04:42,596 --> 00:04:44,526
$50,000.

53
00:04:46,126 --> 00:04:48,606
You want it, right? It's simple.

54
00:04:48,606 --> 00:04:52,396
You need to create a surgery team under me.

55
00:04:52,396 --> 00:04:53,436
Surgery team?

56
00:04:53,436 --> 00:04:56,546
A thoracic surgery team to represent Myungwoo University Hospital.

57
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,026
Myungwoo University Hospital?

58
00:04:58,026 --> 00:05:00,036
You don't want to?

59
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:01,976
Hyung!

60
00:05:01,976 --> 00:05:04,706
If you don't want to, don't do it.

61
00:05:07,616 --> 00:05:11,046
Aigo, aigo, aigo...

62
00:05:11,046 --> 00:05:14,136
That's good! Very good!

63
00:05:14,136 --> 00:05:16,616
Are you really mad?

64
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,366
Do I look like I wouldn't be?

65
00:05:18,366 --> 00:05:20,986
I'm the Chief, but I didn't even know that my staff was going to leave my team.

66
00:05:20,986 --> 00:05:23,976
I was going to tell you first, Jae Joon.

67
00:05:23,976 --> 00:05:27,286
Okay. Tell me.

68
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,786
What's your reason for suddenly leaving the thoracic department?

69
00:05:29,786 --> 00:05:32,596
Hey, oh!

70
00:05:32,596 --> 00:05:36,126
Oh. Did I disturb your date?

71
00:05:36,806 --> 00:05:38,956
Let's talk later.

72
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,336
Knocking is a common knowledge.

73
00:05:45,336 --> 00:05:49,396
Do you think this is still your office, Professor?

74
00:05:49,396 --> 00:05:50,516
I heard you need doctors.

75
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,936
I'm going to have a conference right now to discuss the potential recruits.

76
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:53,556
Excuse me.

77
00:05:53,556 --> 00:05:56,216
Can I also recommend one?

78
00:05:56,216 --> 00:05:58,356
This is the next candidate.

79
00:05:58,356 --> 00:06:00,766
He is a candidate from Johns Hopkins University.

80
00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:03,726
Although he is young, his has plenty of clinical experience and in America and Europe,

81
00:06:03,726 --> 00:06:07,306
he has published multiple articles in the Cardiothoracic Surgery Journal.

82
00:06:07,306 --> 00:06:10,926
I understand that you want to hire him because the Thoracic Surgery Department  is in need of surgeons but

83
00:06:10,926 --> 00:06:13,016
the problem is the budget, no?

84
00:06:13,016 --> 00:06:15,916
Chairman said that he will look into it in a positive light.

85
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:20,646
Then, we just have to pick a person that you like. Is there any reason to look further?

86
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:24,746
As the previous chief, can I recommend someone?

87
00:06:24,746 --> 00:06:27,546
-Of course. 
 -Okay.

88
00:06:34,316 --> 00:06:37,906
So ... in the Cardiothoracic Department,

89
00:06:37,906 --> 00:06:43,016
I think the most important thing is to have surgical skills.

90
00:06:43,066 --> 00:06:48,366
Then, let's evaluate now the surgery performed by the doctor whom I'm recommending.

91
00:06:57,016 --> 00:07:00,106
How can there not be any bleeding when you do an incision?

92
00:07:00,106 --> 00:07:02,876
The human body is symmetrical.

93
00:07:02,876 --> 00:07:06,906
If a doctor with enough clinical experience cuts exactly in the middle of the chest,

94
00:07:06,906 --> 00:07:09,156
it is possible.

95
00:07:10,656 --> 00:07:13,666
Not only is he accurate but he is fast.

96
00:07:14,406 --> 00:07:16,436
His skill is almost level A.

97
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,256
I also think the same.

98
00:07:18,256 --> 00:07:20,766
If he has those skills, I would like to work with him also.

99
00:07:20,766 --> 00:07:23,876
So everyone acknowledges his skill, that's it right?

100
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:26,536
I want to see some of his past records.

101
00:07:26,536 --> 00:07:30,186
Why do you need his past records? I brought him in person.

102
00:07:30,186 --> 00:07:33,766
Dr. Park, please come in.

103
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:55,166
Hello, Quack.

104
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:06,276
 9-14th: Hospital Director Oh Joon Gyu
15th: Hospital Director Choi Byeong Cheol

105
00:08:06,276 --> 00:08:08,576
Director Choi!

106
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,366
This person.

107
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,576
How long has it been?

108
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,056
I think it's been about 6 months, Chairman.

109
00:08:16,056 --> 00:08:18,216
First, sit down.

110
00:08:20,476 --> 00:08:24,396
I know it's right before your retirement, but is it okay to be on a leave for that long?

111
00:08:24,396 --> 00:08:28,196
What have you been doing secretly?

112
00:08:28,196 --> 00:08:32,056
I was organizing my life...

113
00:08:32,056 --> 00:08:34,816
You're speaking nonsense since you still have a lot of time.

114
00:08:34,816 --> 00:08:37,206
More than that, Chairman,

115
00:08:37,856 --> 00:08:40,546
I heard that you were recruiting doctors.

116
00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:43,866
Why? There is someone you want to recommend?

117
00:08:43,866 --> 00:08:48,856
I warned you not to show up here again.

118
00:08:48,856 --> 00:08:51,716
Well, my circumstances became like this.

119
00:08:51,716 --> 00:08:55,976
Excuse me, if it won't be rude, can I ask you what college you graduated from?

120
00:08:55,976 --> 00:08:58,526
If you're a police officer, you just have to catch criminals well.

121
00:08:58,526 --> 00:09:00,516
If you're a doctor, isn't it enough that you can treat people well?

122
00:09:00,516 --> 00:09:03,036
Why is it so important to know which university he graduated from?

123
00:09:03,036 --> 00:09:06,506
Judging someone by their college degree in the 21st century,

124
00:09:06,516 --> 00:09:10,146
it's a bad habit that has to disappear, a bad habit! Don't you think so?

125
00:09:10,146 --> 00:09:12,516
I'm not saying I'm going to judge based on where he graduated from.

126
00:09:12,516 --> 00:09:16,146
We should know at least where he studied if we are going to work together.

127
00:09:16,146 --> 00:09:20,336
Okay. Tell him. Tell him. Seriously!

128
00:09:28,476 --> 00:09:30,146
I'm Pyongyang Medical School's graduate.

129
00:09:30,146 --> 00:09:32,976
Yeah. Pyongyang Medical School.

130
00:09:32,976 --> 00:09:35,166
Pyongyang?

131
00:09:37,096 --> 00:09:39,516
North Korea, Pyongyang?

132
00:09:52,196 --> 00:09:55,616
A North Korean? Does that make sense?

133
00:09:55,616 --> 00:09:57,966
He's from North Korea?

134
00:10:00,716 --> 00:10:03,206
Should we leave too?

135
00:10:03,206 --> 00:10:05,466
Chief Han,

136
00:10:06,686 --> 00:10:10,186
even though he's from North Korea, a doctor is a doctor, don't you think?

137
00:10:10,186 --> 00:10:13,786
Professor Moon, who were we going to operate on with him on the team?

138
00:10:13,786 --> 00:10:16,456
Of course, the Prime Minister--

139
00:10:18,906 --> 00:10:20,566
Our nation's Prime Minister

140
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:24,516
would love that a defector is in charge of his heart.

141
00:10:24,516 --> 00:10:26,116
Is that right?

142
00:10:40,676 --> 00:10:43,816
A defector?

143
00:10:43,816 --> 00:10:48,046
What kind of patient will want treatment from a defector?

144
00:10:50,536 --> 00:10:53,536
Seriously.

145
00:10:56,896 --> 00:10:59,076
Money...Money. Money.

146
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,506
My money.

147
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,656
It is correct.

148
00:11:04,656 --> 00:11:06,906
I knew something was strange.

149
00:11:06,906 --> 00:11:10,356
A doctor at a crappy place like that.

150
00:11:10,356 --> 00:11:11,946
Did you want this so much?

151
00:11:11,946 --> 00:11:14,246
Why did you hide that you were a defector?

152
00:11:14,246 --> 00:11:15,176
Am I eliminated?

153
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:17,806
Even if everyone accepts you, I won't.

154
00:11:17,806 --> 00:11:21,526
I hate the Communist Party the most.

155
00:11:21,526 --> 00:11:25,836
Here, here. Take this and leave.

156
00:11:25,836 --> 00:11:29,066
Think of this as the gasoline price for coming back and forth.

157
00:11:36,956 --> 00:11:39,456
You're even picking that up.

158
00:11:40,186 --> 00:11:44,126
You're looking for your girlfriend when you escaped here alone?

159
00:11:44,126 --> 00:11:48,546
You're just trash, crazy for money.

160
00:11:48,546 --> 00:11:51,936
For money, you'd give your liver, gallbladder, everyth--

161
00:11:51,936 --> 00:11:54,196
That's right, I'm crazy for money.

162
00:11:54,196 --> 00:11:56,416
I need money.

163
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,456
For this, not just my liver, or gallbladder, but I can give up my whole body.  Why?

164
00:11:59,456 --> 00:12:01,156
I can't?

165
00:12:01,156 --> 00:12:03,756
What's wrong with that?

166
00:12:11,936 --> 00:12:14,666
If you want to make some money, do a business.

167
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:18,426
Don't you have pride as a doctor?

168
00:12:18,426 --> 00:12:20,626
Pride?

169
00:12:20,626 --> 00:12:22,796
That must be important to a quack?

170
00:12:22,796 --> 00:12:24,346
What?

171
00:12:26,456 --> 00:12:30,126
You don't get pride from just wearing this.

172
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:32,586
Do you understand, quack?

173
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,956
Have you said everything?

174
00:12:36,276 --> 00:12:38,406
Hey!

175
00:12:38,406 --> 00:12:40,256
HEY!

176
00:13:06,436 --> 00:13:09,306
Ta-da! A present for getting a job!

177
00:13:12,496 --> 00:13:15,836
Forget about it. Wear them yourself.

178
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:38,256
Did you get the job? How did it go?

179
00:13:38,256 --> 00:13:41,796
What do you mean how did it go? It was shi**y.

180
00:13:44,526 --> 00:13:46,786
Here. Okay?

181
00:13:59,276 --> 00:14:00,686
Who are you!?

182
00:14:00,686 --> 00:14:03,156
It's me, Professor Moon.

183
00:14:04,686 --> 00:14:06,326
I am sorry, Chairman.

184
00:14:06,326 --> 00:14:08,246
I didn't know it was you.

185
00:14:08,246 --> 00:14:10,376
Why don't you come up to my office?

186
00:14:12,766 --> 00:14:14,906
You want to use Park Hoon?

187
00:14:14,906 --> 00:14:18,356
His skills are good enough.

188
00:14:20,446 --> 00:14:23,086
Is there a spot in your team?

189
00:14:23,086 --> 00:14:27,326
He'll probably have a lot.

190
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:34,546
It's a team who'll perform the surgery on Prime Minister Jang Seok Joo.

191
00:14:34,546 --> 00:14:36,556
How can we put in a defector?

192
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:39,786
Then, how about Professor Moon taking him?

193
00:14:39,786 --> 00:14:41,316
I heard you even recommended him?

194
00:14:41,316 --> 00:14:43,416
Chairman, that is ...

195
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,616
I did that then, but not anymore.

196
00:14:45,616 --> 00:14:47,846
Then two teams,

197
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:50,566
whatever you do, a competition is good for each other.

198
00:14:50,566 --> 00:14:51,776
A competition?

199
00:14:51,776 --> 00:14:54,226
It's a competition against Professor Moon's team and Chief Han's team.

200
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,976
To pick who will represent Myeongwoo University Hospital's thoracic surgery team.

201
00:14:56,976 --> 00:14:58,146
Chairman,

202
00:14:58,146 --> 00:15:00,386
I want to be taken out of this competition.

203
00:15:00,386 --> 00:15:06,406
You will be evaluated simply  by getting a plus if you succeed a surgery, and minus if you fail. What do you think?

204
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,826
Chairman.

205
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:11,536
Since we're doing this, you will get a prize for winning.

206
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:14,166
Instead if you lose,

207
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,706
you should receive punishment as well.

208
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:33,356
Do you think you can be my rival?

209
00:15:42,016 --> 00:15:45,196
Hey, Hyung Wook!

210
00:15:45,196 --> 00:15:47,296
Hyungnim!

211
00:15:48,826 --> 00:15:50,766
What is this?

212
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:53,856
Why are you here?

213
00:15:53,856 --> 00:15:54,876
You're the same as usual.

214
00:15:54,876 --> 00:15:57,666
Yes.

215
00:16:02,576 --> 00:16:03,866
Take care of her.

216
00:16:03,866 --> 00:16:05,996
Should I move her to your clinic?

217
00:16:05,996 --> 00:16:08,466
Leave her here. I asked the owner to give me back my deposit for the clinic.

218
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:10,366
What?

219
00:16:16,206 --> 00:16:20,026
You should at least have that to make money and bring Unnie.

220
00:16:20,026 --> 00:16:22,846
No. I invested in that too.

221
00:16:22,846 --> 00:16:24,946
No, you can't.

222
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,186
I am sorry.

223
00:16:29,186 --> 00:16:31,466
But, I'm in a hurry.

224
00:16:51,376 --> 00:16:53,396
What is the reason for changing your mind suddenly?

225
00:16:53,396 --> 00:16:54,616
That.

226
00:16:54,616 --> 00:16:59,016
 What? Prime Minister Jang Seok Joo owes Park Hoon?

227
00:16:59,016 --> 00:17:01,616
 You know that I was Prime Minister Jang's personal doctor, right?

228
00:17:01,616 --> 00:17:02,906
 I know that.

229
00:17:02,906 --> 00:17:06,846
 So, believe in me and work with him.

230
00:17:08,006 --> 00:17:10,106
There is no reason.

231
00:17:10,106 --> 00:17:14,376
Just... me, Moon Hyung Wook's ocean-sized heart.

232
00:17:16,126 --> 00:17:18,736
If you don't want it, then don't.

233
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:26,046
Instead, you have to serve me like I'm your master.

234
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,016
Master?

235
00:17:27,016 --> 00:17:30,096
Okay. Just like that.

236
00:17:33,126 --> 00:17:34,426
Let's be clear.

237
00:17:34,426 --> 00:17:37,276
It's not you, but I will be serving this as a master.

238
00:17:37,276 --> 00:17:41,016
Ay, your words are too much. That's my money.

239
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:44,436
Yes, I will serve you, Master. What should I do now?

240
00:17:44,436 --> 00:17:46,016
Prepare for war.

241
00:17:46,016 --> 00:17:48,516
With Han Jae Joon,

242
00:17:48,516 --> 00:17:50,646
you will do a competition.

243
00:17:50,646 --> 00:17:53,626
From now on.

244
00:17:53,626 --> 00:17:55,496
Okay, tonight.

245
00:17:55,496 --> 00:17:59,506
Call all the third year residents and above, staff and doctors.

246
00:17:59,506 --> 00:18:02,726
How about Dr. Yang?

247
00:18:03,956 --> 00:18:06,446
Never mind him.

248
00:18:06,446 --> 00:18:10,316
Dr. Yang is busy now.

249
00:18:12,086 --> 00:18:14,346
Forget about the past.

250
00:18:14,346 --> 00:18:17,276
Let's do well. Okay?

251
00:18:17,276 --> 00:18:22,096
Hey, Doctor Park! Greet our team's-

252
00:18:22,096 --> 00:18:26,316
This person, I told him to stay right here. Where did he go?

253
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:42,776
Hey, are you crazy?

254
00:18:42,776 --> 00:18:45,236
If you can prove that you took Jae Hee out of the 6th Concentration Camp, I'll give these to you.

255
00:18:45,236 --> 00:18:47,806
I need to give them the money to take her out!

256
00:18:47,806 --> 00:18:50,776
Take her out and give me the evidence, or I give you nothing.

257
00:18:50,776 --> 00:18:54,486
Aigoo. You are really-

258
00:18:55,776 --> 00:18:59,496
Don't think about scamming me. It's ₩50,000,000 ($50,000).

259
00:18:59,496 --> 00:19:03,426
Gosh, you annoying jerk.

260
00:19:11,516 --> 00:19:14,286
What happened?

261
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:18,646
Last month, she was hospitalized in my hospital...

262
00:19:18,646 --> 00:19:22,046
At first, I doubted.

263
00:19:23,326 --> 00:19:25,966
Does Soo Hyun know?

264
00:19:29,156 --> 00:19:32,156
The patient Kim Il Do in room 301, did his lab results come out?

265
00:19:32,156 --> 00:19:33,816
They said it will come out tomorrow.

266
00:19:33,816 --> 00:19:35,846
Tell them to do it quickly.

267
00:19:35,846 --> 00:19:38,916
Hey, are you here, Quack?

268
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,756
What are you doing here?

269
00:19:40,756 --> 00:19:43,306
What do you mean, Quack? I'm learning how to read charts.

270
00:19:43,306 --> 00:19:44,976
I'm asking why you're doing that.

271
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:46,546
I'm working here starting today, Quack.

272
00:19:46,546 --> 00:19:47,666
With whose permission?

273
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,536
The boss of this place, Quack.

274
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:53,856
Pick up the phone.

275
00:19:53,856 --> 00:19:54,956
Yes, this is the Cardiothoracic Department, Oh Soo Hyeon--

276
00:19:54,956 --> 00:19:57,946
You did well, Quack.

277
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:07,536
Why, Quack?

278
00:20:07,536 --> 00:20:10,146
Is your hand itchy?

279
00:20:11,346 --> 00:20:13,026
No.

280
00:20:13,026 --> 00:20:15,576
-My foot is itchy.
-What?

281
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:30,856
That...

282
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:33,356
What should I do?

283
00:20:35,226 --> 00:20:36,926
The tumor which started from the lungs

284
00:20:36,926 --> 00:20:41,426
has spread into the left atrial artery, pulmonary artery, and has even into the descending aorta.

285
00:20:41,426 --> 00:20:45,456
Because of that, there is a high probability for excessive bleeding during surgery.

286
00:20:45,456 --> 00:20:47,186
The pain must be severe.

287
00:20:47,186 --> 00:20:51,196
We're treating her with Oxycodone, but it's probably hard to bear.

288
00:20:51,196 --> 00:20:53,546
What about surgery?

289
00:20:53,546 --> 00:20:57,526
It's to hard to say the probability of success itself.

290
00:21:00,086 --> 00:21:02,636
He's uncontrollable, that man.

291
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,416
There are a lot of great doctors, other than him.

292
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,706
Think about it again.

293
00:21:07,706 --> 00:21:09,566
It has already been decided.

294
00:21:09,566 --> 00:21:11,566
But...

295
00:21:11,566 --> 00:21:13,496
 Board Chairman

296
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:19,716
I'm here, Father.

297
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:24,026
Doctor Oh was here.

298
00:21:24,026 --> 00:21:26,306
Let go of me since I'm busy.

299
00:21:26,306 --> 00:21:29,716
No matter how busy you are, you have to accept my gift.

300
00:21:48,776 --> 00:21:50,456
Do you like it?

301
00:21:52,776 --> 00:21:56,796
She's in the late stage of lung cancer. She will live no longer than one week.

302
00:21:58,176 --> 00:22:00,686
Why aren't you talking?

303
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:03,026
Is it that touching?

304
00:22:04,186 --> 00:22:05,356
Is it just this?

305
00:22:05,356 --> 00:22:07,256
Just?

306
00:22:07,256 --> 00:22:10,606
She's your biological mother. She's your real mother who only has one week to live.

307
00:22:10,606 --> 00:22:12,466
So what?

308
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,186
Did you expect me to cry?

309
00:22:17,186 --> 00:22:18,476
She's your mother!

310
00:22:18,476 --> 00:22:22,446
My mother ... she's probably done with her round of golf

311
00:22:22,446 --> 00:22:23,876
and is in a sauna.

312
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:25,676
She's my mother!

313
00:22:25,676 --> 00:22:28,266
I'm really sorry, Director.

314
00:22:28,266 --> 00:22:31,346
You must have suffered from bringing this woman here.

315
00:22:31,346 --> 00:22:33,726
This woman?

316
00:22:51,736 --> 00:22:55,536
The patient in 1120, Kim Eun Hee, when was she transferred?

317
00:22:55,536 --> 00:22:57,066
Today in the morning.

318
00:22:57,066 --> 00:22:59,426
Do you know that patient's guardian?

319
00:22:59,426 --> 00:23:01,506
Why are you asking me?

320
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:03,856
She's a DNR patient.
(Do Not Resuscitate = no 'heroic' measures to save her life.)

321
00:23:03,856 --> 00:23:04,906
DNR?

322
00:23:04,906 --> 00:23:07,886
If she has a heart attack at this rate, we can't even perform the CPR.

323
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:11,746
Then we let her die without even doing anything?

324
00:23:11,746 --> 00:23:13,506
That's why we do the DNR.

325
00:23:13,506 --> 00:23:16,046
Does that make any sense?

326
00:23:16,066 --> 00:23:18,266
I took a look, and it's been a while since this was signed. If we look for her guardian...

327
00:23:18,306 --> 00:23:20,446
Stop doing unnecessary work.

328
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:32,316
 Kim Eun Hee

329
00:23:49,616 --> 00:23:53,106
Is this patient conscious at all?

330
00:23:53,106 --> 00:23:54,906
She wakes up a little once in a while.

331
00:23:54,906 --> 00:23:56,826
Try waking her up.

332
00:23:56,826 --> 00:23:57,896
Right now?

333
00:23:57,896 --> 00:24:02,096
I have something I want to ask her. Hurry up.

334
00:24:05,146 --> 00:24:09,306
Kim Eun Hee. Kim Eun Hee?

335
00:24:11,026 --> 00:24:12,636
 Teacher!

336
00:24:12,656 --> 00:24:14,236
 Yes?

337
00:24:36,196 --> 00:24:37,746
 Mom!

338
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:43,326
 I graduated from Myeongwoo Medical University. I also got a doctor's license.

339
00:24:43,326 --> 00:24:45,426
 I can make a lot of money now.

340
00:24:45,426 --> 00:24:49,376
 So, I want to live with you.

341
00:24:50,486 --> 00:24:55,316
 Mom, that household is too difficult.

342
00:24:58,056 --> 00:25:01,526
 Hardship is only for a moment. Go in.

343
00:25:25,976 --> 00:25:28,586
Now, we should hear a word from our hyungnim, the chief.

344
00:25:28,586 --> 00:25:31,886
What are you doing here? I thought this was only for third year residents and above.

345
00:25:31,886 --> 00:25:35,586
Then how did you, as an anesthesiologist, come to a Cardiothoracic Department dinner?

346
00:25:35,586 --> 00:25:38,956
I came here because the Chief invited me.

347
00:25:40,536 --> 00:25:42,726
Thank you.

348
00:25:42,726 --> 00:25:46,086
Okay then, we will welcome the Chief. Applause.

349
00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:54,276
If people speak long at occasions like these, people usually talk behind their backs.

350
00:25:55,226 --> 00:25:57,776
Just like Chi Gyu said,

351
00:25:57,776 --> 00:26:00,036
everyone here is my donsaeng, hyung, and noona.

352
00:26:00,036 --> 00:26:03,376
I wish we would live like a family.

353
00:26:06,716 --> 00:26:10,616
-Done.
-Very short and firm! Clap!

354
00:26:10,616 --> 00:26:14,026
-Well, with that,  raise you glasses!  
 -Raise them.

355
00:26:18,946 --> 00:26:20,736
Doctor Oh.

356
00:26:25,866 --> 00:26:27,536
I'm sorry.

357
00:26:28,196 --> 00:26:30,036
For the thoracic surgery department!

358
00:26:30,036 --> 00:26:32,456
To  the Thoracic Clinic!

359
00:26:48,266 --> 00:26:51,666
 Code blue, Cardiothoracic Department, Room 1120. Code blue, Cardiothoracic Department

360
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:56,576
 Room 1120. Code blue, Cardiothoracic Department, Room 1120.

361
00:27:05,446 --> 00:27:07,806
Give me one ampule of Epinephrine. Quickly prepare for defibrillation too.

362
00:27:07,806 --> 00:27:09,816
Doctor, this patient is a DNR patient.

363
00:27:09,816 --> 00:27:11,206
Does that mean we should just sit and watch?

364
00:27:11,206 --> 00:27:14,016
Bring an ampule of Epinephrine. Defibrillator too, quick!

365
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:17,796
Where are you going all of a sudden?

366
00:27:17,796 --> 00:27:19,996
Sorry, I have somewhere I have to go quickly.

367
00:27:19,996 --> 00:27:21,366
Where?

368
00:27:21,366 --> 00:27:24,406
I'm going ahead first. I'm really sorry.

369
00:27:38,216 --> 00:27:40,056
-One more time.
-But Doctor...

370
00:27:40,056 --> 00:27:42,026
Hurry!

371
00:27:49,006 --> 00:27:50,736
One more time.

372
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:12,186
200 joules.

373
00:29:12,806 --> 00:29:14,916
 She's a DNR patient.

374
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,856
Doctor Oh?

375
00:29:44,976 --> 00:29:46,966
Did she die?

376
00:29:48,696 --> 00:29:50,586
Kim Eun Hee?

377
00:29:51,216 --> 00:29:54,096
She's in the intensive care unit.

378
00:29:56,686 --> 00:30:00,856
 Intensive Care Unit

379
00:30:32,756 --> 00:30:34,656
What?

380
00:30:34,656 --> 00:30:37,326
What's wrong again?

381
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,486
Didn't you know she was a DNR patient?

382
00:30:39,486 --> 00:30:40,976
Does that mean I have to sit and watch?

383
00:30:40,976 --> 00:30:43,336
It's something the patient signed saying she wants to die.

384
00:30:43,336 --> 00:30:45,646
It's something she signed a long time ago.

385
00:30:47,006 --> 00:30:49,406
Maybe she wanted to die since then.

386
00:30:49,406 --> 00:30:50,486
What?

387
00:30:50,486 --> 00:30:52,276
Didn't you know?

388
00:30:52,276 --> 00:30:56,666
A late stage lung cancer patient goes through so much pain no matter how many pain killers you give them.

389
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:59,536
That's why she signed asking not to perform the CPR.

390
00:30:59,536 --> 00:31:04,716
But because you, she has to go through that pain again.  Because of you.

391
00:31:06,626 --> 00:31:11,266
What you say is right. But if she had no will to live, then the CPR wouldn't even work.

392
00:31:11,266 --> 00:31:13,356
Will to live?

393
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:18,156
She's barely breathing through the life prolonging equipment.

394
00:31:25,686 --> 00:31:29,186
Aish...

395
00:31:29,876 --> 00:31:33,676
Excuse me, what's the relationship between Patient Kim Eun Hee and the quack?

396
00:31:33,676 --> 00:31:35,606
The quack?

397
00:31:36,706 --> 00:31:38,736
Nevermind...

398
00:31:38,736 --> 00:31:40,606
Do you want to have this?

399
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:44,826
 Han Seung Hee

400
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:57,496
Yes, this is Pyungtaek branch of Myeongwoo University Hospital, Han Seung Hee.

401
00:33:02,016 --> 00:33:04,696
Nurse Hong, I need to go to the Emergency Care Center.

402
00:33:05,646 --> 00:33:07,576
What should I help you with?

403
00:33:07,576 --> 00:33:08,846
Is Doctor Han Seung Hee there?

404
00:33:08,846 --> 00:33:10,996
Doctor Han Seung Hee?

405
00:33:14,186 --> 00:33:16,656
She's not here right now. What is the problem?

406
00:33:16,656 --> 00:33:18,466
It's about the patient, Kim Eun Hee.

407
00:33:18,466 --> 00:33:20,786
 Patient Kim Eun Hee?

408
00:33:20,786 --> 00:33:23,406
-That grandma?
-Do you know her?

409
00:33:23,406 --> 00:33:26,896
Of course, we know her well since she was hospitalized here.

410
00:33:26,896 --> 00:33:31,676
Do you know who made her the bracelet on her wrist?

411
00:33:44,586 --> 00:33:46,816
 Emergency Care Center

412
00:34:02,836 --> 00:34:05,726
Yes, it's made out of leather. It is red.

413
00:34:05,726 --> 00:34:09,026
It's probably not Grandmother's.  She didn't like any kind of accessories, so

414
00:34:09,026 --> 00:34:12,196
she never put on anything.

415
00:34:12,196 --> 00:34:14,376
Then...

416
00:34:14,376 --> 00:34:16,406
Then who is Kim Eun Hee's guardian?

417
00:34:16,406 --> 00:34:17,856
 Guardian?

418
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:22,096
Kim Eun Hee lives alone, so I don't think she has a guardian.

419
00:34:22,096 --> 00:34:24,656
She doesn't have a guardian...

420
00:34:24,656 --> 00:34:29,026
Yes. She was alone since the first time she was hospitalized here.

421
00:34:29,026 --> 00:34:31,706
 Why do you want to know Kim Eun Hee's guardian?

422
00:34:53,996 --> 00:34:58,926
Today, China with its strong military and economy

423
00:34:58,926 --> 00:35:01,936
is growing to be a superpower like the US.

424
00:35:01,936 --> 00:35:04,846
Japan, by amending its constitution,

425
00:35:04,846 --> 00:35:08,446
is widening its military territories.

426
00:35:08,446 --> 00:35:12,256
We can't just keep fighting with the same ethnic group.

427
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:15,576
I heard rumors that the Blue House is secretly

428
00:35:15,576 --> 00:35:18,586
preparing a North-South Korean meeting.

429
00:35:18,586 --> 00:35:20,816
That happened?

430
00:35:20,816 --> 00:35:25,856
If that's so, as a Korean citizen, I must help.

431
00:35:25,856 --> 00:35:29,346
The issue of handing out money that has been brought up at the last election, how's that being handled?

432
00:35:29,346 --> 00:35:31,416
It's my first time hearing about that problem.

433
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:35,956
I heard that the Prosecution was moving quietly.

434
00:35:35,956 --> 00:35:37,106
That happened?

435
00:35:37,106 --> 00:35:43,046
If that happened, without discrimination they have to be investigated.

436
00:35:46,976 --> 00:35:50,586
Please enjoy yourselves more. I have an appointment so I must go.

437
00:35:50,586 --> 00:35:52,766
Please sit.

438
00:36:01,846 --> 00:36:04,206
The Central District Prosecution Office has stopped by.

439
00:36:05,976 --> 00:36:09,896
- What is it about?
- It's regarding the source of the election fund.

440
00:36:11,196 --> 00:36:15,006
Should I have broken up the situation after the election?

441
00:36:16,156 --> 00:36:21,466
After making me a mere prime minister, he's coming out like this?

442
00:36:34,586 --> 00:36:38,186
Do you acknowledge the charge that you sent gold?  I heard you personally sent geographical book.

443
00:36:38,186 --> 00:36:39,636
What's the reason you yourself are moving?

444
00:36:39,636 --> 00:36:41,426
Do you think yourself as the person who should take responsibility for this?

445
00:36:41,426 --> 00:36:43,316
Please say something.

446
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:49,846
I want to say that the Prime Minister has nothing to do with this incident.

447
00:36:49,846 --> 00:36:55,136
I promise this nation that I will do my best to cooperate with the investigation.

448
00:36:55,736 --> 00:36:58,836
 Please say one more word.

449
00:36:58,836 --> 00:37:03,666
  Please give more details!

450
00:37:12,436 --> 00:37:14,396
Are you allowed to do this in the on-call room?

451
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:17,996
It's better to not be able to. You don't want to do it?

452
00:37:17,996 --> 00:37:19,906
No.

453
00:37:27,076 --> 00:37:29,166
What's good!

454
00:37:34,566 --> 00:37:38,126
Geez, Dr. Keum.  You should knock before you come in.

455
00:37:38,126 --> 00:37:41,686
What kind of person are you?

456
00:37:41,686 --> 00:37:43,656
Oh, Doctor Moon, Doctor Moon.

457
00:37:45,976 --> 00:37:48,516
Hey, where's Park Hoon?

458
00:37:49,356 --> 00:37:52,466
You don't know? Aish.

459
00:37:52,466 --> 00:37:55,446
Hurry up.

460
00:37:56,186 --> 00:37:59,706
Are you crazy? Why are you going to do surgery on a patient who's going to die tomorrow?

461
00:37:59,706 --> 00:38:01,976
I didn't say that I will do surgery right away. I was going to do surgery if another emergency situation occurs.

462
00:38:01,976 --> 00:38:05,416
Is Kim Eun Hee, that grandma, your lover?

463
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:08,876
It's crazy to save a DNR patient. You can't!

464
00:38:08,876 --> 00:38:11,036
If I succeed, she can live without the life prolonging equipment.

465
00:38:11,036 --> 00:38:14,836
Are you a god? How can you save a patient in this condition?

466
00:38:14,836 --> 00:38:15,896
I want to save her.

467
00:38:15,896 --> 00:38:17,806
WHY?!

468
00:38:19,836 --> 00:38:21,586
Fine.

469
00:38:21,586 --> 00:38:26,146
I don't know the reason, but in her condition, this patient won't be able to survive a major surgery.

470
00:38:26,146 --> 00:38:27,876
It will be a table death.

471
00:38:27,876 --> 00:38:30,916
I will save her. I need to ask her something.

472
00:38:30,916 --> 00:38:32,596
Ask her what?

473
00:38:32,596 --> 00:38:36,116
I will find a solution no matter what it takes and do the surgery.

474
00:38:42,366 --> 00:38:46,016
Aigoo! That dummy!  Seriously!

475
00:38:52,696 --> 00:38:57,006
You leaving like that yesterday...was it because of this patient?

476
00:39:04,326 --> 00:39:07,356
She's the patient Chairman looked at.

477
00:39:07,356 --> 00:39:08,986
Chairman did?

478
00:39:08,986 --> 00:39:11,736
He asked if we could perform a surgery on her.

479
00:39:12,536 --> 00:39:14,626
What did you say?

480
00:39:16,476 --> 00:39:18,316
You can find out if you look.

481
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:23,096
I said that it's hard to see the success percentage.

482
00:39:23,096 --> 00:39:27,136
But still...can you do it?

483
00:39:28,336 --> 00:39:30,426
You're saying to do something beneficial for Professor Moon?

484
00:39:31,746 --> 00:39:36,286
We are in a battle with Professor Moon's team.

485
00:39:38,516 --> 00:39:41,576
But who is she?

486
00:39:42,586 --> 00:39:44,346
My mom.

487
00:39:45,106 --> 00:39:49,466
This person... is my biological mother.

488
00:40:15,626 --> 00:40:17,936
Scalpel.

489
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:24,466
Bovie. (cuts and seals/cauterizes blood)

490
00:40:30,966 --> 00:40:33,656
Metzen. (metzenbaum scissors)

491
00:40:35,446 --> 00:40:38,396
Incision into the inferior lobe. Suction.

492
00:40:39,286 --> 00:40:41,726
Metzen.

493
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:53,096
Again!

494
00:40:56,196 --> 00:40:58,296
Scalpel.

495
00:40:59,186 --> 00:41:01,516
I want to hear the reason why you brought her here.

496
00:41:01,516 --> 00:41:05,916
She gave birth to you, and at one point, I gave her my heart.

497
00:41:05,916 --> 00:41:08,596
I couldn't ignore her.

498
00:41:08,596 --> 00:41:11,316
There's nothing else we can do for her other than prolonging her life.

499
00:41:12,356 --> 00:41:15,416
I heard she will live a maximum of one week.

500
00:41:15,416 --> 00:41:19,256
I want to protect her till the last moment.

501
00:41:19,256 --> 00:41:23,806
I want to relieve her from pain.

502
00:41:24,766 --> 00:41:28,106
I'm going to stop the life prolonging medical care. Please allow it.

503
00:41:28,106 --> 00:41:29,456
Soo Hyeon.

504
00:41:29,456 --> 00:41:31,906
I will let her go.

505
00:41:50,796 --> 00:41:54,956
 From now on, I'm not your mom anymore.

506
00:41:54,956 --> 00:41:58,896
  The person over there is your dad.

507
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:06,496
  Be alert and do whatever it takes to gain your father's acknowledgement.

508
00:42:06,496 --> 00:42:08,946
  Mom.

509
00:42:08,946 --> 00:42:11,326
  Don't ever cry.

510
00:42:11,326 --> 00:42:13,586
 Understand?

511
00:42:19,026 --> 00:42:20,806
 Go!

512
00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:22,986
  Don't come look for me in the future, and

513
00:42:22,986 --> 00:42:26,026
  don't pretend to know me even if I  come looking for you.

514
00:43:33,456 --> 00:43:36,426
I want to do the surgery.

515
00:43:36,426 --> 00:43:39,016
Because of Soo Hyeon?

516
00:43:40,636 --> 00:43:45,136
I can't give you permission. I don't want to give her any more pain.

517
00:43:45,136 --> 00:43:47,386
Board Chairman.

518
00:43:48,046 --> 00:43:51,186
If the patient dies during surgery, it's an embarrassment for the Cardiothoracic Department.

519
00:43:51,186 --> 00:43:56,486
- But still...
- You have to remember that you're competing with Park Hoon.

520
00:44:23,106 --> 00:44:25,656
One more time.

521
00:45:52,396 --> 00:45:54,936
Mom.

522
00:46:20,976 --> 00:46:24,466
 Myeongwoo University Hospital

523
00:46:27,406 --> 00:46:29,376
 Oh Soo Hyeon

524
00:47:00,396 --> 00:47:04,396
  The number you dialed...

525
00:47:24,586 --> 00:47:28,256
 Please save our Jae Hee.

526
00:47:36,936 --> 00:47:42,576
 - Don't.
- Comrade Park Hoon, my doctor,

527
00:47:44,566 --> 00:47:47,106
 goodbye.

528
00:47:48,226 --> 00:47:51,016
 Jae Hee!

529
00:47:51,016 --> 00:47:54,346
 Jae Hee!

530
00:48:18,286 --> 00:48:22,066
Go. I don't have the strength to fight you.

531
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:24,556
Can she get the surgery?

532
00:48:24,556 --> 00:48:28,916
I asked you if this patient can get the surgery.

533
00:48:28,916 --> 00:48:32,666
I want to do it, but I can't.

534
00:48:32,666 --> 00:48:34,666
What do you mean by that?

535
00:48:34,666 --> 00:48:36,906
The chance of success is too low.

536
00:48:36,906 --> 00:48:39,466
Are you saying there's a chance she will live?

537
00:48:39,466 --> 00:48:43,966
The possibility is too low and as you said, even if she lives, she'll be in worse pain.

538
00:48:43,966 --> 00:48:49,706
I tried to save her because I have something to ask her about.

539
00:48:49,706 --> 00:48:55,086
But I don't think I should. I know I'm trash, (because he's already done so many unspeakable surgeries before)

540
00:48:55,096 --> 00:48:56,896
but I can't do something like this again.

541
00:48:56,896 --> 00:48:58,636
You said she had the will to live.

542
00:48:58,636 --> 00:49:02,176
I was mistaken in my judgement. I'm sorry, Quack.

543
00:49:02,176 --> 00:49:04,566
I don't need your apology.

544
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:07,516
Take responsibility for what you said.

545
00:49:23,486 --> 00:49:26,206
If you do the surgery,

546
00:49:26,976 --> 00:49:30,086
I will give you as much as you need.

547
00:49:30,086 --> 00:49:31,556
I can't.

548
00:49:31,556 --> 00:49:34,036
Please do it.

549
00:49:34,036 --> 00:49:37,066
Who is she, this patient?

550
00:49:40,816 --> 00:49:43,096
My mom.

551
00:49:44,166 --> 00:49:46,236
I...

552
00:49:47,016 --> 00:49:50,386
I have something to say to her.

553
00:49:52,536 --> 00:49:55,336
I am really asking you for a favor.

554
00:49:56,216 --> 00:49:58,376
Please save her.

555
00:50:32,606 --> 00:50:34,146
It's a waste of time.

556
00:50:34,146 --> 00:50:35,386
I will still try.

557
00:50:35,386 --> 00:50:37,136
I clearly warned Chief Han.

558
00:50:37,136 --> 00:50:38,656
Another doctor will perform the surgery.

559
00:50:38,656 --> 00:50:40,956
Another doctor?

560
00:50:50,836 --> 00:50:53,306
Stop the surgery.

561
00:50:54,266 --> 00:50:57,266
I don't know who you are, but the guardian requested the surgery.

562
00:50:57,266 --> 00:50:59,686
I'm a guardian too.

563
00:51:02,096 --> 00:51:04,136
Also,

564
00:51:04,136 --> 00:51:06,866
he's our hospital's chairman.

565
00:51:06,866 --> 00:51:11,326
If you don't stop immediately, I will never let you touch a scalpel.

566
00:51:22,326 --> 00:51:27,336
But what should I do? I already accepted the surgery fee.

567
00:51:58,146 --> 00:52:01,406
Let's only think about saving the patient.

568
00:52:02,476 --> 00:52:04,556
Scalpel.

569
00:52:07,376 --> 00:52:10,416
Chairman, I told them not to perform the surgery.

570
00:52:10,416 --> 00:52:12,936
I  never  told them to perform the surgery.

571
00:52:12,936 --> 00:52:15,436
I'm serious.

572
00:52:24,706 --> 00:52:26,516
Aish.

573
00:53:14,686 --> 00:53:18,266
Surgery Time 7:50 
Current Time 17:58 
Anesthesia Time 8:59

574
00:53:31,306 --> 00:53:35,446
Surgery Time 14:24 
Current Time 24:32 
Anesthesia Time 15:33

575
00:54:02,056 --> 00:54:03,846
Administer Epinephrine. How's the oxygen saturation?

576
00:54:03,846 --> 00:54:05,266
It's dropping from 60.

577
00:54:05,266 --> 00:54:08,416
Please hurry with the Epinephrine. Defibrillator.

578
00:54:10,286 --> 00:54:12,786
20 joules charge.

579
00:54:14,606 --> 00:54:16,856
50 joules charge.

580
00:54:32,266 --> 00:54:34,496
Defibrillator.

581
00:54:34,496 --> 00:54:36,316
50 joules again.

582
00:54:36,316 --> 00:54:39,606
Again.

583
00:55:03,436 --> 00:55:05,796
Why did you stop?

584
00:55:07,216 --> 00:55:09,906
The heart isn't beating yet.

585
00:55:15,326 --> 00:55:17,866
What are you doing?

586
00:55:18,796 --> 00:55:20,886
Everybody, you worked hard.

587
00:55:20,886 --> 00:55:22,406
What are you saying?!

588
00:55:22,406 --> 00:55:24,776
I will finish it up.

589
00:55:28,816 --> 00:55:31,716
It's not done yet.

590
00:55:31,716 --> 00:55:33,926
It's not done yet!

591
00:55:33,926 --> 00:55:34,986
It's done.

592
00:55:34,986 --> 00:55:37,326
It's not yet...yet.

593
00:55:37,326 --> 00:55:39,956
It's not done yet.

594
00:55:43,976 --> 00:55:46,276
I'm sorry.

595
00:55:50,316 --> 00:55:52,356
What are you doing?

596
00:55:52,356 --> 00:55:54,016
Can't you see?

597
00:55:54,016 --> 00:55:56,376
Stop.

598
00:55:57,136 --> 00:55:59,786
- Stop it.
- Move!

599
00:56:03,016 --> 00:56:05,666
I have something to say.

600
00:56:05,666 --> 00:56:09,276
I have something to say to this person...

601
00:56:34,466 --> 00:56:36,776
Why did you do that?

602
00:56:38,806 --> 00:56:42,136
Why did you do that to me?

603
00:56:47,286 --> 00:56:50,116
Why to me?!

604
00:56:56,516 --> 00:57:06,316

605
00:57:25,286 --> 00:57:28,466
2014 May 13th 2 A.M.

606
00:57:28,466 --> 00:57:33,056
During a removal of tumors, the heart rate zeroed. Patient is dead.

607
00:57:34,896 --> 00:57:37,226
- She's not dead yet.
- What are you doing?

608
00:57:37,226 --> 00:57:38,826
Let go!

609
00:57:38,826 --> 00:57:40,726
Stop it!

610
00:57:40,726 --> 00:57:41,936
Let go!

611
00:57:41,936 --> 00:57:43,766
Stop it!

612
00:57:52,526 --> 00:57:55,056
Let go!

613
00:57:55,056 --> 00:57:58,216
Save her.

614
00:57:58,216 --> 00:58:01,776
Save my mom!

615
00:58:02,936 --> 00:58:08,106
I'm sorry.  She passed away.

616
00:58:08,106 --> 00:58:10,466
I'm sorry.

617
00:58:11,996 --> 00:58:17,766
♬  Everything will turn into tears and flow by  ♬

618
00:58:19,216 --> 00:58:25,726
♬  I can't think about anything  ♬

619
00:58:25,726 --> 00:58:31,496
♬  In a day without you  ♬

620
00:58:31,496 --> 00:58:39,506
♬  I've been holding back. Even though the farewell was hard  ♬

621
00:58:39,506 --> 00:58:44,586
♬  I couldn't tell you that I love you  ♬

622
00:58:44,666 --> 00:58:51,266
♬  I'm going to meet you right now. Let's meet again  ♬

623
00:58:51,266 --> 00:58:53,666
♬  When we meet again, we'll be really happy  ♬
