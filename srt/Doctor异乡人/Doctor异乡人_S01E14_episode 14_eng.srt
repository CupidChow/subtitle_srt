1
00:00:35,699 --> 00:00:43,099

2
00:00:46,499 --> 00:00:48,559
 Mom

3
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:52,419
 But Hoon is also your son.

4
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:55,529
 Now I want to forget all things mixed up with you... both you and Hoon.

5
00:00:55,529 --> 00:00:56,819
 Mi Sook!

6
00:00:56,819 --> 00:01:00,809
 Let's never talk again.

7
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:11,169
 Mom 001-1-949-2419-25

8
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,819
 Hello?

9
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:30,829
 Hello?

10
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:34,949
 Hello?

11
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:39,859
 By any chance are you… Hoon?

12
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:46,669
Yes, I am Hoon.

13
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:52,979
 Oh, my goodness! Really, I can't believe it!

14
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,559
 I didn't know you would actually call.

15
00:01:56,559 --> 00:01:59,439
What about my mother?

16
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:06,159
 Your mother left to Korea 20 years ago to get you.

17
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:13,519
 If the phone number had changed, you might not be able to contact her later,

18
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:17,949
 she told me adamantly to keep this phone number…

19
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:20,169
 Oh, what do we do?

20
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:23,969
 What took you so long to call?

21
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:32,829
 Your mom... if by chance you called,

22
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:36,059
 she asked me to surely tell you her words...

23
00:02:36,059 --> 00:02:38,489
 that she's sorry,

24
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:43,849
 that Mom had really been wrong.

25
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:47,509
 Sorry...

26
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:51,339
 Mom was really wrong.

27
00:02:52,619 --> 00:02:54,519
 I...

28
00:02:55,969 --> 00:02:59,919
 didn't know what you were going through.

29
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:04,499
 But don't forget.

30
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:08,899
 More than anyone else in this world,

31
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:12,119
 I love you.

32
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:16,119
 Sorry, my son…

33
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:24,599
 Mom will soon go to find you,

34
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:29,829
 so don't be sick, and you have to stay well.

35
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:34,259
 Whoever your son is, I'm very jealous.

36
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:38,859
 You're going to meet him for sure, so you take care as well.

37
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:54,359
Mom...

38
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:09,789
 Sorry, my son...

39
00:04:18,619 --> 00:04:21,289
Mom...

40
00:04:46,049 --> 00:04:47,299
Hello?

41
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:49,489
 It's me.

42
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:54,359
 So, have you met your mother?

43
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:01,849
What did you do to my mother?

44
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:03,969
 I'm not sure…

45
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:07,449
What in the world did you do to my mom?!

46
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:11,659
Oh, there is nothing that we did.

47
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:14,209
But keep this in mind.

48
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:18,549
We're capable of doing anything.

49
00:05:18,549 --> 00:05:21,039
 Do you have time to be like this?

50
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,779
You should quickly go and see your mother.

51
00:05:24,649 --> 00:05:27,829
Hello… Hello.

52
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:42,509
This is going to be a very tear-jerking reunion of mother and son.

53
00:05:44,809 --> 00:05:49,679
 Episode 14

54
00:06:19,109 --> 00:06:22,669
 Park Hoon has left to that place.

55
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:25,779
All right.  I've got it.

56
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:35,579
We need to go to the lab to draw blood.

57
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:37,389
Let's go.

58
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:58,029
The guardian needs to stay outside.

59
00:06:58,029 --> 00:07:00,589
Can you leave the door open?

60
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:02,319
Yes.

61
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:19,809
Yes.

62
00:07:19,809 --> 00:07:22,069
There is nothing of significance to report.

63
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:24,249
Yes.

64
00:07:24,249 --> 00:07:26,219
Okay.

65
00:07:35,369 --> 00:07:38,069
Where did Patient Lee Mi Sook go?

66
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:40,999
She left a few moments ago.

67
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,619
Did you by chance see a patient holding a teddy bear?

68
00:07:54,619 --> 00:07:57,739
I think she went outside earlier.

69
00:08:29,869 --> 00:08:31,289
Patient Lee Mi Sook wasn't in her room!

70
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:33,519
She went to the lab to draw blood.

71
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:40,359
Excuse me, the patient who just drew blood...the patient who was holding a teddy bear...

72
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:41,989
She left a few moments ago.

73
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:43,509
To where? She wasn't even in her room?

74
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:48,349
That's weird… Even her guardian asked where she was before leaving.

75
00:08:48,349 --> 00:08:50,049
Guardian?

76
00:08:57,449 --> 00:08:59,929
We are searching every corner around the hospital.

77
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:01,779
All right.

78
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:10,119
You cannot go inside.

79
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:12,149
I'm trying to see Dr. Han Seung Hee.

80
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:15,149
Dr. Han is in surgery right now

81
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:19,509
What?

82
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:25,099
Lee Mi Sook disappeared?

83
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:26,189
I'm sorry.

84
00:09:26,189 --> 00:09:29,029
Is saying sorry going to make up for everything?! Those two have to meet

85
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:32,829
so that we can control Park Hoon!

86
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:36,629
Did Park Hoon hide her away?

87
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:38,079
That doesn't seem to be the case.

88
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:42,309
Then, what is it?! Are you saying that a woman who's out of her mind ran away by herself or what?!

89
00:09:42,309 --> 00:09:44,659
Right now we're standing guard at the hospital.

90
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:47,769
When we find her...

91
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:14,299
Prime Minister, it's Park Hoon.

92
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:26,099
What's the matter?

93
00:10:26,099 --> 00:10:30,809
Chang Yi, from now on, listen carefully to what I'm telling you.

94
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:35,439
This person is Hoon's mother.

95
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:41,699
I will tell you the details later so can you take care of her for now?

96
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:44,209
Does Hyung know?

97
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:45,889
If Hoon knows then this person will be in danger.

98
00:10:45,889 --> 00:10:48,159
I think you are more dangerous.

99
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,239
Chang Yi.

100
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:51,449
I know what kind of person you are.

101
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:53,939
I saw you holding a gun and threatening people's lives too.

102
00:10:53,939 --> 00:10:57,729
Those people are trying to use Hoon's mother.

103
00:10:57,729 --> 00:11:02,819
When they find out that Hoon's mother has gone missing, they will be monitoring Hoon  first.

104
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:05,939
What would happen if Hoon meets his mother?

105
00:11:08,109 --> 00:11:13,639
Please. For the sake of both Hoon and Hoon's mother,

106
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,759
you absolutely can't let anyone know about this.

107
00:11:20,489 --> 00:11:24,069
I'm really sorry for involving you in this.

108
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:27,869
However, you know that the only person who is really

109
00:11:27,869 --> 00:11:31,019
trustworthy to Hoon is you.

110
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:39,979
She's nowhere to be found outside.

111
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:43,329
I've been continuously looking inside too but I don't think she's here.

112
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:44,439
Keep on looking for her.

113
00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:45,809
Yes.

114
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:55,839
Park Hoon's mother disappeared?

115
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,359
Well, at this rate,

116
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:02,699
will we even be able to use her at an important moment?

117
00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:07,109
That's why if you had trusted us with it, this wouldn't have happened.

118
00:12:07,109 --> 00:12:09,499
Is it your doing?

119
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:13,939
Why would we...

120
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:22,849
 Don't judge on your own whether my decision was wrong.

121
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:44,019
Park Hoon's mother disappeared. Did you do it?

122
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:46,449
Wasn't Prime Minister Jang's side watching her?

123
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:51,279
The only people who know that punk's mother is here are only Jang Seok Joo's side and us.

124
00:12:53,489 --> 00:12:55,529
Was it you?

125
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:59,679
I was in the middle of surgery. Do you think I had the time to do that?

126
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,029
You have a reason to do it, since she is Park Hoon's mother.

127
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:04,819
Why don't you go inside and search?

128
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:09,259
Sure. I hope it wasn't you who did it.

129
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:14,499
If you did, both you and he will be unable to survive in my hands.

130
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,299
You've worked hard.

131
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,469
Don't keep leaving your position during surgery.

132
00:13:30,469 --> 00:13:34,599
I'm sorry. I will do it for you when you have something urgent next time.

133
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:37,269
You have to. Since it's a give and take.

134
00:13:40,229 --> 00:13:41,999

135
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:47,699

136
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:51,569
 The number that you jus-

137
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:59,069

138
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:02,969
Where does the Prime Minister live?

139
00:14:02,969 --> 00:14:06,699
Well, I've already been paid to bring you somewhere.

140
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:22,809
Hoon.

141
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:29,169
Were you the one who sent the taxi?

142
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:32,649
Your mother is safe.

143
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:41,659
Did you know from the beginning? Did you know from the beginning that my mother was in Korea?

144
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:42,799
Yeah.

145
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,179
Then why didn't you tell me?

146
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:46,689
- I didn't know where she was.
- Does that make sense?

147
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:51,259
That guy, Jang Seok Joo, hid the place your mother was, even to us.

148
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:53,469
He didn't trust me.

149
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:58,929
When you guys are on the same side,

150
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:01,519
when you guys have even met each other in person, what do you mean  he doesn't trust you?!

151
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,609
- Jang Seok Joo was also suspicious of who I was in the beginning!
 - What?

152
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:08,249
Only after he saw that there wasn't a surgery mark on my stomach,

153
00:15:08,249 --> 00:15:11,859
did he believe that I was some other person and not Song Jae Hee.

154
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:16,529
Before I came here, I had surgeries done, a few times.

155
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:22,889
Only after he believed that I was someone who looked like Song Jae Hee, who was trained and brought here to lure you,

156
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:26,669
did he tell me everything without being suspicious of me.

157
00:15:26,669 --> 00:15:29,199
Did you ever think that I would be suspicious of you?

158
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,019
Not even once.

159
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:41,079
I thought that you would recognize me even if my face changed.

160
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:50,609
Your mother is in a safe place, so even if it's hard, bear it for a little bit.

161
00:15:50,609 --> 00:15:54,509
I don't want to hear it. Tell me where my mother is right now.

162
00:15:54,509 --> 00:15:56,159
I can't tell you.

163
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,929
Why?! Why can't you?

164
00:15:57,929 --> 00:16:00,509
I told you I have a plan.

165
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:02,879
If it goes the way I plan, I can protect

166
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,909
both you and your mother. So...

167
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:10,709
So, trust and wait me until then.

168
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:13,479
How can I believe you when you don't have anything?

169
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:16,139
I don't know if you really have my mother,

170
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:19,199
and I don't even know what you are planning. So how can I trust you?

171
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,429
- Hoon.
- Truthfully, I can't trust you. No...

172
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:26,489
now I don't even know if you are Jae Hee or not.

173
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:39,649
I don't care about the plan. I need to meet Jang Seok Joo right now. After meeting him,

174
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:42,599
if he doesn't bring me my mother, I will go to the police or the press.

175
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:45,279
Then do you think he'll leave you alone?

176
00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:48,429
Tell him to kill me.

177
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:53,149
What about your mother if you die?

178
00:16:54,879 --> 00:17:00,019
She's someone who has even lost her mind after suffering from sense of guilt for 20 years.

179
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:09,429
That's why I want to meet her.

180
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:16,569
That I'm sorry too ... that I did wrong ...

181
00:17:17,489 --> 00:17:19,949
I want to tell her that.

182
00:17:23,269 --> 00:17:26,999
Trust me just once. I beg of you.

183
00:17:26,999 --> 00:17:30,369
I really want to protect

184
00:17:30,369 --> 00:17:33,179
both you and your mother.

185
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:37,309
I'll promise you. One month. Just wait just one month.

186
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:40,289
Before then everything will be finished.

187
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:45,529
Please... I beg you...

188
00:18:12,969 --> 00:18:15,719
 Jaeil University Hospital

189
00:18:18,349 --> 00:18:24,709
 The words that you want to hear should be in here.

190
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:30,679
 Jaeil University Hospital

191
00:18:31,499 --> 00:18:33,269
 What is this?

192
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:42,589
 Out of Myeongwoo, Mingook, and Jaeil,

193
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:47,639
 the moment I picked Mingook, it was eliminated.

194
00:18:47,639 --> 00:18:54,209
 With that, if you eliminate Jaeil,

195
00:18:54,209 --> 00:18:58,299
 the only one left is Myeongwoo.

196
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:04,179
 If that happens, Park Hoon,

197
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:06,689
 you should accept him one more time.

198
00:19:07,569 --> 00:19:11,479
 We have to finish the competition.

199
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:30,439
Yes, Chairman.

200
00:19:30,439 --> 00:19:34,079
You know some news reporters, right?

201
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:38,219
 According to the Prosecutors, the recently chosen Jaeil Hospital for the Prime Minister's surgery,

202
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:41,279
  has been accepting bribes from the medical equipment companies,

203
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:46,689
 from 100 millions of won to billions of won regularly.

204
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:57,059
By the looks of it, I think my heart surgery has to be done at Mingook University Hospital.

205
00:19:59,229 --> 00:20:01,579
Let's just go with Myeongwoo.

206
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:09,609
Damn.

207
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:17,219
This fox-like old misery.

208
00:20:17,219 --> 00:20:19,939
He should been like this from the beginning.

209
00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:24,299
Did you find Lee Mi Sook?

210
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:26,429
We haven't yet been able to do so.

211
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:30,719
Is this, that Cha Jin Soo's doing?

212
00:20:30,719 --> 00:20:33,619
It seems it's Han Seung Hee.

213
00:20:33,619 --> 00:20:35,529
Why Han Seung Hee?

214
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:38,159
I think Han Seung Hee, that woman,

215
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,579
is Song Jae Hee.

216
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:44,279
What are you talking about? I saw with my own eyes that she didn't have scars from the surgery!

217
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:48,689
Regardless of what you saw, since she is Park Hoon's mother,

218
00:20:48,689 --> 00:20:51,409
Han Seung Hee took her away to protect her.

219
00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:54,609
Don't you think that's more persuasive?

220
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:01,769
Well, Jaeil University Hospital

221
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:05,129
will be automatically eliminated.

222
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:06,939
You are useful in some ways too.

223
00:21:06,939 --> 00:21:09,969
I've always  been like this, Chairman.

224
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:14,119
Then, what should we do now?

225
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,319
About what?

226
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:18,539
Aren't we restarting the competition?

227
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:20,799
- Park Hoon?
- Yes.

228
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:45,099
Didn't you say it's your day off?

229
00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:53,699
I think I was too harsh yesterday.

230
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:57,619
- Are you going to Doctor Park's house?
- Yeah.

231
00:21:57,619 --> 00:22:00,579
There's still some leftover curry from yesterday

232
00:22:00,579 --> 00:22:03,849
and it's a little bit too much to throw away so I should at least give him this.

233
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:05,489
The curry...

234
00:22:07,219 --> 00:22:09,169
Wait a little bit.

235
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:10,189
Why?

236
00:22:10,189 --> 00:22:13,879
Even if he likes it, isn't it too much for dinner and breakfast?

237
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:23,879

238
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,209
Say that you'll make curry for him later.

239
00:22:29,209 --> 00:22:33,679
Did you by chance minor in culinary cooking?

240
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,449
I'll just say that I did.

241
00:22:35,449 --> 00:22:37,939
Thanks. I'll give it to him.

242
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:12,239
Ah,

243
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:13,319
Aww.

244
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:16,249
I came here to get an apology from you.

245
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,249
- Apology?
- Yeah.

246
00:23:19,249 --> 00:23:23,049
That ... Apologize to me about what you said to me yesterday.

247
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:24,419
Why should I apologize when I was being sincere?

248
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:26,759
Are you really going to be like this?

249
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:32,099
Hey, Quack,

250
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:36,469
do you really like me?

251
00:23:36,469 --> 00:23:38,009
What?

252
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:40,959
Did you come see me with that excuse?

253
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:45,069
Jeez. I'm  just flabbergasted.

254
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:49,879
If not, go. I'm not in the mood to play with you.

255
00:23:49,879 --> 00:23:51,039
Who asked you to play?

256
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:51,899
I said to go.

257
00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:57,439
Don't misunderstand... this... this is what Dr. Han made for you saying you're pitiful so I just came to give it to you.

258
00:23:57,439 --> 00:24:00,739
Well, I came to ap... no, to get an apology as well.

259
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:01,799
Doctor Han?

260
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:04,169
That's right. Doctor Han.

261
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:08,819
Seriously, why did Doctor Han have to make such a thing and make me get misunderstood?

262
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:18,119
I got it. I'm sorry. I said I'm sorry. 
♬   Now I can't think of anything.  ♬

263
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:23,419
I'm sorry for yesterday too, so go now.
♬  I endured every day without you.  ♬

264
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:28,619
I was a little harsh yesterday too. 
♬  A difficult parting  ♬

265
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:32,499
Behave yourself so Chief Han won't misunderstand. And don't come here anymore either.

266
00:24:32,499 --> 00:24:37,609
♬  I couldn't tell you I loved you then.  ♬

267
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:41,289
♬  I'm going to meet you now.  ♬

268
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:45,389
♬   Now I am meeting you again.  ♬

269
00:24:45,389 --> 00:24:47,199
Take this. I'm not  going to eat it. 
♬   When we meet again, I will be really happy.  ♬

270
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:51,619
Why? Doctor Han made it really intently. 
♬   When we meet again, I will be really happy.  ♬

271
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:54,719
I'm not eating it.

274
00:25:13,339 --> 00:25:16,209
 Do you really like me? 
♬  Do you remember the time   ♬

275
00:25:16,209 --> 00:25:20,009
♬  When we were always together?  ♬

276
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:23,679
Am I crazy enough to like you? 
 ♬   I am longing for the time  ♬

277
00:25:23,699 --> 00:25:25,789
He's such a jerk.
♬   I am longing for the time  ♬

278
00:25:25,789 --> 00:25:30,229
♬  when there was just the two of us. ♬

279
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:33,409
♬  I want us to be together now.   ♬

280
00:25:33,409 --> 00:25:41,429
♬ I will not let you go for the second time. ♬

281
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:55,529
I told you to leave.

282
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:01,429
Excuse me.

283
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:03,759
What?

284
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:08,659
 I'm begging you. What would happen if Hoon meets his mother?

285
00:26:08,659 --> 00:26:12,039
 You absolutely can't tell anyone.

286
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:16,679
What is it, you punk?

287
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:19,439
You said you'd help me with delivery!

288
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:22,779
- I did?
- Then, do you think a ghost did?

289
00:26:23,639 --> 00:26:25,939
Wait.

290
00:26:26,949 --> 00:26:28,959
What about your mother? Is she alright?

291
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:31,119
What do you mean Mother?

292
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:35,719
You said she was discharged from the hospital yesterday. Get her a lot of delicious food.

293
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,439
Why are you worrying about my mom?

294
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:40,899
Why are you really being like this from morning?

295
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:44,499
Excuse me, can I ask you something?

296
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:47,329
Is this hospital open today?

297
00:26:47,329 --> 00:26:49,429
Yes, of course. Are you not feeling well?

298
00:26:49,429 --> 00:26:52,409
Yes. My chest is a little...

299
00:26:53,649 --> 00:26:56,479
Are you alright?

300
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:58,599
Escort him in.

301
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,689
You want me to prescribe you medication for angina?

302
00:27:08,689 --> 00:27:12,379
I stopped taking it for a while because I was busy, and I collapsed.

303
00:27:12,379 --> 00:27:17,639
That could've been bad.  The blood clots that were stuck in your blood vessels blocked your artery.

304
00:27:17,639 --> 00:27:21,969
It was fortunate that it was a small one.  If it was big, you wouldn't have been able to walk around like this.

305
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:25,559
Can you breathe in deeply?

306
00:27:30,369 --> 00:27:36,589
I went to a big hospital and asked them to prescribe the medicine but they told me to get a surgery.

307
00:27:37,249 --> 00:27:39,219
I don't even have money.

308
00:27:39,219 --> 00:27:41,249
Which hospital?

309
00:27:41,249 --> 00:27:43,559
Myeongwoo University Hospital.

310
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:46,889
If things worked out, I could have met you there.

311
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,199
Can you lay down for a minute?

312
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:10,999
Ahjussi, I think you'll need to get surgery.

313
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:15,699
I don't have money to get surgery.

314
00:28:15,699 --> 00:28:17,289
Even so, if something goes wrong, it could be terrible.

315
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:20,349
Please just prescribe me medication for angina.

316
00:28:20,349 --> 00:28:23,589
But this isn't something that can be treated only with medication.

317
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:30,799
Ahjusshi, then take the prescription...

318
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,479
Hi!

319
00:28:35,949 --> 00:28:38,289
You want me to compete again?

320
00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:40,049
Wasn't a different hospital doing that?

321
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:43,079
Who am I?  I am the almighty Moon Hyung Wook.

322
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:47,789
Do you think I just watched Meyongwoo's crisis?  I stepped up!

323
00:28:47,789 --> 00:28:49,649
Forget it.

324
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:52,319
Here.

325
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:56,179
It's something that's not even useable.

326
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:01,209
Ba Ra Ba Ra Bam.  Tada!

327
00:29:02,889 --> 00:29:06,949
Forget about the money and just tell Chief Han to represent the hospital.

328
00:29:06,949 --> 00:29:10,259
Chief Han can't listen to my father's will.

329
00:29:10,259 --> 00:29:12,679
Master, no... please

330
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:14,629
tell Professor's father that I'm sorry.

331
00:29:14,629 --> 00:29:17,079
Hyung!

332
00:29:17,719 --> 00:29:19,359
Oh!  That person!

333
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:21,369
Do you know him?

334
00:29:21,369 --> 00:29:23,279
I know him.

335
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,939
He is Yang Jung Han's patient.

336
00:29:24,939 --> 00:29:27,769
He was told that he needed surgery  but he just discharged himself because he said had no money.

337
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:28,929
Chang, hurry and turn on the engine.

338
00:29:28,929 --> 00:29:30,839
Where do I go?

339
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:32,979
Let's save the patient.

340
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,499
Let's go to Myeongwoo Hospital.

341
00:29:35,499 --> 00:29:36,729
Yeah!  That's it.

342
00:29:49,979 --> 00:29:52,689
This person came back in the end.

343
00:29:52,689 --> 00:29:54,479
How can you just discharge a patient like that?

344
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:56,289
He has to be discharged if he has no money.

345
00:29:56,289 --> 00:29:59,039
Even if the patient's condition is like that?

346
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:09,549
Hey Tomboy!  Ouch!

347
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:13,179
Ah, really!

348
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:16,329
Do you want to watch a movie later?

349
00:30:16,329 --> 00:30:18,449
Doesn't a perverted thug  have any concerns?

350
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,229
Of course I do.

351
00:30:20,229 --> 00:30:23,949
The way I live isn't that happy...

352
00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:47,669
If he doesn't have money, anyway he can't even  get a surgery.

353
00:30:47,669 --> 00:30:51,439
I will pay this person's hospital fees so please start the hospitalization process.

354
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:18,729
You said one month right?

355
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:29,889

356
00:31:31,939 --> 00:31:35,869
Then has Myeongwoo been confirmed as the hospital for the Prime Minister's surgery?

357
00:31:35,869 --> 00:31:37,459
That's right.

358
00:31:41,989 --> 00:31:45,619
 Chairman, Doctor Park Hoon is here.

359
00:31:45,619 --> 00:31:47,499
Tell him to come in.

360
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,079
Unni, Unni, big news.

361
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:13,139
Stop fussing around and check vitals in room numbers 3 and 9.

362
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:16,979
No, Unni, the water bottle doctor is back.

363
00:32:17,659 --> 00:32:19,789
Is that so?

364
00:32:20,969 --> 00:32:23,179
Hey, what are you talking about?

365
00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:26,029
If it is 1:0, it's 1:0.  Why is it 1:1?

366
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:28,679
Forget it. Let's start it as 1:1.

367
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:29,859
Hey!

368
00:32:29,859 --> 00:32:33,479
Well, actually, you said that if you performed the surgery on that last patient, you lose,

369
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:35,959
but truthfully I think of it as a surgery where someone had to do it.

370
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:37,069
Hey, you!

371
00:32:37,069 --> 00:32:39,129
Why don't we listen some more?

372
00:32:39,129 --> 00:32:41,259
Of course.

373
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:44,909
So, I'll say that I lost that surgery.

374
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:51,989
In other words, there is just one more competition left between me and Chief Han here.

375
00:32:51,989 --> 00:32:55,849
I don't feel all that good because I feel like I'm getting sympathy.

376
00:32:55,849 --> 00:33:00,089
It's not sympathy but a respect towards a good doctor.

377
00:33:00,089 --> 00:33:03,329
Then, is this the last competition again?

378
00:33:03,329 --> 00:33:06,849
Instead, like last time, the hospital will pay for the surgery fee.

379
00:33:15,309 --> 00:33:17,499
He's a 45 year old male patient.

380
00:33:19,379 --> 00:33:24,289
He was brought to the ER after losing consciousness 2 weeks ago. His artery was blocked because of blood clots.

381
00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:26,729
I see the signs of myocardial infarction.

382
00:33:26,729 --> 00:33:29,219
As you can see, this patient needs work on the coronary artery and mitral valve

383
00:33:29,219 --> 00:33:31,869
and the enlarged left ventricle.

384
00:33:31,869 --> 00:33:37,129
Are we using this patient for the competition? It's exciting even though it's a coincidence.

385
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:45,959
She's a 53 year old female patient.

386
00:33:48,369 --> 00:33:51,979
Like him, she's a patient who came in with signs of  infarction.

387
00:33:52,659 --> 00:33:55,889
Because this patient's coronary artery constriction has progressed for a long time as well,

388
00:33:55,889 --> 00:33:59,939
it's at a state where most of the left ventricle fibrosis has progressed

389
00:33:59,939 --> 00:34:04,609
As you can see, it seems she needs mitral valve repair and overall, her condition is extremely critical.

390
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,479
What are you going to do?

391
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:10,099
Since we secured a heart donor, we will be doing a heart transplant.

392
00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:14,909
But it will take a long time if your patient waits for a donor.

393
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:18,369
The reason for the competition lies with that.

394
00:34:22,249 --> 00:34:23,759
You are going to install a VAD?
 (Ventricular Assisting Device to help the heart pump blood.)

395
00:34:23,759 --> 00:34:26,869
Do you know how much that costs? It's over 100 million won!
(100 thousand dollars)

396
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:29,409
And that patient is the patient who ran away because he didn't have money.

397
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:31,369
That's why I said I'll do the competition.

398
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:32,479
What?

399
00:34:32,479 --> 00:34:36,659
A VAD is a device that is usually used to maintain heart function in patients who are waiting for transplants.

400
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,769
But these days, it functions really well.

401
00:34:38,769 --> 00:34:43,579
Even after the patient submits a request, he'll be able to lead a comfortable life while waiting for a donor.

402
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:48,309
Well, since it's a competition, the hospital will pay for the cost.  End of worries.

403
00:34:49,009 --> 00:34:53,619
And the surgery is also easier and less dangerous than a transplant.

404
00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:56,149
Master, you can try insisting that we won after it's over.

405
00:34:56,149 --> 00:34:58,319
Hey, after a long time, you're really

406
00:34:58,319 --> 00:35:01,019
saying things that makes me feel good.

407
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:05,429
Oh! Hey!

408
00:35:05,429 --> 00:35:09,879
He is going to install a VAD, that expensive device?

409
00:35:09,879 --> 00:35:12,569
Park Hoon used his brains.

410
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:15,499
I think this competition will end in a tie.

411
00:35:15,499 --> 00:35:19,069
No! That guy won't be able to install a VAD on that patient.

412
00:35:19,069 --> 00:35:22,659
Isn't the hospital supposed to pay for the surgery expense?

413
00:35:22,659 --> 00:35:24,669
The cost isn't the problem.

414
00:35:25,949 --> 00:35:29,199
Perhaps... does the patient have coagulopathy?
 Bleeding disorder in which once bleeding starts, it doesn't stop.

415
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:33,399
That's right.  Whether it's a heart transplant or a VAD, this patient can't take it.

416
00:35:33,399 --> 00:35:36,129
Even if God himself came to do the surgery, he will die.

417
00:35:36,129 --> 00:35:38,809
Then, this competition...

418
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:44,109
Chief Han, there is one thing you need to bear in mind.

419
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:51,059
The one that I forgave for the last surgery is my daughter, Soo Hyeon's  Han Jae Joon.

420
00:35:51,059 --> 00:35:53,639
The Chief Han, who looked at me with his stiff neck

421
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:57,419
and ignored my orders, I still haven't forgiven him.

422
00:35:58,809 --> 00:36:00,819
Do you know that?

423
00:36:00,819 --> 00:36:04,899
That guy, Moon Hyung Wook, whom you kicked out has helped me and made a clear contribution

424
00:36:04,899 --> 00:36:08,469
in making Myeongwoo the hospital for the surgery on the Prime Minister.

425
00:36:08,469 --> 00:36:12,279
The position that you're in is not one in which you can only rise.

426
00:36:12,279 --> 00:36:15,979
You can fall to the bottom any time. Do you know that?

427
00:36:16,889 --> 00:36:17,799
I know that.

428
00:36:17,799 --> 00:36:21,619
Even knowing that, you act friendly with Park Hoon?

429
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:26,829
How can you smile at that foreign bastard, whom you'll squash to kick out, huh?

430
00:36:26,829 --> 00:36:28,039
I'm sorry.

431
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:33,859
Bear it in mind. This competition is not like a drinking game you have with a friend.

432
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:36,589
It's a competition where everything you have is on the line.

433
00:36:37,899 --> 00:36:39,379
I will keep that in mind, Chairman.

434
00:36:39,379 --> 00:36:43,399
Win. Win unconditionally.

435
00:36:43,399 --> 00:36:46,589
That's how you'll be able to get this Myeongwoo.

436
00:36:46,589 --> 00:36:49,979
If you don't, you'll lose everything.

437
00:36:49,979 --> 00:36:53,869
Even Soo Hyeon, whom you love.

438
00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:02,819
That's right. It seems Professor Park Chul really went to North Korea 20 years ago.

439
00:37:02,819 --> 00:37:05,579
By chance did you find out the reason as well?

440
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:07,789
I heard it was because of their highest leader's surgery.

441
00:37:07,789 --> 00:37:09,869
The highest leader?

442
00:37:10,909 --> 00:37:14,879
After that surgery succeeded, I heard he received extravagant  hospitality.

443
00:37:16,349 --> 00:37:20,129
After telling us  that he'd testify on our behalf with such assurance...

444
00:37:20,129 --> 00:37:23,539
Oh right... they say he has a son too.

445
00:37:23,539 --> 00:37:24,589
I know.

446
00:37:24,589 --> 00:37:26,209
You know?

447
00:37:32,899 --> 00:37:36,039
Although it's not much, it's just a bit of my appreciation.

448
00:37:37,059 --> 00:37:39,899
The isn't the "thank you" that I want.

449
00:37:42,069 --> 00:37:47,939
I rather you have a drink with me just like we did at Harvard.

450
00:37:47,939 --> 00:37:50,129
This is what I want.

451
00:37:52,419 --> 00:37:54,169
Cheers.

452
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:08,819
 Please open the door. Professor! Please answer me!

453
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:10,499
 Seung Hoon, I...

454
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:12,729
 Mom, what's wrong?

455
00:38:12,729 --> 00:38:15,079
 Mom! Are you alright?

456
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:18,589
 Mom, why are you like this?  Mom, wake up.

457
00:38:58,489 --> 00:39:02,239
Park Chul. Park Hoon.

458
00:39:04,099 --> 00:39:06,719
You were that bastard, Park Chul's son?

459
00:39:16,689 --> 00:39:19,119
Doctor Park!

460
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,619
Oh, Quack.

461
00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:22,079
Come in. I have something to give you.

462
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,239
I don't have anything to receive from you.

463
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:25,689
Just come already.

464
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:29,269
What is this?

465
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:31,369
It's your doctor gown.

466
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,359
Mine?

467
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:40,479
I really congratulate you on coming back again.

468
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:42,889
What congratulations?

469
00:39:46,939 --> 00:39:49,229
Hey, Quack,

470
00:39:49,229 --> 00:39:50,979
what's with your expression?

471
00:39:50,979 --> 00:39:53,179
What about me?

472
00:39:53,179 --> 00:39:55,299
Forget it.

473
00:40:00,259 --> 00:40:03,579
Is this possibly the gown which I threw away in the trash can?

474
00:40:03,579 --> 00:40:06,419
Was it? Does it smell a lot?

475
00:40:06,419 --> 00:40:08,139
Smell it then, to see if it does.

476
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,959
It doesn't smell at all.

477
00:40:10,959 --> 00:40:13,609
It only smells like my perfume.

478
00:40:15,209 --> 00:40:17,469
Hurry.

479
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:27,209
You look the best in a gown.

480
00:40:37,499 --> 00:40:39,689
Doctor.

481
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:42,789
Are you awake now?

482
00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:46,579
What happened?

483
00:40:46,579 --> 00:40:49,839
We scheduled the surgery for tomorrow so stay with your mind at ease.

484
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,819
I told you I don't have money!

485
00:40:56,209 --> 00:40:59,039
Don't worry about the surgery fee and stay calm.

486
00:41:04,819 --> 00:41:07,539
The surgery will be attaching this onto your heart.

487
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:10,069
The price is more than a staggering 100 million won.
(100 thousand dollars)

488
00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:14,129
With this, you will be able to live comfortably until a donor is found.

489
00:41:14,129 --> 00:41:17,889
The hospital will pay for the surgery fees that come later too, so you don't need to worry.

490
00:41:17,889 --> 00:41:20,129
Do you understand?

491
00:41:20,929 --> 00:41:25,169
Thank you. Thank you.

492
00:41:29,589 --> 00:41:31,669
- Dad! 
- Are you alright?

493
00:41:31,669 --> 00:41:34,979
Yes.  Daddy is fine.

494
00:41:34,979 --> 00:41:38,729
Honey, don't worry about anything, okay?

495
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:50,169
Daddy is fine.

496
00:42:00,989 --> 00:42:03,429
Did you ask to see me?

497
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:07,299
You said you have a plan, right?

498
00:42:07,299 --> 00:42:10,939
I can't meet my mother because of that, right?

499
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:14,019
Tell me what it is.

500
00:42:14,019 --> 00:42:16,209
You told me you'd wait.

501
00:42:16,209 --> 00:42:18,049
I can't wait.

502
00:42:18,049 --> 00:42:21,389
I can't wait for one month; I can't even wait for another hour.

503
00:42:21,389 --> 00:42:23,099
No.

504
00:42:33,579 --> 00:42:36,079
Tell me what in the world is the plan?

505
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,159
I can't tell you.

506
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:39,319
What's the reason?

507
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:41,369
What's the reason why you can't tell me?

508
00:42:41,369 --> 00:42:44,069
It's because you'll be in danger.

509
00:42:44,069 --> 00:42:46,029
Say something that makes sense.

510
00:42:46,029 --> 00:42:49,569
Hoon, you just have to trust me and remain a good doctor.

511
00:42:49,569 --> 00:42:50,849
Then you and your mother-

512
00:42:50,849 --> 00:42:52,549
A good doctor?

513
00:42:52,549 --> 00:42:55,239
Is that what you want?

514
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,759
What are you doing with the surgery coming up?

515
00:43:00,759 --> 00:43:04,119
Tell me, if not, I'll never be able to hold a scalpel.

516
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:07,389
- Don't do it. 
 - Tell me!

517
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:13,489
It's my plan to meet the President.

518
00:43:13,489 --> 00:43:15,559
Is that good enough?

519
00:43:22,859 --> 00:43:25,549
How can you meet the President?

520
00:43:25,549 --> 00:43:29,859
The Prime Minister surgery team isn't doing the surgery on the Prime Minister but on the President.

521
00:43:29,859 --> 00:43:33,399
So if I just get on the surgery team, I can meet him.

522
00:43:37,709 --> 00:43:40,239
We'll be performing the surgery on the President?

523
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:41,969
Then why did they say that it'll be surgery for the Prime Minister?

524
00:43:41,969 --> 00:43:44,589
It's a national secret that the President is ill.

525
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:46,639
He also wants to hide it.

526
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:47,839
Why would he hide the fact of his illness?

527
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,069
Who would listen to a person's words when you don't know when he'll die?

528
00:43:51,069 --> 00:43:53,699
It'll be of no use even though he's a President.

529
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:56,249
Then what is Jang Seok Joo about?

530
00:43:56,249 --> 00:43:58,529
Why did he tell me to be in that surgery team?

531
00:43:58,529 --> 00:44:01,239
Because he wants to kill the President!

532
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:04,549
If he said that he'll kill me and your mother,

533
00:44:04,549 --> 00:44:07,619
he thought that you'll do everything he tells you to do.

534
00:44:09,919 --> 00:44:17,929

535
00:44:19,939 --> 00:44:24,239
If the President dies, the Prime Minister will get the power.

536
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:26,589
That's what Jang Seok Joo wanted.

537
00:44:26,589 --> 00:44:28,859
Is that your plan?

538
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:30,909
To kill a person as Jang Seok Joo orders you to do?

539
00:44:30,909 --> 00:44:34,449
What Jang Seok Joo wants isn't to kill him immediately.

540
00:44:34,449 --> 00:44:36,539
He's planning to maintain a comatose state.

541
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:42,329
That way, he'll be able to keep the power for the amount of time he wants.

542
00:44:42,329 --> 00:44:48,219
I thought that then I'll have a chance to meet the President alone.

543
00:45:13,809 --> 00:45:16,119
 If you promise to save us

544
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:18,959
 I will save you, Mr. President.

545
00:45:18,959 --> 00:45:21,649
You fool, do you think you'll succeed in that?

546
00:45:21,649 --> 00:45:24,259
If I don't, I'll probably die.

547
00:45:24,259 --> 00:45:28,929
However, I have hope that we can live.

548
00:45:34,279 --> 00:45:37,219
Why didn't you tell me earlier?  When it's such a dangerous task?

549
00:45:37,219 --> 00:45:38,769
I thought that you didn't need to know.

550
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:40,929
When I will be the head surgeon of the team, how can I not know?

551
00:45:40,929 --> 00:45:44,579
Chief Han can also be the head surgeon. I'm going to make a demand to Jang Seok Joo.

552
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:47,319
That I'll take you out and put Chief Han in.

553
00:45:47,319 --> 00:45:50,449
If not, then I won't do as they order me to.

554
00:45:50,449 --> 00:45:52,409
There are a lot of skilled anesthesiologists.

555
00:45:52,409 --> 00:45:55,119
Why, why is it you of all people?

556
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,429
Because I love you.

557
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:01,019
If they threaten to kill you,

558
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:03,989
I cannot do anything but do as they command.

559
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:12,329
I didn't tell you because I didn't think you needed to get involved any further.

560
00:46:12,329 --> 00:46:16,799
So please forget everything I said, Hoon.

561
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:21,899
And you can lose the competition now.

562
00:46:21,899 --> 00:46:25,359
So, you can take the path of a doctor you want,

563
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:28,229
without ever deviating from it.

564
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:31,789
I'm begging you.

565
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:42,329
♬  I love like a tomorrow which may not come.  ♬

566
00:46:42,329 --> 00:46:52,599
♬  Day to day for me I heal with love   ♬

567
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:58,189
♬  instead of scars.  ♬

568
00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:04,239
Is it a present?

569
00:47:13,449 --> 00:47:15,769
It's pretty.

570
00:47:18,209 --> 00:47:22,889
Whoever the person is, they are drawn to new and fresh things.

571
00:47:22,889 --> 00:47:24,809
Just like that bag.

572
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:29,959
Think of Doctor Park as a bag like that.

573
00:47:31,419 --> 00:47:34,639
Think of it as just briefly wearing it on your shoulder.

574
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:38,039
I don't think I can stand any more than that.

575
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:46,229
♬  I love like a tomorrow which may not come.  ♬

576
00:47:46,229 --> 00:47:50,829
♬  I love as if I may not see you again.  ♬

577
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:55,549
 Whoever the person is, they are drawn to new and fresh things.

578
00:47:55,549 --> 00:47:57,479
 Just like that bag.

579
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:00,709
 You can use it.

580
00:48:00,709 --> 00:48:06,529
♬  Day to day for me I heal with love  ♬

581
00:48:06,529 --> 00:48:14,429
♬  instead of scars.  ♬

582
00:48:20,249 --> 00:48:22,519
It won't take long.

583
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:36,409
There's nothing significant to report, right?

584
00:48:36,409 --> 00:48:38,469
Yes, there isn't.

585
00:48:38,469 --> 00:48:41,539
Okay, then let's escort him to the operating room.

586
00:49:16,759 --> 00:49:19,639
I'm sorry about yesterday.

587
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:22,329
You didn't forget my request right?

588
00:49:23,149 --> 00:49:27,419
You don't need to worry about things like competition.

589
00:49:28,409 --> 00:49:33,649
But what should I do? Now I want to win this competition.

590
00:49:34,859 --> 00:49:38,999
No matter which operating room, I won't let you go in by yourself.

591
00:49:38,999 --> 00:49:41,909
- Hoon. 
- Don't worry.

592
00:49:41,909 --> 00:49:45,819
This competition is, above all, about saving the patient.

593
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:56,149
Chairman, I think it'll be difficult to choose the winner.

594
00:49:56,149 --> 00:49:59,799
After all, there isn't any reason why either of them can't perform the surgery with their skills.

595
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:03,009
How about we say that the person who finishes first wins?

596
00:50:03,009 --> 00:50:05,629
It isn't a surgery where time is important.

597
00:50:05,629 --> 00:50:08,389
Let's decide the winner is whoever succeeds in the surgery.

598
00:50:08,389 --> 00:50:11,619
What if both of them succeed?

599
00:50:11,619 --> 00:50:13,179
Let's see.

600
00:50:13,189 --> 00:50:15,529
I've never thought about that.

601
00:50:15,529 --> 00:50:17,789
You should.

602
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:37,659
 Will assistant professor do for you?

603
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:43,109
 He can't know that the patient has coagulopathy.

604
00:50:43,109 --> 00:50:47,129
 Especially he cannot succeed in the surgery either.

605
00:50:47,939 --> 00:50:50,649
 You understand what I'm saying, right?

606
00:51:04,449 --> 00:51:06,809
Did you finish examining everything before the surgery?

607
00:51:06,809 --> 00:51:08,889
Yes.

608
00:51:08,889 --> 00:51:11,399
There was nothing wrong.

609
00:51:11,399 --> 00:51:16,819
Doctor Han, just in case, do the important ones.

610
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:19,799
Should I?

611
00:51:30,299 --> 00:51:32,719
You had an amazing father.

612
00:51:36,249 --> 00:51:38,789
I mean Professor Park Chul.

613
00:51:38,789 --> 00:51:42,109
I heard he went to North Korea to do an amazing surgery.

614
00:51:43,019 --> 00:51:44,309
How did you know that?

615
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:46,379
How was it?

616
00:51:46,379 --> 00:51:50,319
At any rate, since he performed the surgery on the highest leader, I'm sure it was livable.

617
00:51:51,699 --> 00:51:56,839
Indeed, that's why you were able to graduate from Pyeongyang Medical School.

618
00:51:56,839 --> 00:52:01,099
You are acting oddly twisted. Is something going on?

619
00:52:01,099 --> 00:52:05,339
No. Do the surgery well.

620
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:20,059
Hey, Quack, work hard.

621
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:28,089
Why is everyone like this?

622
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:53,529
What happened?

623
00:52:54,659 --> 00:52:58,109
What? It looks like there's a problem.

624
00:52:59,589 --> 00:53:01,359
Isn't there a problem?

625
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:02,769
That's coagulopathy.

626
00:53:02,769 --> 00:53:04,569
At this rate, won't Park Hoon end up with a big problem?

627
00:53:04,569 --> 00:53:06,779
That's what I'm saying.

628
00:53:19,769 --> 00:53:20,939
What happened?

629
00:53:20,939 --> 00:53:22,189
It's coagulopathy.

630
00:53:22,189 --> 00:53:25,829
I'm sorry. I must have forgotten that test.

631
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:27,039
Doctor Yang!

632
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:28,709
I'm sorry, Doctor Park.

633
00:53:28,709 --> 00:53:31,429
- How about the platelet count?
- It's 50,000.

634
00:53:32,339 --> 00:53:34,539
We can't do surgery like this.

635
00:53:40,039 --> 00:53:41,009
Let's cancel it.

636
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:43,259
There is no other way for this patient if we don't do surgery.  You all know that.

637
00:53:43,259 --> 00:53:47,659
If it's coagulopathy, when we install the VAD, we can't use use Heparin or Warfarin (which inhibit blood coagulation).

638
00:53:47,659 --> 00:53:49,249
It mean that he'll die.

639
00:53:49,249 --> 00:53:52,369
This patient's heart... even if we leave it alone, he'll die.

640
00:53:54,749 --> 00:53:58,099
Oh, what is all this trouble?

641
00:53:58,099 --> 00:54:00,299
What's with this disorder all of a sudden?!

642
00:54:00,299 --> 00:54:03,349
Why aren't you working either... again?!  Damn it!

643
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:05,899
How come random things like this are pissing me off?

644
00:54:05,899 --> 00:54:08,109
Oh, really.

645
00:54:09,269 --> 00:54:11,999
Room #2 is in chaos.

646
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:13,999
What's wrong?

647
00:54:13,999 --> 00:54:16,739
The patient has coagulopathy.

648
00:54:16,739 --> 00:54:21,759
The normal platelet count is 300,000-400,000. That patient has only 50,000.

649
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:23,609
Then he can't install a VAD.

650
00:54:23,609 --> 00:54:28,469
It's over. Chief Han won.  Game over.

651
00:54:28,469 --> 00:54:31,739
Stop talking nonsense and

652
00:54:31,739 --> 00:54:33,819
get ready.

653
00:54:50,819 --> 00:54:53,189
- Let's take the line out and move the patient.
- Just wait a moment.

654
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:55,409
What's the point of waiting at this point?

655
00:54:55,409 --> 00:54:57,789
I told you to wait!

656
00:54:57,789 --> 00:55:00,479
Doctor Park will make the decision.

657
00:55:02,479 --> 00:55:04,819
Doctor Park.

658
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:10,469
If the patient can't be given Warfarin, we have to do a surgery which doesn't need that.

659
00:55:11,899 --> 00:55:14,619
We will do SAVER.
 Surgical anterior ventricular endocardial restoration

660
00:55:23,209 --> 00:55:25,269
He said he'll be doing SAVER.

661
00:55:25,269 --> 00:55:26,229
What is that?

662
00:55:26,229 --> 00:55:28,649
What that is...

663
00:55:28,649 --> 00:55:31,719
They take the heart and

664
00:55:31,719 --> 00:55:33,939
cutting out the outer layer.

665
00:55:33,939 --> 00:55:37,899
Next, they take the dead areas of the tissue,

666
00:55:37,899 --> 00:55:40,049
and they remove them.

667
00:55:40,049 --> 00:55:43,139
Here, remove it with your pretty mouth.

668
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:47,139
After that, they stitch it back into its shape like this.

669
00:55:47,999 --> 00:55:49,669
It's very simple.

670
00:55:49,669 --> 00:55:52,759
Simple?  It's a surgery that is no longer perfomed.

671
00:55:52,759 --> 00:55:54,729
A surgery that is no longer performed?

672
00:55:54,729 --> 00:55:57,329
That's right.

673
00:55:57,329 --> 00:56:01,229
It's a surgery no one does now because the probability of success is so extremely low.

674
00:56:01,229 --> 00:56:03,579
Especially for a patient like that,

675
00:56:03,579 --> 00:56:06,089
it's more so when the amount of necrotic tissue is large.

676
00:56:06,089 --> 00:56:09,949
So that water bottle is going to do that?

677
00:56:11,859 --> 00:56:14,259
Let's zoom in a little bit.

678
00:56:16,749 --> 00:56:20,149
- Did the surgery start?
- Yes, it started.

679
00:56:48,459 --> 00:56:50,899
Get Park Hoon on the phone!

680
00:56:50,899 --> 00:56:53,219
Never mind.

681
00:56:54,839 --> 00:57:00,139
Hey, you punk!  Who are you to do that kind of surgery?

682
00:57:02,849 --> 00:57:04,759
Even in SAVER, we have to use Heparin.

683
00:57:04,759 --> 00:57:06,729
The moment bleeding starts, there is no way to stop the bleeding.

684
00:57:06,729 --> 00:57:10,509
If we have a lot of blood platelets ready, and if we are careful with the other treatment, it can be done.

685
00:57:10,509 --> 00:57:13,059
It looks like the necrotic tissue  in the left ventricle is more than 40%.

686
00:57:13,059 --> 00:57:15,299
It's exactly the limit where SAVER can be done.

687
00:57:15,299 --> 00:57:17,379
Are you satisfied?

688
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:21,989
The guardians won't allow it.

689
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:28,129
If we do the surgery without the consent of the guardian,

690
00:57:28,129 --> 00:57:30,749
there's nothing we can do after.

691
00:57:34,759 --> 00:57:37,399
His blood pressure is falling.

692
00:57:38,919 --> 00:57:40,959
Let's start.

693
00:57:40,959 --> 00:57:43,669
Please prepare the information.

694
00:57:44,439 --> 00:57:47,139
- Doctor Park.
- Even if we leave the operating room like this, the patient will die.

695
00:57:47,139 --> 00:57:49,359
We need the guardian's consent in order to perform the surgery!

696
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:52,109
What kind of consent will we get after he dies?

697
00:58:03,209 --> 00:58:05,699
What are you doing?

698
00:58:22,399 --> 00:58:24,839
Be prepared for a shock.

699
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:28,939
If you see bleeding in other areas, inform me immediately.

700
00:58:45,949 --> 00:58:48,429
Then, from now

701
00:58:48,429 --> 00:58:52,079
we're starting SAVER surgery.

702
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:54,119
Scalpel.

703
00:58:56,399 --> 00:59:06,699
