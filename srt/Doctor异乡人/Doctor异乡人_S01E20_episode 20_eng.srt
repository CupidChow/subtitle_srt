1
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:26,866

2
00:00:27,266 --> 00:00:29,586
Mercilessly, when you have the power,

3
00:00:29,586 --> 00:00:31,656
you need to know how to properly trample the weak.

4
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:34,576
That is a law of nature and the truth.

5
00:00:43,156 --> 00:00:44,716
Because he doesn't know that,

6
00:00:44,716 --> 00:00:48,696
our President is here like...

7
00:00:50,396 --> 00:00:53,976
Hey, when you found fault with the election slush fund,

8
00:00:53,976 --> 00:00:56,996
you should have trampled and killed me at that moment.

9
00:00:56,996 --> 00:00:59,536
After putting me on such a trivial leash,

10
00:00:59,536 --> 00:01:02,316
if you pulled and dragged me, "Yes, I understand."

11
00:01:02,316 --> 00:01:04,346
"Yes, I'll do as you say."

12
00:01:04,346 --> 00:01:06,936
Did you think I would do that?

13
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:09,336
Really!

14
00:01:18,516 --> 00:01:22,266
Soon, there will be a presidential election.

15
00:01:22,266 --> 00:01:25,366
Until then, rest well.

16
00:01:25,366 --> 00:01:28,806
I'll accomplish the North-South Korean Summit with the North Koreans

17
00:01:28,806 --> 00:01:31,486
and lighten the mood for the ignorant citizens.

18
00:01:31,486 --> 00:01:36,086
After that, I'll allow you to rest forever.

19
00:01:36,086 --> 00:01:38,376
Understand?

20
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:21,586
 Episode 20

21
00:02:22,396 --> 00:02:26,476
I really heard it very well, Prime Minister Jang.

22
00:02:27,826 --> 00:02:30,796
You guys dare to deceive me?

23
00:02:30,796 --> 00:02:33,716
Your conspiracy is all over.

24
00:02:37,946 --> 00:02:40,926
 After the surgery is over, you just need to manipulate the BIS.
(Bispectral Index- sedation monitor)

25
00:02:40,926 --> 00:02:42,026
 Then?

26
00:02:42,026 --> 00:02:46,936
 Thinking everything went according to his plan, Jang Seok Joo will say everything to the President.

27
00:02:55,256 --> 00:02:58,416
There aren't any Security Service Agents from the Blue House.

28
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:00,976
They're all my people.

29
00:03:02,076 --> 00:03:03,976
Aigoo, really.

30
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:06,986
Drag that bastard and bitch away!

31
00:03:08,586 --> 00:03:14,136
Even if you were to die here, I still have 60 days left to be an acting President.

32
00:03:15,316 --> 00:03:18,176
What are you doing?

33
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:22,066
Did you not hear me? Drag them away.

34
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:26,636
Prime Minister, please stop now.

35
00:03:28,186 --> 00:03:30,786
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:31,786 --> 00:03:33,446
You?

37
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:35,916
Prime Minister Jang.

38
00:03:36,886 --> 00:03:40,146
Let's finish this quietly.

39
00:03:41,076 --> 00:03:43,436
What's a politician?

40
00:03:43,436 --> 00:03:46,236
Yesterday's friend, today's enemy.

41
00:03:46,236 --> 00:03:50,436
Today's enemy is once again tomorrow's friend.

42
00:03:52,296 --> 00:03:55,296
If you stop here,

43
00:03:55,296 --> 00:03:59,296
only you and I will know.

44
00:03:59,296 --> 00:04:05,196
I'm not going to hold you responsible at all regarding this incident.

45
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:12,216
Are you negotiating with me right now?

46
00:04:12,216 --> 00:04:16,246
You're right, negotiation.

47
00:04:16,246 --> 00:04:19,536
I'll forgive everything.

48
00:04:19,536 --> 00:04:22,406
Your position as the Prime Minister,

49
00:04:22,406 --> 00:04:26,226
I'll allow you to retain.

50
00:04:27,596 --> 00:04:31,486
I won't trample and kill you.

51
00:04:31,486 --> 00:04:37,646
In return, even though it may be a trivial leash,

52
00:04:37,646 --> 00:04:41,076
when I pull or loosen the leash,

53
00:04:41,076 --> 00:04:44,466
"Yes, I understand."

54
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:48,456
"Yes, I will do as you say!"

55
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:53,016
You just have to do as I order you to.

56
00:04:55,216 --> 00:04:58,266
What are you doing right now?

57
00:04:58,266 --> 00:05:00,366
He's the person that tried to kill you, Mr. President.

58
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:03,466
Dr. Park, this isn't something for you to get involved in.

59
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:07,516
If you let it go now, the same thing may happen later on.

60
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:11,306
I said it's not for you, the doctors, to decide.

61
00:05:11,306 --> 00:05:13,966
Mr. President!

62
00:05:20,796 --> 00:05:23,656
Getting a reward for doing something wrong,

63
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,576
and getting penalized for doing something right...

64
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:29,796
That's politics, don't you think?

65
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,536
Prime Minister Jang!

66
00:05:37,926 --> 00:05:40,456
Fine.

67
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:43,906
From now on, I'll make sure that the assemblymen on my side will only take orders from the Blue House

68
00:05:43,906 --> 00:05:47,986
and leave you alone. But...

69
00:05:49,526 --> 00:05:51,636
I have a condition, too.

70
00:05:51,636 --> 00:05:54,146
Enlighten me.

71
00:05:59,016 --> 00:06:02,216
That friend from now on will continuously

72
00:06:02,216 --> 00:06:05,896
serve under you, Prime Minister Jang.

73
00:06:06,676 --> 00:06:12,256
Alright. I get that you need at least one to watch over me.

74
00:06:12,256 --> 00:06:17,576
However, you will have to listen to this one.

75
00:06:19,196 --> 00:06:21,736
Those two people...

76
00:06:22,806 --> 00:06:25,716
Hand them over to me.

77
00:06:30,996 --> 00:06:32,736
As you wish.

78
00:06:32,736 --> 00:06:33,806
Mr. President!

79
00:06:33,806 --> 00:06:36,026
This is different from your promise!

80
00:06:36,026 --> 00:06:39,726
What can happen?

81
00:06:39,726 --> 00:06:42,816
Wouldn't you agree, Prime Minister Jang?

82
00:06:42,816 --> 00:06:45,176
Of course.

83
00:06:45,176 --> 00:06:47,346
Mr. President!

84
00:06:47,346 --> 00:06:50,026
You can't do this! You promised!

85
00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:53,206
You promised to save us!

86
00:07:35,236 --> 00:07:38,656
We have a lot to talk about, don't we?

87
00:08:02,836 --> 00:08:04,126
What's going on?

88
00:08:04,126 --> 00:08:06,746
Until tomorrow morning, we're prohibited from using the operating rooms.

89
00:08:06,746 --> 00:08:09,386
- Why?
- The Prime Minister said so.

90
00:08:09,386 --> 00:08:12,526
He's not even letting us get close to it.

91
00:08:18,336 --> 00:08:20,906
This can't be. It's nonsense.

92
00:08:20,906 --> 00:08:23,116
Trusting those people was our mistake.

93
00:08:23,116 --> 00:08:25,106
How can he go back on his word like this?

94
00:08:25,106 --> 00:08:30,226
We were deceived. He had no intention of granting our request from the beginning.

95
00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:33,396
He said he would let us go with his own mouth.

96
00:08:33,396 --> 00:08:39,706
 Then this time, shall I listen to what you were going to tell me before?

97
00:08:39,706 --> 00:08:44,466
 Maybe is it related to Prime Minister Jang Seok Joo?

98
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,146
 Hurry.

99
00:08:47,146 --> 00:08:51,766
 Prime Minister Jang Seok Joo is trying to assassinate you, Mr. President.

100
00:08:51,766 --> 00:08:55,936
 To be more precise, he's trying to put you in a comatose state through this surgery.

101
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:59,056
 He's seeking the position as the acting President.

102
00:08:59,056 --> 00:09:01,946
 We will testify.

103
00:09:01,946 --> 00:09:03,576
 The opposition is the Prime Minister.

104
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:09,556
 Plus, he has received so much support from the party, to the point that I can't do anything.

105
00:09:09,556 --> 00:09:13,516
 The testimony from you doctors won't do much of anything.

106
00:09:13,516 --> 00:09:15,806
 Then, will you do as we ask you to?

107
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:18,786
 - We?
- There's a doctor from the anesthesiology departmentand myself.

108
00:09:18,786 --> 00:09:22,976
 Also, a person from Jang Seok Joo's side decided to help me.

109
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:26,286
 Even the Prime Minister's person?

110
00:09:28,296 --> 00:09:32,416
 Instead, please guarantee our safety.

111
00:09:34,436 --> 00:09:36,616
 Mr. President.

112
00:09:37,606 --> 00:09:40,236
 I understand.

113
00:09:41,606 --> 00:09:44,696
He definitely said that to me, that he understood.

114
00:09:44,696 --> 00:09:47,466
That he would send us away safely.

115
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:50,916
I'm sorry, Hoon.

116
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:56,766
I regret it so much. If only I hadn't made the wrong choice back then.

117
00:10:03,006 --> 00:10:08,366
All of this started from the moment I grabbed onto Cha Jin Soo's hand.

118
00:10:08,366 --> 00:10:13,426
It was just my small greed to see you.

119
00:10:14,796 --> 00:10:18,726
I didn't know that would cause us to go through something so  scary.

120
00:10:18,726 --> 00:10:20,076
It's not your fault.

121
00:10:20,076 --> 00:10:23,976
If I could go back, if only I could really go back,

122
00:10:23,976 --> 00:10:27,696
I'd just hold you in my heart.

123
00:10:28,986 --> 00:10:32,246
then it wouldn't have come to this.

124
00:10:35,566 --> 00:10:37,036
It's not over yet.

125
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:41,666
But still, what more is there that we can do?

126
00:10:48,156 --> 00:10:51,076
Ah, don't, don't, don't.

127
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:55,996
I've seen you easily take care of one or two of my agents, so I know.

128
00:10:55,996 --> 00:10:58,586
If you do that here, what are you going to do if we needlessly use the gun

129
00:10:58,586 --> 00:11:02,236
the wrong way and put a hole in your boyfriend's head?

130
00:11:08,256 --> 00:11:12,196
Isn't there a saying that states that multiple coincidences become fate?

131
00:11:12,196 --> 00:11:17,766
20 years ago, I had requested that you and your father be taken care of, but you're coincidentally alive.

132
00:11:17,766 --> 00:11:23,626
In Hungary, even though we blocked the embassy's doors, you're coincidentally alive.

133
00:11:23,626 --> 00:11:25,386
That was your doing too?

134
00:11:25,386 --> 00:11:27,326
Yeah.

135
00:11:27,326 --> 00:11:31,946
So I thought that I should do some business with you two,

136
00:11:31,946 --> 00:11:36,046
because it's no longer a coincidence, but an inevitable fate.

137
00:11:36,846 --> 00:11:40,056
Inevitable fate, my ass.

138
00:11:41,506 --> 00:11:43,866
I can only laugh.

139
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:47,196
The dizzying feeling you get when the tower you've invested so much to build collapses down.

140
00:11:47,196 --> 00:11:53,126
It's been a while since I felt such feeling since I lost the election 2 years ago.

141
00:11:53,126 --> 00:11:55,756
I really can't get used to it.

142
00:11:57,006 --> 00:12:00,296
Because he's the President, did you think he's an extraordinary person?

143
00:12:00,296 --> 00:12:05,406
If you guys asked him a favor, you thought he would fulfill all your wants?

144
00:12:05,406 --> 00:12:10,006
You guys should've begged me for mercy instead.

145
00:12:10,006 --> 00:12:12,746
After doing as I said, after I became the President,

146
00:12:12,746 --> 00:12:15,456
after this Jang Seok Joo became the true leader of the Republic of Korea

147
00:12:15,456 --> 00:12:18,576
and there's no higher place for me to conquer,

148
00:12:18,576 --> 00:12:21,086
then,  "Please save our lives."

149
00:12:21,086 --> 00:12:24,756
"What would benefit you from killing these insect-like lives?"

150
00:12:24,756 --> 00:12:29,296
Asking for mercy would have been a much better choice.

151
00:12:29,296 --> 00:12:32,076
Even so, you still wouldn't have spared us.

152
00:12:32,076 --> 00:12:34,046
That's true.

153
00:12:35,096 --> 00:12:36,436
Should we go now?

154
00:12:36,436 --> 00:12:39,806
There are a lot of watching eyes, and it's a hospital.

155
00:12:39,806 --> 00:12:43,046
A hospital that saves human lives.

156
00:12:44,116 --> 00:12:48,656
Ah, as you follow me, keep your mouths shut.

157
00:12:48,656 --> 00:12:53,336
If not, your mom could go first.

158
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:37,156
What is it? What's wrong?

159
00:13:45,696 --> 00:13:48,556
You should go first.

160
00:14:04,496 --> 00:14:07,556
Prime Minister. Prime Minister!

161
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:16,566
He's still alive.

162
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:19,126
Bring the stretcher. Intubation set and the AMBU bag too, quickly!

163
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:21,356
Okay.

164
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:41,656
How is Prime Minister Jang's condition?

165
00:14:41,656 --> 00:14:44,056
It's critical.

166
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,136
Yes.

167
00:14:59,176 --> 00:15:01,236
Yes.

168
00:15:10,196 --> 00:15:12,606
What brings you here?

169
00:15:12,606 --> 00:15:14,286
Did you see my hyung by any chance?

170
00:15:14,286 --> 00:15:15,446
Water Bottle? Why?

171
00:15:15,446 --> 00:15:17,246
His phone doesn't work either, that's why.

172
00:15:17,246 --> 00:15:19,986
Don't be like that and call me, who picks up well, instead.

173
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:24,596
One year, 12 months, everyday, 24/7. I am always on call.

174
00:15:24,596 --> 00:15:27,596
I can't even get in contact with Hyung.

175
00:15:27,596 --> 00:15:30,556
Hyung's mother suddenly disappeared.

176
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:32,636
What do I do?

177
00:15:32,636 --> 00:15:33,916
What's wrong?

178
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,886
I'm asking what I should do!

179
00:15:35,886 --> 00:15:38,036
It's okay, I'll look for him with you.

180
00:15:38,036 --> 00:15:41,846
You try calling Doctor Oh. I'll look for him with you. It's okay.

181
00:15:47,586 --> 00:15:48,716
Have you seen Water Bottle?

182
00:15:48,716 --> 00:15:50,136
Doctor Park? I didn't see him.

183
00:15:50,136 --> 00:15:53,136
After the surgery finished, didn't you go to the ICU together?

184
00:15:53,136 --> 00:15:55,876
What are you saying? They won't even let us near it.

185
00:15:55,876 --> 00:16:00,046
It's not just there, but even the surgery center is all surrounded by bodyguards.

186
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:02,226
- The surgery center also?
- Yes.

187
00:16:02,226 --> 00:16:07,166
So the patients that need surgery are all being transferred to the operating room in the new building.

188
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,276
Yesterday, today, what's happening?

189
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:26,796
- What are you doing?
- Hoon.

190
00:16:28,706 --> 00:16:31,146
This person is in a critical state.

191
00:16:31,146 --> 00:16:32,606
Yeah, so let's hurry to the operating room-

192
00:16:32,606 --> 00:16:37,396
Listen to me. Jang Seok Joo, if this man wakes up, we're in danger.

193
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:40,116
What do you mean by that?

194
00:16:45,856 --> 00:16:47,746
- Let go of that AMBU bag.
- What?

195
00:16:47,746 --> 00:16:49,836
Hoon.

196
00:16:49,836 --> 00:16:53,666
It's not just about us, but Mother will also be in danger.

197
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,076
He's breathing. He's still alive.

198
00:16:56,076 --> 00:16:58,806
The Prime Minister was to have the heart surgery anyway.

199
00:16:58,806 --> 00:17:02,916
He got shot in the heart. Even if he dies like this, nothing will seem strange.

200
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:08,306
Let go of that AMBU bag, after waiting for a bit, we can go into the operating room.

201
00:17:08,306 --> 00:17:10,906
- And if we say he died during the surgery-
- I can't do that.

202
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:13,286
Look properly at this man!

203
00:17:13,286 --> 00:17:16,896
It's Jang Seok Joo! Not just anyone, but Jang Seok Joo!

204
00:17:16,896 --> 00:17:18,776
He's the one who tried to kill you and your father.

205
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:21,756
And he made your mother into that state.

206
00:17:21,756 --> 00:17:25,076
- But...
- Let's turn a blind eye, just once.

207
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:30,516
You just need to let go of the AMBU bag.  Then it'll all be over.

208
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,606
What are you doing?

209
00:17:40,606 --> 00:17:42,096
- Let go.
- I can't let go!

210
00:17:42,096 --> 00:17:46,406
Why can't you let go? Because of me, you opened up my father's abdomen and took out his kidney.

211
00:17:46,406 --> 00:17:50,586
Because of that, you and I are left with scars that we won't ever be able to forget.

212
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:52,406
You said it was to save me, then

213
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:55,526
this time too, let go to save me.

214
00:17:55,526 --> 00:18:01,046
No, let go for the sake of saving you and your mother!

215
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,946
Hoon, please.

216
00:18:03,946 --> 00:18:07,706
If it wasn't for this person, we wouldn't be in pain like this.

217
00:18:07,706 --> 00:18:11,306
Yes, if that door to the Consulate had opened, then we would be

218
00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:14,336
living happily like those people outside of the hospital.

219
00:18:14,336 --> 00:18:17,586
Like your father wanted, we would've lived like that.

220
00:18:17,586 --> 00:18:20,656
That's why I can't let go even more.

221
00:18:20,656 --> 00:18:22,946
Do you know why Father died?

222
00:18:22,946 --> 00:18:26,486
Yes, he wanted us to live happily together.

223
00:18:26,486 --> 00:18:31,456
However my father didn't want me to be a crazy dog for Cha Jin Soo any longer.

224
00:18:31,456 --> 00:18:35,186
To tell me not to hold a scapel other than when I need to save lives, he took bullets for me.

225
00:18:35,186 --> 00:18:38,196
So how can I do that again?

226
00:18:38,196 --> 00:18:40,376
It's not just anyone, but this person is Jang Seok Joo!

227
00:18:40,376 --> 00:18:43,246
- In front of me, he's just a patient.
- Hoon!

228
00:18:43,246 --> 00:18:46,296
You know better than anyone else why I became a doctor.

229
00:18:46,296 --> 00:18:49,516
Healing someone who is sick, it's nothing more and nothing less than for that.

230
00:18:49,516 --> 00:18:52,976
What Father and I wanted, just doing what doctors should do.

231
00:18:52,976 --> 00:18:55,586
It's just that!

232
00:18:57,956 --> 00:18:59,996
I'm begging you.

233
00:18:59,996 --> 00:19:05,606
After I met you, I really didn't want to go back to the past.

234
00:19:05,606 --> 00:19:08,996
No matter what you say, I want to protect it.

235
00:19:08,996 --> 00:19:13,046
The first thing I thought, what Father said.

236
00:19:13,046 --> 00:19:15,046
If I don't save this person here,

237
00:19:15,046 --> 00:19:19,216
after meeting you, the thing I was trying to protect, all of that will collapse.

238
00:19:20,996 --> 00:19:24,726
That wish my father had for me, even by sacrificing himself,

239
00:19:24,726 --> 00:19:27,506
I would be throwing all of that away.

240
00:19:34,826 --> 00:19:39,206
Look, it's still beating.

241
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:47,016
It's the same heart.

242
00:19:47,016 --> 00:19:52,466
The ones we saved together: that baby, Jae Cheol's mom, that man.

243
00:19:52,466 --> 00:19:55,306
This heart is no different.

244
00:19:56,106 --> 00:19:58,416
Let's go, Jae Hee.

245
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,806
Please.

246
00:20:48,316 --> 00:20:52,376
Please call Dr. Oh and Nurse Min from the cardiothoracic ward. Quickly!

247
00:21:10,746 --> 00:21:12,216
What is this?

248
00:21:12,216 --> 00:21:13,896
Is he still alive?

249
00:21:13,896 --> 00:21:16,036
Do you call those words?

250
00:21:16,036 --> 00:21:19,066
Even if he dies, no one will hold you responsible.

251
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:20,256
What?

252
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,836
 How is Prime Minister Jang's condition?

253
00:21:22,836 --> 00:21:24,176
 He's seriously injured.

254
00:21:24,176 --> 00:21:27,916
 Then how about letting Dr. Park Hoon do the surgery?

255
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:34,456
 He was originally supposed to do Prime Minister's heart surgery.

256
00:21:34,456 --> 00:21:36,866
 And the two…

257
00:21:37,616 --> 00:21:40,506
 seem to have a good relationship.

258
00:21:40,506 --> 00:21:43,486
It's just as you heard. During Prime Minister Jang's surgery,

259
00:21:43,486 --> 00:21:46,876
it's okay if table death ( death during operation ) happens.

260
00:21:46,876 --> 00:21:50,196
If Prime Minister Jang awakes, nothing good will come for either of you.

261
00:21:50,196 --> 00:21:54,636
But if it's the opposite, you both… it's freedom.

262
00:21:54,636 --> 00:21:57,796
Like what you both wanted since the beginning...

263
00:21:57,796 --> 00:22:01,166
If you say that it was a condition even you couldn't help,

264
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:04,436
then with that, everything is over.

265
00:22:08,146 --> 00:22:11,016
A long time ago, my Master said this.

266
00:22:11,016 --> 00:22:13,336
"A policeman just has to be good at catching criminals."

267
00:22:13,336 --> 00:22:16,166
"A doctor just has to be good at fixing people."

268
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:21,466
I'm sorry, but I'm going to do just that, nothing more and nothing less.

269
00:22:23,566 --> 00:22:26,316
You've been doing quite a lot of terrible things.

270
00:22:26,316 --> 00:22:29,616
How can there be no one who tells me to save you?

271
00:22:32,716 --> 00:22:34,746
There are only the two of you.

272
00:22:34,746 --> 00:22:36,356
Are you saying you're still going to do it?

273
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:38,576
Just don't interfere.

274
00:22:50,116 --> 00:22:53,456
If the Prime Minister lives, we're all in danger.

275
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:56,046
I'll drag Park Hoon out.

276
00:22:56,046 --> 00:22:58,046
Just let him do it.

277
00:22:59,186 --> 00:23:00,836
Secretary Kim.

278
00:23:01,836 --> 00:23:06,456
Right now, that man's decision...

279
00:23:06,456 --> 00:23:08,516
I just want to observe.

280
00:23:13,396 --> 00:23:16,006
You're saying that the surgery started.

281
00:23:16,006 --> 00:23:17,636
Yes, Mr. President.

282
00:23:20,346 --> 00:23:28,276

283
00:23:38,346 --> 00:23:41,586
Around the pulmonary artery - two, in the interventricular septum - one. There's a total of three.

284
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,856
In the intraventricular septum?

285
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:46,146
That part might be complicated.

286
00:23:56,746 --> 00:24:00,846
Amazing. The success in the SAVER surgery wasn't anything.

287
00:24:20,596 --> 00:24:24,696
It seems like the Prime Minister will live.

288
00:24:40,676 --> 00:24:43,376
Now we just have the most complicated one.

289
00:25:18,056 --> 00:25:25,176
Somehow, it seems everyone has become on Park Hoon's side.

290
00:25:26,116 --> 00:25:29,016
What are you saying?

291
00:25:30,206 --> 00:25:34,606
You wanted table death to occur, but once the surgery succeeded,

292
00:25:34,606 --> 00:25:36,136
you're relieved.

293
00:25:36,136 --> 00:25:37,716
Me?

294
00:26:06,206 --> 00:26:08,176
Prime Minister! Prime Minister!

295
00:26:08,176 --> 00:26:10,026
Call the doctor! Quickly move him to the intensive care unit!

296
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,496
Yes.

297
00:26:22,786 --> 00:26:26,246
You saved Jang Seok Joo whom I thought would have died.

298
00:26:27,316 --> 00:26:30,116
Since the flame of power has sparked again,

299
00:26:30,116 --> 00:26:32,766
it's a matter of course that the garden tiger moths will gather.

300
00:26:36,086 --> 00:26:39,096
Soon, the garden tiger moths will be after you.

301
00:26:41,656 --> 00:26:45,526
Behind the hospital and across the bridge, I have a car ready.

302
00:26:46,486 --> 00:26:50,226
In the car, there is enough money and things you need

303
00:26:50,226 --> 00:26:52,826
to hide temporarily.

304
00:26:52,826 --> 00:26:55,296
As much as possible, go far away from Seoul.

305
00:26:55,296 --> 00:27:00,826
When I finish the preparation for you two to leave this nation, I'll contact you.

306
00:27:00,826 --> 00:27:01,736
How about my mother?

307
00:27:01,736 --> 00:27:03,436
Trust me.

308
00:27:03,436 --> 00:27:08,826
I'll take responsibility and help her escape.

309
00:27:39,406 --> 00:27:42,876
Yes, I'm at the surgery center at the new building.

310
00:27:42,876 --> 00:27:44,496
Who?

311
00:27:45,266 --> 00:27:47,576
Chang Yi?

312
00:27:47,576 --> 00:27:50,116
First, tell her to wait in the room.

313
00:27:50,946 --> 00:27:53,486
Are you saying that Jae Hee didn't come from Japan?

314
00:27:53,486 --> 00:27:56,246
Hyung told me not to say anything,

315
00:27:56,246 --> 00:27:59,036
but Hyung's mom disappeared and I can't contact Hyung.

316
00:27:59,036 --> 00:28:00,426
I'm anxious to death.

317
00:28:00,426 --> 00:28:03,586
This is the first time I'm hearing about Dr. Park's mother.

318
00:28:03,586 --> 00:28:05,236
What should I do, Doctor Oh?

319
00:28:05,236 --> 00:28:08,886
What if something happens to Hyung?

320
00:28:09,996 --> 00:28:11,556
 Dr. Kim Chi Gyu

321
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:15,856
Oh Doctor Kim.

322
00:28:15,856 --> 00:28:19,116
Is there something going on at this surgery center today?

323
00:28:20,676 --> 00:28:22,066
Yes, sir.

324
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:24,776
They say it's because of the Prime Minister's surgery.

325
00:28:24,776 --> 00:28:27,856
Oh, but they say he's in an ICU. Who did the surgery?

326
00:28:27,856 --> 00:28:30,466
I don't know that. By chance, have you seen Dr. Park?

327
00:28:30,466 --> 00:28:33,216
I caught a glimpse of him going towards the back of the hospital.

328
00:28:33,216 --> 00:28:34,986
Back?

329
00:28:55,876 --> 00:28:57,396
Jae Hee, you go first.

330
00:28:57,396 --> 00:28:58,626
Why?

331
00:28:58,626 --> 00:29:00,616
Hurry and go.

332
00:29:03,986 --> 00:29:06,096
Hoon.

333
00:29:16,386 --> 00:29:18,266
Cha Jin Soo.

334
00:29:25,256 --> 00:29:27,086
Go quickly.

335
00:29:50,336 --> 00:29:52,136
No!

336
00:30:10,836 --> 00:30:13,766
Hello? This is the police, right?

337
00:30:17,896 --> 00:30:20,016
Just hold on for a little longer, Jae Hee.

338
00:30:29,306 --> 00:30:31,406
Don't do it! Don't do it Song Jae Hee.

339
00:30:31,406 --> 00:30:33,366
Let go and run away Hoon.

340
00:30:33,366 --> 00:30:35,266
Don't do it, Song Jae Hee.

341
00:30:41,236 --> 00:30:43,216
Love is nice, isn't it?

342
00:30:44,016 --> 00:30:48,296
Wow, this is a scene I've seen a lot somewhere.

343
00:30:49,826 --> 00:30:51,766
Was it 2 years ago?

344
00:30:53,346 --> 00:30:57,266
Yeah, 2 years ago.

345
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:01,916
 Jae Hee.

346
00:31:01,916 --> 00:31:03,856
 Hoon.

347
00:31:06,146 --> 00:31:08,136
There's one thing that's different.

348
00:31:08,136 --> 00:31:10,686
I don't know who it was

349
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:15,756
but now there's no one here to help you two.

350
00:31:17,766 --> 00:31:19,506
Do you want to live?

351
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:24,676
Okay, fine. Let's do it like this.

352
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:28,356
If you let go of that hand, I'll let you live.

353
00:31:28,356 --> 00:31:29,396
Crazy bastard.

354
00:31:29,396 --> 00:31:31,886
Yeah, I'm crazy.

355
00:31:32,656 --> 00:31:35,256
It's not enough even if I grind up and drink both of you,

356
00:31:35,256 --> 00:31:37,706
but I'm saying that I'll let one of you go.

357
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:41,276
- Just kill me.
- No no.

358
00:31:42,006 --> 00:31:45,576
You have to live your whole life with the pain of killing your girl.

359
00:31:45,576 --> 00:31:48,206
Because that will hurt more for you.

360
00:31:48,936 --> 00:31:49,926
Right?

361
00:31:49,926 --> 00:31:54,316
Hoon. Let go of my hand quickly. Hurry.

362
00:31:59,266 --> 00:32:01,096
I'll count to 3.

363
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:02,916
One.

364
00:32:02,916 --> 00:32:04,436
Hoon!

365
00:32:05,546 --> 00:32:08,516
Jae Hee.

366
00:32:08,516 --> 00:32:10,636
Do you remember?

367
00:32:10,636 --> 00:32:15,376
My biggest regret was letting go of your hand that time.

368
00:32:15,376 --> 00:32:17,126
Hoon.

369
00:32:17,906 --> 00:32:21,876
I said I would go wherever you went.

370
00:32:21,876 --> 00:32:23,996
Don't do it, Hoon. Don't.

371
00:32:23,996 --> 00:32:25,406
Two!

372
00:32:26,346 --> 00:32:28,546
You see the river water, right?

373
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:31,276
No matter where that takes you,

374
00:32:31,276 --> 00:32:32,836
don't worry.

375
00:32:32,836 --> 00:32:36,026
Hoon... Hoon.

376
00:32:37,186 --> 00:32:38,946
Because I'll go with you.

377
00:32:40,996 --> 00:32:42,876
Three!

378
00:32:44,816 --> 00:32:46,566
Hyung!

379
00:32:52,916 --> 00:32:54,696
Hyung!

380
00:33:04,766 --> 00:33:13,016

381
00:33:25,306 --> 00:33:33,906
Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!

382
00:33:45,976 --> 00:33:47,556
Hyung!

383
00:33:48,496 --> 00:33:50,356
Hyung!

384
00:33:50,356 --> 00:33:52,156
Hyung!

385
00:33:53,896 --> 00:33:56,146
Hyung! Hyung!

386
00:34:07,446 --> 00:34:10,806
Hyung... Hyung!

387
00:34:18,416 --> 00:34:20,156
Hyung!

388
00:34:25,676 --> 00:34:27,436
 One year later

389
00:34:27,436 --> 00:34:31,386
 The following is news about the arrest and imprisonment of former Prime Minister Jang Seok Joo.

390
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:35,186
 Former Prime Minister Jang Seok who is charged with transferring illegal election funds

391
00:34:35,186 --> 00:34:37,276
 has been arrested today.

392
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:40,366
 It is reported that because of the Blue House's strong stance

393
00:34:40,366 --> 00:34:42,406
 and the public interest in the arrest and imprisonment of a corrupt public official,

394
00:34:42,406 --> 00:34:46,586
 there is no chance of compromise.

395
00:34:51,546 --> 00:34:55,546
There's a saying that if the water is clear, the fish won't gather.

396
00:34:57,076 --> 00:35:01,206
I can tell the fish who don't like clear water to go away.

397
00:35:02,006 --> 00:35:05,636
You were the type to reprimand adequately and compromise.

398
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:08,516
Since a year ago, it seems like you've changed.

399
00:35:11,926 --> 00:35:14,446
That friend said this.

400
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:17,366
"A policeman just has to be good at catching criminals."

401
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:21,476
"A doctor just has to be good at fixing people."

402
00:35:24,836 --> 00:35:29,196
Listening to that, a politician

403
00:35:29,196 --> 00:35:33,406
just has to practice clean politics.

404
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,906
If a person comes, you should pretend to notice.

405
00:35:45,906 --> 00:35:47,446
Oh.

406
00:35:49,256 --> 00:35:52,626
I have an interview for a manager's position here today. How do I look?

407
00:35:52,626 --> 00:35:55,636
Oh, beautiful.

408
00:35:56,806 --> 00:35:59,616
Right? I made a huge decision to buy this outfit.

409
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:05,366
No, I mean that your unyielding spirit that allowed you to start from a part timer to manager is beautiful.

410
00:36:07,196 --> 00:36:09,506
Your eye for looking at people really changed.

411
00:36:09,506 --> 00:36:14,806
Well, your body is beautiful too.

412
00:36:17,766 --> 00:36:22,216
Honey. I'll die.

413
00:36:30,316 --> 00:36:32,486
Pull it gently.

414
00:36:35,706 --> 00:36:37,576
I said pull it gently.

415
00:36:37,576 --> 00:36:39,766
I'm sorry, Doctor Oh.

416
00:36:39,766 --> 00:36:42,246
This patient has myocardial infarction and renal failure.

417
00:36:42,246 --> 00:36:45,776
Because of the  septal rupture, it's already frail, so you can't be pulling that hard.

418
00:36:45,776 --> 00:36:47,846
Yes. I'm sorry.

419
00:36:47,846 --> 00:36:50,586
If you don't do it properly either, I'll scold you, too.

420
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:52,246
Yes.

421
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:09,666
Doctor Oh, do you know this?

422
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:10,956
What?

423
00:37:10,956 --> 00:37:12,826
Today's patient.

424
00:37:14,306 --> 00:37:18,576
I know, when I first met Doctor Park.

425
00:37:18,576 --> 00:37:22,156
That patient also had a renal failure.

426
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:25,666
 I am done with the septal rupture repair. You just need to work on the CABG.

427
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:28,476
 It's not a surgery you can handle, Doctor Oh.

428
00:37:31,286 --> 00:37:33,876
At that time you were really unlikable.

429
00:37:34,656 --> 00:37:36,396
Right?

430
00:37:39,086 --> 00:37:40,896
It's time.

431
00:37:46,416 --> 00:37:50,766
Oh right, I heard Dr. Keum is becoming an assistant professor next month.

432
00:37:50,766 --> 00:37:53,296
Pretty soon,  he'll become a father too.

433
00:37:53,296 --> 00:37:55,036
Really?

434
00:37:55,036 --> 00:37:57,766
It's only 3 months in...

435
00:37:57,766 --> 00:37:59,966
Congratulations!

436
00:38:11,106 --> 00:38:14,246
Congratulations on becoming a father Doctor Keum.

437
00:38:15,116 --> 00:38:18,686
I was going to say it, but you already told her?

438
00:38:18,686 --> 00:38:19,906
I'm sorry.

439
00:38:19,906 --> 00:38:21,696
Anyway, congratulations.

440
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,636
Yes.

441
00:38:22,636 --> 00:38:25,266
Doctor Oh, you have to hurry too.

442
00:38:27,406 --> 00:38:29,326
So what are the symptoms of MS?

443
00:38:29,326 --> 00:38:30,846
Uh, difficulty of breathing and...

444
00:38:30,846 --> 00:38:33,196
Looking at you, I'm having a difficult time breathing. I am.

445
00:38:33,196 --> 00:38:36,926
Atrial fibrillation, chest pain, a stroke due to hemoptysis or thrombosis. Okay?

446
00:38:36,926 --> 00:38:40,716
Hey, just finish up and get on.

447
00:38:40,716 --> 00:38:43,636
Study properly, I'm going to ask you again.

448
00:38:43,636 --> 00:38:46,546
I'm Kim Chi Gyu. And you, stop crying. Don't cry!

449
00:38:46,546 --> 00:38:49,916
Gosh, gosh, seriously. You're being too hard on the kids, Dr. Kim.

450
00:38:49,916 --> 00:38:53,546
The kids come to the hospital thinking they're here  to play. Isn't that really too much?

451
00:38:53,546 --> 00:38:55,756
That was exactly you a year ago.

452
00:38:55,756 --> 00:38:58,246
Bong Hyun Hyung, when did I-

453
00:39:07,836 --> 00:39:10,616
Wow, our Chief Moon is really nervous.

454
00:39:10,616 --> 00:39:14,596
This is the first time I've been this nervous since the class president election in elementary school.

455
00:39:14,596 --> 00:39:16,616
Don't be too nervous.

456
00:39:16,616 --> 00:39:19,226
Our hospital's director is always from the Cardiothoracic Department.

457
00:39:19,226 --> 00:39:22,816
But Professor Ha from Orthopedics is such a tough competitor though.

458
00:39:22,816 --> 00:39:25,936
But, when you become the hospital director, what are you going to do?

459
00:39:25,936 --> 00:39:27,726
What do you mean?

460
00:39:27,726 --> 00:39:31,746
I have to give my all for Myeongwoo, what else?

461
00:39:36,976 --> 00:39:39,796
But it feels sort of empty.

462
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:42,996
- What is? 
- They say that you might not notice the filled spaces,

463
00:39:42,996 --> 00:39:45,436
but you always notice the empty spaces.

464
00:39:45,436 --> 00:39:50,146
There is a person that would have been nice to have...

465
00:39:50,146 --> 00:39:52,206
in here.

466
00:40:01,576 --> 00:40:05,446
I just... we're almost there so bear it a bit.

467
00:40:05,446 --> 00:40:09,396
When I'm nervous, gas fills up.

468
00:40:09,396 --> 00:40:13,306
Gosh, Chief. Really. You're too much.

469
00:40:13,306 --> 00:40:15,026
We're almost there.

470
00:40:15,026 --> 00:40:17,516
Why isn't the door opening?

471
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:21,016
Now, we'll invite the 16th Director of Myeongwoo University Hospital up to the stage.

472
00:40:21,016 --> 00:40:23,806
We present the new hospital director.

473
00:40:35,046 --> 00:40:39,176
Hello everyone, I'm the new director, Moon Hyung Wook.

474
00:40:40,116 --> 00:40:43,776
To the many doctors who have supported me all this time, thank you.

475
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:47,126
Especially to my superiors, former Chairman Oh Joon Gyu,

476
00:40:47,126 --> 00:40:50,166
and the current Chairman Han Sang Dae.

477
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:55,816
And Chief Park Doo Ho of Nephrology who believed and supported me until the end.

478
00:40:55,816 --> 00:40:59,406
And Chief In Seong Hoon of Endocrinology.

479
00:40:59,406 --> 00:41:02,116
Chief Seo Woo Jin of Neurosurgery.

480
00:41:02,116 --> 00:41:05,926
Chief Yang Seok Cheon of Radiology.

481
00:41:05,926 --> 00:41:10,036
And Chief Yang Choon Man of Rehabilitation.

482
00:41:10,036 --> 00:41:12,526
Chief Kim Jae Ban of Family Medicine.

483
00:41:12,526 --> 00:41:15,156
And Chief Park Sang Tae of Pathology.

484
00:41:15,156 --> 00:41:17,636
Chief Han Bong Hee of Opthamology.

485
00:41:17,636 --> 00:41:21,336
Are you sure we picked the right director?

486
00:41:21,336 --> 00:41:22,586
I know right?

487
00:41:22,586 --> 00:41:24,786
Thank you.

488
00:41:34,856 --> 00:41:37,926
What are you doing here?

489
00:41:37,926 --> 00:41:40,866
Because I'm so happy.

490
00:41:40,866 --> 00:41:44,726
Chief, I mean Director.

491
00:41:44,726 --> 00:41:50,016
Park Hoon is looking from above, right?

492
00:41:52,796 --> 00:41:57,076
If he knew that I became the Director,

493
00:41:57,076 --> 00:42:00,016
he would've liked it the most.

494
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:18,756
 Park Hoon

495
00:42:19,736 --> 00:42:22,146
His name on the locker is still there.

496
00:42:22,146 --> 00:42:27,456
I really will fulfill my father's wish,

497
00:42:27,456 --> 00:42:30,286
and will run this hospital well.

498
00:42:31,246 --> 00:42:33,946
I'll try to make a good hospital.

499
00:42:55,096 --> 00:42:56,586
Doctor.

500
00:42:58,066 --> 00:42:59,676
Miss Chang Yi.

501
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:11,746
Hyung would've gone to a nice place, right?

502
00:43:12,996 --> 00:43:15,926
Since he went with the person he liked.

503
00:43:19,126 --> 00:43:22,756
But why do you call Doctor Park "Hyung"?

504
00:43:25,756 --> 00:43:30,016
Even though I know there is Jae Hee Unni, if I don't call him that,

505
00:43:31,436 --> 00:43:34,106
I thought I might like him.

506
00:43:40,616 --> 00:43:43,116
I knew this would happen so I wasn't going to come...

507
00:44:04,396 --> 00:44:11,196

508
00:44:13,676 --> 00:44:18,706
Don't be too sad. I'm sure we'll meet again someday.

509
00:44:18,706 --> 00:44:21,396
Are you going to another hospital?

510
00:44:22,696 --> 00:44:25,056
The clinic where the child's father is working at.

511
00:44:26,026 --> 00:44:28,136
Doctor Yang?

512
00:44:28,136 --> 00:44:29,656
You knew?

513
00:44:29,656 --> 00:44:32,706
Of course, my tact level is 100.

514
00:44:35,496 --> 00:44:39,216
Then work hard.  I'll come visit once in a while.

515
00:44:53,216 --> 00:44:56,646
- You said Jae Joon is here.
- Yeah, in there.

516
00:44:57,846 --> 00:44:59,816
Wait.

517
00:44:59,816 --> 00:45:01,646
What if Father gets worked up again?

518
00:45:01,646 --> 00:45:06,146
I was here the whole time. I think they're just talking.

519
00:45:06,146 --> 00:45:10,986
First, let's wait since they have a lot to talk about.

520
00:45:15,166 --> 00:45:18,246
You came to apologize to me?

521
00:45:18,246 --> 00:45:19,476
Yes.

522
00:45:19,476 --> 00:45:21,486
Not to get my apology?

523
00:45:21,486 --> 00:45:25,286
I think I already received your apology.

524
00:45:26,516 --> 00:45:28,236
I never did that.

525
00:45:29,466 --> 00:45:33,446
I'm helping a friend at a law firm in America.

526
00:45:34,326 --> 00:45:36,346
Law Firm?

527
00:45:36,346 --> 00:45:39,196
Since I no longer have a right to be a doctor.

528
00:45:42,366 --> 00:45:44,536
I saw an interesting file there.

529
00:45:44,536 --> 00:45:48,816
It was about medical malpractice lawsuits during the past year of the main hospitals in Korea.

530
00:45:48,816 --> 00:45:51,046
I don't want to hear it so stop.

531
00:45:51,046 --> 00:45:54,656
The standard was about 1/10 of the other main hospitals.

532
00:45:54,656 --> 00:45:59,306
There was a comment that especially noted the hospital's active effort and sincere apology in handling these cases-

533
00:45:59,306 --> 00:46:03,676
That's because I'm out of the Chairman's position.

534
00:46:03,676 --> 00:46:08,866
Even if you stay here, I know that you still make every small or big decision regarding the hospital.

535
00:46:11,356 --> 00:46:14,396
If my parents knew about this as well...

536
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:16,516
Won't you shut up?

537
00:46:17,436 --> 00:46:20,016
I don't want to hear it, so go out.

538
00:46:31,216 --> 00:46:33,786
What is it that you want to apologize to me for?

539
00:46:40,156 --> 00:46:43,656
It's an apology I want to give to Soo Hyeon's father.

540
00:46:46,466 --> 00:46:50,496
Because I was foolish, I hurt Soo Hyeon's heart.

541
00:46:53,386 --> 00:46:55,596
I don't know if the chance will come, but

542
00:46:55,596 --> 00:47:00,236
some day, I would really like to receive forgiveness for my wrongdoing.

543
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:32,306
I'll only forgive Soo Hyeon's Han Jae Joon.

544
00:47:34,236 --> 00:47:35,766
Father.

545
00:47:40,136 --> 00:47:42,696
Why are you there?

546
00:47:42,696 --> 00:47:45,606
Well, I should go now.

547
00:47:47,246 --> 00:47:49,506
I should go.

548
00:48:04,116 --> 00:48:05,516
I'm sorry.

549
00:48:08,606 --> 00:48:13,276
Jae Joon. Should I call you Seung Hoon?

550
00:48:15,816 --> 00:48:20,016
I only thought about how you lied.

551
00:48:20,016 --> 00:48:25,886
Actually, you must've gone through pain much worse than that.

552
00:48:26,826 --> 00:48:30,396
Are you forgiving me?

553
00:48:32,086 --> 00:48:34,796
The person who should ask for forgiveness is me.

554
00:48:36,196 --> 00:48:40,236
To be honest, there's another person we should ask forgiveness from.

555
00:48:44,226 --> 00:48:45,896
Doctor Park.

556
00:48:50,726 --> 00:48:52,926
Give me some of your time tomorrow.

557
00:48:52,926 --> 00:48:54,546
Tomorrow?

558
00:48:54,546 --> 00:48:59,396
There were too many things we didn't know about Doctor Park and Doctor Han.

559
00:48:59,396 --> 00:49:02,256
Doctor Park and Doctor Han?

560
00:49:07,216 --> 00:49:09,386
What about Doctor Park and Doctor Han?

561
00:49:12,066 --> 00:49:15,246
This is something I also heard from someone named, Mr. Jang not too long ago.

562
00:49:16,786 --> 00:49:19,896
I couldn't believe it at first, too.

563
00:49:19,896 --> 00:49:22,016
About those two people.

564
00:49:55,796 --> 00:49:58,856
That bright Dr. Park we used to know

565
00:49:58,856 --> 00:50:03,286
actually held all those things inside his heart.

566
00:50:05,266 --> 00:50:10,286
Doctor Han, no, Jae Hee as well.

567
00:50:12,506 --> 00:50:14,736
Are you alright?

568
00:50:14,736 --> 00:50:16,596
I...

569
00:50:17,626 --> 00:50:21,056
I'm too sorry to those two.

570
00:50:21,056 --> 00:50:23,786
Not even knowing that,

571
00:50:23,786 --> 00:50:28,006
I'm embarrassed at myself for confessing to Doctor Park that I liked him.

572
00:50:28,006 --> 00:50:30,796
How funny I must've seemed.

573
00:50:31,766 --> 00:50:36,256
Without knowing much at all about their sadness,

574
00:50:36,256 --> 00:50:39,936
I asked him to accept my feelings.

575
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:42,266
I'm embarrassed too.

576
00:50:42,266 --> 00:50:46,486
Doctor Park... I only thought he was young and his skills were good.

577
00:50:46,486 --> 00:50:51,196
I didn't even imagine how those surgery skills were acquired.

578
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:59,586
Come out, there's someone you need to meet.

579
00:51:00,736 --> 00:51:02,746
Someone to meet?

580
00:51:02,746 --> 00:51:04,626
That person.

581
00:51:06,276 --> 00:51:09,026
Yes, that person.

582
00:51:09,026 --> 00:51:11,266
 Health Care Center

583
00:51:18,306 --> 00:51:21,036
Why are you hitting someone else's butt?

584
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:24,116
Because it looks attractive.

585
00:51:24,116 --> 00:51:27,356
Why? I prescribed your husband's medicine for enterogastritis yesterday.

586
00:51:27,356 --> 00:51:29,066
You have guests.

587
00:51:29,066 --> 00:51:30,736
Guests?

588
00:51:30,736 --> 00:51:33,256
Stop, Ahjumma!

589
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,526
Who are they?

590
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:49,016
Quack, hello!

591
00:51:55,626 --> 00:51:57,866
Do what you need to do quickly. It's nerve-racking.

592
00:51:57,866 --> 00:52:00,436
I saw you fall from there.

593
00:52:01,966 --> 00:52:04,496
I thought you were dead.

594
00:52:05,946 --> 00:52:08,086
That you're alive...

595
00:52:08,086 --> 00:52:11,646
it would've been fine if you had just told me that, you jerk!

596
00:52:20,536 --> 00:52:22,956
Stop.

597
00:52:38,356 --> 00:52:40,466
If you hit like that, don't you get hungry?

598
00:52:40,466 --> 00:52:42,916
Shut up.

599
00:52:42,916 --> 00:52:45,866
Since you're here, eat before you leave.

600
00:52:50,356 --> 00:52:52,346
 Reservation Complete!

601
00:52:52,346 --> 00:52:54,956
What happened after you fell into the water?

602
00:52:54,956 --> 00:52:58,436
I couldn't find out up to that either.

603
00:52:58,436 --> 00:53:01,266
There was someone who helped.

604
00:53:03,546 --> 00:53:05,976
Did you sleep well?

605
00:53:05,976 --> 00:53:09,386
You look prettier after you slept.

606
00:53:10,786 --> 00:53:13,126
Then please rest.

607
00:53:29,436 --> 00:53:32,306
It's what you asked for.

608
00:53:48,216 --> 00:53:50,596
Thank you.

609
00:53:54,476 --> 00:53:57,826
Your son has also left a present behind.

610
00:54:24,816 --> 00:54:26,916
Open it.

611
00:54:38,156 --> 00:54:43,246
Rather than&nbsp;a law firm assistant, that suits you much better.

612
00:54:46,446 --> 00:54:49,326
Oh, what about Jae Hee?

613
00:54:50,106 --> 00:54:53,706
Jae Hee applied for refuge in China.

614
00:54:53,706 --> 00:54:56,496
She's in China right now then?

615
00:55:27,026 --> 00:55:31,686
Because of Jae Hee's dual identity, it was difficult for her application to be accepted.

616
00:55:31,686 --> 00:55:36,316
Luckily, there is a friend I know. So her application barely went through 4 months ago.

617
00:55:38,196 --> 00:55:43,156
After that, with her refugee status, she was able to seek  political refuge in Korea.

618
00:55:44,316 --> 00:55:51,116
The reason I came to Korea yesterday is because today is the day Jae Hee comes to Korea.

619
00:56:11,746 --> 00:56:16,656
Jae Joon, you said you don't believe in fate right?

620
00:56:16,656 --> 00:56:18,936
Yeah.

621
00:56:18,936 --> 00:56:20,256
Is it still the same?

622
00:56:20,256 --> 00:56:22,216
No.

623
00:56:23,466 --> 00:56:25,796
Now I believe in fate too.

624
00:56:27,306 --> 00:56:31,706
