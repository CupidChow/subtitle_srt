1
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:29,933

2
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:37,333
Why are you flipping out saying that you're going to perform a surgery on our patient without permission?

3
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:40,733
What are you doing? Hurry and move the patient to her room!

4
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:41,533
Yes, I got it.

5
00:00:41,533 --> 00:00:44,233
Let me make a request.

6
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:45,133
What request?

7
00:00:45,133 --> 00:00:48,633
If the patient has another shock, it'll be very dangerous. So...

8
00:00:50,743 --> 00:00:54,283
I've done hundreds of more surgeries than you have.

9
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:56,633
How dare you flap your mouth?

10
00:00:56,633 --> 00:01:00,033
Professor Cho. Isn't this too harsh?

11
00:01:00,033 --> 00:01:02,033
Oh Soo Hyeon, shut your trap.

12
00:01:02,033 --> 00:01:03,933
Professor Cho, your words are out of hand.

13
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:09,233
- How dare you flap your trap...
- What are you doing in front of the surgery room right now?!

14
00:01:10,233 --> 00:01:14,633
Hey, Chief Han. Is this how you train your kids?

15
00:01:17,433 --> 00:01:19,733
In the Cardiovascular Department, do you train people by beating them up?

16
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:20,633
What?

17
00:01:20,633 --> 00:01:22,533
- Aigoo, Professor.
- Let me go!

18
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:24,333
- He didn't start the surgery yet.
- Let go, you bastard!

19
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:25,133
Just stop.

20
00:01:25,143 --> 00:01:27,213
Aren't you going to let go?

21
00:01:27,213 --> 00:01:29,813
Stop it. We're not going to do it!

22
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:32,533
Let go!

23
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:48,033
Are you okay?

24
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:53,233
What in the world is going on?

25
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:57,033
I found the patient.

26
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:01,333
I'm talking about our second match.

27
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:06,233
I'm saying that I found the patient for that.

28
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:28,433
 Episode 12

29
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,733
Take a look.

30
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:45,433
Did you cause all that trouble because of that patient?

31
00:02:48,633 --> 00:02:49,733
What does it look like to you?

32
00:02:49,733 --> 00:02:53,543
There's bleeding near the RCA   stent.

33
00:02:54,143 --> 00:02:57,543
Were you going to do the surgery because of that?

34
00:02:57,543 --> 00:03:00,693
That much bleeding can be stopped naturally.

35
00:03:00,693 --> 00:03:02,723
If pericardial tamponade does not happen, you don't have to worry too...

36
00:03:02,723 --> 00:03:05,453
What if pericardial tamponade already happened?

37
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:09,523
Saying that a pericardial tamponade already happened  means that the chance of bleeding stopping naturally is slight.

38
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,443
It means I don't think it's the kind of bleeding that can be stopped with medication.

39
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:14,673
The Cardiology department will determine that.

40
00:03:14,673 --> 00:03:17,373
How about we try to determine it?

41
00:03:18,713 --> 00:03:22,933
You didn't forget that you told me to choose the patient for the second match, did you?

42
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:27,763
That... I'm saying let's go with this patient.

43
00:03:27,763 --> 00:03:29,133
Then,

44
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:30,423
will you win if you perform the surgery?

45
00:03:30,423 --> 00:03:32,283
Of course.

46
00:03:32,283 --> 00:03:35,133
You win if you do the surgery and save her.

47
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:37,153
That sounds good.

48
00:03:39,513 --> 00:03:41,293
Doctor Han.

49
00:03:41,863 --> 00:03:43,953
Let's go.

50
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:57,233
This kind of match is not bad. Should I call for 100 matches?

51
00:03:57,233 --> 00:04:00,333
If Chief Han Jae Joon performs the surgery, you will be losing.

52
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,903
Aigoo, it's fine as long as the patient lives, what's so important about that?

53
00:04:02,903 --> 00:04:04,293
Doctor Park.

54
00:04:04,293 --> 00:04:07,833
Don't worry. Even if I lose this match, it will be 1:1, so I will have another match left.

55
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,463
I'll just win that one.  Right?

56
00:04:10,463 --> 00:04:12,363
I'm going.

57
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:22,243
Can you do it, Jae Joon?

58
00:04:22,243 --> 00:04:26,653
I have to. The patient could pass away if left alone.

59
00:04:26,653 --> 00:04:28,833
The Cardiology Department will not step back.

60
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,593
I can get permission from the Chairman.

61
00:04:31,593 --> 00:04:36,563
If I tell him the procedural complications, he will approve of the surgery.

62
00:04:37,773 --> 00:04:40,223
But, you know,

63
00:04:40,223 --> 00:04:42,763
what happens if there is a problem with this patient?

64
00:04:42,763 --> 00:04:43,833
What do you mean a problem?

65
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,893
This case might be the result of medical malpractice.

66
00:04:46,893 --> 00:04:52,323
If Cardiology made a definite grave mistake, what should we do?

67
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:05,473
How many years is he in?

68
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:07,953
3 years into residency, Chairman.

69
00:05:07,953 --> 00:05:11,323
How can you give a professors-only stent surgery to a 3rd year resident?

70
00:05:11,323 --> 00:05:13,493
I'm sorry, Chairman.

71
00:05:13,493 --> 00:05:14,583
Get out.

72
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,303
Yes. I'm sorry.

73
00:05:19,293 --> 00:05:21,583
What should we do, Chairman?

74
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:27,273
If the fact that a resident performed the surgery without the guardian's consent is revealed, it'll lead to a lawsuit.

75
00:05:27,273 --> 00:05:30,093
Discipline him well and send him to the branch.

76
00:05:30,093 --> 00:05:32,693
I got it, Chairman.

77
00:05:32,693 --> 00:05:34,103
The family doesn't know yet right?

78
00:05:34,103 --> 00:05:35,093
Yes.

79
00:05:35,093 --> 00:05:35,733
What about the patient?

80
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:40,453
There is some bleeding but it will stop naturally.

81
00:05:40,453 --> 00:05:46,143
It has to. If not, it will be the end for you, this hospital, and me. The end! The end!

82
00:05:49,973 --> 00:05:52,663
Jae Cheol.

83
00:05:52,663 --> 00:05:53,553
What is this?

84
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:57,093
It's a pin. I'll put it on for you.  Come here.

85
00:05:59,573 --> 00:06:01,413
Aigoo. How is it?

86
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:03,763
You're really pretty.

87
00:06:04,413 --> 00:06:05,713
Thank you.

88
00:06:05,713 --> 00:06:08,193
I think I'll get better if you recover quickly.

89
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:09,933
Okay.

90
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:16,443
 I want to forget everything that has to do with you. Both you and Hoon.

91
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:19,843
-  Hoon's mother... 
  - I'm really sick and tired of it!

92
00:06:24,713 --> 00:06:26,993
Oh, Doctor.

93
00:06:33,073 --> 00:06:35,903
Okay. Is your mother doing alright?

94
00:06:35,903 --> 00:06:39,233
Yes. But why didn't you do the surgery yet?

95
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:44,773
There was some situation. But we will do it soon.

96
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:46,733
Will you do it?

97
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:51,653
I might do it or the boss of the Thoracic Department might do it.

98
00:06:51,653 --> 00:06:53,553
Boss?

99
00:06:53,553 --> 00:06:57,033
His name is Han Jae Joon. His personality is crap but he is very skillful.

100
00:06:57,033 --> 00:06:59,633
I like you better though.

101
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:06,073
You must have a great relationship with your mother.

102
00:07:06,073 --> 00:07:08,603
Of course. She's our mom.

103
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,733
Our mom?

104
00:07:29,413 --> 00:07:30,853
This is Kim Tae Sool.

105
00:07:30,853 --> 00:07:33,743
 The Prime Minister is looking for you.

106
00:07:33,743 --> 00:07:35,423
Tell him I'm outside.

107
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,473
 Where should I say you went out to?

108
00:07:38,473 --> 00:07:42,493
He will know if you tell him I went to deliver a doll.

109
00:08:17,603 --> 00:08:20,103
Did you come, Hoon?

110
00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:01,483
So, Doctor, you don't have a mother?

111
00:09:01,483 --> 00:09:04,523
There's no mom like yours.

112
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:06,223
What is that supposed to mean?

113
00:09:06,223 --> 00:09:08,283
There's something like that.

114
00:09:08,283 --> 00:09:10,073
Oh, there's your father.

115
00:09:10,073 --> 00:09:12,013
Father.

116
00:09:12,013 --> 00:09:13,843
Here.

117
00:09:23,433 --> 00:09:24,663
Ah, you surprised me.

118
00:09:24,663 --> 00:09:26,103
You used your brain a little bit.

119
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:27,073
About what?

120
00:09:27,073 --> 00:09:31,433
I heard you handed over a fantastic patient.

121
00:09:31,933 --> 00:09:34,033
A patient is a patient. What's so fantastic about her?

122
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:36,213
Hey, that patient

123
00:09:36,213 --> 00:09:39,313
can go all the way to a lawsuit.

124
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:43,003
The Cardiology people made a serious mistake.

125
00:09:43,003 --> 00:09:48,013
Stent surgery should've been done by a professor but a 3rd year resident did it.

126
00:09:52,743 --> 00:09:56,333
I'm sorry, Chief. I can't tell you anymore about it.

127
00:09:57,523 --> 00:10:00,873
Tell me one thing clearly, Dr. Kim.

128
00:10:00,873 --> 00:10:05,273
Is it really true that you performed that patient's surgery?

129
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:12,343
If a resident performs a surgery without the consent of a guardian,

130
00:10:12,343 --> 00:10:15,483
it's a medical malpractice lawsuit that will be in a quandary.

131
00:10:15,483 --> 00:10:17,033
Then it'll become difficult...

132
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:17,723
What is?

133
00:10:17,723 --> 00:10:19,773
What if Chief Han says he won't do it?

134
00:10:19,773 --> 00:10:22,353
Hey, why are you worrying about that?

135
00:10:22,353 --> 00:10:25,223
If he doesn't do it, it's 2:0. It's over right there and then!

136
00:10:25,223 --> 00:10:27,713
At times, really...

137
00:10:27,713 --> 00:10:29,553
you seem suspicious.

138
00:10:29,553 --> 00:10:31,383
- About what?
- Are you really a doctor?

139
00:10:31,383 --> 00:10:33,073
Of course I'm a doctor, or am I a patient?

140
00:10:33,073 --> 00:10:34,833
You look like it.

141
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,413
You are a serious patient.

142
00:10:36,413 --> 00:10:40,193
You are a patient!

143
00:10:40,193 --> 00:10:42,393
You chose a patient for the competition?

144
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:43,913
Yes.

145
00:10:43,913 --> 00:10:47,003
Doctor Park proposed it, and I've accepted it.

146
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:49,023
Ah, is that so?

147
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:52,283
Let's see.  Shall I take a look?

148
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,653
  A hospital where patients come first
Myeongwoo University Hospital

149
00:11:03,103 --> 00:11:07,813
It's simple. We decided that as long as the surgery is successful, I win.

150
00:11:10,323 --> 00:11:12,093
You can't. Not this patient.

151
00:11:12,093 --> 00:11:15,593
If I don't do this, Prime Minister's surgery will be handed over to Dr. Park.

152
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:17,723
Even so, you can't.

153
00:11:18,673 --> 00:11:21,523
Is it because of the medical malpractice lawsuit?

154
00:11:22,323 --> 00:11:25,863
Did you know about that? And yet you're still wanting to do the surgery?

155
00:11:25,863 --> 00:11:28,903
If it's about that problem, we can just explain that there was a mistake during the surgery.

156
00:11:28,903 --> 00:11:32,003
Do you think the guardians will be fooled that easily?

157
00:11:32,003 --> 00:11:34,553
- I will persuade them.
- Persuade?

158
00:11:34,553 --> 00:11:37,353
You're wrong.  Although threatening might work.

159
00:11:37,353 --> 00:11:40,233
I've never seen a person give up a medical malpractice  lawsuit by persuading them.

160
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:42,573
If we leave it this way just because of that, the patient's condition will get worse.

161
00:11:42,573 --> 00:11:45,113
The patient can die, Chairman.

162
00:11:45,113 --> 00:11:47,943
There are plenty of patients who die from complications.

163
00:11:47,943 --> 00:11:50,893
We can save the patient if we do the surgery.

164
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:54,463
You can't possibly just watch a patient because we are afraid of a lawsuit.

165
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,963
- Cardiology says they can treat her.
- Chairman!

166
00:12:02,143 --> 00:12:04,573
Do you know the saying, "let sleeping dogs lie"?

167
00:12:04,573 --> 00:12:09,023
Touching the matter unnecessarily, if they find out a 3rd year resident performed the surgery instead of the professor,

168
00:12:09,023 --> 00:12:12,273
we will be eliminated from the candidates for the Prime Minister's surgery team immediately.

169
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,923
If we acknowledge what we did wrong and persuade the patient's guardian,

170
00:12:14,923 --> 00:12:16,983
we can block the lawsuit.

171
00:12:16,983 --> 00:12:19,003
Shut your mouth!

172
00:12:19,883 --> 00:12:22,963
Did you already forget

173
00:12:22,963 --> 00:12:25,353
that you begged on your knees saying that you'll do whatever I tell you to do?

174
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:30,193
What's the reason? What's the reason for showing sudden interest in this patient?

175
00:12:33,623 --> 00:12:35,553
I'm sorry, Chairman.

176
00:12:37,063 --> 00:12:39,963
- But as a doctor...
- As a doctor?

177
00:12:39,963 --> 00:12:44,733
As a doctor you can't stay still because of your conscience?

178
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:46,023
Fine then.

179
00:12:46,023 --> 00:12:50,773
If you really want it like that, I'll appoint this patient for your second match.

180
00:12:55,173 --> 00:12:57,733
Yes, Chairman.

181
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:59,083
Pardon?

182
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:02,003
Right now to your office? Yes.

183
00:13:02,003 --> 00:13:06,863
Yes. Then I will see you soon.

184
00:13:06,863 --> 00:13:09,383
- Let's go.
- Why?

185
00:13:09,383 --> 00:13:11,283
Chairman wants to see you.

186
00:13:11,283 --> 00:13:13,343
I don't want to see him.

187
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,853
Aish.

188
00:13:14,853 --> 00:13:18,253
Stop bitching and follow me.

189
00:13:24,163 --> 00:13:25,503
Yes.

190
00:13:26,513 --> 00:13:28,123
I called you here because of the second competition.

191
00:13:28,123 --> 00:13:31,573
Yes, I know that the two of them decided on it.

192
00:13:31,573 --> 00:13:33,403
I know that!

193
00:13:34,023 --> 00:13:35,833
Follow me!

194
00:13:40,313 --> 00:13:47,373

195
00:13:52,563 --> 00:13:56,493
You must all know what kind of patient it is.

196
00:13:56,493 --> 00:13:59,423
- Is it 1:0 now?
- Yes, Chairman.

197
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,253
As you all want,

198
00:14:03,253 --> 00:14:05,313
we'll do so with this patient.

199
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:09,123
However, there is a basis to win or defeat.

200
00:14:09,123 --> 00:14:11,543
Is it a victory if you succeed in the surgery, Chairman?

201
00:14:11,543 --> 00:14:15,683
No. The guy who doesn't touch this patient is the winner.

202
00:14:16,663 --> 00:14:17,873
Excuse me?

203
00:14:17,873 --> 00:14:21,643
The person who does the surgery on this patient is the loser. Do you understand?

204
00:14:23,903 --> 00:14:26,933
Chief Han, you lost once right?

205
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:29,773
If Chief Han ends up doing the surgery on this patient, it'll be 2 losses.

206
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:33,363
Because we are playing 3 games, there's no need for a third round.

207
00:14:34,413 --> 00:14:37,583
Chief Han, you are finished with that. Do you understand?

208
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:41,573
The time limit is up to tomorrow. If neither of you do it,

209
00:14:41,573 --> 00:14:45,023
we will choose another patient after that and do it.  Understand?

210
00:14:52,323 --> 00:14:54,703
Are you going to do the surgery?

211
00:14:54,703 --> 00:14:56,503
Let's pick a different patient.

212
00:14:56,503 --> 00:15:00,283
You will wait it out? When the patient is like this?

213
00:15:01,343 --> 00:15:05,293
Then I will do it. Let me just ask for your team's quack.

214
00:15:05,293 --> 00:15:08,433
I don't think it'll be a simple surgery.

215
00:15:28,013 --> 00:15:29,973
Doctor!

216
00:15:33,423 --> 00:15:36,463
I will do your mom's surgery, so wait a little bit.

217
00:15:36,463 --> 00:15:38,183
Really?

218
00:15:38,183 --> 00:15:42,433
First of all, I need to gather all the people to do the surgery with.

219
00:15:43,703 --> 00:15:46,433
What again?

220
00:15:48,003 --> 00:15:51,453
- Don't worry. Okay?
- Yes, Doctor.

221
00:16:01,063 --> 00:16:02,573
Take it off!

222
00:16:02,573 --> 00:16:05,643
What are you doing?

223
00:16:06,303 --> 00:16:09,473
- Get off work right now. You are on break until tomorrow.
- A break?

224
00:16:09,473 --> 00:16:13,143
Until I call you, get plenty of rest at home.

225
00:16:13,143 --> 00:16:14,943
It's no use even if you do this, Master.

226
00:16:14,943 --> 00:16:16,723
You can't!

227
00:16:16,723 --> 00:16:19,363
If you d-d-do s-s-surgery on that pa-pa-patient,

228
00:16:19,363 --> 00:16:21,403
you are finished with me at that moment!

229
00:16:21,403 --> 00:16:23,573
If this is the end, I'm not losing anything anyway.

230
00:16:23,573 --> 00:16:26,733
You don't need money? You need to bring your girlfriend.

231
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:29,083
Yes, you are right but...

232
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,673
Even we lose this one, there's one more match left.

233
00:16:31,673 --> 00:16:34,113
You can't even if you die. Hurry home.

234
00:16:34,113 --> 00:16:37,163
Hurry up and come!  Hurry, hurry!

235
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,813
Ah, really!

236
00:16:38,813 --> 00:16:42,843
If you do surgery on that patient, you are doing a good deed for Han Jae Joon.

237
00:16:42,843 --> 00:16:45,043
The patient's guardians will like it too.

238
00:16:45,043 --> 00:16:47,993
Why does the patient's guardian matter when we are competing so ferociously?

239
00:16:47,993 --> 00:16:52,123
- They are important because this is a hospital.
- You can't do that because this is a hospital.

240
00:16:52,123 --> 00:16:56,343
If there's a lawsuit, forget the competition.  This hospital will be finished, got it?

241
00:16:56,343 --> 00:16:58,893
- Master! 
- Will you stop bitching and follow me?!

242
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,763
I will make you go home.

243
00:17:01,763 --> 00:17:04,453
What is this? Move aside! Move aside.

244
00:17:04,453 --> 00:17:07,733
Hurry up and come. Come here! Taxi!

245
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:11,613
Until I call you, stay in your house like a dead man.

246
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:14,583
Do you understand? Get in.

247
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:17,333
Hey, you, who are you?

248
00:17:18,823 --> 00:17:22,313
Hey. Where did that guy go?

249
00:17:24,193 --> 00:17:26,213
Jae Hee!

250
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:28,913
Doctor Han, what's your surgery schedule like?

251
00:17:28,913 --> 00:17:30,643
Doctor Park.

252
00:17:30,643 --> 00:17:33,693
What is it? Is something wrong?

253
00:17:38,563 --> 00:17:41,323
He's so funny!

254
00:17:43,603 --> 00:17:46,573
Hey, Park Hoon!

255
00:17:46,573 --> 00:17:51,163
Doctor Park, your sunbae is really funny!

256
00:17:52,143 --> 00:17:54,613
- Sunbae?
 - Did you forget already?

257
00:17:54,613 --> 00:17:57,883
Laboratory of Prosperity of Our Dear Supreme Leader.

258
00:17:57,883 --> 00:18:00,783
We earnestly struggled to learn there.

259
00:18:00,783 --> 00:18:03,553
He says, struggling for learning.

260
00:18:04,563 --> 00:18:06,133
- Let's leave.
- Okay.

261
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:09,303
Should we go catch up somewhere?  It's been awhile.

262
00:18:09,303 --> 00:18:12,193
But, about the thing you talked about a moment ago.

263
00:18:12,193 --> 00:18:16,743
What do you call a miniskirt in North Korea?

264
00:18:16,743 --> 00:18:20,083
Snapped (in half) skirt.

265
00:18:31,703 --> 00:18:35,133
- Why did you come to the hospital?
- Me?

266
00:18:36,993 --> 00:18:39,023
That's obviously because

267
00:18:39,023 --> 00:18:40,983
I came to encourage you Dr. Park.

268
00:18:40,983 --> 00:18:44,683
Wouldn't it be a bit problematic if you show that face of yours everywhere?

269
00:18:44,683 --> 00:18:47,803
Why would I go there if you're doing well?

270
00:18:47,803 --> 00:18:49,053
What are you talking about?

271
00:18:49,053 --> 00:18:52,373
That patient in Cardiology...

272
00:18:52,373 --> 00:18:55,003
I heard the person who performs operation loses.

273
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:58,193
- Even if I lose this time, there is one more chance left.
- I know.

274
00:18:58,193 --> 00:19:00,333
It will become 1:1.

275
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,973
It will be very exciting.

276
00:19:02,973 --> 00:19:05,073
Because there is still the final competition.

277
00:19:05,073 --> 00:19:07,123
- That's why...
- For me,

278
00:19:07,123 --> 00:19:10,033
I didn't come here to see something exciting.

279
00:19:10,033 --> 00:19:13,203
I came here to fulfill the assignment.

280
00:19:13,203 --> 00:19:14,793
Assignment?

281
00:19:14,793 --> 00:19:18,923
It is an assignment worth a hundred times more than the assignment you messed up two years ago.

282
00:19:18,923 --> 00:19:21,193
Is this about earning dollars again?

283
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:24,263
What in the world does that have to do with the Prime Minister's heart surgery?

284
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:28,353
You will know about things like that naturally when the time is right.

285
00:19:30,913 --> 00:19:36,423
The thing you have to keep in mind is that the Republic is keeping great interest in this assignment.

286
00:19:36,423 --> 00:19:38,793
Is that why they brought in a has-been like you, too?

287
00:19:38,793 --> 00:19:40,893
That has-been has...

288
00:19:42,003 --> 00:19:44,693
brought Song Jae Hee all the way here.

289
00:19:44,693 --> 00:19:47,353
So I can always take back

290
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:51,003
the girl you love so much.

291
00:19:51,003 --> 00:19:54,843
Whether as a dead body or alive.

292
00:19:54,843 --> 00:19:56,913
If you wanted to kill her, you would have done it sooner.

293
00:19:56,913 --> 00:19:59,283
But I didn't.

294
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:00,813
No,

295
00:20:00,813 --> 00:20:03,353
if you want,

296
00:20:03,353 --> 00:20:07,363
I can show you mercy of the People's Republic.

297
00:20:07,363 --> 00:20:11,833
- Mercy?
- It means I can also set you two free.

298
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:15,243
Aren't you happy by just thinking about it?

299
00:20:15,243 --> 00:20:17,803
Living happily

300
00:20:19,323 --> 00:20:21,973
without any worry,

301
00:20:21,973 --> 00:20:24,373
with the woman you love.

302
00:20:24,373 --> 00:20:26,853
You don't even have to hide around.

303
00:20:27,443 --> 00:20:31,103
I, too, won't appear before you, either.

304
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,783
If you want,

305
00:20:33,783 --> 00:20:37,253
I can give you money to live comfortably as well.

306
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:40,523
If you succeed in the mission.

307
00:20:43,143 --> 00:20:45,523
Keep in mind that,

308
00:20:45,523 --> 00:20:49,853
as long as the mission is accomplished,

309
00:20:49,853 --> 00:20:52,303
you and Song Jae Hee can be happy.

310
00:21:17,613 --> 00:21:19,423
Chief Han.

311
00:21:23,553 --> 00:21:25,413
Can you see?

312
00:21:26,733 --> 00:21:31,873
This Myeongwoo came here while overcoming many obstacles.

313
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:35,283
Of course, there were small and big medical accidents and

314
00:21:35,283 --> 00:21:37,903
there were lawsuits following those.

315
00:21:37,903 --> 00:21:39,323
However, I've

316
00:21:39,323 --> 00:21:44,203
never allowed any malpractice action which would hurt Myeongwoo.

317
00:21:45,293 --> 00:21:49,343
So that's why, even till now, I'm here as Myeongwoo's Chairman.

318
00:21:50,593 --> 00:21:54,713
And you are my heir, whom I have acknowledged.

319
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:57,243
I'm sorry for worrying you.

320
00:21:58,133 --> 00:21:59,963
For the second competition,

321
00:21:59,963 --> 00:22:05,053
you don't need to worry because you can pick 2 patients that you know well and show off your skills.

322
00:22:05,053 --> 00:22:08,003
However keep this in mind. If you want to become the owner of  Myeongwoo,

323
00:22:08,003 --> 00:22:11,753
you have to become more than just a doctor.

324
00:22:53,533 --> 00:22:57,053
 They say that it will be a simple surgery, so don't worry.

325
00:22:57,053 --> 00:23:00,303
 Even so, how can we not be worried when it's a surgery?

326
00:23:00,303 --> 00:23:03,123
 Why didn't you become sick after I grew up a bit more?

327
00:23:03,123 --> 00:23:04,353
 Why?

328
00:23:04,353 --> 00:23:06,563
 Ah, Father, did you forget already?

329
00:23:06,563 --> 00:23:09,643
 I said I would become a doctor.

330
00:23:09,643 --> 00:23:12,073
 Ah, right.

331
00:23:12,073 --> 00:23:13,093
 You did, right?

332
00:23:13,093 --> 00:23:14,633
 It doesn't matter anyway.

333
00:23:14,633 --> 00:23:19,613
 After you become well, you can become sick again after I become a doctor.

334
00:23:19,613 --> 00:23:22,373
 You rascal, do you want your dad to be sick?

335
00:23:22,373 --> 00:23:25,533
 What's wrong about that? I can cure him anyway.

336
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:29,303
 Okay, I will make sure to become sick later,

337
00:23:29,303 --> 00:23:34,103
 so Seung Hoon, you have to become a great doctor. Okay?

338
00:23:34,103 --> 00:23:36,213
 Yes, Father.

339
00:23:39,153 --> 00:23:43,333
 Don't forget. My father is Lee Jo Seon and I am Lee Seung Hoon.

340
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,243
 At any cost, remember this.

341
00:23:45,243 --> 00:23:49,313
 I'm telling you to clearly remember the person who will take revenge on you!

342
00:24:06,713 --> 00:24:14,223

343
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:35,793
 If Chief Han decides to perform the surgery on this patient, 2 losses.

344
00:24:35,793 --> 00:24:39,333
 Because there are 3 games, there's no need for the third round.

345
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:42,023
 You are finished with that.

346
00:24:46,763 --> 00:24:49,093
To destroy the castle,

347
00:24:49,093 --> 00:24:51,523
I have no choice.

348
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:55,323
I'm sorry.

349
00:25:06,993 --> 00:25:08,623
Is my mother alright?

350
00:25:08,623 --> 00:25:10,593
Mother?

351
00:25:27,423 --> 00:25:29,963
Mom, are you sleeping?

352
00:25:31,633 --> 00:25:34,373
She's always sleeping like this whenever I come here.

353
00:25:34,373 --> 00:25:38,023
Should I ask the nurse to wake her up?

354
00:25:38,023 --> 00:25:39,993
It's okay.

355
00:25:39,993 --> 00:25:44,643
She was always sick at home so she wasn't able to sleep well.

356
00:25:51,523 --> 00:25:53,653
What is your name?

357
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:56,163
Jae Cheol.

358
00:25:56,163 --> 00:25:58,313
Jae Cheol?

359
00:25:59,153 --> 00:26:02,543
Is your name Han Jae Joon?

360
00:26:03,683 --> 00:26:05,333
It's not.

361
00:26:05,883 --> 00:26:07,703
Then?

362
00:26:16,733 --> 00:26:19,513
Doctor, do you know Doctor Park Hoon?

363
00:26:19,513 --> 00:26:20,583
I do.

364
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:23,473
He talked about you.

365
00:26:23,473 --> 00:26:25,703
Doctor Park talked about me?

366
00:26:25,703 --> 00:26:30,803
He said there is a doctor named Han Jae Joon, with a good personality and good skills...

367
00:26:30,803 --> 00:26:33,373
I doubt he said it like that.

368
00:26:34,073 --> 00:26:36,833
He said your personality was a little bad.

369
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:40,073
However, it's the truth that he said you had good skills.

370
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:48,233
Doctor Park said that he'll do surgery on my mom tomorrow.

371
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:53,413
If by chance, that doctor can't do it, can you do it?

372
00:26:54,843 --> 00:26:58,443
If Doctor Park Hoon said that he'd do it, he will do it.

373
00:26:58,443 --> 00:27:00,543
I think like that too, but,

374
00:27:00,543 --> 00:27:04,813
actually, he was going to do it earlier today but he couldn't.

375
00:27:06,673 --> 00:27:11,563
If possibly that doctor can't do it, can you please do it?

376
00:27:13,453 --> 00:27:15,283
Jae Cheol.

377
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:18,933
You will do it, right?

378
00:27:18,933 --> 00:27:21,733
Okay. I'll think about it.

379
00:27:46,133 --> 00:27:49,493
Chief Han isn't going to do the surgery, right?

380
00:27:49,493 --> 00:27:51,773
He probably won't.

381
00:27:52,753 --> 00:27:54,933
But I'm worried about Doctor Park.

382
00:27:54,933 --> 00:27:56,213
What about Dr. Park?

383
00:27:56,213 --> 00:28:00,213
He obviously will rush in to save the patient.

384
00:28:00,213 --> 00:28:03,243
He didn't ask you to be his anesthesiologist?

385
00:28:03,243 --> 00:28:04,363
Not yet.

386
00:28:04,363 --> 00:28:06,593
Are you going to do it if he asks you?

387
00:28:06,593 --> 00:28:08,553
I don't know.

388
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:11,153
He didn't ask you to be his First?

389
00:28:11,153 --> 00:28:13,473
You know that he calls me a quack.

390
00:28:13,473 --> 00:28:15,673
I heard that he asked you today.

391
00:28:15,673 --> 00:28:17,853
That's because

392
00:28:17,853 --> 00:28:20,733
it was a surgery that had to be done in secrecy.

393
00:28:25,633 --> 00:28:27,583
 Let me borrow your hands.

394
00:28:29,203 --> 00:28:33,313
Aren't Doctor Park's pranks a little too harsh?

395
00:28:33,313 --> 00:28:36,763
I mean, just because a hair fell off

396
00:28:36,763 --> 00:28:41,493
he squeezed my head like this telling me it's hair loss or whatever.

397
00:28:43,493 --> 00:28:46,053
I've never seen a person like that before.

398
00:28:50,933 --> 00:28:54,183
Sometimes he seems like an adult,

399
00:28:54,183 --> 00:28:56,953
but sometimes he acts like a child.

400
00:28:56,953 --> 00:28:59,533
He's so unpredictable...

401
00:29:01,043 --> 00:29:04,023
- You must like him.
- What?

402
00:29:04,023 --> 00:29:07,163
You keep on smiling while talking about him.

403
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:08,843
No!

404
00:29:08,843 --> 00:29:13,353
Whenever I think about that guy, Doctor Park, my fist cries.

405
00:29:13,353 --> 00:29:15,503
Like this.

406
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,343
No.

407
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:42,333

408
00:30:28,603 --> 00:30:32,893
 Apartment prices that have been on the rise since January

409
00:30:32,893 --> 00:30:38,343
 have gone down by 0.03% in 4 months and has moved to a downward trend.

410
00:30:40,103 --> 00:30:43,943
What kind of a country is this calm when they are saying that they're going to do nuclear testing?

411
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:47,883
It seems like the card this time is a failure.

412
00:30:47,883 --> 00:30:50,103
Failure?

413
00:30:50,103 --> 00:30:55,143
Then, do you think I have to ask them to shoot a few cannon balls for this country to become frantic?

414
00:30:57,263 --> 00:31:00,403
- What about the two players at Myeongwoo?
- It will either be decided today,

415
00:31:00,403 --> 00:31:03,793
or we have to wait a little more.

416
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:08,043
If they're already going to be doing it, I wish they'll fight ferociously.

417
00:31:08,043 --> 00:31:11,053
So we can have more customers...

418
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:16,363
We should prepare since our two players are fighting.

419
00:31:16,363 --> 00:31:18,353
Yes.

420
00:31:24,063 --> 00:31:26,633
It's very different than 20 years ago.

421
00:31:26,633 --> 00:31:29,333
Even when North Korea is working on a nuclear test,

422
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:33,533
citizens will not be agitated like in the past.

423
00:31:33,533 --> 00:31:37,293
It just hasn't risen to the surface.

424
00:31:38,713 --> 00:31:41,993
War correspondents are still in Korea and

425
00:31:41,993 --> 00:31:46,083
foreign investors are leaving fast.

426
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:50,403
We have already suffered more than what the North has asked for.

427
00:31:51,803 --> 00:31:57,153
It seems like you enjoy states of crisis.

428
00:31:57,153 --> 00:31:59,173
I'm sorry.

429
00:31:59,173 --> 00:32:01,213
I'm saying we should prepare for the possibility.

430
00:32:01,213 --> 00:32:05,253
All I'm saying is we need to lay a foundation for the summit meeting.

431
00:32:13,203 --> 00:32:16,463
They are the hospitals who may be responsible for my surgery.

432
00:32:16,463 --> 00:32:21,423
Wasn't the director of this hospital your main doctor in the past?

433
00:32:21,423 --> 00:32:23,913
Yes. A long time ago.

434
00:32:23,913 --> 00:32:26,733
Which hospital do you think will be good, Prime Minister?

435
00:32:26,733 --> 00:32:27,993
Me?

436
00:32:27,993 --> 00:32:31,433
It's a hospital that will do surgery on your heart.

437
00:32:31,433 --> 00:32:33,413
I

438
00:32:33,413 --> 00:32:36,893
think Mingook Hospital will be good.

439
00:32:42,873 --> 00:32:45,373
Lala. Woo hoo.

440
00:32:45,373 --> 00:32:47,893
Ah, I love you.

441
00:32:47,893 --> 00:32:49,363
A practice.

442
00:32:49,363 --> 00:32:52,593
What is he? Is he crazy?

443
00:33:11,173 --> 00:33:12,613
What can I get you custo-

444
00:33:12,613 --> 00:33:14,583
I picked it up on the street on my way here.

445
00:33:14,583 --> 00:33:20,213
When will you finish? A Korean, Chinese, Japanese, North Korean cuisine?

446
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,773
You

447
00:33:23,773 --> 00:33:26,323
have a nice body line.

448
00:33:40,653 --> 00:33:44,273
You should have a better personality.

449
00:33:50,793 --> 00:33:54,553
As I expected, it's a unique taste.

450
00:33:58,093 --> 00:33:59,463
Oh, oh.

451
00:33:59,463 --> 00:34:02,473
Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

452
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:04,503
It seems like you don't really know who I am, but,

453
00:34:04,503 --> 00:34:09,063
even if I look like this, I'm the one shot one kill...

454
00:34:13,973 --> 00:34:16,703
Ah, there are so many people watching.

455
00:34:16,733 --> 00:34:19,733
 Victory Taekwondo

456
00:34:27,813 --> 00:34:31,163
I know you very well, you perverted thug!

457
00:34:34,513 --> 00:34:39,723
Wow, this is. Ahjusshi!

458
00:34:44,593 --> 00:34:47,383
- Hey, what are you doing here? 
- Ah, you surprised me.

459
00:34:48,343 --> 00:34:49,973
Your mother is doing fine, right?

460
00:34:49,973 --> 00:34:51,733
Oh, yeah.

461
00:34:51,733 --> 00:34:53,763
What is this?

462
00:34:53,763 --> 00:34:56,773
I brought this in case you hadn't eaten breakfast.

463
00:34:56,773 --> 00:34:58,313
In fact,

464
00:34:58,313 --> 00:35:01,183
I was a bit hungry. This is great.

465
00:35:09,783 --> 00:35:11,923
Go, okay?

466
00:35:13,723 --> 00:35:16,723
- You are performing a surgery on the Cardiology's patient?
- Yes.

467
00:35:17,603 --> 00:35:19,343
Is your hand doing alright?

468
00:35:19,343 --> 00:35:21,823
Yes, it's fine.

469
00:35:21,823 --> 00:35:25,233
- When are you going to do it?
- As soon as I get a scrub nurse and an anesthesiologist.

470
00:35:25,233 --> 00:35:27,923
Is Nurse Min going to be the scrub?

471
00:35:27,923 --> 00:35:30,183
Yes, why?

472
00:35:30,183 --> 00:35:33,463
Nurse Min is working in the afternoon.

473
00:35:34,713 --> 00:35:37,733
I will try to look for one, so why don't you use a different person?

474
00:35:38,643 --> 00:35:40,603
Yes, then I'll ask you for this favor.

475
00:35:40,603 --> 00:35:42,433
Yes.

476
00:35:53,233 --> 00:35:55,903
Dr. Park will be doing the surgery on the patient from Cardiology department?

477
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,853
 I need you to help me.

478
00:35:57,853 --> 00:36:01,413
 I heard that if you do the surgery then you will lose the second competition.

479
00:36:01,413 --> 00:36:03,813
 Is it because of that?

480
00:36:03,813 --> 00:36:06,893
 You can think it however you want.

481
00:36:06,893 --> 00:36:10,083
 Since he's doing it anyway,  help me so that

482
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:12,183
 he can do better.

483
00:36:12,873 --> 00:36:15,083
 I understand.

484
00:36:18,373 --> 00:36:20,893
 Seung Min's dad, drink some tea.

485
00:36:22,743 --> 00:36:25,163
 Soo Ji, tomorrow's work schedule...

486
00:36:25,843 --> 00:36:28,863
 Can you move it to the afternoon?

487
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:36,533
Doctor Han.

488
00:36:36,533 --> 00:36:39,063
- Do you have surgery?
- Later.

489
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:43,103
- When do you finish?
- It is a simple surgery, so it will be done quickly.

490
00:36:43,703 --> 00:36:46,813
Call me when the surgery is done. We are doing Off-Pump CABG. (Coronary Artery Bypass Graft without stopping the heart)

491
00:36:46,813 --> 00:36:49,253
Are you really doing surgery on the Cardiology department's patient?

492
00:36:49,253 --> 00:36:51,093
- Of course. 
- But...

493
00:36:51,093 --> 00:36:55,183
There's another chance even if I lose this round. There are three rounds.

494
00:36:56,923 --> 00:37:00,063
- Does that person also know?
- Cha Jin Soo?

495
00:37:01,113 --> 00:37:03,303
It doesn't matter.

496
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:13,103
No, don't do it.

497
00:37:13,103 --> 00:37:16,753
I understand how you feel but I can't stay still any longer.

498
00:37:16,753 --> 00:37:19,433
You said you'll do as I say.

499
00:37:19,433 --> 00:37:22,173
Let's first do as he tells us to do.

500
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:24,953
I promised the patient's family that I'd do it.

501
00:37:24,953 --> 00:37:26,903
Hoon.

502
00:37:26,903 --> 00:37:30,303
I can't disappoint them.

503
00:37:30,303 --> 00:37:32,463
Oh, Park Hoon.

504
00:37:33,393 --> 00:37:36,243
Then what about this sunbae?

505
00:37:36,243 --> 00:37:38,603
I warned you that there will not be such thing as a final competition.

506
00:37:38,603 --> 00:37:41,583
If the patient dies then there could be a medical lawsuit.

507
00:37:41,583 --> 00:37:46,373
Then this hospital will be eliminated from the candidates for the Prime Minister's surgery team. Will you be okay with that?

508
00:37:46,373 --> 00:37:48,363
You don't have to worry about that.

509
00:37:48,363 --> 00:37:50,583
I'm begging you.

510
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:54,053
I will win the final competition no matter what,

511
00:37:54,053 --> 00:37:57,513
so let me do surgery on that patient.

512
00:38:08,253 --> 00:38:09,683
What are you doing?

513
00:38:09,683 --> 00:38:14,033
Repeat after me. "I'm going to do as Cha Jin Soo says."

514
00:38:18,053 --> 00:38:21,393
Don't do it. That's not what you want.

515
00:38:21,393 --> 00:38:23,593
Say it.

516
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:37,103
I...

517
00:38:37,103 --> 00:38:40,153
will do what Cha Jin Soo tells me to do.

518
00:38:44,773 --> 00:38:46,753
One more time.

519
00:38:47,753 --> 00:38:50,873
I will do what Cha Jin Soo tells me to do.

520
00:38:55,383 --> 00:38:57,303
Okay.

521
00:38:58,083 --> 00:39:01,203
You have to do what I command you to do.

522
00:39:14,763 --> 00:39:16,873
Are you alright?

523
00:39:16,873 --> 00:39:18,803
I'm sorry.

524
00:39:18,803 --> 00:39:21,223
It's all because of me.

525
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:01,053
Doctor!

526
00:40:01,053 --> 00:40:03,363
My mother...

527
00:40:25,243 --> 00:40:27,323
Doctor!

528
00:40:27,323 --> 00:40:29,793
Doctor, what happened?

529
00:40:29,793 --> 00:40:32,783
We are looking for the exact cause.

530
00:40:32,783 --> 00:40:38,323
We are thinking that it's probably because of a genetic factor or an allergy to a particular drug.

531
00:40:38,933 --> 00:40:40,543
By any chance,

532
00:40:40,543 --> 00:40:43,533
was it because there was a mistake in the surgery, Doctor?

533
00:40:43,533 --> 00:40:46,863
We do thousands of stent surgeries a year.

534
00:40:46,863 --> 00:40:49,603
Until now, the cases where there were mistakes have been less than 1%,

535
00:40:49,603 --> 00:40:53,243
on top of which, the symptoms are generally very different from the patient's.

536
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:56,233
I don't know what you heard, but

537
00:40:56,233 --> 00:40:59,883
this kind of suspicion

538
00:40:59,883 --> 00:41:03,273
is not good not only for the guardian but also for the patient.

539
00:41:03,273 --> 00:41:05,323
I'm sorry, Doctor.

540
00:41:06,553 --> 00:41:07,733
What happened?

541
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:10,013
It's none of your business.

542
00:41:11,473 --> 00:41:13,493
Heart failures keep happening because of pericardial tamponade.

543
00:41:13,493 --> 00:41:16,433
We will do it as we see fit. Get lost!

544
00:41:29,983 --> 00:41:31,363
Doctor.

545
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:33,963
Don't worry, I...

546
00:41:43,893 --> 00:41:47,343
Doctor, you will do surgery on my mom, right?

547
00:41:49,033 --> 00:41:50,973
Doctor!

548
00:41:57,693 --> 00:41:59,933
What's the matter, Doctor?

549
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:10,423
Doctor! Doctor!

550
00:42:11,063 --> 00:42:16,193
Doctor! Doctor! Doctor!

551
00:42:20,133 --> 00:42:21,673
Are you okay?

552
00:42:21,673 --> 00:42:23,793
Doctor...

553
00:42:40,243 --> 00:42:42,523
Doctor!

554
00:42:42,523 --> 00:42:44,603
Doctor!

555
00:42:53,433 --> 00:42:55,683
When is Doctor Park doing the surgery?

556
00:42:55,683 --> 00:42:58,663
I received a contact that the surgery is canceled.

557
00:42:58,663 --> 00:43:01,623
- Why?
 - I don't know.

558
00:43:02,933 --> 00:43:04,623
Uhm...

559
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:08,173
Will the patient be okay?

560
00:43:08,793 --> 00:43:09,643
Why?

561
00:43:09,643 --> 00:43:13,333
I hear there was another incident of  heart failure because of pericardial tamponade.

562
00:43:27,303 --> 00:43:29,163
Doctor!

563
00:43:29,843 --> 00:43:30,813
Jae Cheol.

564
00:43:30,813 --> 00:43:33,323
Doctor Park Hoon said he won't do it.

565
00:43:34,373 --> 00:43:37,163
Please do the surgery on my mom.

566
00:43:37,163 --> 00:43:41,333
You said you'll do it if Doctor Park doesn't do it.

567
00:43:49,933 --> 00:43:51,403
Doctor!

568
00:43:51,403 --> 00:43:54,403
Please do it! Doctor!

569
00:43:54,403 --> 00:43:57,513
Doctor! Please, save my mother.

570
00:43:58,313 --> 00:44:01,183
 Save my father. Please, save my father!

571
00:44:01,183 --> 00:44:03,773
 I said, please save my father!

572
00:44:03,773 --> 00:44:06,483
 Save my father, save my father!

573
00:44:06,483 --> 00:44:09,683
Doctor please listen to me!  Doctor!

574
00:44:09,683 --> 00:44:11,983
Doctor!

575
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:14,703
Please, save my mother, Doctor!

576
00:44:15,473 --> 00:44:20,013
Doctor! Please save my mother!  Doctor!

577
00:44:37,183 --> 00:44:44,573

578
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:04,703
You said you would do the surgery.

579
00:45:04,703 --> 00:45:07,363
You said you that would do the surgery!

580
00:45:09,063 --> 00:45:10,473
I can't.

581
00:45:10,473 --> 00:45:11,643
Why?

582
00:45:11,643 --> 00:45:13,313
I can't.

583
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:15,293
I can't do it.

584
00:45:15,293 --> 00:45:17,273
You can do it.

585
00:45:17,273 --> 00:45:18,833
You have another chance after this.

586
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:19,803
I told you I can't do it.

587
00:45:19,803 --> 00:45:22,073
You promised that you would do it.

588
00:45:22,073 --> 00:45:24,093
Then why aren't you doing it?

589
00:45:25,213 --> 00:45:27,363
You're a doctor.

590
00:45:27,363 --> 00:45:30,163
Then you have to listen to your patients.

591
00:45:30,163 --> 00:45:34,693
For a moment, just for a moment, I imitated a doctor.

592
00:45:36,423 --> 00:45:37,313
I'm not a doctor.

593
00:45:37,313 --> 00:45:39,613
Stop talking nonsense!

594
00:45:39,613 --> 00:45:42,353
The patient might die

595
00:45:42,353 --> 00:45:43,493
and you want to win that badly?

596
00:45:43,493 --> 00:45:45,773
I can't lose.

597
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:48,653
That's why I'm saying that I'm not a doctor.

598
00:45:48,653 --> 00:45:50,973
You bastard!

599
00:45:57,133 --> 00:46:00,943
I still thought that you were a doctor.

600
00:46:00,943 --> 00:46:03,813
I thought you were a different person from me.

601
00:46:09,593 --> 00:46:12,023
Bring all the team members to my office.

602
00:46:27,033 --> 00:46:29,763
You are doing the surgery for that patient of Cardiology?

603
00:46:29,763 --> 00:46:34,343
As you all know, the Chairman is opposed to this surgery.

604
00:46:34,343 --> 00:46:36,303
That's why.

605
00:46:36,303 --> 00:46:38,453
Any person who wants to leave say it now.

606
00:46:38,453 --> 00:46:42,433
After the surgery, I don't even know what's going to happen to me.

607
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:45,173
I still...

608
00:46:45,173 --> 00:46:49,313
I didn't even finish residency, so for this time, I'll...

609
00:46:51,523 --> 00:46:53,473
I will ask one thing about this.

610
00:46:53,473 --> 00:46:59,333
Will you take responsibility for us if we get fired after this surgery?

611
00:47:05,723 --> 00:47:08,013
Let's do our best.

612
00:47:14,213 --> 00:47:15,923
Okay.

613
00:47:16,513 --> 00:47:18,673
I'll do it.

614
00:47:24,013 --> 00:47:26,043
I'll also

615
00:47:26,633 --> 00:47:28,763
do it, Chief.

616
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:30,433
Me, too.

617
00:47:30,433 --> 00:47:34,543
Then, we can finish it before the Chairman knows.

618
00:47:34,543 --> 00:47:37,233
But does that make sense?

619
00:47:37,233 --> 00:47:39,593
Okay, then let's get ready.

620
00:47:39,593 --> 00:47:45,303
♬  I cannot see a single place to rest  ♬

621
00:47:45,303 --> 00:47:52,143
♬  Every time I open my eyes, there's not a single light  ♬

622
00:47:52,143 --> 00:47:55,483
♬  Difficultly, I take a step  ♬

623
00:47:55,483 --> 00:47:57,583
Doctor!

624
00:47:58,493 --> 00:48:01,363
Doctor, you're doing the surgery, right?

625
00:48:03,733 --> 00:48:07,103
I had faith that you would do it.

626
00:48:10,223 --> 00:48:17,543
♬  Walk on without stopping. Wait for me.   ♬

627
00:48:17,543 --> 00:48:22,133
♬   At the end of this road, at the end of this strange road,  ♬

628
00:48:22,133 --> 00:48:25,023
Dr. Han is doing the surgery for the patient Lee Gyu Eun?

629
00:48:25,023 --> 00:48:26,213
Yes.

630
00:48:26,213 --> 00:48:29,733
♬  You'll probably be crying  ♬

631
00:48:29,733 --> 00:48:35,533
♬ Even though time will create rust ♬

632
00:48:35,533 --> 00:48:40,833
♬ As you love, you will wait at the end of this road. ♬

633
00:48:40,833 --> 00:48:46,193
♬  Wait for me a little bit   ♬

634
00:48:49,423 --> 00:48:52,553
Hurray! Hurray!

635
00:48:52,553 --> 00:48:56,243
Hey, it's all done.

636
00:48:56,243 --> 00:48:57,073
What is?

637
00:48:57,073 --> 00:49:00,683
Dr. Han Jae Joon will be doing the surgery for the Cardiology patient.

638
00:49:00,683 --> 00:49:04,273
We won! 2:0!

639
00:49:18,823 --> 00:49:21,733
This is probably the last surgery I'm going to do here.

640
00:49:21,733 --> 00:49:23,823
Will you be alright?

641
00:49:23,823 --> 00:49:26,993
Father won't stay still.

642
00:49:30,373 --> 00:49:32,943
I have so many things I can't say, but

643
00:49:33,543 --> 00:49:36,703
I can say this for sure.

644
00:49:38,623 --> 00:49:41,163
About my heart toward Soo Hyeon,

645
00:49:42,283 --> 00:49:43,353
it was sincere.

646

652

653
00:50:28,643 --> 00:50:31,233
Don't worry. It'll be fine. Okay?

654
00:50:32,793 --> 00:50:35,453
Doctor, did you come here because of my mother, too?

655
00:50:37,413 --> 00:50:41,163
Doctor, please take good care of my mother.

656
00:50:42,713 --> 00:50:44,323
I'm sorry.

657
00:50:57,443 --> 00:51:00,283
I'm still on your team, right?

658
00:51:00,283 --> 00:51:01,823
Yes.

659
00:51:09,033 --> 00:51:10,293
What are you talking about?

660
00:51:10,293 --> 00:51:11,973
Yes, Chairman.

661
00:51:11,973 --> 00:51:14,613
But Chief Han, this friend,

662
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:16,843
will you be able to use him

663
00:51:16,843 --> 00:51:19,033
when he doesn't know how you feel like this?

664
00:51:19,033 --> 00:51:21,223
This guy... In the end...

665
00:51:27,213 --> 00:51:34,253

666
00:51:47,403 --> 00:51:49,003
Doctor Oh!

667
00:51:55,123 --> 00:51:58,923
It's fine, this is Dr. Keum's place..

668
00:52:04,853 --> 00:52:06,753
You're all ready, right?

669
00:52:11,053 --> 00:52:12,713
Scalpel.

670
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,583
Chairman.

671
00:52:41,583 --> 00:52:43,943
I already know about it so be quiet.

672
00:52:45,933 --> 00:52:49,313
Oh Hyung. It's not me who did that, gosh.

673
00:53:27,953 --> 00:53:30,393
Chief Han, Chairman has come in.

674
00:53:30,393 --> 00:53:32,833
Don't be concerned about that and quickly prepare the graft.

675
00:53:32,833 --> 00:53:33,883
But still, Chief...

676
00:53:33,883 --> 00:53:35,613
Hurry!

677
00:53:41,233 --> 00:53:43,043
Get Chief Han on the phone!

678
00:53:47,253 --> 00:53:49,623
Won't you stop right now!

679
00:53:59,303 --> 00:54:02,643
When the surgery is over, I will tell the truth to the patient's guardians and apologize to them.

680
00:54:02,643 --> 00:54:03,833
Won't you shut it?!

681
00:54:03,833 --> 00:54:06,453
Chief Han, close her up immediately and come out!

682
00:54:06,453 --> 00:54:08,733
That would be sad if he does that...

683
00:54:08,733 --> 00:54:11,533
If you come out right now, I will forgive everything.

684
00:54:11,533 --> 00:54:12,633
Right now!

685
00:54:12,633 --> 00:54:14,883
I will come out after the surgery.

686
00:54:14,883 --> 00:54:17,653
After the surgery? Fine then.

687
00:54:17,653 --> 00:54:20,273
Everyone who is in the operating room, listen well.

688
00:54:20,273 --> 00:54:25,253
Come out of the operating room.  If not, I'll make you rot in the countryside!

689
00:54:28,793 --> 00:54:30,183
What in the world are you afraid of, Chairman?

690
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:31,663
You stay still!

691
00:54:31,663 --> 00:54:34,803
If you tell the patient's guardian the truth right away and sincerely apologize,

692
00:54:34,803 --> 00:54:36,403
the medical lawsuit will not happen.

693
00:54:36,403 --> 00:54:38,743
There has never been a person like that, not even once!

694
00:54:38,743 --> 00:54:43,093
That's because we never once sincerely apologized!

695
00:54:43,093 --> 00:54:47,753
We have ignored the hearts of the people who lost their parents and their children

696
00:54:47,753 --> 00:54:49,833
because we didn't want to lose our money and our positions.

697
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:51,263
Won't you be quiet?!

698
00:54:51,263 --> 00:54:53,903
Chairman, I will show you

699
00:54:53,903 --> 00:54:56,203
that you are wrong.

700
00:54:59,303 --> 00:55:00,873
Chief Han! Chief Han!

701
00:55:00,873 --> 00:55:03,943
 Chief Han!

702
00:55:15,033 --> 00:55:17,113
Concentrate and keep going.

703
00:55:17,933 --> 00:55:20,293
Hang in there, Doctor Keum.

704
00:55:20,293 --> 00:55:22,943
Pay attention!

705
00:55:22,943 --> 00:55:24,483
Suction.

706
00:55:36,073 --> 00:55:38,453
Chief...

707
00:55:38,453 --> 00:55:39,513
Let's try to stop the bleeding first.

708
00:55:39,513 --> 00:55:41,093
Suction.

709
00:55:53,473 --> 00:55:55,793
 Please take good care of her, Doctor.

710
00:56:03,053 --> 00:56:06,353
If a table death occurs, call a disciplinary committee immediately.

711
00:56:06,353 --> 00:56:07,933
What should the agenda be, Chairman?

712
00:56:07,933 --> 00:56:11,013
He performed a surgery without consent  from the attending department.

713
00:56:11,013 --> 00:56:14,963
Then, should it be for not complying with your orders?

714
00:56:14,963 --> 00:56:18,153
Go to the Legal Affairs Department and prepare for a medical lawsuit too.

715
00:56:18,153 --> 00:56:19,463
Preparation for a lawsuit?

716
00:56:19,463 --> 00:56:23,793
Yes, tell them to tell all the truth like that bastard wants.

717
00:56:23,793 --> 00:56:25,113
Tell them as is,

718
00:56:25,113 --> 00:56:27,753
that Han Jae Joon killed the patient during the surgery.

719
00:56:27,753 --> 00:56:30,863
Absolutely put all the blame on that bastard, you understand?

720
00:56:30,863 --> 00:56:32,883
Yes, Chairman.

721
00:56:37,203 --> 00:56:38,553
Hey!

722
00:56:38,553 --> 00:56:41,323
You should have looked carefully where you were going.

723
00:56:43,753 --> 00:56:46,773
- Where are you going?
- What are you going to do if you know?

724
00:56:52,673 --> 00:56:54,053
Tell them to bring more blood!

725
00:56:54,053 --> 00:56:56,603
Blood!  Please more blood!

726
00:56:56,603 --> 00:56:58,033
Suction.

727
00:56:58,033 --> 00:56:59,373
What about the vitals?

728
00:56:59,373 --> 00:57:01,533
The blood pressure keeps dropping.

729
00:57:02,863 --> 00:57:03,683
Did you find it?

730
00:57:03,683 --> 00:57:07,253
I... I can't see it well, Chief.
- Calm down.

731
00:57:07,253 --> 00:57:10,343
- But Chief...
- I told you to stay calm!

732
00:57:12,863 --> 00:57:15,013
Keum Bong Hyun.

733
00:57:53,673 --> 00:57:55,523
Please take me in.

734
00:58:14,273 --> 00:58:16,683
Why do you have your heads down like you've committed a crime?

735
00:58:16,683 --> 00:58:20,113
You didn't do anything wrong so lift your heads.

736
00:58:21,163 --> 00:58:25,223
The ones who should be lowering their heads are up there. Look.

737
00:58:42,673 --> 00:58:46,053
Yes, let's become confident.

738
00:58:46,053 --> 00:58:50,603
Because the real doctors in this hospital are only you guys.
