1
00:00:27,257 --> 00:00:29,527
- She's not dead yet.
- What are you doing?

2
00:00:29,527 --> 00:00:31,067
Let go!

3
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:33,227
Stop it!

4
00:00:33,227 --> 00:00:34,587
Let go!

5
00:00:34,587 --> 00:00:36,227
Stop it!

6
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:47,657
Let go!

7
00:00:47,657 --> 00:00:50,817
Save her.

8
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:53,987
Save my mom!

9
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:56,497
♬  When we meet again, we'll be really happy.  ♬

10
00:00:56,497 --> 00:01:05,097
♬  Me, without you, I can't do anything.  ♬

11
00:01:05,097 --> 00:01:13,497
♬  Again right now, I'm going to meet you.  ♬

12
00:01:13,497 --> 00:01:17,347
♬  Right now  ♬

13
00:01:35,817 --> 00:01:42,037
Yes. For now, I denied all the charges pressed by the prosecution.

14
00:01:42,037 --> 00:01:46,067
- When is the next summon?
- I think it will be half a month later.

15
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,397
Where are you right now?

16
00:01:48,397 --> 00:01:52,197
I am on my way to check on that girl.

17
00:02:02,907 --> 00:02:06,007
Doctor Han, a patient is here.

18
00:02:13,537 --> 00:02:16,167
Do you not feel well somewhere?

19
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:38,787
They really look alike.

20
00:03:16,037 --> 00:03:19,187
 Jae Hee. Jae Hee!

21
00:03:55,567 --> 00:04:00,807
 Episode 5

22
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:20,067
 Personnel Record Card

23
00:04:37,197 --> 00:04:39,107
I'm Han Seung Hee.

24
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:43,647
When Kim Eun Hee was at the branch hospital, I was her doctor.

25
00:04:44,487 --> 00:04:47,847
I transferred her to the main hospital myself.

26
00:04:47,847 --> 00:04:51,627
I heard that she passed away.

27
00:04:51,627 --> 00:04:53,947
It's a pity.

28
00:05:11,187 --> 00:05:12,727
How is that you...?

29
00:05:12,727 --> 00:05:17,177
She asked me to live together with her when she was getting outpatient treatment.

30
00:05:17,177 --> 00:05:20,247
The hospital is close, too. Most of all,

31
00:05:20,247 --> 00:05:23,037
she said she was lonely.

32
00:05:24,597 --> 00:05:27,367
She said she was lonely?

33
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:31,047
 Go!

34
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:33,127
 Don't look for me in the future, and

35
00:05:33,127 --> 00:05:36,067
 don't pretend to know me even if I come looking for you.

36
00:05:39,267 --> 00:05:41,897
But why was she like that to me?

37
00:06:34,657 --> 00:06:38,227
 You grew this much!  Aiyoo!

38
00:06:52,127 --> 00:06:55,377
She bought a present every year on her daughter's birthday.

39
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:04,357
  To Soo Hyeon, the daughter I love.
Happy 25th birthday. I wish I can see you wearing this necklace.

40
00:07:04,397 --> 00:07:07,217
 Dear My Lovely Soo Hyeon, Happy 8th birthday.

41
00:07:13,327 --> 00:07:15,827
She treasured that the most.

42
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:48,857
How did she...

43
00:07:48,857 --> 00:07:52,447
She must have kept watching over you.

44
00:07:54,427 --> 00:07:57,087
But why did she do that?

45
00:07:57,087 --> 00:07:59,207
She always pushed me away.

46
00:07:59,207 --> 00:08:01,747
She said that if she didn't do that

47
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:05,047
she would ultimately resent herself.

48
00:08:08,047 --> 00:08:11,147
Only in the embrace of an extravagant and rich father,

49
00:08:11,147 --> 00:08:14,687
she thought that her daughter would be happy.

50
00:08:16,327 --> 00:08:17,897
No.

51
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:21,007
She said her daughter resembled herself.

52
00:08:21,007 --> 00:08:25,737
Following the luxurious lifestyle, choosing a love that people curse at,

53
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:27,807
a person who resembles herself.

54
00:08:30,147 --> 00:08:32,407
No.

55
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,317
No!

56
00:09:08,957 --> 00:09:12,677
 For your happiness, I thought that it'd be okay.

57
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,087
 That you would be okay.

58
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:17,267
 Mom.

59
00:09:18,117 --> 00:09:21,087
 I cried every day because I missed you.

60
00:09:23,527 --> 00:09:29,237
 I was always longing ... for my daughter!

61
00:09:29,237 --> 00:09:33,997
 I'm sorry... Mom.

62
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:12,607
I was certain that it was an ischemic stroke and administered  RTPA but before the blood clots arose,

63
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,747
a pulmonary embolism occurred.

64
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,937
It's a senseless prescription.

65
00:10:16,937 --> 00:10:21,917
How come you used thrombolytic agent, but you never suspected shock from massive hemorrhage?

66
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:25,207
We had most of the hemorrhage under control. It's only that the patient's condition was so poor...

67
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:28,557
Don't make excuses. The patient was in the last stage of lung cancer.

68
00:10:28,557 --> 00:10:31,217
In a state like that, don't you agree that the risks were clearly foreseen?

69
00:10:31,217 --> 00:10:33,557
I don't think there exists a surgery that has no risk factor.

70
00:10:33,557 --> 00:10:36,457
And because I acknowledged that danger, I performed surgery on her.

71
00:10:36,457 --> 00:10:39,057
That's why the patient died.

72
00:10:39,837 --> 00:10:41,717
Isn't that right?

73
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,937
I do feel sorry about the death of the patient.

74
00:11:04,857 --> 00:11:07,277
I apologize again.

75
00:11:18,227 --> 00:11:20,047
We're not asking for an apology.

76
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:23,367
We want to discuss the cause of death to prevent this from happening again.

77
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:27,157
It was a surgery where the surgeon in charge did his best and the cause of death has been revealed as well.

78
00:11:27,157 --> 00:11:29,107
Let's move on to the next case.

79
00:11:29,107 --> 00:11:31,437
Why did you do the surgery?

80
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:38,197
For this patient, surgery itself was impossible.

81
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,727
Was it a surgery that was absolutely necessary?

82
00:11:39,727 --> 00:11:41,897
Of course the probability of a successful surgery was very faint, however...

83
00:11:41,897 --> 00:11:44,567
What exactly did you think the probability of success was?

84
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:46,277
I thought it was less than 5%.

85
00:11:46,277 --> 00:11:48,177
You did well on a surgery that doesn't even make sense.

86
00:11:48,177 --> 00:11:51,207
I wanted to save her somehow, and also...

87
00:11:54,907 --> 00:11:59,327
 I have something to say to her.

88
00:12:00,307 --> 00:12:02,417
 I am really asking you for a favor.

89
00:12:03,617 --> 00:12:05,507
 Please save her.

90
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:13,017
I mean if there's at least a 1% chance, doing surgery is what a doctor must do.

91
00:12:13,017 --> 00:12:17,397
A thing that a doctor must do? Wasn't it because you want to show off your skills?

92
00:12:17,397 --> 00:12:23,437
Without the patient on your mind, you just wanted to show off your petty skill.

93
00:12:23,437 --> 00:12:26,757
A thing that only an empty-headed quack would do,

94
00:12:26,757 --> 00:12:29,367
you did it.

95
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:31,807
Do you understand?

96
00:12:34,147 --> 00:12:36,277
Chief, your words are a little...

97
00:12:36,277 --> 00:12:38,597
Stay still!

98
00:12:49,317 --> 00:12:53,017
A doctor who has to save a patient has done a murderous thing.

99
00:12:53,017 --> 00:12:56,947
I'm saying that your arrogance has killed the patient.

100
00:12:58,467 --> 00:13:01,147
Your words are too harsh.

101
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:04,427
If it wasn't that, then why did you do surgery?

102
00:13:04,427 --> 00:13:06,547
-That is...
-Answer me.

103
00:13:06,547 --> 00:13:09,067
Why did you do the surgery?

104
00:13:10,397 --> 00:13:12,457
Fine then.

105
00:13:12,457 --> 00:13:14,767
I did it because of money.

106
00:13:20,557 --> 00:13:22,177
Because of money?

107
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:26,567
There's no way -- were you going to receive a bribe for performing Kim Eun Hee's surgery?

108
00:13:28,777 --> 00:13:32,687
- Yes.
- You performed the surgery on a patient for money?

109
00:13:37,757 --> 00:13:40,587
Is that something a doctor should do?

110
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:44,527
Who on earth taught you to earn money on the side by performing surgery?

111
00:13:56,047 --> 00:13:59,837
I know I didn't do the right thing, so let's just finish at this point.

112
00:13:59,837 --> 00:14:02,587
I was already going crazy thinking that I'm going to be fired from this place.

113
00:14:02,587 --> 00:14:04,997
Go back to your place.  It's not finished yet.

114
00:14:04,997 --> 00:14:07,127
I'm finished.

115
00:14:09,187 --> 00:14:11,137
Go back.

116
00:14:12,607 --> 00:14:16,067
Why? You don't want to listen?

117
00:14:18,717 --> 00:14:21,697
Fine then. Go.

118
00:14:21,697 --> 00:14:24,387
Instead, let me say one more thing.

119
00:14:26,177 --> 00:14:28,507
You're not a doctor.

120
00:14:32,717 --> 00:14:35,147
I'm not a doctor?

121
00:14:35,147 --> 00:14:37,227
Let's finish up for today.

122
00:14:38,357 --> 00:14:40,747
Truthfully, even I think that

123
00:14:42,307 --> 00:14:45,217
it's too much to say that I am a doctor.

124
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:51,437
A doctor does surgery for money... what kind of a doctor is that?

125
00:14:51,437 --> 00:14:53,387
But,

126
00:14:54,347 --> 00:14:57,977
if that's the case, then what about the people here?

127
00:14:57,977 --> 00:15:00,717
Do they perform the surgery for free without getting a salary?

128
00:15:00,717 --> 00:15:06,057
- What are you saying?
- How dare you say that?

129
00:15:12,187 --> 00:15:14,117
Why did I do the surgery?

130
00:15:14,117 --> 00:15:16,297
Because I wanted to become a doctor.

131
00:15:16,297 --> 00:15:19,907
A doctor is someone who heals the sick, a doctor like you!

132
00:15:19,907 --> 00:15:21,967
But why didn't you do it?

133
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:24,197
Because the probability of success was low?

134
00:15:24,197 --> 00:15:26,837
Then the people who perform surgery only when the chance is high are doctors?

135
00:15:26,837 --> 00:15:30,187
When the patient wants to live and there's someone who is asking to save the patient?!

136
00:15:30,187 --> 00:15:34,497
Is someone who gives up and just lets the patient die just because the probability of success is low a doctor? Tell me.

137
00:15:34,497 --> 00:15:36,647
Tell me.

138
00:16:00,097 --> 00:16:02,827
Hey! Are you really crazy?

139
00:16:02,827 --> 00:16:05,017
That's right. I must have gone crazy briefly.

140
00:16:05,017 --> 00:16:07,397
But I didn't say anything wrong.

141
00:16:07,397 --> 00:16:09,877
At a point when the Chairman is deciding whether to fire you or not,

142
00:16:09,877 --> 00:16:12,047
how can you make all the doctors your enemy?

143
00:16:12,047 --> 00:16:14,827
I know, Master.  Ai, what should I do now?

144
00:16:14,827 --> 00:16:16,607
What do you mean?

145
00:16:16,607 --> 00:16:19,767
You have to beg saying that you did wrong.

146
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:21,337
Well, he says that he's also the guardian.

147
00:16:21,337 --> 00:16:25,147
Go. He will be there right now.

148
00:16:33,537 --> 00:16:35,487
Weren't you too harsh?

149
00:16:35,487 --> 00:16:36,977
I only said what I had to say.

150
00:16:36,977 --> 00:16:39,457
It was just venting your anger on someone else.

151
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:42,027
- Venting my anger?
- Because it was a surgery you couldn't do.

152
00:16:42,027 --> 00:16:44,837
- It was surgery that killed the patient.
- It was a surgery that I, the guardian, wanted.

153
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,777
There was also a guardian who didn't want it.

154
00:16:47,777 --> 00:16:53,067
I understand. That you couldn't defy the Chairman's  decision.

155
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:58,227
But you saw it, too. Doctor Park

156
00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:00,707
really did his best.

157
00:17:01,597 --> 00:17:05,077
Even though Mom died, I'm still thankful for him.

158
00:17:06,447 --> 00:17:09,097
But you are only venting your anger on him.

159
00:17:10,517 --> 00:17:15,647
I really can't understand this side of you.

160
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:35,337
I was wrong, Chairman.

161
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:40,057
Chairman, Doctor Park will do well from now on.

162
00:17:40,057 --> 00:17:41,767
So please forgive him once.

163
00:17:41,767 --> 00:17:46,047
It's too late to ask for forgiveness.

164
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:51,317
I'm sorry for not saving the patient.

165
00:17:51,317 --> 00:17:53,497
- I will apologize again...
- That's what you did wrong.

166
00:17:53,497 --> 00:17:55,747
That you couldn't save the patient.

167
00:17:56,617 --> 00:18:01,407
The fact that you disobeyed my command. If you're going to beg, that's what you should be begging about!

168
00:18:02,787 --> 00:18:04,737
Since we didn't officially hire you,

169
00:18:04,737 --> 00:18:07,397
there is no reason to have a personnel committee.

170
00:18:07,397 --> 00:18:09,997
Leave my hospital right now.

171
00:18:21,487 --> 00:18:25,427
I'm sorry for disobeying your command. It will not happen again.

172
00:18:25,427 --> 00:18:29,007
That's good. Leave immediately.

173
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,067
That's my command.

174
00:18:32,597 --> 00:18:35,077
- And Doctor Moon.
- Yes?

175
00:18:35,077 --> 00:18:41,187
Be careful. I'm not a person with a lot of patience.

176
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:43,197
Let's go.

177
00:18:43,197 --> 00:18:45,317
Chairm... Chairman.

178
00:18:45,317 --> 00:18:48,587
Chairman! Chairman!

179
00:19:05,957 --> 00:19:08,357
You said that the Chairman is your father.

180
00:19:09,997 --> 00:19:11,957
I have to keep on staying here.

181
00:19:11,957 --> 00:19:14,187
Can't you do something?

182
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,427
Ah, really!

183
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:23,887
Hyung!

184
00:19:23,887 --> 00:19:26,237
Why are you running around and not staying by your mother's side?

185
00:19:26,237 --> 00:19:29,107
It's Mr. Lim. Answer it.

186
00:19:29,107 --> 00:19:31,017
Ajusshi?

187
00:19:31,017 --> 00:19:32,857
What?

188
00:19:32,857 --> 00:19:35,147
Doctor Park, where are you?

189
00:19:35,147 --> 00:19:37,097
What do you mean where? I'm at the hospital.

190
00:19:37,097 --> 00:19:39,167
- That woman ...
- Jae Hee?

191
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:42,467
- I found her.
- What?

192
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,667
Where is Jae Hee?

193
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:58,487
Hey, you have the cashier's check, right?

194
00:19:58,487 --> 00:20:00,427
The cashier's check?

195
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:09,057
Yes. Where is Jae Hee?

196
00:20:10,997 --> 00:20:13,117
If you want to know more,

197
00:20:13,117 --> 00:20:16,097
with the other half of the cashier's check, go wait for me  at your hospital.

198
00:20:34,047 --> 00:20:34,857
Is he here?

199
00:20:34,857 --> 00:20:36,737
He's not here, Hyung.

200
00:20:42,337 --> 00:20:44,077
Where are you?

201
00:21:29,507 --> 00:21:31,167
Ajusshi!

202
00:21:39,977 --> 00:21:41,527
Ajusshi.

203
00:21:47,027 --> 00:21:48,747
Ahjussi!

204
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:51,487
Ahjussi.

205
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:57,017
Damn it.

206
00:21:58,747 --> 00:22:01,437
Ahjussi.  Ahjussi!

207
00:22:03,147 --> 00:22:07,807
Doctor Park, save me.

208
00:22:07,807 --> 00:22:09,637
Don't talk.

209
00:22:12,687 --> 00:22:14,677
Ahjussi!

210
00:22:18,777 --> 00:22:20,617
Chang Yi, open the door.

211
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:27,527
What is this?

212
00:22:33,607 --> 00:22:34,607
I'll call the ambulance, Hyung.

213
00:22:34,607 --> 00:22:36,687
Okay. Go outside.

214
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,237
You're going to do surgery here?

215
00:22:53,237 --> 00:22:55,857
A bone fragment is stuck in the right ventricle.

216
00:22:56,607 --> 00:22:57,577
Other  blood vessels are okay.

217
00:22:57,577 --> 00:23:00,087
You can't. We can't do anything.  Let's wait until the ambulance comes.

218
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,137
There's no time. If we don't stop the hemorrhage, he'll die due to cardiac tamponade!

219
00:23:02,137 --> 00:23:05,067
How can you do surgery at a place like this?

220
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:07,157
Put this on.

221
00:23:23,647 --> 00:23:25,157
Pull.

222
00:23:26,477 --> 00:23:30,187
Why is the suction so weak? I can't see anything.

223
00:23:35,197 --> 00:23:37,017
Are you doing this properly, right now?

224
00:23:37,017 --> 00:23:39,177
Just focus on holding it.

225
00:24:02,647 --> 00:24:03,887
You saw this?

226
00:24:03,887 --> 00:24:06,427
How could you do anastomosis?

227
00:24:06,427 --> 00:24:10,357
Well, it's just... It's not that I see, but I just know.

228
00:24:10,357 --> 00:24:13,377
- It's not over yet, so please stay focused.
- Okay.

229
00:24:30,547 --> 00:24:32,817
 Garibong Clinic

230
00:24:44,877 --> 00:24:46,677
Let's go.

231
00:24:49,707 --> 00:24:55,407
Hey! Hey! Hey!

232
00:24:55,407 --> 00:24:57,387
What about me?!

233
00:24:58,517 --> 00:25:00,667
I'll just go in my own car.

234
00:25:05,177 --> 00:25:12,217

235
00:25:16,087 --> 00:25:17,727
You said a bone fragment is stuck on the right ventricle?

236
00:25:17,727 --> 00:25:19,557
For now, I took out the fragment and I only did first-aid.

237
00:25:19,557 --> 00:25:22,027
- Doctor Park?
- There could be damage to the ventricular septum.

238
00:25:22,027 --> 00:25:24,307
Prepare as much antibiotics as possible.

239
00:25:25,577 --> 00:25:28,497
- What are the vital signs?
- 80/50. Pulse is 110.

240
00:25:28,497 --> 00:25:30,717
- Please get one ampoule of EPI and please prepare more IV fluids.
- Yes.

241
00:25:30,717 --> 00:25:32,457
I'll do it so go hurry and get an operating room.

242
00:25:32,457 --> 00:25:34,527
You can't. You're prohibited from doing surgery.

243
00:25:34,527 --> 00:25:36,917
Don't say bullsh*t, I'm going to do it. I need to save this person!

244
00:25:36,917 --> 00:25:38,797
You don't do the surgery alone.

245
00:25:38,797 --> 00:25:41,447
Can you do a surgery without a scrub nurse, or an anesthesiologist?

246
00:25:42,497 --> 00:25:46,207
You said you did first-aid. Then leave the rest to us.

247
00:25:46,207 --> 00:25:50,067
 That woman ... I found her.

248
00:25:51,367 --> 00:25:54,267
Okay. I'll leave it to you.

249
00:25:54,267 --> 00:25:56,737
Get a surgery room and call Dr. Keum.

250
00:26:08,237 --> 00:26:10,017
Suction.

251
00:26:13,237 --> 00:26:17,267
Nerves on the ventricle are alright. This is unworthy of the word "first-aid".

252
00:26:17,267 --> 00:26:18,427
Who did this?

253
00:26:18,427 --> 00:26:20,367
Doctor Park Hoon.

254
00:26:20,367 --> 00:26:23,037
I thought he was prohibited from doing surgery.

255
00:26:23,037 --> 00:26:26,357
Well, he's not a person who quibbles over those things.

256
00:26:26,357 --> 00:26:31,287
It'd be great if Dr. Keum were to have that kind of recklessness.

257
00:26:34,687 --> 00:26:37,027
How... how are the vitals?

258
00:26:38,247 --> 00:26:40,427
They're very good.

259
00:26:40,427 --> 00:26:42,377
Suction.

260
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:45,057
How is it?

261
00:26:45,057 --> 00:26:50,007
There's nothing to do. His skills are really good.

262
00:26:53,847 --> 00:26:56,347
Will Ajusshi be okay?

263
00:26:57,487 --> 00:27:01,877
But could it be that Ahjussi really saw Jae Hee unni?

264
00:27:05,987 --> 00:27:09,527
He definitely said that. That he found her.

265
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:11,147
But...

266
00:27:12,377 --> 00:27:14,057
I can find her.

267
00:27:15,937 --> 00:27:20,337
If he wakes up, I can find her. I can find her.

268
00:27:30,777 --> 00:27:35,397
Juliet Binoche is  a very famous French actress.

269
00:27:35,397 --> 00:27:39,787
Really? I don't really know who she is.

270
00:27:39,787 --> 00:27:41,917
If you just look in the mirror you'll see it.

271
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:45,427
Omo, Doctor, are you seducing me right now?

272
00:27:45,427 --> 00:27:47,407
When do you finish?

273
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:53,547
Yap!

274
00:27:55,267 --> 00:27:57,877
Oh, it's amazing.

275
00:27:57,877 --> 00:27:59,637
It's amazing right?

276
00:28:01,107 --> 00:28:05,497
This is the moat that first blocks the enemy.

277
00:28:07,137 --> 00:28:10,447
And the castle wall that never crumbles down.

278
00:28:10,447 --> 00:28:15,137
and this is the inner castle where the lord stays.

279
00:28:16,247 --> 00:28:21,997
Ah, our dear princess has to be at the top of the castle where the view is the greatest.

280
00:28:24,057 --> 00:28:26,327
That location is the best for a princess.

281
00:28:26,327 --> 00:28:29,097
But there's a knight who's good at fighting.

282
00:28:30,337 --> 00:28:32,247
He covets this castle.

283
00:28:32,247 --> 00:28:34,937
Then he must seduce the princess.

284
00:28:34,937 --> 00:28:37,437
As expected, you are Kim Chi Gyu.

285
00:28:38,807 --> 00:28:42,027
To get the favor of the lord of the castle, you have to be good at fighting but you have to also

286
00:28:42,027 --> 00:28:44,107
obviously steal the princess's heart.

287
00:28:44,107 --> 00:28:47,197
He's good at fighting. He stole the princess's heart. It's the end.

288
00:28:47,197 --> 00:28:49,487
But the knight falls into a dilemma.

289
00:28:49,487 --> 00:28:51,767
What dilemma?

290
00:28:51,767 --> 00:28:54,567
Every time he  sees the princess,

291
00:28:55,657 --> 00:28:57,857
his heart feels weird.

292
00:28:57,857 --> 00:29:00,047
He must've fallen in love.

293
00:29:00,787 --> 00:29:03,217
- Love?
- The knight can't be like that.

294
00:29:03,217 --> 00:29:06,987
If he wants to swallow the castle, that's extravagance.

295
00:29:13,277 --> 00:29:15,477
You're really drunk though.

296
00:29:19,857 --> 00:29:20,927
I'll go in first.

297
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:25,167
Then will you do that? Are you really okay, Hyungnim? Really?

298
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:27,307
Take good care of him.

299
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:45,047
 But you are only venting your anger on him.

300
00:29:45,047 --> 00:29:50,267
  I really can't understand this side of you.

301
00:30:06,177 --> 00:30:08,037
Did you drink?

302
00:30:10,627 --> 00:30:11,527
I have to go home.

303
00:30:11,527 --> 00:30:13,127
I'm sorry, Soo Hyeon.

304
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:19,097
I couldn't go against Chairman's orders.

305
00:30:19,097 --> 00:30:22,347
You're right, I vented my anger on Doctor Park.

306
00:30:22,347 --> 00:30:25,247
You're really drunk, Jae Joon. Go rest.

307
00:30:25,247 --> 00:30:28,067
At first I thought it was because of pride.

308
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:32,567
I couldn't do it, but because Doctor Park did.

309
00:30:34,907 --> 00:30:36,307
But that wasn't it.

310
00:30:36,307 --> 00:30:37,487
Then why?

311
00:30:37,487 --> 00:30:42,507
I couldn't hold it in. You were supporting Doctor Park,

312
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,477
I really hated it.

313
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:51,077
The fact that you were not on my side but on Doctor Park's,

314
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:54,737
I really hated it.

315
00:30:54,737 --> 00:30:56,917
Jae Joon.

316
00:31:00,197 --> 00:31:04,657
It's obvious that you would do that,

317
00:31:04,657 --> 00:31:07,107
but my feelings,

318
00:31:08,237 --> 00:31:10,627
I couldn't control them.

319
00:31:29,677 --> 00:31:34,107
Thank you, for telling me honestly.

320
00:31:41,487 --> 00:31:43,577
I'm sorry.

321
00:32:04,137 --> 00:32:09,127
 Myeongwoo University Hospital

322
00:32:37,397 --> 00:32:40,497
I'm sorry. I was late because there was an emergency surgery.

323
00:32:40,497 --> 00:32:43,037
You don't need to sit.

324
00:32:57,717 --> 00:33:01,647
Sang Jin will be on the  Business Management team.

325
00:33:04,127 --> 00:33:07,017
If you have something to say, say it now.

326
00:33:11,507 --> 00:33:13,817
I'll tell you tomorrow.

327
00:33:13,817 --> 00:33:16,217
I said I'll hear it now.

328
00:33:25,467 --> 00:33:30,267
A 67 year old male patient was brought to the ER due to heart failure  three months ago.

329
00:33:30,267 --> 00:33:32,287
He is complaining of  extreme fatigue.

330
00:33:32,287 --> 00:33:35,157
First let's give him diuretics and do an echocardiogram (heart ultrasound).

331
00:33:35,157 --> 00:33:39,037
There is a possibility of heart failure so watch him carefully.

332
00:33:43,387 --> 00:33:46,547
What is it?

333
00:33:46,547 --> 00:33:49,017
I am from the Metropolitan Police.

334
00:33:51,017 --> 00:33:55,137
Yesterday, I didn't know that the woman was married.

335
00:33:55,137 --> 00:33:59,427
But I took her home without doing anything else.  But what is this ominous feeling?  He's coming, coming.

336
00:33:59,427 --> 00:34:02,947
He's coming. I think it's me.

337
00:34:05,697 --> 00:34:08,127
Are you Doctor Park Hoon?

338
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:14,037
Shall we go out?

339
00:34:24,887 --> 00:34:27,167
He should probably be able to regain consciousness.

340
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:30,747
Is there maybe another witness?

341
00:34:30,747 --> 00:34:33,577
It's just me and my friend.

342
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:55,717

343
00:35:05,847 --> 00:35:07,597
Hyung!

344
00:35:08,497 --> 00:35:10,627
Ajusshi...

345
00:35:21,807 --> 00:35:23,787
Why is the man who had a surgery yesterday not in his place?

346
00:35:23,787 --> 00:35:25,677
I don't know.

347
00:35:25,677 --> 00:35:29,587
Sun Hee, does the patient Lim Hang Seo in Room 1105 have something else scheduled today?

348
00:35:29,587 --> 00:35:31,647
No he doesn't, is he not there?

349
00:35:31,647 --> 00:35:34,997
How can you ask me that?

350
00:35:38,247 --> 00:35:41,087
Our Dr. Water Bottle did the surgery so well that

351
00:35:41,087 --> 00:35:42,957
he must've walked out on his two feet.

352
00:35:42,957 --> 00:35:44,887
What?

353
00:35:46,507 --> 00:35:48,587
- Hyung!
- What?

354
00:35:48,587 --> 00:35:51,847
There's a text message from Ahjussi.

355
00:35:51,847 --> 00:35:54,777
I am going to China, let's not see each other from now on.

356
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:57,647
This unlucky fellow.

357
00:36:00,047 --> 00:36:03,217
Why is this conman not picking up the phone again?

358
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:24,787
How is your health, Prime Minister Jang?

359
00:36:24,787 --> 00:36:27,227
Yes, it's bearable Mr. President.

360
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:30,517
Is the selection of the surgery team going well?

361
00:36:30,517 --> 00:36:32,517
Yes.

362
00:36:32,517 --> 00:36:35,517
I hope a good team will be chosen.

363
00:36:35,517 --> 00:36:39,217
Since we have to fix the heart of a precious person.

364
00:36:40,437 --> 00:36:44,177
Oh yes, I called the Director of Police.

365
00:36:44,177 --> 00:36:46,117
He probably has many other cases,

366
00:36:46,117 --> 00:36:50,147
so would there be a point in bringing up incidents during the presidential election...

367
00:36:51,907 --> 00:36:54,267
Prime Minister Jang's health isn't that well either,

368
00:36:54,267 --> 00:36:57,217
so I told him to bury it.

369
00:36:57,217 --> 00:36:59,367
For now.

370
00:37:16,717 --> 00:37:20,737
This sneaky old man.

371
00:37:20,737 --> 00:37:23,377
He clutched my vulnerability.

372
00:37:23,377 --> 00:37:26,737
So he's telling me to listen well, huh.

373
00:37:30,397 --> 00:37:32,127
Okay.

374
00:37:33,047 --> 00:37:37,407
First, I'll listen to him.

375
00:37:42,517 --> 00:37:45,757
What happened with the business in Pyeongtaek?

376
00:37:51,147 --> 00:37:55,167
- What about Park Hoon?
- We have an unexpected situation.

377
00:37:55,167 --> 00:37:56,947
I hear he is getting  kicked out of the hospital.

378
00:37:56,947 --> 00:37:58,797
What?

379
00:38:00,097 --> 00:38:02,777
It was a surgery that I asked him to do.

380
00:38:02,777 --> 00:38:04,907
If you want to give punishment, do it to me.

381
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:07,887
Is that all you have to say?

382
00:38:07,887 --> 00:38:13,207
Before you defend him, you should ask for forgiveness from me first.

383
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:16,907
You never went against my words.

384
00:38:16,907 --> 00:38:19,867
Even if you did something wrong you asked for forgiveness soon,

385
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:23,127
and each time, I forgave you.

386
00:38:24,917 --> 00:38:26,707
Yesterday, you also had that chance.

387
00:38:26,707 --> 00:38:30,267
But you didn't say anything.

388
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:33,067
What in the world is the reason?

389
00:38:37,937 --> 00:38:40,577
Please forgive Doctor Park Hoon.

390
00:38:40,577 --> 00:38:43,317
I asked what the reason is?!

391
00:38:44,467 --> 00:38:49,817
Yes. If there is a call looking for me, please tell them my contact information right away.

392
00:38:49,817 --> 00:38:52,007
Yes.

393
00:38:57,087 --> 00:38:58,837
Did they say Unni's name was there?

394
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,617
No.

395
00:39:00,617 --> 00:39:03,117
By any chance, did Ahjussi mistook what he saw?

396
00:39:03,117 --> 00:39:04,427
He definitely said he found her.

397
00:39:04,427 --> 00:39:07,497
You were the one who said Ahjussi is a swindler.

398
00:39:07,497 --> 00:39:08,607
What he said was true.

399
00:39:08,607 --> 00:39:10,437
But it's strange.

400
00:39:10,437 --> 00:39:14,987
If she came from North Korea, even if you leave Hanawon, you have to leave your contact number.(defector training facility)

401
00:39:14,987 --> 00:39:17,427
Why are you leaving your mother and following me around, Punk?

402
00:39:17,427 --> 00:39:19,137
Because I'm worried.

403
00:39:19,137 --> 00:39:21,487
Why would you...

404
00:39:30,777 --> 00:39:33,127
You said you definitely saw Jae Hee here right?

405
00:39:33,127 --> 00:39:35,177
I don't know.

406
00:39:37,097 --> 00:39:38,297
It was Jae Hee.

407
00:39:38,297 --> 00:39:41,527
If I say no, I mean no. Okay?

408
00:39:41,527 --> 00:39:43,277
- I said no.
- Wait.

409
00:39:43,277 --> 00:39:46,577
-Just a minute! 
-I said no.

410
00:39:48,437 --> 00:39:50,817
Come on, damn it!

411
00:39:50,817 --> 00:39:52,797
Last Monday afternoon, it was around 3-4 PM.

412
00:39:52,797 --> 00:39:55,077
I just need to check the ER's CCTV please?

413
00:39:55,077 --> 00:39:57,477
I'm sorry.

414
00:39:58,507 --> 00:40:00,077
Hyung!

415
00:40:00,887 --> 00:40:01,897
Stop it, Hyung.

416
00:40:01,897 --> 00:40:03,467
I almost found her. Stop what?

417
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:06,087
Mom said she saw Unni in North Korea.

418
00:40:06,817 --> 00:40:08,647
Unni...

419
00:40:09,947 --> 00:40:14,087
 There was a girl named Song Jae Hee

420
00:40:14,087 --> 00:40:18,737
 who came after getting shot abroad about 2 years ago.

421
00:40:18,737 --> 00:40:24,267
Even though that young lady was near death,

422
00:40:24,267 --> 00:40:31,817
she would continuously say, "Hoon, Hoon, Hoon."

423
00:40:34,607 --> 00:40:37,197
 Her fever is too high...

424
00:40:37,197 --> 00:40:40,067
 You can't forget about me.

425
00:40:41,357 --> 00:40:43,217
 Hoon.

426
00:40:43,217 --> 00:40:45,737
 Hoon.

427
00:40:45,737 --> 00:40:51,677
She continually called out for Dr. Park like that, then because we told them that she couldn't breathe,

428
00:40:51,677 --> 00:40:54,997
it was then that a doctor finally came.

429
00:40:57,327 --> 00:41:00,027
When they came and looked...

430
00:41:01,097 --> 00:41:03,877
they said she was dead.

431
00:41:06,107 --> 00:41:09,197
What should we do about our Dr. Park...

432
00:41:11,007 --> 00:41:14,037
What should we do...

433
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:23,067
Jae Hee's not dead. She's alive.

434
00:41:26,337 --> 00:41:29,357
She's mistaken. Jae Hee's alive.

435
00:41:29,357 --> 00:41:32,237
Please stop now, Hyung. She said she died.

436
00:41:32,237 --> 00:41:34,557
Shut up!

437
00:41:34,557 --> 00:41:36,327
Hyung.

438
00:41:38,437 --> 00:41:41,617
I will be able to find out if I watch the CCTV.

439
00:41:41,617 --> 00:41:43,917
Then I will be able to meet her.

440
00:41:43,917 --> 00:41:47,177
Hyung, please stop!

441
00:41:51,667 --> 00:41:56,917
Chang Yi, I have something to ask you.

442
00:41:56,917 --> 00:42:01,177
Doctor, is the guardian of the grandma in Room 1104 present?

443
00:42:01,177 --> 00:42:02,667
Excuse me, Doctor.

444
00:42:02,667 --> 00:42:05,217
Leave him. I heard Water Bottle was fired today.

445
00:42:05,217 --> 00:42:10,127
Water Bottle?  Is that the person who did the incision without bleeding?

446
00:42:11,217 --> 00:42:13,777
But is there really such a thing, Unnie?

447
00:42:13,777 --> 00:42:16,447
You said you worked as an OR nurse for a long time at that last hospital.

448
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:20,507
If they're skilled. But why would you fire someone like that?

449
00:42:20,507 --> 00:42:23,177
Because he's someone  who deserves to be fired.

450
00:42:23,177 --> 00:42:28,867
Get a urine sample from room 311, Patient Kang Chang Soo.

451
00:42:28,867 --> 00:42:30,967
Yes, Doctor.

452
00:42:34,917 --> 00:42:37,057
Your face looks haggard.

453
00:42:38,107 --> 00:42:40,027
Are you okay?

454
00:42:41,227 --> 00:42:45,077
I have to earn money. I'm not single anymore.

455
00:42:52,407 --> 00:42:55,627
He has a girlfriend in North Korea?

456
00:42:55,627 --> 00:42:59,727
He came here (to work) because he needs money to bring Jae Hee here.

457
00:42:59,727 --> 00:43:02,757
Her name is Jae Hee?

458
00:43:02,757 --> 00:43:08,237
Yes. She almost escaped, but she was taken back again.

459
00:43:08,237 --> 00:43:11,657
Then I guess she is still in North Korea.

460
00:43:11,657 --> 00:43:14,047
I heard she died.

461
00:43:16,967 --> 00:43:20,877
But he's acting like that to find a dead person.

462
00:43:20,877 --> 00:43:23,267
I am going crazy. Seriously.

463
00:43:32,017 --> 00:43:34,307
If you watch the CCTV, can you verify that it's Jae Hee?

464
00:43:34,307 --> 00:43:35,897
Of course I can.

465
00:43:35,897 --> 00:43:39,417
Chang Yi said that she died in North Korea.

466
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:42,797
Don't say things like that. Jae Hee is alive. I saw her.

467
00:43:42,797 --> 00:43:45,727
It could have been someone else.

468
00:43:45,727 --> 00:43:47,377
How could I mistake her?

469
00:43:47,377 --> 00:43:50,337
Since it's been a long time since you broke up,

470
00:43:50,337 --> 00:43:51,987
you could have mistaken her for someone else.

471
00:43:51,987 --> 00:43:56,067
Mistake? Can you mistake a person you love?

472
00:43:56,067 --> 00:44:01,997
Yes,  your mom. You think you could mistake her even though it has been a while?

473
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:07,327
She was Jae Hee. The one that I saw was definitely Jae Hee.

474
00:44:07,327 --> 00:44:09,417
Okay.

475
00:44:09,417 --> 00:44:12,747
I'll help you, so let's first go there.

476
00:44:28,327 --> 00:44:37,117

477
00:44:41,767 --> 00:44:42,757
When did you say it was?

478
00:44:42,757 --> 00:44:46,437
Last Monday. The time is around 3-4 PM.

479
00:44:48,077 --> 00:44:51,017
You said she came towards the ER, right?

480
00:44:53,267 --> 00:44:56,457
Here. Isn't this you?

481
00:44:57,487 --> 00:45:01,497
- What about the parking lot? 
 - The one that shows the parking lot...

482
00:45:04,887 --> 00:45:06,587
Is that her?

483
00:45:07,847 --> 00:45:10,047
Can you zoom in?

484
00:45:15,307 --> 00:45:16,807
It seems like she's a doctor at our hospital...

485
00:45:16,807 --> 00:45:20,517
Is there anywhere else? She went to the ER from the lobby.

486
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:22,957
The lobby is farther...

487
00:45:40,887 --> 00:45:43,257
What are you doing?

488
00:45:43,257 --> 00:45:44,477
You were trespassing.

489
00:45:44,477 --> 00:45:46,017
We are hospital employees.

490
00:45:46,017 --> 00:45:49,947
He got fired.

491
00:45:50,787 --> 00:45:54,847
Go and come back. Father will be extremely happy.

492
00:45:54,847 --> 00:45:57,917
- Over something like this? 
 - Something like this?

493
00:45:58,787 --> 00:46:00,637
Just over a thing like this,

494
00:46:00,637 --> 00:46:04,217
how you crazily fussed all this time,

495
00:46:04,217 --> 00:46:06,657
did you forget?

496
00:46:20,837 --> 00:46:24,617
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

497
00:46:25,997 --> 00:46:30,007
But is the girl earlier Jae Hee?

498
00:46:30,007 --> 00:46:32,457
I don't know.

499
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:35,077
I really don't know.

500
00:46:37,077 --> 00:46:40,717
 That woman ... I found her.

501
00:46:40,717 --> 00:46:43,627
  She died.

502
00:46:46,597 --> 00:46:49,997
Is Jae Hee a doctor?

503
00:46:52,037 --> 00:46:56,977
The person you saw was wearing a doctor's coat.

504
00:46:59,657 --> 00:47:04,037
We attended medical school together.

505
00:47:04,037 --> 00:47:06,607
What kind of person was she?

506
00:47:07,747 --> 00:47:09,427
What kind of person?

507
00:47:09,427 --> 00:47:12,927
Yeah, Jae Hee.

508
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:20,017
Someone who smiles often...

509
00:47:25,347 --> 00:47:27,907
Smiles often...

510
00:47:33,857 --> 00:47:36,087
Smiles often...

511
00:48:19,407 --> 00:48:21,267
 Changing Room

512
00:48:40,507 --> 00:48:42,177
Yes, this is Han Seung Hee.

513
00:48:42,177 --> 00:48:44,467
Park Hoon's been kicked out of the hospital.

514
00:48:44,467 --> 00:48:45,987
I know.

515
00:48:45,987 --> 00:48:47,307
Stupid bastard.

516
00:48:47,307 --> 00:48:52,657
More than that, a defector who's saying that Song Jae Hee died has appeared.

517
00:48:52,657 --> 00:48:56,247
At this rate, all our plans are going to go down the drain.

518
00:48:56,247 --> 00:48:58,367
They already have.

519
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,917
We're returning to the North.

520
00:48:59,917 --> 00:49:02,437
But we still have the opportunity...

521
00:49:15,137 --> 00:49:19,617
Since there are so many people who look alike in this world,

522
00:49:19,617 --> 00:49:23,057
perhaps, you made a mistake.

523
00:49:24,897 --> 00:49:28,007
Did I really make a mistake?

524
00:49:29,677 --> 00:49:32,557
Is the Jae Hee I saw

525
00:49:32,557 --> 00:49:35,417
really someone else?

526
00:50:02,847 --> 00:50:05,647
I won't go out alone.

527
00:50:05,647 --> 00:50:08,047
Soo Hyeon.

528
00:50:20,707 --> 00:50:22,947
Useless punk.

529
00:50:22,947 --> 00:50:24,097
I'm sorry, Father.

530
00:50:24,097 --> 00:50:30,037
Because of selecting the surgery team for the Prime Minister, other hospitals are looking for weakness. What is this?

531
00:50:30,037 --> 00:50:33,027
I was wrong, Father.

532
00:50:35,177 --> 00:50:38,617
You also, don't ever appear in front of me.

533
00:50:50,817 --> 00:50:53,837
You are really the cancer in my life.

534
00:50:53,837 --> 00:50:55,847
It's an honor.

535
00:50:55,847 --> 00:50:57,277
Did you do it on purpose?

536
00:50:57,277 --> 00:51:01,357
Acting like you're watching your mom being transferred here, to screw me over?

537
00:51:02,577 --> 00:51:04,077
I'm afraid to see you in my dreams.

538
00:51:04,077 --> 00:51:06,857
What are you talking about? What do you mean my mom was being transferred here?

539
00:51:06,857 --> 00:51:11,547
What you were watching... that was the CCTV footage of the day your mom was transferred here!

540
00:51:11,547 --> 00:51:17,477
 My name is Han Seung Hee. When Kim Eun Hee was at this branch, I was the doctor in charge.

541
00:51:31,977 --> 00:51:36,367
 Garibong Clinic

542
00:52:23,317 --> 00:52:25,497
 Hoon.

543
00:52:27,667 --> 00:52:29,307
Hoon?

544
00:52:30,387 --> 00:52:32,337
 Hoon.

545
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:35,307
Hoon?

546
00:52:36,077 --> 00:52:38,057
 Hoon.

547
00:52:39,247 --> 00:52:40,957
Hoon.

548
00:53:19,707 --> 00:53:20,927
Why do you want Jae Hee's picture?

549
00:53:20,927 --> 00:53:23,177
Because there is something I need to verify.

550
00:53:48,137 --> 00:53:49,967
Why did you go looking for him?

551
00:53:49,967 --> 00:53:54,127
That person, Park Hoon... Song Jae Hee can send him back to the hospital.

552
00:53:54,127 --> 00:53:58,597
How? The rumor that Song Jae Hee is dead has reached his ears.

553
00:53:58,597 --> 00:54:01,897
Don't you know? That's why I looked for him.

554
00:54:01,897 --> 00:54:05,227
Because I have to show him that Song Jae Hee is alive.

555
00:54:11,887 --> 00:54:14,277
 Hoon.

556
00:54:14,277 --> 00:54:16,477
 Hoon.

557
00:54:18,247 --> 00:54:20,467
 I'm Han Seung Hee.

558
00:54:22,387 --> 00:54:25,077
Have you seen her?

559
00:54:30,627 --> 00:54:32,897
Comrade, you should've sent me to Park Hoon first.

560
00:54:32,897 --> 00:54:34,827
How could you miss something like that?

561
00:54:34,827 --> 00:54:36,097
Have you gone blind from revengeful thoughts?

562
00:54:36,097 --> 00:54:38,127
Don't say ridiculous things.

563
00:54:38,127 --> 00:54:39,567
The task is the most important thing to me.

564
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,627
Then I'm going to meet Park Hoon even if it's now.

565
00:54:41,627 --> 00:54:43,207
You are wrong.

566
00:54:43,207 --> 00:54:46,617
Even if you meet him, he can't go back to the hospital anyway.

567
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:50,877
Oh Joon Gyu is not an easy man.

568
00:54:50,877 --> 00:54:53,777
So are you going to give up the task?

569
00:54:53,777 --> 00:54:56,657
This is all because of that bastard, Park Hoon.

570
00:54:56,657 --> 00:55:00,447
That worthless guy made everything into a mess.

571
00:55:01,837 --> 00:55:06,307
She's the doctor who brought my mother to the hospital.  You said you saw her that day.

572
00:55:22,587 --> 00:55:27,027
Yes, she was Jae Hee.

573
00:55:42,177 --> 00:55:44,727
There's no way we can finish the task.

574
00:55:44,727 --> 00:55:47,207
But the chance to take revenge is not gone.

575
00:55:47,207 --> 00:55:49,907
Please think objectively.

576
00:55:49,907 --> 00:55:52,147
Are you going to give up the task for  mere revenge?

577
00:55:52,147 --> 00:55:54,547
A mere revenge?

578
00:55:54,547 --> 00:55:57,647
What do you know that you're babbling?

579
00:56:13,427 --> 00:56:15,327
  Emergency Medical Center.

580
00:56:15,327 --> 00:56:17,227
Where is Doctor Han Seung Hee?

581
00:56:17,227 --> 00:56:19,207
We haven't been able to contact her for hours.

582
00:56:19,207 --> 00:56:20,067
Why can't you get a hold of her?

583
00:56:20,067 --> 00:56:23,557
I was wondering as well. It has never happened before.

584
00:56:33,697 --> 00:56:37,627
Then kill me first.

585
00:56:39,097 --> 00:56:40,817
You think I won't be able to kill you?

586
00:56:40,817 --> 00:56:43,367
There's only death for people who do not complete the task.

587
00:56:43,367 --> 00:56:46,787
I, Han Seung Hee, am not afraid of death given by my country.

588
00:56:46,787 --> 00:56:52,137
I, too, am only afraid that I cannot finish the task.

589
00:57:08,187 --> 00:57:10,507
She didn't pick up?

590
00:57:11,977 --> 00:57:13,577
First, let's go to my mom's house.

591
00:57:13,577 --> 00:57:14,547
Your mom's house?

592
00:57:14,547 --> 00:57:17,517
-She was living with my mom at my mom's house.
-Okay.

593
00:57:21,207 --> 00:57:23,997
Doctor Oh.

594
00:57:44,207 --> 00:57:47,967
Dr. Oh, what brings you here at this time?

595
00:57:55,647 --> 00:57:57,877
Jae Hee.
