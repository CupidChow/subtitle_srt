[Episode 24]

3
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,940
You scared me!

4
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,790
Did the doctor say anything?

5
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,040
Does it still hurt?

6
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,210
Mo Fei, what did your roommate just say?

7
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,710
Is something wrong with your health?

8
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,080
President Tang is here?

9
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,280
I didn't know you guys were video chatting. I—

10
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,010
You two don't need to be so worried. I'm fine. Look. Right?

11
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,330
You even went to the hospital, how are you fine?

12
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,500
I will find time to go and visit you.

13
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,370
Don't, don't! Don't come. I was just...

14
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,840
I was just a little bloated, so I went to see the doctor. Look!

15
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,090
Aren't I fine now?

16
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,290
Also, even if you come, I wouldn't have time to keep you company.

17
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,630
I've been busy with classes lately.

18
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,350
But I'm worried about you. What shall I do?

19
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,310
You really don't need to. You, on the other hand,

20
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,540
need to take care of yourself.

21
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,120
Say, is work more important or is your health more important?

22
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,120
You are more important.

23
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,250
Such a sweet talker.

24
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,070
All right. Don't work too late.

25
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,470
All right. I'll get to work now.

26
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,110
Bye.

27
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,770
Scared me to death.

28
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,040
Director Fang, you're eating breakfast?

29
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,320
- Did you eat?
- Yes, I did.

30
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,510
I found this lab test report in your car.

31
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,120
Did you go to the hospital yesterday?

32
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:16,070
Have you not yet recovered from your previous injury? Why did you drive yourself instead of calling me?

33
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,230
That's not mine.

34
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,880
Oh. Then why is it in your car?

35
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,990
Mo Fei was sick last night. I took her to the hospital.

36
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,690
You took her to the hospital?

37
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,710
What about her roommate?

38
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,700
Her roommate wasn't home, so I took her. It was nothing.

39
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,340
B-But he's your family doctor.

40
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,180
I already said it was nothing.

41
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:46,570
Well... when I was sick in France last time, you didn't take me to this doctor.

42
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:54,110
Director Fang, have you fallen for Mo Fei for real?

43
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,750
Don't you know why I came to France?

44
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,180
Of course!

45
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,740
I just think... you don't know clearly why.

46
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,140
How do I not know why?

47
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,080
Look!

48
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,640
You bought an apartment here

49
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,750
and became neighbors with Mo Fei, right?

50
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,180
You also fought someone for her and got hurt.

51
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,430
You also gave her a tour of Cayman and gave a lecture at her school.

52
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,860
As long as she's in trouble, you're the first to do something.

53
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,830
Director Fang, in my experience,

54
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,950
when an actor plays a character too many times,

55
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,610
he gets immersed in it and it becomes serious.

56
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,250
I think you are getting serious now, which is dangerous.

57
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,580
After such a long time of caring for Mo Fei,

58
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,750
even you don't know if it's real or fake.

59
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,600
Are you done?

60
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,170
I'm done. You wouldn't have really fallen for Mo Fei, right?

61
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,540
You can go to work now.

62
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,480
- Aren't you going?
- None of your business.

63
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,220
You need to be at Cayman before 9:00 a.m.

64
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,040
Hurry and go.

65
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,500
Director Fang...

66
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,290
Hurry and go. Stop the nonsense.

67
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,870
- If you like her...
- Leave now.

68
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,620
Okay.

69
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,330
Let's look at these drawings.

70
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,490
Look at this pleated skirt,

71
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,850
the waistline, the skirt's border,

72
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,000
the navy collar, the square collar,

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,360
and the stand-up collar.

74
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,040
There you go.

75
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,650
Let's take a break, and meet again after 20 minutes.

76
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:53,510
Mo Fei, did you understand this? How do you do this line?

77
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,950
This?

78
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:59,010
Look on the board. It should be like this.

79
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,460
This should be it.

80
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,780
By the way, shouldn't the result of the competition we entered last time be out by now?

81
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,600
How did I forget about that? Let's hurry and take a look.

82
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,100
Look at the tailoring.

83
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,390
- The tailoring is very bold.
- Yes.

84
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,750
There's also this color combination.

85
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:31,510
This color contrast looks very nice, too.

86
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,040
When will ours show up?

87
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,230
Here comes another one.

88
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,040
Wow.

89
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,610
This is so pretty.

90
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,860
It looks even better on the runway.

91
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,670
That's right. It's better than I imagined.

92
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,480
Perfect.

93
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:04,140
[Songtang]
[Symphony of Clouds and Mist]

94
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:08,740
We've confirmed the main theme of our show this time is "Symphony of Lights, Clouds, and Smoke."

95
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,880
At the same time, we also decided to use the traditional Chinese elements as the focus.

96
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,320
Most importantly, Songtang

97
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,090
is the brand that keeps traditional Chinese elements.

98
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,340
Therefore,

99
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:28,330
I would like Designer Cheng Yang to be responsible for Songtang's designs at this time.

100
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,250
There are still some people who haven't met Cheng Yang yet, right?

101
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,730
Hello, everyone. My name is Cheng Yang.

102
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:41,540
I hope we will have a good time working together. Thank you.

103
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,470
Even though Designer Cheng Yang is very young, he

104
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,910
has received the LVMH award.

105
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,450
I'm sure you've all heard.

106
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:56,120
I believe that you can bring new life to Songtang.

107
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,610
Let's work hard together.

108
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,640
By the way, you will be in charge of the men's outfits.

109
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,130
I'm sure you all know the significance of this show.

110
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,230
So, I hope you all do your best.

111
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,120
Okay. That's it.

112
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,470
[Duoduo]

113
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,980
Sorry.

114
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,190
How has it been? Have you gotten accustomed to the company yet?

115
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,900
It's been good. I've gotten quite familiar with it.

116
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,740
The design environment in China is different than abroad. I was afraid you wouldn't get used to it.

117
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,910
I'm fine. Thank you, Director Xia.

118
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:39,180
It was my idea to have you in charge of Songtang. It's also President Tang's wish.

119
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,950
Songtang hasn't been doing very well due to the market.

120
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,540
However, as the oldest brand in Mingyuan Fashion Group,

121
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,510
I'm sure you know what this means to us.

122
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,600
Don't worry, Director Xia.

123
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,960
I will seriously create the designs for this season.

124
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,960
Then, what do you have in mind for the designs of this season?

125
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,480
I would like to use elements of splash ink landscape painting as the focus.

126
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,490
Splash ink landscape?

127
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:07,250
- I haven't thought of the details yet. I still need to find some inspiration.
- Okay.

128
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,210
- Then let's talk after you've thought of the details.
- Okay.

129
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,220
Do your best. I look forward to your work.

130
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,890
I'm going to get going then.

131
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,810
Bye, Director Xia.

132
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,880
Thank you very much, everyone, for coming here tonight.

133
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,080
Thank you.

134
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,080
Now is the moment we announce the best design in the competition.

135
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,410
The winner is...

136
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,480
No. 5, Jean McCarthy.

137
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,660
What?

138
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,800
We lost the competition just like that.

139
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,400
They'll return our outfits, right?

140
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,050
- Probably.
- Are you two all right?

141
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,160
I'm fine. Thanks.

142
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,500
Good. It's okay.

143
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,050
But you need to understand why your work wasn't selected.

144
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,670
Why?

145
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:15,710
Do you remember that I reminded you to pay attention to the details?

146
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,360
Was it still not enough?

147
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,460
It needed to be more profound.

148
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,660
It also needed more lively colors.

149
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,420
After all, it's a clothing exhibition to be photographed.

150
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,380
The decorative quality is very important.

151
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,000
Do you understand?

152
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,500
Maybe we weren't suited to

153
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,900
participate in this kind of fashion show after all.

154
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,550
But the fabric you chose

155
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,930
was the perfect match for your concept.

156
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,680
Really? Thank you very much.

157
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,240
What are you doing here?

158
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,510
I came to see how it's going with choosing the theme.

159
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,790
Here's the thing. Cheng Yang wants to do splash ink.

160
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,860
- Splash ink?
- Yes.

161
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,210
If we want a splash ink effect on our clothing,

162
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:11,110
we need to pick the right fabric.

163
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,090
So, right now, I'm...

164
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,580
Tell me about the splash ink concept.

165
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,520
How can it be created?

166
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,110
You've seen splash ink before.

167
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:22,550
It's a type of random expression.

168
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,120
It's a type of beauty that arises accidentally,

169
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,670
so, as to how the clothing will come out,

170
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,970
we cannot predict it.

171
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,930
I think it's quite an interesting idea.

172
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,770
It basically means that every piece created

173
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,020
is unique.

174
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,540
Yes, this idea of his is good.

175
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,570
But when we actually execute it,

176
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,820
I think this randomness will create problems.

177
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,790
Furthermore, none of us can foresee the seriousness of the problems.

178
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,300
We also can't control the results.

179
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,660
Then, how do you want to deal with that?

180
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,590
I think that even though we are creating art,

181
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,190
it's still merchandise,

182
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:04,550
and merchandise should match the public's aesthetics.

183
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,370
Cheng Yang's idea is too idealistic.

184
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,640
It's not realistic at all.

185
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,250
This is what I think. We hired Cheng Yang because

186
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,120
we hope he can bring new life to the company

187
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,130
and brings new ideas.

188
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,970
So we need to give him space.

189
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,700
I understand what you are saying

190
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,460
but his pieces must be executable.

191
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,930
That's because we don't have too much time to experiment.

192
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,490
Everyone is in the process of figuring it out.

193
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:39,160
We shouldn't reject his idea just because of that.

194
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,310
Listen to me. Let's think about it some more.

195
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,270
Come in.

196
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:29,670
Director Xia, there are some issues with the fabric we just got.

197
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:34,270
We asked for a plain weave, but they gave us a twill weave.

198
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,270
How do you do your job?

199
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,990
Must you come and find me for such a trivial thing?

200
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,570
It's not my fault, Director Xia.

201
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,610
The factory made the decision without confirming with us.

202
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,690
No matter what the reason is, you didn't do your job well.

203
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,340
Don't blame it on others.

204
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,800
It was my first time dealing with this manufacturer,

205
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,910
- so...
- So must I give you time and space to adapt as well?

206
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,650
Are you someone President Tang hired as welll?

207
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,590
I...

208
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:02,440
Director Xia, did Designer Cheng Yang say something to upset you?

209
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,990
Get to work.

210
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:14,630
Director Xia, I haven't been here for long,

211
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,760
but I want to share your burden.

212
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,820
How about I join the Women's Department?

213
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,400
- You want to join Cheng Yang?
- No, no, no.

214
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,660
That's not what I meant. I want to join your team.

215
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,370
But the company has its rules.

216
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,750
Assistants can't pick the designers themselves.

217
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,910
I know that, but you can.

218
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,140
So I'm here to ask you to let me into the Women's Clothing Department.

219
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,790
I am really not good at men's clothing.

220
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,880
I'm not the only designer in the Women's Clothing Department. Cheng Yang is one as well.

221
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,740
Also, he just came back from France and is at the peak of popularity.

222
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,350
Why don't you go join his team?

223
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,910
Designer Cheng's work is good,

224
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,870
but your designs are more elegant and practical.

225
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,060
In comparison, I like yours more.

226
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,640
Also, what's the use of being popular? It'll end sooner or later.

227
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,780
You are a true pillar of Mingyuan.

228
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,590
Without you, would Mingyuan still be Mingyuan?

229
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,780
All right, cut the compliments.

230
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:16,990
You can work with me if you want. I can tell Liu Pei tomorrow.

231
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:21,740
But let me make it clear from the beginning. You can't continue to be muddle-headed when working with me.

232
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,290
What happened today with the fabric can't happen again.

233
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,840
I got it. Thank you, Director Xia.

234
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,650
I'll get going now.

235
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,460
Mo Fei.

236
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,110
Mo Fei.

237
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,810
Mo Fei, I want to ask you for a favor.

238
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,890
Why are you so courteous with me? Tell me.

239
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,610
It's the homework André assigned this time.

240
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:35,030
I want you to ask Fang Xiaoyu to look at it for me.

241
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:38,520
I want his advice on my design.

242
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,830
He is Cayman's director and he knows André very well.

243
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:45,510
If he can help, I can definitely pass.

244
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,340
That...

245
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,210
You know that Fang Xiaoyu does whatever he wants.

246
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,490
He easily gets over-enthusiastic when helping others.

247
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:58,370
I'm afraid that I will cause trouble for him again if I ask him.

248
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:01,220
So, sorry.

249
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,670
That's true. I'm the one who didn't think it through.

250
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:08,070
No. How about... How about I take a look at it for you?

251
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,450
I think...

252
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:13,330
- our judgments are not that much worse than his.
- Okay.

253
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,650
I don't understand French.

254
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,860
Is it here? 302.

255
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,170
Hi.

256
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,030
Why is it you?

257
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,570
How did you find me?

258
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,980
That's my personal capability.

259
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,550
My connections are far and wide.

260
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,110
Are you trying to trespass?

261
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:25,180
Yes, I am. So what? Hit me.

262
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,180
If I do, wouldn't I be like you?

263
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,360
I have something very important to talk to you about.

264
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,310
If you don't let me in,

265
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,440
I'm not leaving.

266
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,490
Why do you use this trick every time?

267
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,640
Are you letting me in or not? If not,

268
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,490
I will just sit here.

269
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,320
How long do we have to draw this time?

270
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,350
André is pretty strict about the time requirement.

271
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,820
I don't know either.

272
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,600
Hasn't it been almost two weeks now?

273
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,270
Are your neighbors Chinese? That's great!

274
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:01,760
If you don't let me in, I will go chat with them.

275
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,490
Did you see that? A woman entered Fang Xiaoyu's home just now.

276
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,140
I didn't see it.

277
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,270
Fang Xiaoyu even pulled her inside.

278
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,800
Enough! Stop being nosy. Let's go.

279
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,510
Come on.

280
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,860
Did Fang Xiaoyu give you this?

281
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,180
Probably.

282
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,760
He's such a playboy.

283
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,640
He has unclear relations with other women and then comes to mess with you.

284
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,870
My Lady, open the door. All right?

285
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,810
Enough, enough. Let's go.

286
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,460
This place is not bad.

287
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,410
Is this your home?

288
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,110
Hurry and say what you have to. Then quickly leave.

289
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,710
I think you need to reconsider

290
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,920
the collaboration between Haiyao and Cayman.

291
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,650
Are you done?

292
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:12,030
Even though you are Cayman's director,

293
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,700
you haven't realistically participated in designing for two to three years now.

294
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,620
The show you are hosting this time

295
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,600
has to be grand.

296
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,980
Are you finished?

297
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,750
I will help you.

298
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,540
I will sincerely help you.

299
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:33,900
As long as you agree to collaborate with me.

300
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,970
You will definitely receive fame and fortune.

301
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,810
Are you finished now?

302
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,360
Are you still not satisfied with these offers of mine?

303
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,520
Fang Xiaoyu, I—

304
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,950
I really don't understand you.

305
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,900
What do you really want?

306
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,860
What do I have to offer,

307
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,990
so you will be satisfied?

308
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,860
Bai Xiaoman, did you forget who you are?

309
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,120
Or did you forget who I am?

310
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,130
Collaborate with you?

311
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,500
I can't even get fame and fortune?

312
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:19,130
Are you saying that my Fang family is nothing compared to you?

313
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:23,460
You and that Zhu Haitian are just a perfect match.

314
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,920
- Get out right now.
- I'm not done yet.

315
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,810
If you have any self-respect left,

316
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,840
cooperate...

317
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,040
and get out.

318
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,680
Mo Fei! Mo Fei!

319
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,570
Come here and look. The woman who came to see Fang Xiaoyu is really pretty.

320
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:52,470
Her figure is great and she is even wearing branded clothes.

321
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,920
Is she gone?

322
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,950
She is now.

323
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:58,090
Then I'm going to go return the medications to Fang Xiaoyu.

324
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,930
Oh.

325
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,760
Mo Fei?

326
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,950
What are you doing here?

327
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,970
I was about to ask you. What are you doing here?

328
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:37,060
Me? My friend lives here.

329
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,340
What about you? What's your excuse?

330
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,760
What excuse can I possibly have? I live here.

331
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,330
If you say that I'm your friend, I don't agree to that.

332
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:49,360
I have never viewed you as my friend. Take your purse and leave.

333
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,620
My goodness. What is going on?

334
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,960
Say, Mo Fei, you're quite amazing.

335
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,960
What? Is having only President Tang as your boyfriend not enough for you?

336
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,250
What nonsense are you saying, Bai Xiaoman?

337
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,140
Do you think Mo Fei is like you?

338
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,340
In order to climb higher, you're with someone like Zhu Haitian.

339
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,960
Psycho.

340
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,930
Don't leave.

341
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,430
I live here!

342
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:17,730
Fang Xiaoyu, you don't know her at all. Don't be deceived by her.

343
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,020
Let me tell you, Mo Fei is such an opportunist.

344
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,880
She always uses the men around her, and—

345
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,090
Shut up, Bai Xiaoman.

346
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:29,320
I am warning you. Don't ever let me find out if you cause trouble for Mo Fei.

347
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,470
Take your purse and leave.

348
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,850
Leave!

349
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,260
How's it going?

350
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:20,290
- What are you doing here, President Tang?
- How is it going?

351
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:23,360
The waste from this line of splash ink will be a bit much.

352
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,430
I'm perfecting the design right now and trying my best to save on costs.

353
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,280
You don't need to think about costs at all. You just need to create the best

354
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,420
design you can.

Hello, Duoduo.

Hey, Mingxuan.

Why do you sound so down?

00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,310
I'm not.

362

Are you feeling unwell?

363
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:19,030
You should know there are those few days when a girl's relative (periods) will come.

364
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:22,500
After a night of sleep, I'll be better tomorrow.

365

What can I do to make you happy?

366
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,970
How's this?

367
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:37,150
You usually tell me stories to coax me to sleep every day.

368
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:40,230
How about I tell you a story,

369
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,810
and coax you to sleep today?

370
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,570
You know how to tell stories?

371
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,670
Of course.

372
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,720
Listen to me.

373
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,670
Lay down now.

374
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,290
Okay.

375
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,080
I'm lying down.

376
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,400
Cover yourself with the blanket.

377
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,850
I've been covered this whole time.

378
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,870
Close your eyes.

379
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,150
I'm starting now.

380
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,090
Wait.

381
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,200
I'm ready.

382
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,070
I had a dream when I was a kid.

383
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,260
I dreamed about sitting on a tiny earth.

384
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,580
The earth is so tiny that it only fits me.

385
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,410
The sun is on my left and the moon on my right.

386
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:39,040
It seemed like I was the center of the earth and the king of the universe.

387
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:46,920
Until one day, I met a little girl.

388
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,390
She told me a story about a little prince.

389
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:54,400
That's when I found out

390
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,790
that there is someone else like me in this world.

391
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,000
She was as lonely as me.

392
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,270
But it got better later on. The little prince

393
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:13,660
got his little fox and I

394
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:18,240
found my little girl.

395
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:25,660
♫ My heart, just this one is for you ♫

396

♫ Protect me, hold me in the palm of your hand ♫

00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,430
She fell asleep so quickly.

Good morning.

411
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,910
How have you been? Is the training tough?

412
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:58,380
The training is not tough, but there's something else

413
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,940
that's a bit tough.

414
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,290
What is it? Did the company assign you a bunch of work? Or is it the bar?

415
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:08,340
I told you to stop working at the bar if you are too exhausted.

416
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,390
Neither of those.

417
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,550
What is it then?

418
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,430
This matter...

419
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,740
is all because of you.

420
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,080
Because of me?

421
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,150
Say, I'm so far from you, so how can it be because of me?

422
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:25,820
However, your dear boyfriend is still in Shanghai.

423
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,120
What's with Mingxuan?

424
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,250
Dear sister, let me be frank.

425
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,790
Could you stop your boyfriend from visiting me for no reason?

426
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:37,310
It's so weird for two men to be visiting each other all the time!

427
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:43,070
I thought it was something serious. He is taking care of you for me.

428
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:46,620
I'm begging you, Sis, spare me.

429
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:51,090
All right. Then... I'll talk to him.

430
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:56,270
By the way, Sis, I watched your competition. It was awesome.

431
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:00,770
So what? I didn't win the award.

432
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:03,490
Your attitude is problematic.

433
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:07,630
The award is not important. It's the process that's important.

434
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:11,560
I think you are the best. You did a great job.

435
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:17,550
You are so grown up now, that you are lecturing me.

436
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:22,620
Sis, then... can I show the video to others?

437
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,780
Don't go showing it to people. It's embarrassing.

438
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:30,510
But Lu Zhu is fine. Be a bit modest though.

- Got it.
- Take care of yourself.

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,700
He lives in the left unit on the fourth floor.

488
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,570
Thank you.

489
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:51,980
Hello.

490
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:55,830
A Chinese girl came to find Fang Xiaoyu.

491
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:59,040
Did he break someone's heart again?

492
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,670
Oh, right.

493
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,770
Has he been harassing you lately?

494
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:08,500
Don't worry. I keep a long distance away from him.

495
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,510
Good girl.

496
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,410
Who is it?

497
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:57,650
You are suffocating me.

498
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,860
Don't let go.

499
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,780
Come in.

500
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:52,780
Mo Fei, what are you doing?

501
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:56,090
I saw Fang Xiaoyu hugging a pretty girl.

502
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,700
Really?

503
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,890
I need to see.

504
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,330
Hey.

505
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,890
Don't look.

506
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,780
Our homework deadline is approaching.

507
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:15,600
If you can't turn in your assignment, be careful, André might give you trouble.

508
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:20,000
- Right. Okay.
- Let's go.

509
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,540
Xueling just introduced our design proposal.

510
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:26,350
The press conference this time is very important

511
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,120
to our Mingyuan.

512
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,110
That's because it will be our new face

513
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,760
towards the world.

514
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,910
Will SLC's Miya come?

515
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:37,640
Yes. They are very interested in our

516
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,420
embroidery shop and intangible cultural heritage.

517
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,800
That's good news.

518
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,890
It looks like the professionals in our industry all know about our embroidery shop and public welfare.

519
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:52,080
It also means that they are really considering the acquisition.

520
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,520
- Right, Old Xia?
- What?

521
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,320
So many people of the same industry are coming,

522
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,180
we can't embarrass ourselves.

523
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:05,570
Xueling, the Design Department

524
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:08,080
- needs to get ahead.
- I will.

525
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,190
Do a good job.

526
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,880
I also want to tell everyone

527
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,520
that we will be including a very outstanding designer.

528
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,320
His name is Cheng Yang.

529
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,880
This time, he will work with Xueling for this press conference.

530
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:30,020
Mingxuan, w-what does that mean?

531
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:33,120
Why would a n-new person

532
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,170
be working with her?

533
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:37,650
- Explain more clearly.
- Uncle Xia, don't misunderstand.

534
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:41,820
Cheng Yang is only in charge of Songtang.

535
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,400
Direcor Xia is still in charge of the overall operation.

536
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,200
Everyone probably doesn't know much about Cheng Yang.

537
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,770
He is the designer I brought back from France.

538
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:56,860
He just won the LVMH award.

539
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,020
He's very outstanding.

540
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,850
I hope you all can support him.

541
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:06,500
I heard about Cheng Yang. I think it's a good thing

542
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,450
that we can have some young people working in Songtang.

543
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:13,550
Gain some experience and then he can take the lead later on.

544
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:19,260
Xueling, with regards to the personnel arrangement that the president has suggested,

545
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:22,940
- does the Design Department have any objections?
- None.

546
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:26,480
Old Xia, are there any more comments?

547
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,870
Since the chairman has decided,

548
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,390
I have no objections.

549
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:34,700
Good. That's it for today then.

550
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:40,310
Tell me. Tell me what exactly that father and son of the Tang family are trying to do.

551
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:45,580
It's not the first time they're trying to sustain Songtang.

552
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,770
What's so strange about this?

553
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:52,130
I never had problems with them trying to sustain Songtang, right?

554
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,160
But I feel injustice on your behalf.

555
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,140
Say, how much effort have you spent on Songtang?

556
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,180
Why is there a new designer all of a sudden?

557
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:02,350
He is clearly trying to replace you, don't you understand?

558
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:04,110
Dad, you've misunderstood.

559
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,090
Having Cheng Yang be in charge of Songtang's design

560
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:09,720
is something Mingxuan told me in advance and I agreed with.

561
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,140
You agreed to it?

562
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:14,550
What were you thinking, my child?

563
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:19,260
You should've at least discussed such an important matter

564
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,240
with me.

565
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:25,850
I just think that Songtang's designs

566
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:28,350
have always been a lot for me to be in charge of.

567
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:31,890
Isn't it better now I have less work?

568
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,550
Silly girl. Have you thought about it?

569
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:38,660
If this is the case, everything you've done for Songtang

570
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:42,130
and the painstaking effort you've put in

571
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:45,780
are all accredited to that new designer now!

572
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,840
How is it as serious as you put it?

573
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,910
- It won't happen.
- How will it not happen?!

574
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:53,240
Have you forgotten when you took your suitcase and left for a few days?

575
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,650
Those two father and son took it to heart.

576
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:58,700
They are doing this to tell you

577
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,250
and me

578
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:04,560
that Songtang can continue without you!

579
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,860
It's really not like how you put it.

580
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,750
All right, let's not talk about it. Have some water.

581
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:12,310
Isn't this obviously revenge?

582
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,090
So petty.

583
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:17,720
All right.

584
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,910
I will not talk about it anymore.

585
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:23,030
My dear,

586
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:26,570
forget everything I said today.

587
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:29,500
All right. Don't worry about it.

588
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,930
I will take care of

589
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:34,920
the rest.

590
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:50,930
♫ I say you're an April day ♫

591
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:55,080
♫ The sound of your laughter lights everything up ♫
