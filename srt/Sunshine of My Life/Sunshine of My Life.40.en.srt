00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:41,090
Remember, when you get there and feel unwell in any way,

4
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,000
call your doctor. Okay?

5
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,570
Your eyes have just recovered, so don't spend so much time playing games or watching dramas.

6
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,920
Also, don't stay up late to study. Right?

7
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,480
Dad, you have already said these things 8,000 times.

8
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,680
I have memorized them.

9
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,020
That's right, Weiguo.

10
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,110
Qian Qian is all grown up. She can take care of herself.

11
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,880
I only have this one precious daughter.

12
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,000
Of course, I have to keep reminding her so I don't worry.

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,510
Dad, just don't worry. I also have my older brother looking after me.

14

Xiaoyu.

15
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,630
I know. I will take good care of her. Don't worry.

16
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,140
Okay.

17
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,150
Auntie Zhuang, we will leave our dad in your care when we're gone.

18
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,900
He has health problems and a bad temper.

19
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,010
We will trouble you to tolerate him.

20
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,860
Don't worry, Qian Qian.

21
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,260
I will take good care of your dad.

22
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,610
Get in the car. If you don't leave soon, you will be stuck in traffic.

23
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,620
It's time to go. We are running late.

24
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,560
- That's right.
- Dad.

25
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,160
All right, all right. Go on.

26
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,130
Bye-bye, Auntie Zhuang.

27
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:36,110
I really want to wear this outfit to a party.

28
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,250
Dongdong.

29
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,830
You just gave this outfit the highest compliment.

30
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,270
I have not seen such satisfactory work in a long time.

31
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,380
Give it a name.

32
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,490
This outfit gives you the feeling you only get on top of a mountain,

33
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:57,060
where you cannot tell how deep the clouds are.

34
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,880
With the addition of the nine-colored deer pattern, how about...

35
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,490
we name it "Clouded Ink"?

36
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,670
What do you think?

37
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,400
Let's call it "Clouded Ink".

38
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,630
It's been a long time since we have walked like this on the streets.

39
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,230
It feels quite nice.

40
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,100
Yes, because we have been too busy fighting.

41
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,360
Don't say "I'm sorry" because I don't want to respond with "It's okay."

42
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,650
What's the matter?

43
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,590
I haven't ridden a bike in a long time now.

44
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,070
- Do you want to ride one?
- Yes

45

67
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,120
I received a call from Meng Jing.

68
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,120
She said the school break in France is almost over.

69
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,780
I know. There's only one week left, right?

70
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:01,490
I've been counting the days.

71
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,120
Don't be like this. I'm just going there

72
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,500
to study. I'll be back very soon.

73
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,220
You still have one whole semester left.

74
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,160
One semester passes by very quickly.

75
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,440
Besides, I can come back to see you when I'm on break.

76
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,350
You can also fly there to see me.

77

Paris is very near.

78
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,520
Besides, communication is so convenient nowadays. You can send me

79
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,530
WeChat messages and make video calls.

80
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:25,890
I promise I'll be there whenever you need me, okay?

81
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,790
I just can't bear for you to leave.

82

I can't bear leaving you as well.

Hurry and eat. Weren't you hungry?

84

It's fine.

What do you think? Does the food suit your taste?

89

It's quite delicious. Is this place new?

It's been around for a while.

91

But they only serve regulars.

Of course, I have to be prepared for future dates and stuff.

94
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,230
Does that mean you've found a girlfriend?

95
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,060
I guess so.

96
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,170
It's just that, I don't know if she'll agree or not.

97
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,360
- Then ask her.
- What?

98
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,220
Ask her directly?

99
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,750
Of course. The more straightforward, the better.

100
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,270
Then, will you be my girlfriend?

101
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,260
Yes, just like that.

I'm not kidding. I'm serious, Xueling.

Ever since I met you again after coming back,

106
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,280
I realize that my feelings for you have never faded.

107
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,700
Before, I wasn't confident so I didn't dare express them.

108
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,320
But this time, I don't want to miss the opportunity again.

109
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,360
I hope that you give me a chance to stay by your side,

110
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,710
and to take care of you. Will you?

111
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,020
Yan Xu, I can't say yes.

112
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,400
Because there's always been someone in my heart.

113
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:35,080
Even though I'm not sure if he and I will end up together,

114
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,210
he's been the only one in my heart since I was young.

115

I'm sorry.

116

You're not together yet, right?

118
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,330
Then I still stand a chance.

119
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,870
Right now, I just want to stay beside you,

120
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,820
take care of you, and protect you.

I'll wish you two happiness.

But that's not fair to you.

124
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:10,950
Because I'm not sure if I can let go of him completely or not.

125
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,660
I also don't know how much time it will take to do that.

Yes, he knows.

There's not much to do for me.

There's no work for you to turn in either.

It's just that, you came back and helped me so much.

We can forget about a send-off party. That's too high profile.

We all have been occupied with the product launch lately, and never had the time for a gathering.

All right, let's do as you said. Thank you.

 [yet you still want me to send-you off.]

162
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,840
You can't be casual.

163
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,850
Fashion design is a form of art.

164
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,460
Dongdong, I'll toast to you.

165
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,330
- I'll toast to you with tripe.
- I don't want that.

166
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,370
Take it easy.

167
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,870
This isn't cooked yet, bro.

168
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,140
It's cooked. I guarantee it's cooked.
[Mo Fei: Cheng Yang thinks, the more, the merrier.]

169
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,120
It's definitely cooked. How could it be uncooked after 20 minutes? Should I feed you?

170
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,530
Thank you. With those hands of yours, I'll pass.

171
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:55,220
- A toast to you.
- Hey.

172
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,960
Everyone, listen to me.

173
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,750
- I think I'm too loud. I'll lower my voice.
- No, no.

174
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:07,570
Today, since President Tang is with us, which is rare,

175
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:11,220
let's all make a toast to President Tang.

176
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,720
A toast to President Tang.

177
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,860
Mo Fei is the one leaving. You should make a toast to her.

178
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,110
- A toast to Mo Fei.
- Come on, a toast to Mo Fei.

179
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,800
President Tang, join us.

180
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,660
- All right.
- Thank you, President Tang.

181
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,880
Thank you, everyone.

182
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,060
So, Mo Fei, shouldn't you say a few words

183
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,360
to President Tang on behalf of all of us?

184
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:52,110
Thank you, President Tang, for coming to my send-off party.

185
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,630
No!

186
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,800
That's too simple. Who wants to hear that?

187
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,880
Exactly. You are leaving the country. Say something touching.

188
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,360
At least express your sentiments about parting.

189
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,690
This isn't really a parting. Since the internet is so developed,

190
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,490
we can see each other at any time. Right?

191
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,770
Right?

192
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,130
So you'll come to see me often, right?

193
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,660
- I will.
- Pinkie promise.

194
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,780
We're such third wheels here.

195
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,830
Cheers.

196
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,020
- Cheers. Thank you, everyone.
- Cheers.

197
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,680
- Cheers.
- Let's wish Mo Fei a safe trip.

198
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,120
- Thank you.
- You got this.

199
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,910
Today's sales in all the stores

200
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,920
are more than double the usual amount. What do you think?

201
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,300
Can we keep up with the replenishment of stocks?

202
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,200
No problem. We've already arranged in advance. Speed isn't a problem.

203
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,350
You don't need to do it too quickly. After all, what's scarce is precious.

204
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,270
Please thank everyone for their hard work for me.

205
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,850
We all worked hard. You did too.

206
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:13,440
When you are working, you look quite formidable and cool.

207
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,310
I'm sorry, I forgot.

208
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:19,370
Well, you two chat. I'll get going. Bye-bye.

209
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,800
It's fine. Waiting for a short time

210
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,880
will only make me more excited to see you.

211
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,540
You must have waited for a long time. How about this? Dinner is on me.

212
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,080
It's already very late.

213
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,980
The restaurant reservation has been canceled.

214
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,640
Then, what shall we do?

215
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,260
Originally, I was going to treat you to a fancy meal.

216
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,070
But we ended up eating so simply. I hope you don't mind.

217
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,310
I'm the one who should be apologizing.

218
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,000
I was so busy that I lost track of the time.

219
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,640
It's fine.

220
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:04,660
Yan Xu, do you have a plan for the future?

221
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:13,120
My biggest wish is that when I grow old,

222
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,600
I can be with my beloved one

223
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,690
and be far away from the bustling city,

224
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:21,160
spending the rest of our lives by the sea.

225
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:27,130
Leaving everything behind, and going back to the basics

226
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:30,240
is indeed a life that one would look forward to.

227
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,950
Xueling, are you willing to do that with me?

228
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,350
I haven't made up my mind about the future yet.

229
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,280
That's fine.

230
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:54,850
We still have time to waste.

231
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:58,140
Besides, you being able to be with me here today,

232
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,070
I feel like half of my wish has already come true.

233
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,800
If we really lived by the ocean,

234
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,400
aside from the moonlight, there should be a sky filled with stars. Right?

235
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,900
It's such a shame, that we live in the city.

236
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,600
The lights are too bright. You can't see anything.

237
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,660
Leave it to me.

238
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,830
When did you prepare that?

239
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,300
We played with these together when we were at school, do you remember?

240
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,600
It's really been so long since I've played with these.

241
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,600
Stars.

242
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,200
Based on this,

243
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,000
the company's stock prices are steadily rising again.

244
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,800
And a lot of large orders are coming in.

245
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,600
Institutions are probably optimistic about our Mingyuan Group.

246
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,000
Stock markets are all about people buying and selling, right?

247
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,200
Buying Mingyuan's stocks can earn money.

248
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,800
That's right.

249
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,800
After our show,

250
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,400
the feedback from malls and online platforms are both good.

251
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,800
Dad, you can stop worrying. Have a good time.

252
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,400
Exactly.

253
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,600
You're worried when the prices go up and you're worried when the prices don't.

254
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,000
You'll get sick this way.

255
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Okay, all right. I'll stop looking at it.

256
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,600
Old Xia and I are meeting for golf today.

257
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,200
Do you have time? Let's go together.

258
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,200
I won't join you, Dad. There is a lot to do at the company today.

259
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
All right.

260
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,400
You must maintain a good relationship with Uncle Xia.

261
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,100
Speaking of, Xueling hasn't been here for a meal in a long time now.

262
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,400
What?

263
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,400
Did you choke?

264
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,800
The child already said he's busy with work and doesn't have time.

265
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,800
Let him handle his own affairs. Stop worrying for him.

266
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,400
I'm his mom. Can I not worry?

267
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,400
In this world, is there a mom who doesn't worry about her child's marriage?

268
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,000
Should I be like you, and not care, ask, nor listen?

269
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,300
He said he has a girlfriend already.

270
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,000
- Did I acknowledge her?
- Mom.

271
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,800
Do you want me to marry two women?

272
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,400
Right. Do you agree to that?

273
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,800
You two.

274
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,000
Do you dare?

275
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,600
Enjoy your meal. I'm going to work.

276
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,800
You haven't finished your bun yet.

277
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,800
I won't eat that, Dad. I'm full.

278
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,200
Bye-bye, Mom.

279
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,600
You little brat.

280
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,900
He only ate half of his breakfast. It's all because of you.

281
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,930
What do you mean?

282
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,500
Bring me my medicine.

283
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,770
President Fang.

284
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,000
Are you feeling unwell, President Fang?

285
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,090
No.

286
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,930
I'm just a little dizzy.

287
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,300
What is it?

288
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,500
I've been working on buying the stocks per your instructions.

289
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,600
- How much were you able to buy?
- Almost three percent.

290
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,400
Three percent.

291
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,200
All right, I got it.

292
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,200
Continue buying.

293
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,800
Okay.

294
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,850
Don't be too obvious.

295
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,300
I understand.

296
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,200
What? We only sold five items today?

297
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,400
In addition, 57 were returned or exchanged.

298
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:56,200
There are also comments saying that our clothing's quality is not as good as Mingyuan's.

299
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,400
That's such bullshit.

300
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,230
Do they have mouths to just eat?

301
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:02,800
When it's time to speak, why are they keeping their mouth shut?

302
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,800
They can't even handle sales returns and exchanges. What's the use of keeping them?

303
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,800
They are good-for-nothings!

304
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,800
Haitian.

305
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,900
Liu Rui, you may leave first.

306
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,800
Haitian, why are you here?

307
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,600
Aren't you busy with the game?

308
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,000
It's a good thing I came.

309
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,400
If I hadn't come, I wouldn't have known what was happening to the company.

310
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,400
Why have the company's sales fallen so drastically?

311
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,300
As the general manager, explain it to me.

312
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,600
Haitian, don't be angry first.

313
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,600
I don't want this to happen either.

314
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,800
Mingyuan's new products have had a big impact on us.

315
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:56,600
So it's normal that our sales declined. After all, they just launched their new products.

316
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,400
Don't panic yet.

317
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,000
Don't panic? How do I not panic?

318
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,300
That's not the problem at all.

319
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Six out of ten things sold have issues.

320
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,500
Why? Why would that happen?

321
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
Let me ask you another thing.

322
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,000
Regarding the money, we invested to produce this batch of clothing,

323
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,400
where did it go? What did you use it for?

324
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,200
What else can I use it for? You've seen the contracts.

325
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:31,100
I used all the money on Haitian Color.

326
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,000
If there's a problem with the quality,

327
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,400
it must be the purchasing department's fault.

328
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,400
What a load of nonsense!

329
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,630
That's impossible.

330
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:43,000
Old Chen in the purchasing department has been with us for so many years.

331
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,600
He's an old employee! I completely trust him!

332
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:51,400
Don't throw others under the bus when a problem occurs.

333
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,600
Haitian, are you suspecting me?

334
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,600
I've put sweat and blood into Haiyao as well.

335
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,300
For such a long time, what haven't I done for

336
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,600
your and Haiyao's sake?

337
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,400
Bai Xiaoman, there better not be a problem with your doings.

338
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,600
Is there anything happening with Haiyao recently?

339
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,150
I heard that because of their clothing quality,

340
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,600
they have been busy and hard-pressed.

341
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,600
This is the best opportunity for us.

342
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,800
What do you mean by that?

343
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,400
It's time to settle matters with them.

344
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,400
Come in.

345
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:57,000
Brother Xuan, this is the draft from the lawyers you asked me to contact. It's ready.

346
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,040
I'll get back to work now.

347
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,000
Xueling, take a look.

348
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,400
[Yan Xu]

349
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,400
If you need to go do something, go ahead.

350
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,790
It's nothing important.

351
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:38,200
Aside from work, your personal life is very important, too.

352
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,800
Go.

353
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,600
Uncle Fang, you have already acquired five percent of Mingyuan's stocks.

354
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,800
You're already considered one of our shareholders.

355
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:10,200
I am very interested to know why you want to acquire our stocks.

356
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:15,210
I'm a businessman.

357
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,800
Before doing anything, I evaluate things from the perspective of profits.

358
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,900
After evaluation of pros and cons,

359
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,600
do I need to send you a message via WeChat?

360
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,000
To be honest...

361
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,000
Well, in the past,

362
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,700
Mingyuan experienced lots of crises.

363
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:44,030
However, it has

364
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:47,110
remained invincible in the industry.

365
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,600
That proves it has value as a brand.

366
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:57,200
The value of a brand is infinite.

367
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,600
And I'm the type who likes to collect things of value.

368
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:05,200
So, my next plan is to acquire Mingyuan.

369
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,000
Acquire Mingyuan?

370
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,500
It won't be that easy.

371
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,200
In the past, I've always thought

372
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,400
that if the Tang and Xia families became in-laws, the combined stocks

373
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,000
might be more than one-third.

374
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,600
It would be impossible for me to acquire it. But with the current situation,

375
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,800
Mingyuan's stocks are being dispersed all over the place out there.

376
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,800
In addition, the Tang and Xia families

377
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
wouldn't possibly stand on the same side to go against me. Right?

378
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,400
So, it's very possible for me to become Mingyuan's biggest shareholder.

379
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:51,200
Uncle Fang, how are you so sure that the Xia family wouldn't do that?

380
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,600
The rumors should be true, right?

381
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,100
Perhaps they are fake.

382
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,600
It should be true.

383
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,400
As the one managing Mingyuan,

384
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,300
our Tang family will not give up on Mingyuan.

385
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:14,190
I like your confidence.

386
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,400
But remember this, confidence

387
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,600
doesn't represent actual capability.

388
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,400
- Thank you for the lesson.
- All right.

389
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,000
What are we going to do?

390
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,410
Mingyuan didn't take any actions against us before

391
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:40,800
because of their product launch.

392
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,000
The point is they have evidence of us stealing the designs.

393
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,600
It's over. We are doomed now.

394
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,800
Stop pacing back and forth in front of me. It's making me dizzy! How do I come up with a way out of this like that?

395
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,200
Bai Xiaoman!

396
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,600
Haitian.

397
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,810
I was so blind

398
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:58,800
to have you help me manage the company.

399
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,000
You really are unable to accomplish anything, but good at making everything worse.

400
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,600
Since you started managing the company,

401
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,400
how many lousy ideas have you come up with?

402
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,600
Don't you know your own capability?

403
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,200
You insist on competing with Mingyuan.

404
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,000
Take a look at yourself in the mirror!

405
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,800
Are you qualified? You stop right there!

406
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,500
Shen Jiaxi, you're also a good-for-nothing. I will talk to you in a bit.

407
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:30,290
The issues with return and exchange,

408
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:33,930
you begged me to give you time to handle it. Fine, I gave you time. Did you resolve it?

409
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,970
You resolved nothing!

410
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,890
Now Mingyuan, Tang Mingxuan,

411
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:42,460
is suing Haiyao.

412
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,320
Is this the result of your resolution?

413
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,890
Why did you screw Haiyao? Why did you screw me?

414
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,630
Haitian, I-I never did anything to betray you.

415
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,320
Since the day we became a couple...

416
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,270
I've focused all my attention on you and the company.

417
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,900
You can't treat me this way.

418
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,810
Are you still putting on an act?

419
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:05,040
You're still putting on an act!

420
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:08,210
Let me ask you one thing.

421
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:10,150
Why did you hide the fact

422
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:12,240
that you stole the designs from Mingyuan?

423
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,330
Who made you so bold? Who?

424
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,560
Stole? What do you mean stole the designs?

425
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,610
Jiaxi, how could you steal the designs?

426
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,240
I really didn't know you stole them.

427
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,460
I bought them from her!

428
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:30,000
- Jiaxi, you shouldn't have done something like that.
- Bai Xiaoman!

429
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,570
- What are you saying? You clearly—
- Jiaxi.

430
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:35,980
I know you hate Mo Fei. I also know you hate that you couldn't showcase your talent at Mingyuan.

431
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,300
But how could you steal the designs?

432
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,840
As a friend, I've always wanted to protect you. But this time, I can't do it anymore.

433
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,380
Look at Haitian. If I don't explain things clearly, he won't forgive me.

434
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,620
Bai Xiaoman! Can you act like a human being for once?

435
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,240
You were the one who told me to steal the designs!

436
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,290
Enough with the both of you!

437
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,880
Are you still putting on an act here?

438
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,640
Singing a duet?

439
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,390
Bai Xiaoman,

440
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:08,520
I see your true colors clearly now.

441
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:13,260
If this matter gets resolved, fine.

442
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,610
If it can't be resolved,

443
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,340
you both just wait.

444
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,550
You two won't get out of this.

445
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:32,380
Bai Xiaoman, I was so blind.

446
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,790
I actually believed what you said.

447
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,730
I don't know if you're blind or not.

448
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:40,630
However, whether it's in front of Zhu Haitian or the judge, that is what I will say.

449
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,780
If I were you, I would have run away long ago.

450
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,720
Will I still be here speaking nonsense and waiting for the police to come and arrest me?

451
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,610
- Xueling.
- Mom.

452
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,960
Did you just get home? Did you eat yet?

453
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,720
I ate at my friend's place.

454
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,330
A friend's place?

455
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:12,590
You usually never eat at other people's places.

456
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:15,410
It is a classmate from college.

457
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:16,850
We haven't been in touch for a long time.

458
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:20,690
I bumped into the person when they came back to the country to hold an art exhibit.

459
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:22,960
Is your classmate a girl or a boy?

460
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,250
Mom, what do you mean?

461
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:28,360
Nothing. I'm just asking.

462
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,400
It seems like your dad wants to see you.

463
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,560
Tonight, he asked why you haven't come back yet.

464
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,720
He's waiting for you downstairs. Go quickly.

465
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,620
- All right. I'll go see him.
- Okay.

466
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,840
- Dad, you wanted to see me?
- Yes.

467
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:53,730
What do you think about Fang Weiguo's acquisition of Mingyuan stocks this time?

468
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,410
What do you mean?

469
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,010
I think that Uncle Fang is a bit out of line.

470
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:04,920
Although we say business is business,

471
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,260
what he's doing now is taking advantage of the situation.

472
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:11,020
I don't like this kind of competition.

473
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:14,020
Then, are you supporting the Tang family?

474
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,900
Of course, what else?

475
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,680
I just wanted to know your opinion.

476
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,650
Dad, I don't understand what you mean.

477
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:27,690
If we don't support our own people now, what will happen to Mingyuan?

478
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:32,820
Child, that's the reason why I wanted to talk to you today.

479
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:36,910
Actually, regardless of who manages Mingyuan,

480
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:41,530
it won't affect our family. It might even be a good thing.

481
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:45,810
Dad, are you having other intentions?

482
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:49,380
If you act this way too, what will Mingxuan do?

483
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,490
It seems like, compared to Mingyuan's future,

484
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:54,990
you care more about that brat.

485
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,900
Let me tell you.

486
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,460
No matter who manages the company,

487
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,980
we'll either be the second or third-largest shareholder.

488
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:12,230
When the time comes, they'll be competing to collaborate with us.

489
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:24,020
[Yan Xu]

490
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,210
Hello.

491
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,480
I'm home already. Don't worry.

492
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,760
I have some things to do so I'll call you back later.

493
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:39,850
Is it Mingxuan?

494
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,640
No, it's not.

495
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,760
Then, who is it?

496
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,200
Don't ask.

497
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:53,340
Okay, okay, all right. I won't ask. What is your relationship with Mingxuan now?

498
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,380
- What are you referring to?
- You know what I'm referring to.

499
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,510
I don't know.

500
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,040
Outside of work.

501
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,610
There's nothing.

502
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,380
Not even a bit?

503
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:16,510
Perhaps we are not fated for that.

504
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:22,460
Fate or no fate.

505
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,600
In my opinion,

506
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:27,490
human effort is the decisive factor, understand?

507
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:44,260
Child, in life,

508
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,160
you will be faced with a lot of choices.

509
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,110
Some choices aren't important.

510
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:53,110
But there are some choices that will determine the direction of your life, understand?

511
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:55,200
- Like...
- That's enough, Dad.
- Let me finish.

512
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,800
Sit down.

513
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:02,470
Now is a very dangerous time.

514
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:06,310
But I think this is also a time for opportunities.

515
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,440
You must know, there is only one thing I'm concerned about for the second half of my life.

516
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,800
- I hope you will be happy. Don't yawn and listen to me.
- Go ahead.

517
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,220
So Fang Weiguo's appearance

518
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,070
isn't a bad thing.

519
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:22,400
At this time, you need to take initiative.

520
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,130
When the time comes, regardless of the position you have in Mingyuan

521
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:29,400
or your relationship with Mingxuan, you'll be able to control them. Understand?

522
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:38,560
Hello, the number you've dialed is turned off. Sorry...

523
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,440
You're back.

524
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:54,160
I'm talking to you. I've been trying to find you all night. Where did you go? You wouldn't answer your phone.

525
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:59,110
- How is that your business?
- I'm just concerned for you.

526
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,820
Concerned for me?

527
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:04,210
Concerned about whether I'm alive or dead?

528
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,850
Zhu Haitian won't die.

529
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:10,710
Haiyao won't die either.

530
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:13,170
- I'm going to sleep now. Move.
- Wait.

531
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:15,760
Didn't we already clear it up at the company?

532
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,180
Don't worry, I will handle it with Shen Jiaxi.

533
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,230
Don't worry about it.

534
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,040
You'll handle it?

535
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,880
What can you possibly handle?

536
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,920
- Are you done?
- No!

537
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,280
This matter won't get resolved!

538
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,980
Move away!

539
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,010
Bai Xiaoman, you better remember this.

540
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:52,490
Don't ever forget your own status and position.

541
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:57,100
Before you met me, you were nothing.

542
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,840
I'm sorry about yesterday.

543
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:53,540
Where are you going?

544
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,270
I'm going to see Tang Mingxuan.

545
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,010
Why?

546
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:06,360
From now on, where I go

547
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,290
and who I see

548
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:10,220
are none of your business.

549
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:21,600
