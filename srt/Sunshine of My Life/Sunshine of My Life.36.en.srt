[Episode 36]

3
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,410
What is it? Why the long face?

4
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,870
You're not eating the sandwich you heated.

5
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,400
Let me ask you. When Duoduo has a fight with you,

6
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,690
how does she punish you?

7
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,240
I can't tell you that.

8
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,360
Why not?

9
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,440
Why would I embarrass myself?

10
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,740
Are you thinking of a way to punish your President Tang?

11
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,980
You know too much.

12
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,430
Did President Tang have a fight with you?

13
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,470
Why are you so nosy as well?

14
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,210
It's written on your face, okay?

15
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,910
W-What's written on my face?

16
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,350
My boyfriend and I are fighting.

17
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,830
Also, he is not coaxing me.

18
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,830
I'm just... too lazy to give him my attention.

19
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,580
Let me tell you. When it comes to men,

20
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,240
don't pay any attention to them.

21
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,410
The more attention you give them, the worse they get. Wait for them to figure it out and come to find you.

22
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,730
Otherwise, they'll keep going against you.

23
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,830
Can't pay any attention to him... Can't pay any attention to him...

24
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,940
Talking about me?

25
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,140
That... Well...

26
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,930
President Tang, I still have work to do. You two talk.

27
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,830
Have a good chat.

28
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,910
Hello?

29
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,490
Hi, Sister Mo Fei.

30
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:08,640
Fang Qian just called me. She said she wants to see you.

31
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,820
I happen to want to talk to her as well.

32
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,540
She said she'll wait for you at her house. I will send you the address then.

33
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,700
Okay. Tell her that I will see her after work.

34
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,160
Bye.

35
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,620
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,770
That day, I was at fault.

37
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:57,360
Everyone became unhappy that day because of me.

38
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,710
What does it have to do with you?

39
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,020
I knew it was your birthday, yet I left just like that.

40
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,290
I ruined the good atmosphere.

41
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,540
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,990
Mo Fei, it wasn't your fault.

43
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,400
You didn't know.

44
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,370
If it were me,

45
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,740
I don't know how big of a scene I would have caused.

46
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:23,180
So, are you guys fighting?

47
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,810
I wouldn't call it a fight.

48
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:35,730
It's just that we deal with things differently.

49
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,660
Don't be mad at Brother Mingxuan.

50
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,260
I don't want your relationship to become unpleasant because of me.

51
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,430
Qian Qian, it has nothing to do with you.

52
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:53,870
Mo Fei, actually, I am quite envious of you two.

53
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,570
Envious of what?

54
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,200
I'm envious of the fact that you two can fight.

55
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,930
Fighting means you care about each other a lot.

56
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,700
Also, fighting can help a relationship.

57
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,450
The more you guys fight, the more inseparable you are.

58
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,300
All right, let's not talk about us.

59
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:17,050
Let's talk about you. As for the surgery, you're...

60
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,010
I've already made my decision.

61
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,720
Since I've decided, I won't change my mind.

62
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,390
You're amazing.

63
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,890
By the way, Mo Fei,

64
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:31,690
may I be a little selfish?

65
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,720
What is it? Tell me.

66
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,970
Can you come on the day of the surgery?

67
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,630
With you there, I will feel more at ease.

68
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,460
Of course, I can! Don't worry, I will be by your side the whole time.

69
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,230
Great!

70
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:50,560
Mo Fei, do you like going to amusement parks?

71
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,310
I do, but I've only been when I was very young and my mom took me.

72
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,970
What about it?

73
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,060
If...

74
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,980
If my surgery is successful,

75
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,040
let's go to the amusement park together. What do you say?

76
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,280
Of course, we can. There's no if.

77
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,720
You have to believe that the surgery will surely be a success.

78
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,420
You will surely be healthy.

79
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,290
That's great. When the time comes, let's invite my brother

80
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,860
and Brother Mingxuan. We can all go together.

81
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,200
The more the merrier.

82
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:28,570
Are you afraid that it will be awkward for them?

83
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,040
Mo Fei, don't worry. As long as I recover,

84
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,040
their relationship will surely become better.

85
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,930
You may not know

86
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:45,590
but my brother and Brother Mingxuan were especially close when we were young.

87
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,490
They were closer than biological brothers.

88
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:52,810
However, in regards to what happened between me and Brother Mingxuan,

89
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,470
my brother minded a lot.

90
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:58,490
Later on, I got sick.

91
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:03,590
So, my brother and Brother Mingxuan's relationship became so hostile.

92
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:09,780
Besides, my brother hasn't designed anything these past three years.

93
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,960
To him, it has been a disaster.

94
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,660
I think it has been painful for him, too.

95
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,670
Okay. Once you are recovered, let's all go to the amusement park together.

96
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,860
All right. It's a deal then.

97
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,470
Qian Qian. Qian Qian.

98
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,990
Brother.

99
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,610
Mo Fei is here, too.

100
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,890
Brother, you are back.

101
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,020
Then I'll get going first. I have plans with someone.

102
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:44,010
Mo Fei, the auntie already made dinner. Eat before you leave.

103
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,490
No, it's all right.

104
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,040
I'll eat with you the next time I come, all right?

105
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,990
You need to take care of yourself.

106
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,600
Brother, take Mo Fei home.

107
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,220
It's fine. I can go home myself.

108
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,750
I've already called a taxi. Don't worry. I will call you when I get home.

109
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,090
- Bye.
- Bye.

110
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,540
- Teacher Cheng.
- You are here.

111
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,480
Is the new design ready?

112
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,950
- President Tang is asking for it.
- It's done.

113
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,280
I forgot to take it over there. I was so busy, I forgot.

114
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,860
Who isn't? I've been so busy lately, I can't even breathe.

115
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,460
President Tang even more so.

116
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,550
He has been sleeping here at the company these days.

117
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,620
Furthermore, he's just napping for about two hours.

118
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,600
I feel like he's going to become immortal soon.
 (T/N: Immortals do not need sleep)

119
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,710
How is it all right for him to exhaust his body like that?

120
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,300
President Tang isn't made of steel.

121
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,270
Well, what can we do? The press conference is soon, right?

122
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,240
All right, that's all. I still have a bunch of things to take care of.

123
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,700
All right, go on. Tell President Tang to take care of himself.

124
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,320
Got it. I thank you on his behalf.

125
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,260
You're welcome.

126
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,700
Everyone, let's work hard. We will work overtime today

127
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,990
to finish the last of the work left.

128
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,120
Okay.

129
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,320
I will buy dinner tonight.

130
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,180
All right.

131
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,530
What'd you like for dinner?

132
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,660
I don't think I will go.

133
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,290
Why not?

134
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,690
Did you make plans with your...

135
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,520
All right then. I won't be the third wheel.

136
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,540
Thank you though.

137
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,590
Brother Xuan, this is the newest modified design for Symphony of Clouds and Mists.

138
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,460
- I will get back to work.
- Okay.

139
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,350
Xueling.

140
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,630
Mingxuan, Cayman's contract still hasn't been sent to us.

141
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,630
It's getting closer and closer to the day of the big show.

142
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,090
I worry...

143
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,840
Let's do this. Where are you?

144
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,010
I'm downstairs in the cafe talking with a client.

145
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,190
It just ended. I can go see you.

146
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,130
I happen to have something to talk to you about. Wait for me.

147
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,630
Okay.

148
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,490
Xueling.

149
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,500
In regards to the contract with Cayman,

150
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,540
I will need to trouble you.

151
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:37,160
Even though their models have already tried on the clothes and their attitudes are not bad,

152
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,100
I still don't feel at ease.

153
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,460
So you hope I will personally take care of it, right?

154
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,850
You are always so smart.

155
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:50,980
We grew up together. I know you.

156
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,300
Don't worry about this matter. I will go see Fang Xiaoyu soon.

157
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,620
Thanks.

158
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,200
How are you going to thank me?

159
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,740
I'll treat you to dinner.

160
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,620
I have a meeting tonight. We can eat somewhere close, what do you think?

161
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,110
Okay.

162
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:10,770
Hello.

163
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,090
Hello. Two orders of fried crayfish dumplings

164
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,270
and a bowl of beef soup.

165
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,850
How many people are dining? I'll prepare utensils for you.

166
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,780
Two. Thanks.

167
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,120
For today, the second order of beef soup is half off. Do you want to order another one?

168
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,830
No. One bowl is enough.

169
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,450
Hello. Your takeout order is ready.

170
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,780
Miss, your takeout order is ready.

171
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,060
The thing I just handed to you...

172
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,720
Okay, I'll go work on it immediately.

173
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,360
- Hurry, okay?
- Okay.

174
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,590
- All right.
- Okay.

175
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,280
Didn't you have a date with President Tang?

176
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,140
Are you eating two orders of fried dumplings by yourself?

177
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,630
- Can't I?
- No.

178
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,490
I'm just afraid you'll get indigestion.

179
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,480
It's fattening to eat this late at night. Here, let me help you eat it.

180
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,300
No. Eating two orders of fried dumplings

181
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,640
makes me happy.

182
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,550
All right. As long as you're happy.

183
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,960
Say, aren't you a rare guest?

184
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,220
What wind blows you here?

185
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,560
If just a gust of wind can bring me here, then won't I be a paper doll?

186
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,060
Aren't you a paper doll?

187
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,150
Look how skinny you are. Are you not eating every day?

188
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,940
That's my choice.

189
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,590
You are not just here to visit me, right?

190
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:42,560
Since I came to see you in your office, of course, it's for business.

191
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,730
Let me ask you. Regarding the contract of Mingyuan using Cayman's models,

192
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,640
why haven't you confirmed and signed it yet?

193
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,480
I haven't signed it because I have concerns.

194
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,040
I can't be careless when it comes to contracts.

195
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,420
Didn't I already send the models for fitting?

196
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,390
We didn't delay your regular work, right?

197
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:03,750
Indeed, there was no delay. However, we still need to go through the required procedure.

198
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,480
The sooner we sign the contract, the sooner things are settled. Right?

199
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,570
Did Tang Mingxuan send you?

200
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,390
Why isn't he here himself?

201
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,690
It's not about who comes here.

202
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,390
Can the issue be resolved if he's personally here?

203
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,230
Let me tell you.

204
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,340
This show is not only important to Mingyuan,

205
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,920
but also to your Cayman.

206
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,760
If Cayman's models can get great exposure

207
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,900
through this big show,

208
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,880
it is very beneficial to Cayman's future.

209
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,680
As the vice president, you need to think about your models, right?

210
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,720
This is the reason I've been thinking about it and haven't signed the contract yet.

211
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,600
The contract talks about only this collaboration.

212
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,640
What do you mean by that?

213
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,510
I want to sign a long-term collaboration contract with Mingyuan.

214
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,060
It's not too much to ask for, is it?

215
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,190
It's not. I can agree with that.

216
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,170
But you have to agree to a small request of mine.

217
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,540
Go on.

218
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,600
The models Cayman provides us

219
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,420
must be the best.

220
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,730
Also, Mingyuan must be your priority.

221
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,130
Of course.

222
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,510
As long as the price is right.

223
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:20,660
That's for sure. You aren't allowed to demand an exorbitant price though.

224
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,390
All right. Revise the contract according to your thoughts,

225
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,770
sign it and fax it to me.

226
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:30,260
Aren't you and Tang Mingxuan going to look at the revision I make?

227
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:34,840
We grew up together after all. We trust you very much.

228
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,460
Let's have a pleasant cooperation.

229
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,910
Let's have a pleasant cooperation.

230
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,060
The contract is done.

231
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,530
Fang Xiaoyu signed it?

232
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:52,490
But there are some changes.

233
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,710
What has been added?

234
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,770
The single collaboration has become a three-year collaboration.

235
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:00,070
Furthermore, the price is 7% lower than before.

236
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,350
It looks like Xiaoyu isn't acting impulsively this time.

237
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,900
All right, this matter is resolved now. We can both be at ease.

238
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,110
Not yet.

239
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,550
Why not?

240
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,400
The final draft is not done yet.

241
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,240
Today, our first round of fittings and alterations

242
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,270
is done.

243
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,090
Everyone has worked hard.

244
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,200
Yang Guang, find a place

245
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,000
for everyone to relax.

246
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,420
All right.

247
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,930
I won't go. Qian Qian is about to have her surgery.

248
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,830
Since I'm free, I will go keep her company.

249
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,540
Send her my regards.

250
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,620
Have fun. I'll be leaving first.

251
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:50,990
Brother Xuan, may I have the rest of the day off after arranging this?

252
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,250
You've been quite busy lately.

253
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,970
How could I possibly be busier than you?

254
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:00,010
Don't worry. Your boss doesn't need you today.

255
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:04,180
President Tang, why do I feel like you are trying to spend time with your girlfriend

256
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,470
so you're using us as an excuse?

257
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,320
Right, everyone?

258
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,360
Enjoy yourselves today.

259
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,470
Mo Fei and I won't accompany you all.

260
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:19,720
Mo Fei, come out with me.

261
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,460
Go!

262
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,460
What? Are you worried about us?

263
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:29,660
Don't worry. We will eat your share.

264
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,450
It's so cold.

265
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:44,240
Stop being mad. I've already apologized so many times in the car earlier.

266
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,090
I was wrong.

267
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,190
How were you wrong?

268
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:15,930
My mistake was that I used what I thought was the right way to love you,

269
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:20,130
but I completely neglected all your feelings.

270
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:26,470
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

271
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:30,520
♫ Will instantly become sunny ♫

272
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:37,470
♫ That day, you said some words ♫

273
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:42,210
♫ Her smile ♫

274
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,620
Did you know? When I heard about you and Fang Qian,

275
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,770
I kept thinking,

276
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:52,080
was I not good enough

277
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,420
so that's why you didn't tell me.

278
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,800
Do you know what I was most angry about?

279
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,510
It's that I found out about your past from other people.

280
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,830
All right. It's in the past now.

281
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:13,120
I care about your present and future more.

282
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:18,640
So can you share with me whatever is going on with you from now on?

283
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:24,320
Also... Why are you shaking your head?

284
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,810
Whenever I'm angry, can you coax me?

285
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:30,580
Don't... just say a few words and then leave.

286
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,450
I can't.

287
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,830
- Why?
- Because there's no next time.

288
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,890
One more thing.

289
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,250
What else is there?

290
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,310
Why are you being so serious?

291
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,900
Don't you see that I'm scared like a little kid?

292
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,920
Why are you like my mom?

293
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,190
What do you mean I'm like your mom?

294
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:06,480
Even though you are good at your job, that may not be the case when it comes to relationships.

295
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,720
Life is long, so we still need to keep learning together.

296
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,090
Learn until we're old. Live until we're old.

297
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,120
It smells so good, Sister Xueling.

298
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,530
It reminds me of when I was a kid.

299
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:22,850
We went picking chrysanthemums all over the hill.

300
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,440
We were so happy back then.

301
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,550
Yes.

302
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,200
Here. I'll put it on your bedside table for you

303
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,800
so you can smell it every day.

304
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,910
Qian Qian, you are about to have surgery.

305
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,120
Are you nervous?

306
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,830
A little.

307
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:53,220
But I'm not afraid, because you guys are by my side.

308
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,900
Good.

309
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:01,390
I'm just worried about other people affecting your mood.

310
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,970
Are you talking about Mo Fei?

311
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,890
Sister Xueling, there's actually something

312
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,450
I have always wanted to talk to you about.

313
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,170
Go ahead.

314
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,360
I know that you don't like Mo Fei,

315
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:25,160
not because of her as a person. It's for another reason.

316
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,480
What other reason could there be?

317
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,470
Sister Xueling,

318
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,490
actually, we are the same.

319
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:38,160
Ever since we were young, we got everything we wanted.

320
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,610
Even if it's the moon in the sky, someone will go pluck it for us.

321
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:48,490
We had too much, so we didn't know how to cherish it.

322
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:52,870
In the past, I thought that as long as I wanted it,

323
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:56,170
I could get everything with hard work.

324
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,930
But feelings are different.

325
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:03,300
They're not commodities, and can't be exchanged.

326
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,210
If you force your feelings on someone else,

327
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:10,220
then the other person will only hate you.

328
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,740
Just like the roses in the garden.

329
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,970
If you forcefully pick it,

330
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,880
it will wither some day.

331
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,950
However, watching it bloom towards the sun and rain,

332
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,710
isn't that a kind of joy?

333
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:31,360
Qian Qian, you're having surgery soon.

334
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,400
Don't think too much.

335
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,820
It's fine, Sister Xueling.

336
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:41,300
I hope you can remember what I said today.

337
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,840
I also hope you can receive your own happiness.

338
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:01,320
I'll go buy you some oden to cheer you up, all right?

339
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,180
I don't want to eat that.

340
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,460
Why not?

341
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,040
Guess.

342
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,230
Then, what do you want to eat?

343
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:23,400
♫ Falling, falling, falling for you ♫

344
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,800
♫ Perfect love song ♫

345
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,460
♫ Wholeheartedly loving you ♫

346
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,820
You've improved, haven't you?

347
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:37,690
♫ Falling, falling, falling for you ♫

348
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:41,260
♫ Perfect love song ♫

349
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,880
♫ We are all listening ♫

350
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,960
Teacher Cheng, are you okay?

351
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,940
Here, napkin.

352
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,450
I'm completely fine.

353
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,990
- Let's go to another place and continue to drink.
- All right. Okay.

354
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:00,460
Stop forcing yourself. Look, you can't even stand.

355
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,820
Would you believe that I can stand up to do a model walk for you?

356
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,500
All right.

357
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,260
Hello, Mom.

358
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,400
I will be back soon.

359
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,480
All right, got it.

360
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,390
How about you go home first, Dong Dong?

361
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:19,750
Your home is so far. If you get home too late, your mom will worry.

362
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,910
But that's not very appropriate, right?

363
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,800
It's fine. You live in the opposite direction anyway.

364
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,440
I can take Teacher Cheng home.

365
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,790
Teacher Cheng... like this...

366
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,650
Just go. Don't worry.

367
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,120
Go, go, go.

368
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,170
All right. I will get going then.

369
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:38,960
- Be safe on your way home. Bye-bye.
- Bye.

370
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:44,810
Easy. Here, rinse your mouth.

371
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,810
Teacher Cheng.

372
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,330
Teacher Cheng.

373
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:57,120
Teacher Cheng, where do you live? I'll take you home.

374
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,630
Teacher Cheng, can you hear me?

375
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:03,550
Where do you live? I'll take you home.

376
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,760
Where exactly are you going, Miss?

377
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,570
Cheng Yang.

378
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,480
You scared me to death, Duoduo. What brings you here?

379
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,160
Where is Cheng Yang?

380
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,640
He hasn't been home for the entire night.

381
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,850
I've been calling him all night and he didn't answer.

382
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,820
I thought he slept here.

383
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,290
I didn't see him this morning.

384
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:02,510
Don't worry. I will call our colleagues and ask.

385
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,350
Cheng Yang.

386
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:08,750
- You are dead.
- Don't worry.

387
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,120
Excuse me, do you have a phone charger I can use?

388
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,730
My phone is out of battery.

389
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,720
- What phone do you have?
- I have an iPhone.

390
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,480
iPhone? You won't be able to charge it. I only have an android charger.

391
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,150
Let's go faster, please.

392
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:50,230
I am in a hurry.

393
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:53,990
There's a speed limit. I can't go any faster.

394
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,520
- Don't cry.
- Say,

395
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,530
where exactly has Cheng Yang gone?

396
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,500
Nothing happened to him, right?

397
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,830
No, don't make wild guesses. He was just...

398
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:16,090
Hello, Yu Xia. Was Teacher Cheng not with you guys after dinner?

399
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,200
What? He got drunk?

400
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,780
Then, who took him home?

401
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,110
Got it. I will make another call. Bye-bye.

402
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,810
What did your colleague say? Where is he?

403
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,800
Let me make another call.

404
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,150
- Duoduo.
- Cheng Yang!

405
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,140
Where did you go?

406
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,870
I figured you must have come to the company.

407
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:42,710
You must have been worried. It's all right now.

408
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:46,320
I called you all night but you didn't pick up.

409
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,850
Let me tell you what happened. I blacked out last night.

410
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,850
I didn't even know how I got to the hotel.

411
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:55,960
I couldn't remember a thing and I don't know who took me there.

412
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,320
Are you telling the truth?

413
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,000
Yes, Baby. That's the truth.

414
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,900
Look how worried you made Duoduo.

415
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,080
- You can't drink the next time there's a gathering.
- Yes, yes. I was wrong.

416
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,770
I was just too happy yesterday, so I drank too much.

417
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,840
- My phone is dead. I'll leave it here to charge and take Duoduo home.
- Okay.

418
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,760
Cheng Yang!

419
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,650
- What?
- What is it?

420
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,840
- What?
- Look!

421
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,010
- What is it, Duoduo?
- A lipstick stain.

422
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:27,310
Where exactly did you go last night?

423
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,240
- W-What?
- If you don't explain it clearly,

424
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,000
I won't let you off!

425
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,190
- Where did the lipstick stain come from?
- Liar!

426
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,310
- I didn't lie to you, Duoduo!
- Duoduo, that's enough.

427
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,250
- Duoduo.
- Duoduo, listen to me! Listen to me!

428
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:41,930
- I am definitely not lying to you!
- What's going on here?

429
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,050
- Who was the last to be with Teacher Cheng last night?
- Shen Jiaxi.

430
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,960
My mom called me, rushing me to go home, so I left first.

431
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,050
Shen Jiaxi said she would take Teacher Cheng home.

432
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:54,470
Who is Shen Jiaxi?

433
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:58,670
Where is she? I'm asking you who is Shen Jiaxi?

434
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,140
Shen JIaxi!

435
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:07,330
- Are you Shen Jiaxi?
- Yes, why?

436
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:11,000
- You shameless tramp!
- Duoduo.

437
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,120
- Duoduo, we haven't figured out what happened yet.
- Let go of me!

438
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,040
Where did you come from, you crazy person? Why did you hit me?

439
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,300
Hit you? Cheng Yang didn't come home all night.

440
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,670
Where did you take him? Tell me!

441
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:25,440
Shen Jiaxi, tell me exactly what happened last night?

442
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,480
- Stop pretending here.
- What happened?

443
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,430
You want me to say it? Aren't you very well aware?

444
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,440
What is he aware of? He was so drunk.

445
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,240
Look.

446
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,200
Let go!

447
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,640
Look. It's the lipstick stain from your mouth.

448
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,600
Mo Fei, aren't they the same color?

449
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,240
How did it get on there? Tell me how it got on there.

450
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,880
There are so many people with this lipstick color in this country. Why don't you suspect everyone? Why only suspect me?

451
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,040
Also, Cheng Yang and I are only coworkers.

452
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,530
He was so drunk that he didn't know where he lives, so I was only able to take him to a hotel.

453
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:54,340
- I left right after that.
- Coworkers?

454
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,980
Stop with the nonsense.

455
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,510
There are so many male coworkers here, yet you, a girl, took him home.

456
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,510
Dong Dong and I were going to take him home together last night

457
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,770
but Dong Dong had to go, so only I was left to take him back.

458
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:05,340
Not only did you not thank me, but also slapped me, are you insane?

459
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:09,340
Duoduo, calm down a bit. We don't know the entire situation right now.

460
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:12,030
I did a good deed, yet not only are you not thanking me

461
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,360
- but also saying I'm in the wrong.
- Good deed?

462
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,030
I should've left Cheng Yang on the street, is that right?

463
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:20,800
Also, do you really think your Cheng Yang is a super handsome man that everyone wants a piece of?

464
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,130
If you like him so much, keep him home to look at every day!

465
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:25,670
I, Shen Jiaxi, don't care at all!

466
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,890
Cheng Yang, you are not human.

467
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:31,800
You were like this in Paris, and you are like this after coming home as well.

468
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,590
You've really gone too far.

469
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,570
Duoduo, what am I like?

470
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:38,400
- I didn't do anything. Believe me.
- Stop talking.

471
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,480
No matter what you say today, I am breaking up with you. No one can convince me otherwise.

472
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,360
Duoduo, calm down a bit.

473
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,810
I know you are very upset right now.

474
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:47,790
But, I've known Shen Jiaxi for years now.

475
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:50,150
I believe she is not that kind of person.

476
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:54,010
Besides, if she really did something wrong towards you, I definitely won't let her off.

477
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,960
But we don't even know if it happened or not

478
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,520
yet you're mentioning breaking up like this. Don't you think that's a pity?

- Shut up.

You must know which hotel you stayed at.

I really drank too much. I can't even remember how I got there.

Do you recognize this guy?

He spent a night here with a woman.

He was drunk last night and opened a room here with a woman. Do you have any recollection of that?

♫ I say you're an April day ♫

639
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,600
♫ The sound of your laughter lights everything up ♫

640
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:34,080
♫ Even the spirit of a light breeze ♫

641
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:40,200
♫ In the midst of the brightness and beauty of spring,
shift as one would in a dance ♫

642
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:45,450
♫ You're the mist on a dry April day ♫

643
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:49,880
♫ The gentle breeze blown during dusk ♫

644
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,410
♫ The unintentional sparkle of the planetesimal ♫

645
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:59,420
♫ The fine rain that's sprinkled in front of the flower ♫

646
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:04,200
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

647
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:09,040
♫ Like a shy water lotus that bows to a cool breeze ♫

648
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,760
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

649
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,620
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫

650
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:23,360
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

651
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:30,920
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫

652
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:43,150
♫ You're like the ivory field after snowflakes ♫

653
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:47,480
♫ You're the round moon every night ♫

654
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,280
♫ You're the naïve ♫

655
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:57,540
♫ white lotus that floats on the water ripples of your dream ♫

656
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:02,540
♫ You're the flower blossoms of tree after tree ♫

657
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:07,120
♫ The swallow twittering within the beams ♫

658
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:11,200
♫ You are love, hope, and warmth ♫

659
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,150
♫ You're an April day ♫

660
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:19,920
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

661
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,620
♫ The bittersweet parting words of "take care" ♫

662
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:29,420
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

663
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:37,010
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫
