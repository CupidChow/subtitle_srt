[Episode 5]

3
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,240
You are stingy.

4
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,590
You're a boss of such a big company yet you're having me pay.

5
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,030
Excuse me. Make way please. Excuse me.

6
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,890
Okay.

7
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,190
There is no place to sit.

8
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,250
Let's sit here. Boss, please help us clean up this table!

9
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,000
Sure!

10
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,580
- May I have the menu?
- Menu.

11
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,330
Sit.

12
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,790
Let me tell you... The bullfrog here is super delicious.

13
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,550
One serving of bullfrog.

14
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,500
You can eat spicy, right?

15
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,580
Lobster. All right! Boss, just these.

16
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,160
Oh, and 2 cans of Sprite.

17
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,920
All right! I'll bring the food to you soon.

18
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,170
Hey, this.

19
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,960
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,320
Let me tell you... This place's bullfrog is really, really delicious!

21
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,260
After you eat it, I promise you will fall in love with it!

22
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,430
Do you come here often?

23
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,510
This is my canteen.

24
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,010
You are pretty rich.

25
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,160
This-This place is not as expensive as the places you go to.

26
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,060
Besides you are so rich, shouldn't you pay for this meal?

27
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,830
Your Sprite.

28
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,800
Escherichia coli.

29
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,240
What?

30
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,860
Escherichia coli. Give it to me.

31
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,420
The bullfrog is here. Hurry, hurry. Hurry up and eat.

32
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,380
Miss, please bring me a bowl of water.

33
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,840
- Hot water.
- Okay! Coming right up.

34
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,880
Say, it's such a hot summer day yet you're going to drink hot water?

35
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,300
I ordered it for you.

36
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,860
I have a Sprite.

37
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,740
Shouldn't you be drinking hot water right now?

38
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,860
I'm not health conscious.

39
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,310
T-Then you go ahead and drink it.

40
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,230
Chopsticks.

41
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,830
Eating at these places is like this. There's really no problem with it.

42
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,940
My mother is an especially disciplined person.

43
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,580
Then it must be very exhausting to learn all those rules, right?

44
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,970
If you were like this since you were young,

45
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,140
would you think it is exhausting?

46
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,930
B-But I'm different from you. I'm very carefree.

47
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,970
Since I was young, my mom has been very easygoing with me, except for when she's working.

48
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:07,280
Here, here! E-Eat some bullfrog. It is really tasty.

49
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,100
So you were like a wild child?

50
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,430
What wild child? I'm what's called carefree.

51
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,380
So you were set free to being your individual self?

52
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,220
Who is it?

53
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,210
Lu Zhu? How did you find my home?

54
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,450
The owner of the bar told me.

55
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,160
You didn't go sing last night.

56
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,630
I am worried about you.

57
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,130
Wow! Do you know how to make clothes, too?

58
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,240
These are all my sister's.

59
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,210
Oh...

60
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,960
Don't touch. If you mess it up, my sister will scold me.

61
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,340
Are these done by her, too?

62
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,860
Yes, she is amazing.

63
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,980
A talented woman.

64
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:10,720
Hey, your home has a lot of fox dolls.

65
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,430
Wow, this Little Prince is so cute!

66
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,330
Can you give it to me?

67
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:22,600
That... is my sister's. You should put it back.

68
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,800
You don't even know how long I've searched and how far I've walked to find your home.

69
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,820
I care for you so much, yet don't you know to treat me better?

70
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,700
All right! I'll give it to you!

71
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,940
- Really?
- My sister has a lot of these anyway.

72
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,110
Thank you.

73
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,640
My house is in front. You don't need to walk me there. I can get there myself.

74
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,270
I wasn't planning on walking you there.

75
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,500
It just so happens that I have to go this way to get my car.

76
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,780
Get your car?

77
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,910
But... isn't your car parked across from the restaurant we just ate at?

78
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,670
It is so late. Taking a girl back home is also one of my family's rules.

79
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,980
Your family has so many rules.

80
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,720
What?

81
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,680
Say it out loud.

82
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,550
I-I-I nothing.

83
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,250
I discovered that you can eat quite a lot.

84
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,310
I'm all right.

85
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:39,240
You can stop here. Thank you for bringing me home. Hurry up and head back.

86
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,230
Okay.

87
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,920
Her look of admiration is so direct, isn't it?

88
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,520
Why do you keep looking at me?

89
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:06,660
Actually, I've been wanting to tell you...

90
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,700
You can be direct.

91
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,410
You have sauce on the corner of your mouth.

92
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,710
You haven't rubbed it off yet.

93
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,530
Let me help you.

94
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,390
Cousin?

95
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,340
Sister?

96
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,080
She's your younger cousin?

97
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,170
This is my younger brother.

98
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,720
- It is so late. Why aren't you—
- Don't misunderstand.

99
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,990
This is my colleague at Cayman.

100
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,700
We are both trainees.

101
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:02,500
Today, I came... to ask him about tomorrow's class schedule.

102
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,230
- What?
- Right?

103
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,740
Oh, right. Yes.

104
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,380
But why were you two standing so close to each other?

105
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,480
Hurry home.

106
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,420
- What's going on?
- What's going on with you?

107
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,380
W-When I am not home, you bring girls home?

108
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,740
Then, how about you? I haven't even asked why there is a guy bringing you home in the middle of the night.

109
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,080
I asked you first! You haven't answered me yet.

110
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,930
No, you're a girl. I have to be concerned about your safety.

111
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,670
I-I am your older sister!

112
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:54,400
- Brother...
- Let me ask you, what time is it right now?

113
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,550
It's just past 8:00 p.m.

114
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:58,070
- It's just past 8:00 p.m?
- Yes.

115
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:04,660
It's so late after your classes already. Is it appropriate for a lady like you to go to a man's home?

116
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,660
- Brother, how do you know Mo Fan's sister?
- Don't change the subject.

117
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,140
We have a work relationship. I am asking you a question.

118
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,880
Are you guys dating? I feel very strongly like you two are a couple.

119
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,300
- Really.
- Do we seem like a couple?

120
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,080
I feel like you guys are really compatible.

121
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,900
This...

122
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,170
Is it a pair with mine? The two of them—

123
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,070
Wait! Where did you get this?

124
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,430
Mo Fan gave it to me.

125
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,650
W-What are you doing, Brother?

126
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,140
Don't be touching other people's stuff.

127
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:54,800
- C-Can I not even look at it? Besides, Mo Fan gave it to me!
- That belongs to Mo Fei!

128
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,430
Let me tell you! Regarding your problem, once we get home,

129
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,550
I will discipline you.

130
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,350
He's a grown man

131
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:13,150
yet he even uses a straw to drink a beverage.

132
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,760
Sister, what man are you talking about?

133
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,690
Who else can it be—

134
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,480
Say, why are you such a gossip?

135
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,830
I'm just curious. Hurry and tell me.

136
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:30,520
Curious? From what I see, you usually don't care yet now you're curious?

137
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,170
Listen! The two of us have no relationship at all.

138
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,240
No relationship at all?

139
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,180
If there is no relationship, why did he take you home?

140
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,400
How many times have I told you already?

141
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,560
We have only a work relationship.

142
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,830
Aside from that, there is nothing at all!

143
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:57,570
Wait! I haven't asked you yet! What's your relationship with Lu Zhu?

144
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,530
- Us?
- Yes.

145
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:03,290
It's very simple. We are simply colleagues.

146
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,600
You two are simply colleagues. Why can't we be the same?

147
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,490
Our relationship is very simple, too, all right?

148
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,300
If that's the case, why are you blushing?

149
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,050
I'm blushing? I just put too much blush on.

150
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,850
What do you know?

151
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,980
You like clapping so much, you brat!

152
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,850
Sister, don't touch me! I depend on my face to make money nowadays.

153
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,870
Depend on your face to make money? Leave!

154
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,990
- Don't annoy me.
- Fine, I'll go.

155
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,500
Did I really blush?

156
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,790
It is just too much blush.

157
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,560
[You seem to be in a very good mood today.]

158
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,880
♫ Like a falling leave falling in front of you ♫

159
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,770
Yes, I am in a very good mood.

160
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:17,150
Something I have worried about for a long time was finally solved.

161
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,630

Go over right now?

00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,900
This is an exclusive employee access card. With it, you can enter and exit the Mingyuan Building at will.

You can even come into my office.

only you can enjoy such privileges.

214
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,890
Thank you, President Tang, for your kindness. I will definitely work harder and cherish it.

If you let me see you slack, be careful. I may take the card back.

Miss Mo, President Tang specially made this card for you

so it will be more convenient for you to come in and out of Mingyuan.

229

Since it's an employee card, why give it to me? I don't want it.

Miss Mo, you should keep it.

But I don't come often.

Well, you don't want to always be locked out of the building. Right?

234
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:06,610
That's true. There are a lot of mosquitoes outside.

All right, I'll take it. Thanks.

But don't worry, I won't come here often. Once the embroidery workshop matter is over,

237
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,070

- We didn't see you.
- Why aren't you more careful?

They are employees of my company.

Be careful. I might tell your boss to deduct your bonus.

What? Are you going to deduct my salary as the boss?

264
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,430
It all depends on how your discussion with the TV station went.

265
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,670
The TV station has already released the advertisements.

266
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,290
We have also started the pre-launch marketing stage.

267
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:24,620
Store sales in first-tier cities have also increased significantly.

268
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,050
I can see that many consumers came after watching the event.

269
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,050
That's great!

270
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,430
Also... the TV station

271
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:38,070
wants Fang Xiaoyu to be a judge.

272
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,100
If they have the ability to invite him, then let them invite him.

273
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,090
He, himself, is unwilling to go, but Cayman wants him to participate.

274
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,330
Then let them argue amongst themselves.

275
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,170
Director Fang,

276
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:04,890
this is "Chinese Style Fashion," a competition among designers, that the TV station is hosting.

277
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:10,020
The organizers would like to invite you to participate in the show.

278
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,150
I am not interested.

279
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:17,600
Director Fang, how about you look at the proposal first.

280
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,130
The President of the Garment Association would like you to go be a judge.

281
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:24,540
To give the younger generation some pointers and some lessons.

282
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:28,640
I think that the other designers aren't as handsome on camera as you are.

283
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,300
Besides, Cayman needs to have a public image.

284
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,800
Take a look.

285

- Yes.

287
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,100
Director Fang, I think it's a good idea.

288
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,300
They give the funding and we get the exposure. What a bargain.

289
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,230
How is it a bargain?

290
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:59,580
Hosting this show, they're bound to invite the big names in the industry to support it.

291
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:04,140
In the end, don't the sponsorships and advertisements still belong to Mingyuan Fashion Group?

292
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:08,180
Since they've invested in it, we have to let them show off a little.

293
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,930
We didn't spend any money but get free advertisement.

294
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,780
- Right?
- Does Cayman lack money?

295
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,720
No, of course not.

296
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,050
Then, why take advantage of Tang Mingxuan?

297
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,270
But... President Hu has already

298
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:26,910
asked Linda to send models for the fashion show.

299
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,950
What does that have to do with me?

300
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,200
Director Fang, you at least have to give the association's president face. Right?

301
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,960
What is it? If I don't give him face, will he bite me?

302
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,020
He won't do that.

303
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,840
I just think that since you are so handsome,

304
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,510
it would be a pity not to be on camera.

305
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,950
Sucking up to me is useless.

306
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,830
How about you have Tang Mingxuan come beg me?

307
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,810
I might say yes.

308
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,550
Hello, Director Fang. Are you looking for me?

309
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:02,500
I sent you a message. Why didn't you reply?

310
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,440
What? You sent me a message? Let me check.

311
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,380
What's wrong with this dress?

312
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:16,800
I'm going to test you. What do you think about this dress?

313
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:22,740
I think... the hemline can be made higher.

314
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,030
Because velvet is a fabric that tends to appear heavy.

315
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:30,260
This way it will make the entire effect look lighter.

316
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:33,270
Not bad! You are indeed Teacher Pan's student.

317
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:36,160
Our ideas coincide.

318
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,600
By the way, the TV station is holding a competition called "Chinese Style Fashion."

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,800
I suggest you sign up for it immediately.

320
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,320
Director Fang, I really did sign up for it.

321
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,520
- Really?
- Yes.

322
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,600
Then I wish you great results.

323
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:58,000
Say... You wouldn't happen to be a judge, right?

324
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,830
Didn't you insist on not "walking through the back door"? Whether I'm a judge is not important at all.
(T/N: Using connections)

325
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,500
Unless you are not confident about your design.

326
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,120
I was just asking. If there's nothing else, I will hang up now.

327
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,750
Bye-bye.

328
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,230
Li Qi!

329
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,460
Li Qi!

330
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:25,110
- Director Fang.
- Tell the TV station that I want to be a judge.

331
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:28,540
Just cut these and we're about done.

332
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,660
Sister Mo Fei.

333
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,260
Do you two need help with anything?

334
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,440
Help me wash the vegetables.

335
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,460
All right.

336
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,900
Why are you so obedient today?

337
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,820
You are talking too much.

338
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,550
- Is the picture all right?
- It looks good, doesn't it?

339
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:18,590
- Yes. Can we eat now?
- Yes.

340
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,060
Here.

341
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,460
Lu Zhu.

342
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:34,730
Sister Mo Fei, to be honest, I really envy you.

343
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:35,950
Envy me for what?

344
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:39,190
For relying on your own skills to get to France.

345
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,740
Even though I grew up abroad,

346
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,190
everything was arranged by my family.

347
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,990
I don't have the slightest sense of accomplishment.

348
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,960
I have only sent them my designs.

349
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,130
Whether they accept me or not is not certain.

350
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:53,430
No, you will certainly succeed.

351
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:57,100
To us all being able to fulfill our dreams.

352
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,860
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

353
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:14,000
I didn't expect you to be such a good cook.

354
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,440
Then, can I come here often to eat your food in the future?

355
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,600
Sure, sure! Come often! Just come, no need for a reason.

356
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,160
Don't you live at President Tang's home? Is the food there that bad?

357
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,670
What's up with the attitude?

358
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:31,220
Lu Zhu likes the food you made. You should be happy.

359
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,780
Say "thanks."

360
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:35,030
Thank you, Lu Zhu!

361
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,220
The food at my house is not bad.

362
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,130
It's just that at the dinner table,

363
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:44,800
there is nothing to talk about with my aunt and uncle.

364
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:49,060
And my cousin is very cold and ignores people all day long.

365
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,200
Whenever I eat there, I feel like I'll get indigestion.

366
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,090
Especially my cousin, he...

367
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,380
Let's not talk about him. Let's not talk about him.

368
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,900
He is just very strange.

369
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,360
This salad tastes better than the ones I ate abroad.

370
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,690
- Really?
- Really!

371
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,570
Then have some more.

372
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,400
- You're lying.
- It's true.

373
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,300
Hello, Embroiderer Wu. What is it?

374
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,660
What happened? Tell me slowly.

375
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:24,840
Lu Jun?

376
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,170
Is everything okay with Master?

377
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,600
Embroiderer Wu, don't worry. I will think of something.

378
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,680
All right. Bye-bye.

379
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,470
Mingxuan, it's so late yet you're still working?

380
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,340
Mom, it's so late. You're still awake?

381
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,420
I made this soup for you. Drink it while it's still hot.

382
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,130
Thank you.

383
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:51,980
Why hasn't Xueling come here lately?

384
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,800
We are only colleagues.

385
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,600
If there's something to talk about, we do it at the office.

386
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,910
Why would she come here?

387
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:04,000
Are you pretending not to understand or do you really not understand?

388
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,840
I'm going to answer the phone.

389
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,430
Hello, Mo Fei.

390
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,520
Hello, President Tang. Do you have time tomorrow?

391
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,160
Something has happened at the embroidery workshop.

392
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,330
Last night, you mentioned a...

393
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:27,660
Lu Jun. Who exactly is he?

394
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,970
He is my master's nephew. He is extremely greedy.

395
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:34,540
Each time the embroidery workshop makes money, he will come to ask for some.

396
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:38,540
I don't know how he found out that the embroidery workshop is going to collaborate with Mingyuan.

397
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,890
So, lately, he keeps pestering my master.

398
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:44,530
He even took over a dozen relatives to my master's house yesterday.

399
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:47,940
She had no choice but to hide.

400
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:52,140
Have you seen him before?

401
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,350
I have. What should we do now?

402
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:58,620
Will the collaboration fall through now?

403
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,670
Let's go see first.

404
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:11,660
Whatever you want to talk about on behalf of Mingyuan, just talk to me.

405
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,660
I make the decisions here.

406
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:17,130
The price... is also decided by me.

407
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:21,300
If you want to talk about a collaboration, then you should at least introduce yourself.

408
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,400
I don't even know who you are.

409
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,080
My name is Lu Jun. I am Master Li's nephew.

410
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,160
I am also the legal person of this embroidery workshop.

411
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,500
By the way, President Tang,

412
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,410
my aunt already told me about

413
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:37,270
your acquisition of the embroidery workshop.

414
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,340
I can give you a reply right now.

415
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:43,060
I don't agree to it.

416
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,290
What's the reason?

417
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:50,510
As for the reason–

418
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:54,220
President Tang, what a coincidence.

419
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,320
Long time no see.

420
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,650
Here, Brother, have a seat.

421
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:05,170
Who is this person?

422
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:15,400
A supporting character. The bad guy.

423
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:20,780
- Where's my aunt?
- Your aunt? She went out.

424
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:24,590
Mister, who is your aunt?

425
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:29,250
- Miss, who are you?
- She's your aunt's

426
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:32,060
- apprentice.
- Apprentice?

427
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,060
President Tang!

428
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:38,070
Since you have already noticed, I might as well be honest with you.

429
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:41,020
This embroidery workshop is our ancestral property.

430
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,960
If you really want to buy it,

431
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,000
then our whole family has to approve of it.

432
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:52,250
So you mean that your family includes my competitor,

433
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,480
President Zhu Haitian. Is that what you mean?

434
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,810
President Tang, such a coincidence, such a coincidence.

435
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,710
Wait!

436
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:03,990
Why don't I understand this play you are acting out at all?

437
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,050
Acting?

438
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:10,110
What kind of play are we acting out? We are talking about business right now!

439
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:14,710
So much effort just to discuss business. It must be hard on you guys.

440
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:19,380
Malicious competition will only make the market worse and worse.

441
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:22,910
Bettering the embroidery workshop relies on the passing down of the craftsmanship.

442
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:26,950
Not on making a quick buck on an ancestral business like the two of you.

443
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:32,170
President Tang, those words are a bit unpleasant to the ears.

444
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:37,050
Do you deserve to have me talk nicely to you?

445
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,270
Tang Mingxuan, aren't you too arrogant?

446
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:46,290
Haiyao may lack the financial resources that

447
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,270
Mingyuan has.

448
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:50,740
But the capabilites of our clan

449
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,020
are more than yours, aren't they?

450
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,110
I have honestly not seen the capabilities you claim to have.

451
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:58,840
But I really do admire your ability to boast.

452
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,670
Hey, you!

453
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:06,210
Let's go. It's not worth wasting our precious time on them.

454
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:08,000
Let's go.

455
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,280
Brother, how was that?

456
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,700
Look at you!

457
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,970
President Tang! President Tang!

458
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:23,150
Wait, wait!

459
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,670
Look! My younger brother is not very experienced.

460
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:28,990
He doesn't know how to speak. He has offended you.

461
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:33,910
President Tang, can we exchange a few words in private?

462
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,140
Just for a bit.

463
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:41,520
Based on our relationship, do you think that is appropriate?

464
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,540
Look at the way you are talking.

465
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:46,480
You two talk. I will wait for you outside.

466
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,400
Thank you!

467
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:54,410
President Tang, you have misunderstood me!

468
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:58,480
Before I came here, I really didn't know about the situation between Mingyuan and the workshop.

469
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,760
But now that I'm aware of it,

470
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,550
as a gentleman, I have to help others fulfill their wish.

471
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,960
With only one word of yours, the family's side...

472
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,420
I will support you and be on your side, all right?

473
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:10,330
Can you just be direct?

474
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:12,940
Is what I'm saying not clear enough?

475
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,050
I can help you with the acquisition of the embroidery workshop.

476
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:17,070
Really, you might not believe it.

477
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,750
Let me tell you.

478
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,420
If I help you today, it's the same as helping my aunt.

479
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:25,280
You probably know this better than I do. This embroidery workshop cannot survive for much longer.

480
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:29,190
Although she's my maternal aunt, she is still a relative from the same clan.

481
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:33,000
I can't just watch the embroidery workshop collapse, right?

482
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:37,150
If you have any conditions, you can just say so directly.

483
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,830
President Tang, you are insulting me.

484
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,670
What conditions? There are no conditions.

485
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:43,670
We are in the same industry so we run into each other all the time.

486
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:47,380
Actually, I have always wanted to become friends with you.

487
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,640
Since we're in the same industry, we're bound to collaborate.

488
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,650
With you?

489
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,440
Forget it.

490
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,690
Wait! When did I

491
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:59,810
ever offend you to make you so hostile towards me?

492
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:03,050
Since you asked today, I will clear it up for you.

493
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:07,150
Three years ago, did your company copy our design?

494
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:12,080
That... Actually, that—

495
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:16,730
When we sued you back then, the court also ruled you guys were guilty of plagiarizing.

496
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:20,150
Yet you've only paid the fine. You never apologized.

497
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,610
Do I need to say more?

498
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:26,030
President Tang, this is old history. It has been three years.

499
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,390
Let's both forget about this. Let's have tea,

500
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:30,940
- and chat–
- Time has passed, but this matter cannot be in the past.

501
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:35,190
As long as you don't apologize, there is no ending to this matter.

502
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:40,860
Also, our company actually doesn't need a friend with no bottom line like you.

503
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,000
In regards to our company's business,

504
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,900
you don't need to worry.

505
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:49,820
President Tang.

506
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:10,410
Both Master Wu and Master Chen are not answering their phones. Where could they have gone?

507
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:12,950
You have followed your master for so many years.

508
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:14,850
Think about it again carefully.

509
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:17,170
Where does she normally like to go?

510
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,730
Right now, I am so worried my mind is blank.

511
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,700
Don't worry.

512
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:29,020
President Tang, if the embroidery workshop and Mingyuan cannot collaborate...

513
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,170
I won't give up that easily.

514
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:38,840
I hope you can be like me and try your very best.

515
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,370
Okay?

516
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:49,590
I know! I know where my master went!

517
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,450
This is the process by which Zhangzhou satin is made.

518
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:17,910
It is all made by hand.

519
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:34,150
My master frequently brought us here to do maintenance on the exhibition works.

520
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,160
They are all volunteers.

521
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:45,360
Look! This is how dense we want it.

522
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,750
Okay, I got it.

523
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:12,040
[Intangible Cultural Heritage of Silk Weave Technology in Suzhou]

524
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:19,870
Say, shouldn't you introduce all these to me?

525
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,620
This is the hui dress that the Song Dynasty's empress wore

526
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,840
during ceremonies and imperial court sessions.

527
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,790
The base color is dark blue.

528
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:31,500
The whole Song brocade is covered with the five-colored di bird pattern.

529
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,790
On the edges are hand-embroidered dragons.

530
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:40,550
Also, when you wear clothes like this, you must wear, on your head, a phoenix crown—

531
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:43,020
There is an introduction above it.

532
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:54,300
I didn't expect you to be so educated. You've memorized it so well.

533
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,980
What I said is not the same as what's on there.

534
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,620
Really? You just need to read it word for word.

535
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:02,200
Thank you very much.

536
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,580
I keep bothering you every time.

537
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,840
No need to thank us.

538
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,950
All right then, goodbye.
 [Song Brocade]

539
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:11,170
- Okay, see you.
- Goodbye.

540
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,300
Master.

541
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,000
Mo Fei.

542
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,930
President Tang is here.

543
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:27,170
I am really sorry for making you work so hard for nothing.

544
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:31,090
I really didn't think my family would be so against it.

545
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:37,350
President Tang, I actually recognize your ideas and your sincerity.

546
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,420
But at my age,

547
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,950
I don't have the ambition young people do.

548
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:45,080
I also don't dare try the plan you are proposing.

549
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:51,150
Also... I really can't continue to deal with the fuss that Lu Jun keeps making.

550
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:57,850
However, I want to say my thoughts.

551
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:02,820
Do you really have the heart to give him what you've worked at your entire life?

552
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:10,210
If you trust me, I can resolve this together with you.

553
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:21,920
But this matter is really not something that can be solved by a simple discussion.

554
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,740
The person who really represents the workshop and who will sign the contract with you is Lu Jun. He is the legal person.

555
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:29,870
He has brought the whole clan to oppose me. Tell me. What should I do?

556
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:37,190
Master, then you're not going to collaborate with Zhu Haitian, right?

557
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:42,380
I am old, but I'm not muddle-headed from old age yet.

558
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,480
If Zhu Haitian's father were still here, then it might be possible.

559
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:51,140
Haitian has always been incompetent, ever since he was little.

560
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:54,570
If the embroidery workshop works with him, then there won't be a future.

561
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:56,630
Then reject him.

562
00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:01,550
Master, right now, everyone is waiting for you to make a decision.

563
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:06,130
Your decision will affect everyone's livelihood.

564
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,860
Master, take a look. This is the latest revision we made.

565
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,870
It includes expanding the embroidery workshop.

566
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:19,460
There is also a plan for the recruitment of new students. Take a look first.

567
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:25,380
If you reject it now, don't you think it's a shame?

568
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:29,520
It's all right. Why don't you have a look first?

569
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:46,650
Tuck in your chin a little. Lifting it so high, are you doing ballet?

570
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:53,400
Okay, mind your footing, a straight line, not an S-line

571
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,540
Push your hip back.

572
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:00,340
All right, Mo Fan, not bad.

573
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:05,130
Pay attention to your pose at the fixed point.

574
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,260
All right.

575
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,160
Lu Zhu. Rhythm. Rhythm.

576
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,310
Rhythm! Do you hear me?!

577
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:19,190
Pay attention to the rhythm. I am not asking you to use your heels to chisel the floor.

578
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:22,670
Tell me. What are you learning?

579
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,250
Lu Zhu.

580
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:39,050
What's the matter? Are you upset? Don't cry.

581
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,780
Today, the teacher was a bit harsh.

582
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:44,490
Let me make an announcement.

583
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:56,130
♫ I say you're an April day  ♫

584
00:41:56,130 --> 00:42:00,110
♫ The sound of your laughter lights everything up ♫

585
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:03,650
♫ Even the spirit of a light breeze ♫

586
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:09,690
♫ In the midst of the brightness and beauty of spring,
shift as one would in a dance ♫

587
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:14,990
♫ You're the mist on a dry April day ♫

588
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:19,280
♫ The gentle breeze blown during dusk ♫

589
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,880
♫ The unintentional sparkle of the planetesimal ♫

590
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,940
♫ The fine rain that's sprinkled in front of the flower ♫

591
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:33,770
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

592
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:38,550
♫ Like a shy water lotus that bows to a cool breeze ♫

593
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:43,250
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

594
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:48,150
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫

595
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:52,760
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

596
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:59,310
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫

597
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:12,650
♫ You're like the ivory field after snowflakes ♫

598
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:16,960
♫ You're the round moon every night ♫

599
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,800
♫ You're the naïve ♫

600
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:27,070
♫ White lotus that floats on the water ripples of your dream ♫

601
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:32,180
♫ You're the flower blossoms of tree after tree ♫

602
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:36,710
♫ The swallow twittering within the beams ♫

603
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:40,240
♫ You are love, hope, and warmth ♫

604
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,660
♫ You're an April day ♫

605
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:49,310
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

606
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:54,160
♫ The bittersweet parting words of "take care" ♫

607
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:59,010
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

608
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:05,970
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫
