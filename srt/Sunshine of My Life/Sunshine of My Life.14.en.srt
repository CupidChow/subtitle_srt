3
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,460
What time should we go?

4
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,770
- Where?
- To Paris...

5
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,730
Aren't you going to Paris to visit SLC?

6
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,710
You don't need to go.

7
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,550
But. besides discussing the acquisition of SLC,

8
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,840
aren't you also going to Paris to look for designers?

9
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,820
Having a professional designer like me by your side

10
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,140
can give you some insights, right?

11
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,380
Isn't there still a lot of work at the company that needs your attention?

12
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,850
Besides you, who else can I trust to keep an eye on things?

13
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,520
But if you go alone...

14
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,260
Wait a moment.

15
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,360
Hello, President Wu.

16
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,210
That's right. You can rest assured.

17
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,820
I will make a trip to Suzhou to follow up on it.

18
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,520
Sure.

19
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,410
- Brother Xuan.
- Is the Paris itinerary ready?

20
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,950
When we get back from Suzhou, we can go to Paris.

21
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,390
But SLC has not given us a clear response yet.

22
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,730
So... how about we wait a bit before going?

23
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,880
If they don't agree to see us, then we would be going for nothing.

24
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,340
What do you mean "going for nothing"?

25
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,780
Aren't we going to Paris to discuss business? If they don't agree to see us, then it will be all for nothing.

26
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:10,080
You need to have some patience. Many things need time.

27
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,530
All right.

28
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,920
- Yang Guang.
- What is it, Brother?

29
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,840
Let me ask you something.

30
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,750
If a girl keeps giving you her blessing to be with another girl,

31
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,620
what does that mean?

32
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,360
Brother Xuan, did you... do something wrong?

33
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,600
If Mo Fei says that, she must be jealous.

34
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,140
I didn't do anything wrong.

35
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,920
That's impossible.

36
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:57,890
If you didn't do anything wrong, Mo Fei couldn't possibly say such things.

37
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,400
Did I say I was referring to Mo Fei?

38
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,970
What exactly is going on?

39
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,950
If I were to say,

40
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,110
Mo Fei must be jealous of Director Xia.

41
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,650
Think about it.

42
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,650
Director Xia is such an exceptional woman, right?

43
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,510
She is around you every day.

44
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,790
Anyone would be jealous of her.

45
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,320
Think. Think about it carefully.

46
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,650
So she's jealous.

47
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,570
- Yang Guang, turn the car around.
- Okay.

48
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:07,830
Sir, you have such good taste. You picked the best Zhang satin in our store with just a glance

49
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,930
- Really?
- Indeed.

50
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,410
The skill to weave Zhang satin is considered a cultural heritage in our country.

51
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,740
It must be weaved little by little by hand.

52
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,900
Especially this type of satin with multiple colors, the work is very complex.

53
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,330
A few years ago, you could only see it in museums.

54
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,770
All right, please wrap this up for me.

55
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,570
Yes, Sir.

If I call him now to ask if he is coming to Paris to see me,

58
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,930
would I be overthinking?

59
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,410
Should I call him or not?

60
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,470
Mo Fei, have you finished taking the trash out?

61

Yes!

Hey, stop!

65
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,930
It's got nothing to do with you. Go away.

Brother Xuan!

67

You just wait!

I'm fine. My main concern is you.

How did you provoke those French people?

77

Are those three siblings bothering you again?

78
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,270
They lost something and insist that Mo Fei stole it.

79

Let's do this. I'll find you two a new place that has security. It will be safer that way.

80
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,450
Mo Fei, you should avoid going out to work for now.

81
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,600
President Tang, thank you for your kindness but living here is fine.

Don't worry, we already filed a police report.

How come you suddenly appeared outside my building?

85
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,240
I came to Paris on a business trip.

I am Mo Fei's roommate. You are...

Friends are great!

leaving others with nothing to say.

108

But you were not bad today.

110

Of course, I trained before.

111

Why do I feel like I'm not paying you enough?

112
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,940
You should double my salary. I can also be your bodyguard.

What is your view on fashion designing?

128
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:24,870
All right. Fashion designing to me is a form of communication with the world.

129

Ms. Miya originally wanted to see you,

00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,320
But it's not open yet.

166
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,920
Then... I'll wait in the car and come back in a bit.

167
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,830
Paris is huge. If you are that hungry,

168
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:02,780
why don't you go eat at a restaurant that's already open?

169
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,810
That makes sense, too. I'm leaving then.

170
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:08,190
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

171
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,560
♫ The sound of your laughter lights everything up ♫

172
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,990
♫ Even the spirit of a light breeze ♫

173
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:50,060
♫ In the midst of the brightness and beauty of spring,
shift as one would in a dance ♫

174
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:55,330
♫ You're the mist on a dry April day ♫

175
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:59,620
♫ The gentle breeze blown during dusk ♫

176
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,330
♫ The unintentional sparkle of the planetesimal ♫

177
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:09,350
♫ The fine rain that's sprinkled in front of the flower ♫

178
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:14,090
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

179
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,310
Why is it you?

180
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,020
- Is Mo Fei here?
- She's...

181
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,180
not here. You can come in to wait for her.

182
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,130
No need. I'll wait for her downstairs.

183
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:33,390
- Thanks.
- Okay.

184
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:38,020
♫ The bittersweet parting words of "take care" ♫

185
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,730
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

186
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,290
- Mo Fei.
- Yes.

187
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:45,890
- What is it, Boss?
- If you've finished your work, just go on home.

188
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,000
Are you closing up early today?

189
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,630
No. I see that your friend is here

190
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,470
so I wanted to give you some time off.

191
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,870
I really lost to him.

192
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,470
It's all right. I can just leave work at the usual time. Thank you, Boss.

193
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,180
Okay.

194
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,220
Aren't you bored?

195
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,770
No.

196
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:14,140
Seeing you going in and out, I'm actually quite comfortable to be sitting here and working.

197
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,820
But you being like this will affect my work.

198
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,220
I'm affecting you?

199
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:23,630
I'm not stealing, robbing, singing, or bothering anyone's sleep.

200
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:26,060
How am I affecting you?

201
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:33,920
Do you think we have some sort of relationship, so that's why I'm affecting you?

202
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,800
- Okay, you just continue.
- Hey!

203
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,770
I'm been working here for a while now and drank a lot of coffee.

204
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:45,150
I'm a bit hungry now. Let's have dinner together later.

205
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,060
But my work hasn't ended yet.

206
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:51,100
Just treat it as friends having dinner together. It's nothing much, right?

207
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,380
This is not what you give a stray cat, is it?

208
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,560
If you don't want to eat it, just throw it away.

209
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,630
I'll eat it! I'm eating it now. I'll eat all of it.

210
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,980
[Chez M. Huang]

211
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,600
Who is he? He looks a bit familiar.

212
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,420
Has he been here before?

213
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,360
He is not harassing you, is he?

214
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,890
No, no! Boss, I can just leave through the backdoor.

215
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,850
But I'll have to trouble you to lock the door today.

216
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,280
I'm leaving now! Bye-bye!

217
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,480
Hey, hey, hey!

218
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,380
Mo Fei!

219
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,480
Cute!

220
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:40,820
Hi. W-Why are you here?

221
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,540
I was worried about you, so I came to see you.

222
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,940
Thank you. Have you been here long?

223
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,930
Not really. It hasn't been an hour yet.

224
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:56,350
Sorry for making you wait so long. I didn't know you would come.

225
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,360
It's okay.

226
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,350
Actually, I came today because I wanted to discuss with you

227
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,620
about the last time at the airport.

228
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,890
Weren't you unsure of some things?

229
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,820
Airport? That's so long ago.

230
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,970
Is your injury better now?

231
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,260
Why are you interrupting?

232
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,350
I-I'm not interrupting. I just feel that

233
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,890
since you got hurt because of me,

234
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,180
I'm quite guilty. I'm sorry.

235
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,780
You are quite distant from me now.

236
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,420
A-Am I?

237
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,290
Are you not?

238
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,720
Mo Fei, didn't we agree that I'd pick you up from work?

239
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,320
Why didn't you wait for me?

240
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,110
Say, I was so worried that you were alone. You are so mischievous.

241
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:54,190
I didn't find her at Boss Huang's place, so I worried the whole way here.

242
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,520
What nonsense are you saying?

243
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,590
I know that you pamper me and even made egg rolls for me. They were especially delicious.

244
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,360
Have you eaten them before?

245
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,990
That's for stray dogs!

246
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,370
I particularly like an adorable girl like her.

247
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,150
You are quite adorable yourself.

248
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,870
Say, how old are you already?

249
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,310
Why do you still forget things?

250
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:52,030
Thank you. I am just afraid.

251
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,890
Wait here for me then. I'll go get it for you.

252
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,140
Be careful.

253
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Your schoolbag. There's also a bag.

254
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
What is it? It's quite heavy.

255
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,550
What is it? Let me see.

256
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,000
Zhang satin!

257
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,600
Mo Fei, you're so rich.

258
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,600
You're able to afford Zhang satin.

259
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,000
It's so heavy.

260
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,400
Cheng Yang also used this material before.

261
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,000
I accidentally ruined a patch, and he was mad at me for a whole week.

262
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,300
I didn't know you were rich. You bought so much.

263
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,400
What are you going to make with it?

264
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,300
It's not mine.

265
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,400
Not yours? Then, why was it placed with your bag?

266
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,000
This is...

267
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,600
President Tang!

268
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,000
President Tang gifted this to you. He came a long while back to wait for you.

269
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,700
I saw him carrying this bag.

270
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,200
Say, what did you two do out there?

271
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,200
What else can we do in broad daylight?

272
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,400
What is there you can't do?

273
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,200
I'll give it back to him tomorrow.

274
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,800
Why give it back to him?

275
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,000
Mo Fei, don't do stupid things.

276
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,200
Xueling.

277
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,800
Mingxuan, are you resting?

278
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,900
I'm about to. What's the matter?

279
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,000
Did things go well today?

280
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,700
I still haven't seen Miya.

281
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,200
So I may return a few days later than planned.

282
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,800
See? I told you I should have gone with you.

283
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,300
If I were there, I would definitely be able to help you.

284
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,000
By the way,

285
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,600
how are things progressing with the new embroidery workshop?

286
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,400
Don't worry about the company. I'm here.

287
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,000
Let's not talk about work.

288
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,400
What did you do tonight?

289
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,800
Xueling.

290
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,400
Yes?

291
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,900
Nevermind.

292
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,200
When I return to Shanghai, I will find time to have a good chat with you.

293
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,400
What's the matter? So mysterious.

294
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,200
Nothing. Are you about to go to work?

295
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,200
Yes, I'm going to work soon.

296
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,400
All right, you get some rest. I'll be waiting for you to come back.

297
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,500
Okay, bye-bye.

298
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,200
Xueling? Xueling, time to eat!

299
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,400
Mom, what did you say?

300
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,200
What are you thinking about? I was calling you to go eat breakfast.

301
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,200
I was on the phone with Mingxuan just now.

302
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,400
He wants to talk to me when he gets back.

303
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,800
This Mingxuan is such a slowpoke.

304
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,200
He should have asked you long ago. We adults have been anxiously waiting.

305
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,200
That's a good thing. Why do you seem unhappy?

306
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,400
Mom, I know Mingxuan very well.

307
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,500
That's definitely not what he wants to talk about.

308
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:02,400
I feel like his tone... In any case, it was a bit strange.

309
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,300
What else can it be then?

310
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:09,000
You're probably overthinking. Isn't he in Paris now?

311
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,600
Is there something wrong with work?

312
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,000
He would have told me directly if it was work-related.

313
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,500
If it's not work, what can it be?

314
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,000
Foreign women are very free-spirited.

315
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,200
Is it possible that he met some girl in Paris?

316
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,400
Mo Fei?

317
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,200
Mo Fei? Who's that?

318
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,800
A designer we worked with before.

319
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,200
She should be in Paris now, too.

320
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,600
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

321
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,800
Could it be that she's been pestering Mingxuan since they were here in the country?

322
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,000
Did you not notice anything?

323
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,200
Let's not make blind guesses.

324
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,400
Let's wait until Mingxuan returns.

325
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,000
You can't just wait around like this.

326
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,500
Mom, you can't ask Auntie Lu about this.

327
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,400
Why would I ask her? What would I talk about Mingxuan with his mother?

328
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,700
I'm going to work then.

329
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,710
- Have some breakfast.
- Okay.

330
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,200
What's Mingxuan up to?

331
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,800
Hello, Sir.

332
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,500
Thank you.

333
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,800
Xiao! I'm very happy to see you again.

334
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,600
Enough, enough. Let's not be so pretentious.

335
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,800
If you didn't see my design, would you have asked me to return to the French headquarters?

336
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,000
You are wrong. You are completely wrong.

337
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
You've had great pressure these past two years.

338
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,200
I'm giving you time to relax right now.

339
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,000
You need to go seek inspiration.

340
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,300
Look! Haven't you started anew again?

341
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,900
Ansel, say, you are French.

342
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,400
Since when do you know how to do Chinese wordplay?

343
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,200
As long as you can produce good work,

344
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,000
I accept any criticism.

345
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:52,300
By the way, with regards to the joint names,

346
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:56,000
the superiors are fine with it, but I don't quite understand.

347
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,600
Why do you insist on putting the name of someone who is completely unknown

348
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,600
and can't even be called a designer?

349
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,100
Enjoy.

350
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,200
Well…

351
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,670
First, she's a very talented

352
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:15,200
Chinoiserie designer.

353
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,200
She is also the one who inspired me.

354
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,400
Second, I like her a lot.

355
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,900
It's indeed a great way to show your love.

356
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,200
So I think this is an important move.

357
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,200
Move? Do you know how to play chess?

358
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,600
I have heard that Chinese chess is very interesting.

359
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:43,800
Of course. The most important thing in chess is the formation.

360
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:48,000
It's easier to win by planning it step by step.

361
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,200
I'm playing a very interesting game of chess right now.

362
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,400
Towards my opponent, I'm about to...

363
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,000
kill in an undetectable way.

364
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,600
Yes, yes, yes! Of course.

365
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,600
Look. This is

366
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,400
the schedule for the launch conference.

367
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:18,400
This is the information on all the designers.

368
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,400
You can pick your team.

369
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,000
Okay.

370
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,800
- Let me see it.
- Okay.

371
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,100
Who's being noisy this early in the morning?

372
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,800
Mo Fei! Mo Fei, wake up!

373
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,500
Duoduo, I'm begging you.

374
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,800
- I didn't sleep well last night.
- Fang Xiaoyu is here.

375
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,200
- What's he doing here?
- It's Fang Xiaoyu!

376
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,200
Fang Xiaoyu.

377
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,200
There's a big truck downstairs, filled with furniture.

378
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,200
I saw him moving into this building.

379
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,400
Moving here?

380
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,200
What's the situation? Why would he move here?

381
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,600
President Tang gifted you fabric just yesterday

382
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,400
and Fang Xiaoyu moves in here today.

383
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,800
It really costs a lot to pursue a girl these days.

384
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,000
Look, look.

385
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,700
I don't see him.

386
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,600
He's already moved in. He must have.

387
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,600
I'm very sure.

388
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,600
Mo Fei, it's so romantic.

389
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,100
- My goodness.
- I'll go take a look.

390
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,000
Mo Fei. Mo Fei!

391
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,800
Did you just wake up? You didn't wash your face or brush your teeth yet, right?

392
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,800
What are you doing here?

393
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,200
It's obvious. I'm moving.

394
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,200
You're moving next door to me?

395
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,200
Yes.

396
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,400
Oh, right! We will be neighbors from now on. Let's get reacquainted.

397
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,200
There are so many houses in Paris, why did you have to move next door to me?

398
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,600
It happens to be vacant, so I rented it.

399
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,000
It's really you, Fang Xiaoyu. Are you moving next door to us?

400
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,100
Am I welcome?

401
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,400
Of course. We all welcome you very much.

402
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,800
Leave out the "we."

403
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,300
Mo Fei, that's not right of you.

404
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,400
We are all friends here, how could you upset the harmony?

405
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,400
From now on, I'm not friends with him anymore.

406
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,800
Perfect. Since we're not friends anymore,

407
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,000
where I live has nothing to do with you. Right?

408
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,200
- Wait…
- That does seem reasonable.

409
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,800
Right?

410
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,000
Do you need help?

411
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I don't dare let you help. Cheng Yang will scold me.

412
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,600
- Then, come visit when you have time!
- Okay!

413
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,100
Bye-bye.

414
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,600
Is our calm girl angry,

415
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,200
or is the balance inside your heart wavering non-stop?

416
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,400
Will you really not consider Fang Xiaoyu?

417
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,800
It's impossible between me and Fang Xiaoyu.

418
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,110
I just really dislike how he's endlessly pestering me like this.

419
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,400
Liking someone shouldn't be like this.

420
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,200
What should it be like then?

421
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,950
Very quickly, I've come to

422
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:59,500
to know this flower better.

423
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,600
On the little prince's planet,

424
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,900
there have only been very simple flowers that grew. They had only...

425
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,700
When you like someone, you'll quietly treat that person well

426
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:14,200
and be devoted to that person. As long as that person is well,

427
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,200
there is no need for any repayment.

428
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,600
It's fine even if he is with someone else in the end.

429
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,900
Why does this sound like you are referring to someone in particular?

430
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:32,400
I'm not going to explain to you! Even if I explain it to you, it can't be clearly explained.

431
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,400
Say, if you choose Fang Xiaoyu,

432
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,400
what will President Tang do?

433
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,300
This is such a difficult choice.

434
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,800
Hello.

435
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,500
Beauty, where is Mo Fei?

436
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:59,000
Mo Fei! We'll be neighbors from now on!

437
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,200
Fang Xiaoyu is talking to you.

438
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,200
Naughty.

439
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,100
Brother Xuan, according to the original itinerary, we should be leaving today.

440
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,400
There is a whole bunch of stuff for you to deal with in the company.

441
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,220
President Wu has a contract.

442
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,200
Also, Director Xia has a design drawing that is waiting for you to see.

443
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,000
How are things with Master Li?

444
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,600
There is actually nothing much with Master Li.

445
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,000
It's just that the new embroidery hall is built and waiting for you to cut the ribbon.

446
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,200
Let's do this.

447
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,800
Help me change my flight to the latest one tonight.

448
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,500
Why?

449
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,100
Are you still waiting for my little Mo Fei?

450
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
She has already gone to school.

451
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,200
Didn't she tell you? I'm living next door to her now.

452
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,400
What is it, Tang Mingxuan? Lost your temper?

453
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,000
Fang Xiaoyu, have you gone crazy?

454
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,800
I told you to stop this.

455
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,600
Stop?

456
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,400
What right do you have to warn me?

457
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,400
Just come after me.

458
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,500
What are you trying to do to Mo Fei?

459
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,200
You speak so easily.

460
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,800
Have you forgotten that my sister has been missing for three years without a trace?

461
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:24,000
Or have you forgotten that she used to follow you and call you "Brother Mingxuan"?

462
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,800
You've forgotten how many tears she shed for you, right?

463
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,800
What have you been doing for the past three years? I'm asking you, what have you been doing?

464
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,000
I've been looking for her all these years.

465
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,600
Then find her!

466
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,200
Give me back my sister.

467
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,800
She has always been weak and sickly since she was young.

468
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,400
I have no idea what kind of life she is living now.

469
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,800
I feel sick and worried when I think about it.

470
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,800
Have you thought of her?

471
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,800
You are her Brother Mingxuan! I'm asking you, have you thought of her?

472
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,100
Xiaoyu, when I find Fang Qian, I will give her an explanation.

473
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,400
But if you are a man,

474
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,400
don't take it out on a girl.

475
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,600
Don't mention Mo Fei to me now.

476
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,000
Each day that my sister is missing,

477
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,400
is another day when you will be my enemy.

478
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,400
Remember. You remember that!

479
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,400
You are my enemy forever.

480
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Do you have any energy?

481
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,800
Head up!

482
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,800
Where's the chest? Shoulders back.

483
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,100
Come on. Tuck the chin in.

484
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,000
Rhythm. I don't hear any rhythm.

485
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Where is the rhythm? Lu Zhu, how many times do I have to say it?

486
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,800
Come on, do it again.

487
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,400
Walk.

488
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,200
Lu Zhu, please use your own imagination.

489
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,760
Modeling is also a form of performance.

490
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,400
At least imagine how you...

491
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,600
- What's the matter?
- I can't. I really can't do this anymore, Teacher.

492
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,600
I've been eating only boiled plain vegetables the last few days.

493
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:40,000
My body really can't handle it anymore. Can you please let me rest a little?

494
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,600
What are you doing? Who told you to help her?

495
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,200
Get up by yourself. Hurry up!

496
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,600
Hurry and get up.

497
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,400
The Fashion Expo will start soon.

498
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,200
I dragged Mo Fan here to practice with you!

499
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,400
What other requests do you have?

500
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,200
I think of you as a good piece of steel

501
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,400
but you insist on being a pile of mud on the ground. Right?

502
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,600
If you can't handle this little hardship, you should hurry home and lie down.

503
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,600
Don't lie on the runway and block other people's path.

504
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,000
Lu Zhu, get up first.

505
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,100
All right, continue.

506
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,000
Not bad. A little better than earlier.

507
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,300
Come on, walk back.

508
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,000
Let's go! Let's celebrate.

509
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,500
Celebrate? Celebrate that I got scolded?

510
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,800
Celebrate that you've... improved. It's my treat.

511
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,300
Eat...

512
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,770
I can't eat.

513
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:04,100
Teacher Linda wants me to lose more weight.

514
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,000
If you don't eat, how will you have the strength to lose weight?

515
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,400
What do I do then?

516
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,000
I don't even dare to drink water, not to mention food.

517
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Don't worry. I've got an idea.

518
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,400
What idea? What are you doing?

519
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,800
Come on up.

520
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,000
Do you want to carry me on your back?

521
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,200
I said I'll treat you to a meal, so I must certainly escort you there.

522
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,800
You said so yourself.

523
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,400
You have to carry me all the way there.

524
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,400
You should lose weight.

525
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,800
You said you'll carry me.

526
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:02,400
♫ I say you're an April day ♫

527
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,400
♫ The sound of your laughter lights everything up ♫

528
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,000
♫ Even the spirit of a light breeze ♫

529
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,000
♫ In the midst of the brightness and beauty of spring,
shift as one would in a dance ♫

530
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,200
♫ You're the mist on a dry April day ♫

531
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,600
♫ The gentle breeze blown during dusk ♫

532
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,200
♫ The unintentional sparkle of the planetesimal ♫

533
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:35,200
♫ The fine rain that's sprinkled in front of the flower ♫

534
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:40,000
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

535
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,800
♫ Like a shy water lotus that bows to a cool breeze ♫

536
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,600
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

537
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:54,400
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫

538
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,200
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

539
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:06,900
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫

540
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:19,000
♫ You're like the ivory field after snowflakes ♫

541
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,400
♫ You're the round moon every night ♫

542
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,000
♫ You're the naïve ♫

543
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,000
♫ white lotus that floats on the water ripples of your dream ♫

544
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:38,600
♫ You're the flower blossoms of tree after tree ♫

545
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:43,000
♫ The swallow twittering within the beams ♫

546
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,200
♫ You are love, hope, and warmth ♫

547
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,000
♫ You're an April day ♫

548
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,800
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

549
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:00,800
♫ The bittersweet parting words of "take care" ♫

550
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,300
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

551
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:13,000
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫
