The prince met a fox.

4
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,240
The fox said to the prince,

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,860
"Good morning!"

6
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,980
But when the prince looked back, he didn't see anything.

7
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,480
The fox said "I am here!"

8
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,860
"I am under the apple tree!"

I dreamed of a girl just now.

12
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,030
She was telling me a story.

13
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,900
Do you know her?

represents.

17
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,400
It can only represent a situation that can bring you

18
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,820
the most ease so far.

19

Are you still having fitful sleep and insomnia lately?

It's still the same.

You still have to keep taking Lexapro. I'll prescribe more to you. (Lexapro a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used to treat anxiety in adults and major depressive disorder)

Hello, President Tang.

34
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:21,180
In such a big, bustling city, is there a place that truly belongs to you?

35
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,220
In the era of meeting and parting hastily,

36
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,160
is there someone you want to work hard for?

If there is, that's your fortune.

Then there isn't.

Let me tell you guys.

41
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,860
Even if your father is extremely wealthy,

42
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,660
it's impossible for your life to be perfect.

43
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,050
Only through your own unyielding hard work

44
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,220
can you live the life you want

I'll go found out what swimming in the Seine-et-Marne River is like.

50
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,390
Then I will make a bonfire by the river

Thank you all for coming here to watch our product launch press conference.

77

Let me give a simple introduction.

78
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,910
Mingyuan Group was founded by my father, Mr. Tang Qiren.

79
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,100
I remember that when I was young,

80
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,800
my family manufactured the simplest clothing.

81
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,900
In the blink of an eye, thirty years have passed.

82
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,940
Mingyuan Group's structure

83
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,550
has gone through a huge change now.

84
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,300
Within these past thirty years,

85
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,700
through the hard work of generations of people at Mingyuan,

86
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,910
our designs, development,

87
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,560
production, and sales

88
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,790
have already reached our domestic industry's

89
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,180
highest standards.

90
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:55,030
Of course, great numbers are important.

91
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,760
But what our Mingyuan wants to do

92
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,770
is Chinoiserie with true ethnic origin,

93
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:06,580
so we can truly service our consumers. To have our designs

94
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:10,150
become a cultural phenomenon. To have our designs

95
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,520
carry Chinese culture forward.

The main theme of our design this time is the red-crowned crane.

109
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,270
It represents an unswerving and loyal love.

110

Their designs are really nice.

117
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,230
But I feel like there isn't anything special.

118
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:23,260
But the red-crowned cane on this embroidery

119
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,030
uses two different techniques: Su embroidery and drawnwork.

120
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,820
I indeed never thought of that.

121
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,060
Everywhere you go, you're learning. My gosh.

122
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,570
But I don't really like Xia Xueling's designs.

123
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,430
I think her designs are all too superficial.

124
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:40,630
Besides, she used a topic related to love just for publicity gimmicks.

125
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,900
Think about it. If a bird can represent some kind of everlasting love,

126
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,240
then didn't Liang Shanbo and Zhu Zhu Yingtai die in vain? Am I right? (T/N:Chinese legend called the Butterfly Lovers in which a tragic love story happens)

132
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,050
I wasn't targeting you.

133
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,240
For example? Go ahead and tell me.

134
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,600
I'll say it then?

135
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,120
I think that if organza is used,
 (T/N: Organza is a sheer fabric traditionally made from silk)

136
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,080
the whole attire would look even more magical.

137
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,710
So you are a designer?

138
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,140
No, I major in fashion design.

139
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,290
So, I'm technically not a designer yet.

140
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:30,850
I'm truly sorry for my offense just now.

141
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:34,040
Hello, Teacher Xia. Please come this way for an interview.

142
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,150
- Sure.
- This is my notebook.

143
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:52,660
Your notes are quite detailed.

144
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,950
Don't tell me you want to plagiarize, right?

145
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,800
You've misunderstood. I just major in fashion design.

146
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,500
I want to record some stuff only. That's all. I don't intend to plagiarize.

147
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,760
We've already registered a trademark for this red-crowned crane. It has a patent on it.

148
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,220
Did you know that plagiarism is the greatest insult to the original creator?

149
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:18,170
You have a trademark for this red-crowned crane logo, but have you trademarked the red-crowned crane itself?

150
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:22,700
Besides, I've already told you. I'm not plagiarizing. I'm just recording it.

151
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,380
Okay, I'll return it to you.

152
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,540
What's the use of giving it to me? You've already remembered it in your heart.

153
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,710
- Then, what do you want?
- Give it back to you.

154
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,470
Say, didn't you have a press conference to let others see your work?

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,460
I'm exhausted. Slow down! Slow down! I can't run anymore.

162
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,690
I was almost scared to death just now.

163
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:08,180
We didn't even do anything wrong. Why were you so scared?

164
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,810
- You even made me drop my sketchbook!
- Sketchbook?

165
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:14,390
Yeah! I think that Tang guy picked it up.

166
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,900
Sorry, sorry! I really didn't notice.

167
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,380
This won't do. I have to go find that cold-faced guy and get my book back.

168
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,810
Do you really have to go now?

169
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,300
How about later? After his interview is over, I'll go with you.

170
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,760
But that book is really important.

171
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,530
It's fine. I'll buy you tea and then go with you later.

172
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,440
- No—
- Let's go. Let's go.

173
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,140
Isn't Mingxuan going to come down to eat?

174
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,630
The press conference just finished. He still has some documents to organize.

175
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,320
I'm guessing he'll be busy for some time.

176
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,400
Later, I'll have Nanny Wu reheat the food and bring it to him upstairs.

177
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,140
Let's not wait for him. We'll eat first.

178
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,790
- Xueling, help yourself.
- All right.

179
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,000
Hasn't the press conference ended already?

180
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,940
Besides, Xueling came today.

181
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,750
I was even happily looking forward to

182
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,180
our entire family finally having dinner together.

183
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,960
He's the president, after all.

184
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,940
He is busier than us and has a lot to take care of.

185
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,670
It's okay. We can eat together next time.

186
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,300
But I don't really like Xia Xueling's designs.

187
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,050
I think her designs are all too superficial.

188
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:39,380
I think that if organza is used

189
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,420
the whole attire would look even more magical.

190
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,800
[Design is missing something.]

191
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,270
[The design is very unique.]

192
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:36,330
Picture. Take a picture. (in French)

193
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:39,270
Picture.

194
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:46,040
Is there a charge for the entry? (in French)

[Fly to this Little Corner]

(T/N: her name Fei sounds the same as the word for "fly")

196
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:02,070
Hello? Hello? Hello?

197
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,350
Hello, everyone! Welcome to

198
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,850
"Fly to this Little Corner."

199
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:10,880
I am your beloved Little Fei Fei.

200
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,430
Even though it's already very late today,

201
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,560
I can't help myself but vent a little.

202
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,930
Say, can all the accounts on the various websites be unified?

203
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,670
The username for each website is different.

204
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,570
Also, the password requirements are entirely different.

205
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,140
Besides, it is already very hard to remember one, to begin with.

206
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,460
To every website's boss,

207
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,220
can we consider some kind of collaboration?

208
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,160
This way, we can use one account for everything.

209
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,280
So even if you forget your password, it's fine.

210
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,570
Then you don't have to be like me, so pitiful.

211
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,360
I wrote down everything in that sketchbook.

212
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,410
But my book was taken away by someone else.

213
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:48,670
I can't even get it back.

214
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,190
I've decided.

215
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,810
Tomorrow, I'm going to Mingyuan

216
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:59,650
to get my book back.

217
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,220
Sorry, you don't have an appointment with President Tang so you can't go in.

218
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,960
B-But he knows me.

219
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,710
I asked President Tang's secretary and he said that he doesn't know you.

220
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,700
How is that possible? He took something very important to me.

221
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,460
Hello? Hello, this is the front desk.

222
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,310
Let me look for it.

223
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,510
Miss, you can't go in!

224
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,060
Security!

225
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,670
We remember your face so don't cause trouble, okay?

226
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,280
Leave.

227
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,350
Fine.

228
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,260
- Come in.
- Brother Xuan.

229
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,930
This is done. Where should I put it?

230
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,460
Put it there.

231
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,810
Oh, right.
 [It's because you've wasted time on your rose so it seems that your rose has become so important.]

232
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:06,250
Is that little girl... still downstairs?

233
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,540
She is. She still won't leave even when the security asked her to.

234
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:13,480
I've never seen someone so relentless.

235
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,510
No... stubborn and unyielding miss.

236
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,280
Do I let her in?

237
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,140
Let me ask you something.

00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,120
What is this Ximalaya?

It's an app.

240
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,360
What does it do?

241
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,960

I went to get my own stuff back yet they chased me out!

256
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,320
They even say that they're an enterprise that understands the spirit of traditions the most.

257
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,750
Do you really understand the spirit of traditions?

258
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,550
Do you understand the benevolence, justice, etiquette, wisdom, and trust that our ancestors spoke about?!

259
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,720
Do you understand our ancestors' saying of "not pocketing money that you picked up"?!

260
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,000
You don't understand anything! You're just a trash enterprise!

00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,360
I just got another fan.

267
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,950
There are people who listen to your rants from that ancient platform?

268
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,850
What do you even know? This is called "a faithful friend is hard to come by."

269
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,510
Being your fan,

270
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,090
listening to you complain all day must be boring.

271
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:43,020
Don't talk about my fans! I now have the means to spoil my fans.

As for you, stop training!

Cayman Agent Company is recruiting model trainees.

277
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,770
Mom definitely won't agree.

278
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,210
Everyone's way of living is not the same.

279
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:03,230
In any case, once I've passed auditions and become famous, she will have no choice but to agree to it.

280
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:07,390
Think about it. If I become a world-famous model,

281
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,700
I will pay your tuition for when you go study abroad in France.

282

Really?

283
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,400
No, these are two different things.

284
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,200
We can't do that.

285
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,330
Sis, can you not tell Mom for now?

286
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,410
Just let me try once. All right?

287
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:24,500
Didn't you say I was blessed by the heavens to fit in any clothes I wear?

288
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,360
I did say that, but I can't let you do that!

289
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,010
I'm begging you, Sis.

290
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:35,100
Think about it! I will become a world-famous model

291
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,360
and you will become a master fashion designer.

292
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,440
I will wear the clothes you design for a runway show.

293
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,940
Won't our mom be overwhelmed with beauty as she watches from below the stage?

294
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,210
No, our mom will beat you

to death backstage.

I don't care! I have already registered for it anyway.

298

00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:14,510
Look. The whole neckline needs to be tightened. That will look more fashionable.

475
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,250
The rest is fine.

476
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:19,260
Mo Fei, you're here?

477
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:24,200
Why did you borrow so many embroidery books?

478
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,460
I accepted a tea ceremony attire job.

479
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:29,470
I want to embroider some auspicious cloud patterns

480
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:33,660
to go with its primary lotus design.

481
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,880
Like Chinoiserie?

482
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:41,030
I don't want to casually print the pattern from the books on there.

483
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,340
Then work here.

484
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:48,100
You can use all the equipment here.

485
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,130
Thank you, Teacher Pan Su.

486
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:53,540
However, it's been a bit busy here so I need you to help me do some alterations.

487
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:57,300
Okay. There's no rush for this tea ceremony attire anyway.

488
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,710
An evening gown.

489
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,700
No problem, right?

490
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:15,460
I'm thinking... if...

491
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,680
Teacher, take a look. Is this alteration okay?

492
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,810
The client commissioned this to use for a charity banquet.

493
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:41,660
If we do this.... would it be too conservative?

494
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:46,560
I don't think so because of the fabric chosen. If indistinctive yarn is chosen,

495
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,580
it will look better.

496
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:52,820
All right. I believe in your judgment.

497
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:58,820
Mo Fei! I guessed that you would be here at Teacher Pan's.

498
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:03,590
Shen Jiaxi? Aren't you supposed to be at school preparing your graduation piece?

499
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:09,270
Didn't I... come here now... to work on my graduation piece?

500
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:13,500
I say you two treat this place as your own work studio now.

501
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,910
Teacher Pan, you're the kindest. How about this?

502
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:21,020
Once Mo Fei and I graduate, we'll come here to help you.

503
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:24,320
You better be able to graduate this time.
