[Episode 19]

3
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,400
By the way, during the competition

4
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,400
weren't you close to Mo Fei?

5
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,300
We are college classmates.

6
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,600
How is she doing in France?

7
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,800
How did you know she was in France?

8
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,400
Her going to France is not a secret,

9
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,500
is it unusual for me to know?

10
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,400
She is doing just fine.

11
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,600
She called me the other day and told me she was super busy.

12
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,600
You should pay more care to her.

13
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,400
It's not my turn to do so.

14
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,390
I heard that Director Fang from Cayman is in France, too.

15
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,500
He has been taking care of her.

16
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,400
They were together when she called me.

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,400
So, are they dating?

18
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,700
I wouldn't know about it.

19
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,200
She never tells me about her love life.

20
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,200
It wouldn't be so surprising if she were dating Fang Xiaoyu.

21
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,400
That's what young people do nowadays.

22
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,000
They switch the new one once they realize the current one is not a fit.

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,200
However,

24
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,800
it's a pity to waste her precious time on her love life

25
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,100
when she is studying abroad.

26
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,200
That's why I hope

27
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,600
you won't let your personal life get into your work. Do you understand?

28
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,300
Of course! I won't let it happen.

29
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,800
I am not dating anyone now.

30
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,600
Even if I were, I wouldn't let it get into my work.

31
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,400
That's right!

32
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,200
Remember, it's all about quality at work.

33
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,200
You must put your job first in all circumstances.

34
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,400
Shen Jiaxi is somewhat talented.

35
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,900
She is also motivated.

36
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,600
But be careful, she is too ambitious.

37
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,100
Got it. Don't worry, I know why she is useful.

38
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,600
You don't think I did this because of Mingxuan, do you?

39
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,400
You are my senior. I know you well enough.

40
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,600
You talk too much.

41
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,880
I just think it's not worth it, you know?

42
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,800
I would fire you for sure if we weren't friends.

43
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,200
No way, Sis.

44
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,000
You wouldn't be this heartless. We are friends.

45
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,600
I am just worried about you.

46
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,400
Right, how is that new guy, Lin Xiang, doing?

47
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,000
He has been pretty good in our meetings.

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,200
It wasn't easy for you to get someone like this from Haiyao.

49
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,600
Of course. I have been laying my eyes on him for a long time.

50
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,000
Zhu Haitian didn't know how to utilize him.

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It would be a waste of talent for him to stay there.

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,400
But after all, he is a local designer.

53
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,400
He would be relatively conservative and not edgy enough

54
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,800
in terms of creativity.

55
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,200
Did Director Tang find anyone in France?

56
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,400
I heard that it's not going well. He is still trying.

57
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,900
Usually for those designers who study abroad,

58
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,200
they are talented and very likely to become the assistants of art masters.

59
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,200
They can establish their own brands after a few years.

60
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,400
But it's not easy for them to make the decision and go back.

61
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,600
This industry is way too competitive.

62
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,400
- It takes a long time to make changes.
- Exactly.

63
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,200
But, at least, we are still making original products.

64
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,600
Wow, you look so great today.

65
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,400
Of course, it's shooting day.

66
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,700
You look great every day.

67
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,000
I heard from Liu Rui that

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,600
you have prepared a set of stunning jewelry for me.

69
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,200
It's not just stunning. It's expensive.

70
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,200
My mom bought it from an auction in Switzerland.

71
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,800
It took me forever to borrow it from my mom.

72
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,600
Oh, so it's your mom's jewelry.

73
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,200
You are family. There's no such thing as borrow. Let me see!

74
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,700
You will see it later anyway.

75
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,600
I want it now, Haitian.

76
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,200
- You're so annoying!
- Let me see.

77
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,600
All right, all right. I'll show you.

78
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,000
- Don't sneak a peek.
- I'm not looking!

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,650
It's the company's safe.

80
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,400
Wow, it's fabulous.

81
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,400
Don't touch it. My mom won't forgive me if you break it.

82
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,800
Got it.

83
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,000
See?

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,300
- Is it fabulous?
- Yes.

85
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,100
My mom said this is for her future daughter-in-law.

86
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,000
Oh? Isn't that me?

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,300
Did I say I was marrying you?

88
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,000
Yes?

89
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,400
Are you stupid?

90
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,700
We have confirmed this.

91
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,670
All right, wait for me.

92
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,100
I'm going to check on the drawings.

93
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,000
Put it down. Don't break it.

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,100
I will be back in a minute.

95
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,000
This is so pretty.

96
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,100
Xiaoman, the shooting set is ready.

97
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,700
Liu Rui, can you take a photo of me and post it?

98
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,000
Hurry.

99
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,200
What am I posting?

100
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,700
Just write...

101
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,800
I am so jealous of Xiaoman.

102
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,600
That's it. Nothing more.

103
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,300
If anyone asks you, don't reply. Make it look natural.

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,200
Is this okay?

105
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Yes!

106
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,780
I got a comment, Xiaoman.

107
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,600
They think you are engaged.

108
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,300
Let me see.

109
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,440
They are not dumb. They should think that way.

110
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,200
This Mo Fei,

111
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,000
how do you know her?

112
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We connected during Mingyuan's competition.

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,300
She has gone to France.

114
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,400
She is studying at ECSCP.

115
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,800
Her pics looked so great. France is such a romantic place.

116
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,000
I want to go, too.

117
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,200
Does it look good?

118
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,900
Liu Rui, be careful.

119
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,800
After I walk you to the set,

120
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,000
I am going out for work. There are many things to do.

121
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,400
Why?

122
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,400
Are you making up excuses so that you don't have to stay with me?

123
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,400
What are you talking about?

124
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,300
I am looking for designers lately. It's driving me crazy.

125
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,200
Things are not going well at Director Yang's end?

126
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,800
No.

127
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,470
What about Paris?

128
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,800
It's a top city in the designer world.

129
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,000
He can go to Paris to find one.

130
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,800
He couldn't even take care of Milan.

131
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,000
I can give it a try.

132
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,200
You?

133
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,400
I am your personal assistant now.

134
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,000
Not to mention that I have connections in Paris.

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,200
You have connections in Paris, for real?

136
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,400
Yes.

137
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,400
I will have them to ask around.

138
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,700
Once we find the right candidate, the board will no longer give you a hard time.

139
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,600
Look at our Xiaoman.

140
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,200
She's got connections in Paris.

141
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,800
Listen... If you can pull this off,

142
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,000
you will be doing a huge favor for the company.

143
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,800
Rest assured, I got this.

144
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,200
Once it's done,

145
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,600
this will be yours.

146
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,200
- Promise?
- Of course!

147
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Good luck with your shooting.

148
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,600
Got it.

149
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Lower your head, please.

150
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,200
Okay.

151
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,400
Nice.

152
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,100
Lower the reflector. Let's do a body shot.

153
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,200
Thank you.

154
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,940
Let's take a rest, everybody.

155
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,800
Thanks.

156
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,100
Liu Rui, what's up with this model?

157
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,400
Why is she such a queen?

158
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,200
She is the future Ms. Haiyao.

159
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,200
Really? No wonder she is so arrogant.

160
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,200
Director Zhu treats her so nicely.

161
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,200
All these are just for her.

162
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,100
Really?

163
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,000
Liu Rui?

164
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,050
What are you two chatting about?

165
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,310
Nothing much. He's just asking about you and President Zhu.

166
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,150
Oh.

167
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:04,710
Sister Xiaoman, are you almost going to get married to President Zhu?

168
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,780
I think it'll be soon.

169
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,230
That's great! I'll be waiting for your wedding candies then.

170
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,930
Help me arrange my schedule to France.

171
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:17,760
Then tell me some more talented designers over there.

172
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,830
Okay.

173
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:23,130
Do it well. After it is done, I will give you a big red envelope.

174
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,910
Thank you, Sister Xiaoman.

175
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,690
Go and prepare my next outfit.

176
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,320
Why is there no yellow? I like yellow more.

177
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:50,260
The oriental elements you see right now on the clothes are from Vietnam.

178
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:54,940
So that's why the clothes from this collection are mainly white.

179
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,410
Such a shame.

180
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,380
If you want, you can consider another type of style.

181
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,530
Do you like this one?

182
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,280
What is this?

183
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,340
This may be a small purse.

184
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:24,490
A purse, so small.

185
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:29,120
- What can you put in there–
- This is a sachet. It will have a nice aroma.

186
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,480
It is a really romantic item. It is not a normal yellow.

187
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,680
It is Autumn Fragrance Yellow, which represents the season of autumn,

188
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,170
the look of the bright sun.

189
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:44,030
I want this one, the autumn fashion.

190
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,150
Thank you.

191
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,590
I have heard of your name. I have finally met you today.

192
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,460
I will introduce myself.

193
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,710
I am Tang Mingxuan of Mingyuan Fashion.

194
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,840
I didn't think I would meet you at the shopping counter.

195
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:24,250
I didn't want to miss a single chance

196
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,320
to see you.

197
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,000
Then, you are so sincere.

198
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,550
I have a good impression of you and your company,

199
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,690
but my answer is still the same.

200
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,200
Can I know what the reason is?

201
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:45,870
Doing business is not like making friends, being casual.

202
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:49,000
SLC is a business with a long history.

203
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,420
We value acquisition extremely important.

204
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,400
It is not only the problem with money.

205
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,430
I have to think about SLC's future.

206
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,550
But in the market environment currently, China is the

207
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,700
greatest market in the world.

208
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,670
Also, our Mingyuan has a very perfect sales relationship with all of China.

209
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,320
I believe our cooperation

210
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,480
can help SLC out of the current difficulty.

211
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,450
Of course, we are really interested in the Chinese market, but...

212
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,990
In the end, SLC is a French business.

213
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,080
We are more lenient towards working with Europe

214
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,490
because we have a more similar cultural value and management system.

215
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,910
So, Mingyuan Fashion is not our best choice.

216
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:33,100
So right now you are saying Mingyuan Fashion is a really strong opponent.

217
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,610
I cannot share anymore.

218
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,830
I understand.

219
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:41,750
But I hope our plan can be changed to a better direction.

220
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,190
It can help SLC more.

221
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,750
I hope you can give us another chance.

222
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,490
I am looking forward to the next time I see you.

223
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,960
Thank you.

224
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,010
Yes, Dad. Actually being able to see Mia was a lucky surprise.

225
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,610
But afterward, it was not too smooth.

226
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:03,190
If there is hope, then that is good.

227
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,340
Yes. We have an opponent.

228
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:09,070
It will only be meaningful if we win in the end.

229
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,800
Is it Cayman?

230
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,950
Mia won't tell us, but don't worry.

231
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:17,670
I will try to find out who the opponent is as soon as possible.

232
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:21,080
Okay. Stay safe.

233
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,680
Don't worry, Dad.

234
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,410
Then I'm hanging up.

235
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,320
You're at home?!

236
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,150
It is so hard! Let me tell you, I went to a lot of places today.

237
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:55,740
I am tired to death. I haven't eaten at all today. I'm going to quickly call for takeout.

238
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,170
Do you want to eat something?

239
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,700
No thank you, I have eaten already.

240
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,320
I will only order for myself. Don't eat mine later.

241
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,200
Order a pizza, pizza.

242
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,170
How about you get one for me?

243
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,140
Haven't you eaten already?

244
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,760
- Get it for him.
- Who?

245
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:23,350
Miss, why does it matter to you if he eats or not?

246
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,940
Do you really think he cannot manage his life?

247
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,800
He is just pretending to be pitiful.

248
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,850
He got hurt because of me.

249
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:35,460
Also, his hand isn't convenient. I'm thinking if I can help him, then it is help. Right?

250
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,780
Thanks.

251
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,790
Where's my book?

252
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,400
I put your book in the car.

253
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:03,660
Brother Xuan, are you... going on a date with Mo Fei?

254
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,960
Yeah.

255
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,040
From what I see in the dramas,

256
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:14,270
on dates, they get a flower or wine. Getting a book is too shabby.

257
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,220
What do you understand?

258
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:23,330
Let me tell you! My book is the original Le Petit Prince.

259
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:28,130
Really? But I still think it isn't too good.

260
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,990
What you think is not important. What is important is as long as Mo Fei likes it, it's fine.

261
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,480
Let's go.

262
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,030
Here?

263
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:46,140
I knew you didn't forget about me. I am starving to death.

264
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,260
Pizza?

265
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,980
How about I open it for you?

266
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,330
Sure.

267
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,570
I'll put it on the table.

268
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,170
Okay.

269
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,600
Right, Li Qi just sent me a message saying

270
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,270
Betty's matter is resolved.

271
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,070
Really? How was it resolved?

272
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,630
- Do you want to know?
- Yes.

273
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,720
Then feed me.

274
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,800
I am just kidding, jeez.

275
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,420
Li Qi's friend found the recording of a clothes shop.

276
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,200
It captured the whole process of them hitting.

277
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,670
So the police caught them.

278
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,980
That simple?

279
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,280
Then since I told you this, in return,

280
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,500
- could you help me with something?
- What?

281
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,270
Look at it for me.

282
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:55,460
I feel like there are too many tricks and not many new ideas.

283
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:07,950
Have you thought of using wax printing and Su Embroidery?

284
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:11,970
Oh my goodness! Why do you always use Chinese elements to solve everything?

285
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,770
Can you actually think thoroughly?

286
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,400
I have thought thoroughly and I also tried it myself.

287
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,800
The finished product is actually pretty good.

288
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,270
But using two elements at once, will it be too much?

289
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,030
After all, I am making a Western suit.

290
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,580
I think as long as you have a good grasp of the measurements, there won't be a big problem.

291
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:34,230
Before when I did homework, I used the same way to make a leaf.

292
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,410
Andre said then he couldn't believe

293
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,110
that the result of these two elements would be like this.

294
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,850
Everyone else also said the result was really good.

295
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,780
So it should be fine.

296
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,780
Also, right now, the most important thing

297
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,950
probably is the finishing touch and not the Chinese elements.

298
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,920
This way, your boss will also not think it is too odd.

299
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,480
Coming!

300
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,860
I was of taking a bath. Why did you lock the door?

301
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:42,590
Why did you take so long in bringing takeout next door?

302
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:45,710
President Tang, why are you here?

303
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,140
Where's Mo Fei?

304
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:51,930
She...

305
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,310
You have friends over. I also have to go back. I will help you open the door.

306
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,880
Sure, I can also eat this.

307
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,900
Mingxuan.

308
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,680
Don't misunderstand, I only came to deliver a pizza.

309
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,610
Mingxuan, we were eating pizza together.

310
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,540
Do you want to eat, too?

311
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,490
It's this late and you're eating pizza still?

312
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,380
No need, you guys eat.

313
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:47,800
Mingxuan! Let me explain!

314
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,310
- He is angry just like this?
- I said let go!
- Why go after him?

315
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,520
Your leg's better, right?

316
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,430
- No, I am just–
- Fang Xiaoyu, you are too much.

317
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:16,650
♫ You emotionlessly face me ♫

318
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:23,530
♫ and just let go like you said you would ♫

319
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:30,620
♫ You may be very sad ♫

320
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:37,470
♫ You may miss me very much ♫

321
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:42,290
♫ Congratulations, you've wrapped up the performance early  ♫

322
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:45,100
♫ A sequel for my tragic role ♫

323
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,410
♫ as a one-man show ♫

324
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,450
♫ was given all to me ♫

Mr. Tang left without saying much.

335
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,880
Are you guys having a fight again?

336
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,290
It's not his fault.

337
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:55,560
If I were him and I saw you coming out from Fang Xiaoyu's room,

338
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:00,090
I wouldn't just be mad, I would break up with you.

339
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,400
Is it that bad?

340
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,480
It's not about that, Mo Fei.

341
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,220
You must consider his feelings.

342
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,230
I did.

343
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:14,130
I was about to explain it to him.

344
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:16,940
But he left without even listening to me.

345
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,460
All right. Let me put it this way.

346
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,380
If Mr. Tang were in China,

347
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:27,260
and you wanted to

348
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,220
go back to China and surprise him.

349
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,240
And then you went back

350
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,600
and you saw him being with the woman he grew up with.

351
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,050
Would you be upset about it?

352
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,870
Fine. You are right.

353
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:45,980
I would be upset, too.

354
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,380
That's it.

355
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:54,120
Luckily, he is a gentleman.

356
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,730
If it were me, I would have hit Cheng Yang right away.

357
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,460
Mo Fei,

358
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,840
you did do wrong this time.

359
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,390
I am your cautionary tale.

360
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:11,870
Are you and Cheng Yang not getting back together at all?

361
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,390
Cheng Yang and I...

362
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:17,350
need a break.

363
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,800
I think we both need some space to cool down.

364
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,000
I am going to say this again.

365
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,250
You must consider his feelings.

366
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,730
Cherish the people around you.

368
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,070
Good evening.

369
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,650
I...

370
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,500
[Online: 1]

371
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:15,080
I read about a fun fact shared by a blogger.

372
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,290
He said that Killer Whales are very loving animals.

373
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:21,120
If they have a fight,

374
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,320
they will reconcile in 3 minutes.

375
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:28,850
If only people were like Killer Whales,

376
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:32,980
so that we could reconcile right after we fight.

377
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:39,510
It was my fault for what happened tonight.

378
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,960
Can we...

379
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:47,820
reconcile?

380
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,950
Please come in.

381
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,120
Hi, Mia.

382
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,100
Good to see you, Director Tang.

383
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,940
Welcome.

384
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,940
Welcome, please have a seat.

385
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:14,730
To be honest, our last meeting was only coincidental.

386
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:18,810
I didn't know much about Mingyuan Fashion at that time.

387
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:23,420
Afterward, I did some evaluation.

388
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:27,690
I am happy to see you support Su Embroidery.

389
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,800
This is only the first step of

390
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,800
our global strategy.

391
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,320
After this,

392
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,150
we will continue to support our Chinese traditional embroidery.

393
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,550
Personally, I would love to work with you.

394
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:46,450
So I submitted a detailed proposal to our board.

395
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:50,100
I emphasized the strength of Mingyuan Group.

396
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,290
- Thank you so much.
- No worries.

397
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:54,570
Based on my knowledge of SLC,

398
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:58,960
it has been adding a lot of Asian elements to its work.

399
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,820
But why are most of them Vietnamese styles?

400
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:06,250
Indeed, my grandfather has lived in Vietnam for a long time.

401
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:09,520
But now we are focusing on China.

402
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,920
We hope to...

403
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,990
present more Chinese elements.

404
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,690
For the past few years,

405
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:23,360
the Chinese fashion industry has been following the world's trends.

406
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,450
But now many companies

407
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:28,520
are establishing

408
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,910
their own styles and texture.

409
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,450
Just like what you did.

410
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:35,030
Yes, just like what we did.

411
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:38,750
However, the acquisition is a different matter.

412
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:43,030
I got to know your business model,

413
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:46,090
but it must go through our board.

414
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,740
Once we are on the same page,

415
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,260
we can then have it approved by our shareholders.

416
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,520
May I ask if you have read

417
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,120
the new proposal I brought last time?

418
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,470
The board prefers Cayman more.

419
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,430
They had a better offer.

420
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:05,040
It's okay, I understand.

421
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,500
Competitors are inevitable when it comes to collaborations.

422
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,620
But I firmly believe that

423
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,080
Mingyuan will be the best choice for SLC.

424
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,160
Yes. Cayman has its advantages

425
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,460
in funds and brand reputation.

426
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:23,260
But their acquisition strategy is nothing new.

427
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,500
Even though I prefer you personally,

428
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,320
but I must follow the rules.

429
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,100
It's all right. I will be waiting for your answer patiently.

430
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,430
Best hope.

431
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:36,430
Best hope.

432
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:41,220
Mingxuan,

433
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,080
the board has approved your acquisition proposal. Don't worry about the funding.

434
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:49,000
Just to make sure it goes well, I added 5% of the budget myself.

435
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,390
Mr. Xia has signed it as well.

436
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:54,560
Dad, thanks a lot.

437
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:59,030
I am worried about Fang Weiguo.

438
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,350
He won't give up. He will keep sabotaging us.

439
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:05,960
But for now, Mia is very interested in our Songtang.

440
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,320
They have no advantages on that.

441
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,460
There's one more thing.

442
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,910
Haiyao is actively recruiting designers in France.

443
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:21,560
They know nothing but plagiarism.

444
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,940
You need to clear the troops. I am in the jungle now.

445
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,140
Yes, I am on it.

446
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:28,350
I am clearing them.

447
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:31,440
What did I tell you, Zheng Hang?

448
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,370
- Hurry up!
- Sister Xiaoman, you are back.

449
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:37,260
Yo, you are back. Thanks for your hard work.

450
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,020
Not at all.

451
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,480
How was your meeting?

452
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,200
It went well. You can always trust in me.

453
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,620
Did those old things complain about you representing me?

454
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,460
I was representing you.

455
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:56,550
If they complain about me, they are complaining about you.

456
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,780
You are the boss.

457
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:02,330
They wouldn't dare to do that.

458
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,390
Zheng Hang,

459
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,100
watch out!

460
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:11,250
Haitian, did you take a look

461
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,250
at the designer info that I gave you?

462
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,030
What info?

463
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:18,420
It's in the office.

464
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,030
Oh. I haven't.

465
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,650
It's all right. I can walk you through it.

466
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,710
Those designers in France are pretty good.

467
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:29,580
Especially the one named Cheng Yang.

468
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:34,540
I want to go there and have a talk with him myself.

469
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,370
Watch out for the tower!

470
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,940
Are you stupid?

471
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,750
You were talking about France?

472
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,100
Yes, I support you.

473
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,790
I have a schedule in France.

474
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:48,030
I could ask him out when I am there.

475
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:50,620
If it goes well, we can sign him right away.

476
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:53,490
So that you would look good

477
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:55,540
in the board meeting.

478
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,840
You are right. You got this, Boss Bai!

479
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,060
Thumbs up for you.

480
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,090
Zheng Hang!

481
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:04,750
You are losing your tower!

482
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:13,940
Mo Fei, I've thought it through.

483
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,100
I'm preparing to return to China.

484
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,670
You've really thought it through?

485
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:27,020
I came here because of Cheng Yang.

486
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:30,480
Our relationship is at this point,

487
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,800
so I want to go back.

488
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,990
Okay.

489
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:39,340
No matter wherever you are,

490
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,000
I want you to be happy.

491
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,070
You, too.

492
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,990
After I return to China,

493
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:49,420
I'm not worried about Cheng Yang...

494
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:52,850
but you. You're always so careless.

495
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,300
You don't know how to take care of yourself.

496
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,940
You don't even know you are lost.

497
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:02,130
Don't worry, I will take care of myself. But you,

498
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:04,450
you have to take care of yourself.

499
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:08,690
Did you book your flight already?

500
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:11,360
I've been checking the last few days.

501
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:16,550
How's it going with President Tang lately?

502
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:19,010
Has he called you?

503
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:24,200
He's probably busy.

504
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:27,920
If he's busy, but you can take the initiative.

505
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,590
Mo Fei, let me give you some advice.

506
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,850
While he's still here,

507
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:35,320
you definitely need to talk it out.

508
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:39,970
Or else, when he leaves in a few days, who will you cry to?

509
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,430
Didn't you want to go see an art exhibit?

510
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:49,450
Tell him to go with you.

511
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,220
How can I do that?

512
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,660
We agreed we'd go together.

513
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:57,600
I won't be able to go. I have so much to pack.

514
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,650
Say, you haven't booked your ticket yet.

515
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,070
Why are you being this way?

516
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:05,980
- Don't you have a class to attend?
- Let me check.

517
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:10,290
I have to go. You eat, okay? Bye-bye.

518
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:13,000
- Be careful, okay?
- All right.

519
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,110
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

520
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:48,680
You are too focused on the lower part of the skirt.

521
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,820
Are you saying...

522
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:54,500
I shouldn't make the details of the skirt stand out?

523
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,420
I should focus on the body, right?

524
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,360
Yes, that's right.

525
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,360
That's very good. Great.

526
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:21,710
There is a competition in Lyon.

527
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:25,190
Are you interested in joining me?

528
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:31,110
Mo Fei, do it. This is a great opportunity.

529
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,720
- It will be my pleasure.
- Good.

530
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:40,950
Meng Jin, you can also join Mo Fei.

531
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,820
Thank you very much.

532
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,780
I think Andre really likes your design this time.

533
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:53,520
Wrong, it's our design.

534
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,850
Does he want us to modify the body proportions?

535
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:00,220
I think he's suggesting that we do an embroidery.

536
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,730
The hardest part would be the phoenix totem, right?

537
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,670
The phoenix totem is a Chinese-style element.

538
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:10,100
Isn't it a bit strange to add this to the clothes?

539
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,920
Actually, he wants us to use embroidery to see how we would present

540
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,550
the Chinese style. He also used an interesting term.

541
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,840
He used totem, not phoenix.

542
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,990
What's the difference?

543
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:25,540
In the eyes of Chinese and Westerners, phoenixes are a product of our imagination.

544
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:28,130
The Westerner's phoenix is evolved from a

545
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:30,780
sacred bird and Greece's sunbird.

546
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:34,630
Between 300 to 500 years old, they'll burn themselves and be reborn again.

547
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:37,150
Yet the Chinese phoenix

548
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:41,010
represents jubilation, luck, and in addition, nobility.

549
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:45,040
It's completely different from the Western one. They even look different.

550
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,870
So he wants us to do a noble version?

551
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:51,760
It's not that simple. Think about it...

552
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,630
In Chinese literature,

553
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:57,840
the phoenix is often used to describe talented people.

554
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,690
And the phoenix in certain fields is used to describe masters.

555
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:04,570
It also represents the holy subject to win love.

556
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:08,210
People wish their fire of love

557
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:10,190
to last forever like the phoenix.

558
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:13,610
I am still very confused.

559
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:16,410
It's a combination of the Chinese-style clothing

560
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:20,180
and Western literature.

561
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:23,600
It's more than just piling up Chinese elements.

562
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,150
I told you.

563
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,830
Chinese-style clothing is hard to make.

564
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:29,660
We need to take into consideration the philosophy theory,

565
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,630
expression method, and traditional culture.

566
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:35,870
Is Andre trying to make us fail?

567
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:40,220
He is not that bad. I think he just wanted to encourage our ideas.

568
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:44,600
So all we need to do now is to find the pattern and the way to present it.

569
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:51,160
Miss Meng Jing,

570
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,020
are you willing to take on this tough task?

571
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:57,580
Fine, I will give you a chance.

572
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,250
Let's go.

573
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,920
Phoenixes flying side by side. What kind of pattern are you looking for?

574
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,230
I want something light.

575
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:18,060
Phoenixes flying side by side, spreading their wings.

576
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:21,020
If it's too heavy,

577
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:24,060
it won't present the sense of lightness.

578
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:29,330
Tell me what's in your mind. I can help you.

579
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:32,250
I want Georgette.

580
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,250
Let me see...

581
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,920
Over there.

582
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,840
Yes, this is it.

583
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,790
We also need some Organza.

584
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:46,850
Don't you think it's too plain?

585
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:50,790
What if we add bead embroidery

586
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:53,610
and Su Embroidery to it?

587
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:55,800
We can use the bead embroidery

588
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,110
to make the feather of a phoenix.

589
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,100
- What do you think?
- Okay.

590
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,320
Madam.

591
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,530
Hello.

592
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,140
Hi, can I have some of this?

593
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,990
No problem.

594
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:17,290
May I ask if you have organza in a pearly white color?

595
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:22,340
I'm sorry, that's out of stock. Would you like something else?

596
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:25,330
Do you have any samples that I can take a look at?

597
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:28,230
Of course! Follow me. It's over there.

598
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:34,590
These are our samples.

599
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:40,050
I think this one is pretty good.

600
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:44,930
The glossiness is good. It will have a low-key luxury style.

601
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:49,160
Can we order now? We don't need much.

602
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,260
Sure, this one?

603
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,870
Okay.

604
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,150
Please leave your number and your name.

605
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:01,150
I will call you once it's restocked.

606
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:03,250
Thank you.

607
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,470
Are you free today?

608
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,870
Yes, I have homework to do.

609
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:19,270
I have a thesis on the history of fashion to finish.

610
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:22,700
Fine. I was going to invite you to an art exhibition with me.

611
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,100
Art exhibition? Oh, I really want to go.

612
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:29,220
But my thesis is only halfway done.

613
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,960
Okay.

614
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:37,790
Hello, Duoduo.

615
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:39,020
Where are you?

616
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,790
I just finished buying fabric with Meng Jing.

617
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:48,560
Did you say you wanted to go to an art exhibit this afternoon?

618
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,560
I thought about it? How about I go with you?

619
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:56,240
Really? Are you going to go with me? Didn't you say you had a lot to pack?

620
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,910
I can pack any time.

621
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,120
I am leaving soon.

622
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,390
I won't be able to hang out with you.

623
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:06,230
I might as well hang out with you now

624
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:08,670
as much as I can.

625
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:12,790
I've already bought the ticket. I'll meet you there in the afternoon.

626
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:17,100
Duoduo, I love you so much. I'll be right over. Bye-bye. See you in a bit.
