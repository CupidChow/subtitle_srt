[Episode 29]

3
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,330
I won.

4
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,680
You really haven't improved since you were little.

5
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,820
Big Brother, can't you just let me win once?

6
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,290
You are playing the wrong moves. How can I let you win?

7
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,910
You girls are really...

8
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,280
We girls?

9
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,640
Who else?

10
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,400
It's so late. You need to rest.

11
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,390
I have to go.

12
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,330
Brother, don't change the subject.

13
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,480
Are you dating?

14
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,860
Who told you I was?

15
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,490
You said it.

16
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,810
Did I? Why don't I remember?

17
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,550
You're obviously having a guilty conscience.

18
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,820
Is it the girl in the drawing?

19
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,410
Tell me about her!

20
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,930
You clearly have a girlfriend! Why don't you bring her to see me?

21
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,530
She... probably will never forgive me.

22
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,710
Why?

23
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,360
Why wouldn't she forgive you?

24
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,140
Nothing. She has a boyfriend.

25
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,320
Go to bed. Rest well and don't catch a cold. I'm leaving.

26
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,230
Brother, I want orange juice.

27
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,570
What are you doing drinking orange juice in the middle of the night?

28
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,540
I just want to.

29
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,300
You are so random.

30
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,500
Buy it for me.

31
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,030
All right. Behave and wait for me.

32
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,900
Do you remember if Qianqian stays in room 316 or B-318?

33
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,440
Let me ask.

34
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,940
Excuse me. Which room is Fang Qian in?

35
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,780
In 318, over there.

36
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,430
Thanks.

37
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,800
Dad!

38
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,800
Dad, what are you doing in Shanghai?

39
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,660
Dad!

40
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,510
I... I finally get to see you.

41
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,960
You scared me so much.

42
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,420
- I'm so sorry.
- I thought...

43
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,290
I thought you were dead.

44
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,790
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,130
Where were you? You didn't call home at all.

46
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,610
I'm sorry, Dad.

47
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,950
I was a liaison for World Without Borders.

48
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,430
We didn't have any communication facility over there.

49
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,280
I wasn't avoiding you on purpose.

50
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,940
You haven't told me what you are doing in Shanghai.

51
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,630
I flew here as soon as I got the news.

52
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,550
Are you in pain?

53
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,170
- Do you feel uncomfortable?
- Sit, sit.

54
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,660
Tell me if you are in pain? Are you feeling uncomfortable?

55
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,370
I'm not in pain at all. You sit.

56
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,510
They said you were sick.

57
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,940
How are you feeling sick? Tell me.

58
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,070
I'm not. I'm fine.

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,210
Have you been taking care of yourself?

60
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,650
Your blood pressure is always high.

61
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,770
You haven't told me. Where are you in pain?

62
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,700
I know how to take blood pressure, Dad.

63
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,700
Here. You came here in a hurry. Your blood pressure must be high.

64
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,760
Don't move.

65
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,650
They say daughters care the most.

66
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,350
Qian Qian is sick, but she still worries about you.

67
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,020
Relax.

68
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,090
Don't move. Don't move.

69
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,960
All right.

70
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,310
Don't move.

71
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,400
Look! You are not taking care of yourself.

72
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,850
- You promised me!
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

73
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,150
But you... you...

74
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,860
I'm all fine when I saw you.

75
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,520
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,800
I'm all good with you here. I'm glad you're back.

77
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:28,370
Braised beef noodles, tomatoes, and orange juice. Are sure you don't want anything else?

78
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,990
That's it.

79
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,610
- Sis, also bring me a small bag of chips!
- Why are you here?

80
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,510
- Answer him.
- Okay!

81
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,880
What are you doing here?

82
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,410
I can't sleep so I came to see you.

83
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,570
I'm going to the market. How about coming with me?

84
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,130
It's because we're like that we can walk like this.

85
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,580
But if it's the same, then it's weird.

86
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,200
As long as you like it.

87
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,280
Your little brother is so immature.

88
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,890
It's so late at night, yet he lets you go out alone to buy stuff.

89
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,680
Because it's my shift tonight.

90
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,720
- What shift?
- In my family, we have shifts

91
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,260
for doing housework. It's my shift today.

92
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,140
Ever since I was little, my mom would never

93
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,130
take care of me more just because I'm a girl.

94
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,260
She doesn't take care of my brother more just because he is younger.

95
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,700
Your mother is so wise.

96
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,550
In my family, my little cousin,

97
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,890
because she's a girl and younger than me,

98
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,550
she's undisciplined

99
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,010
and out of control at home.

100
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,090
So since you were little,

101
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,640
you never sided with her more, right?

102
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,870
That's why she isn't very close to me.

103
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,100
She likes Fang Xiaoyu more.

104
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,520
He spoils her a lot.

105
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,690
Didn't we agree to

106
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,660
not mention him?

107
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,000
Time passes so fast.

108
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,940
Vacation is halfway done in a blink of an eye.

109
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,350
- You haven't decided when you are going back?
- Not yet.

110
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,750
But why aren't you even a little bit sad?

111
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,110
Why should I be sad?

112
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,870
Because...

113
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,310
If everything goes well,

114
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,230
I can go visit you in France often.

115
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,550
- Really?
- Of course.

116
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,390
Is there hope for the acquisition?

117
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,160
The future is bright. Miya agreed

118
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,370
to come to Shanghai for our Symphony of Clouds and Mist press conference.

119
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,030
That's great!

120
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:57,640
Is there anything I can help with?

121
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,750
As a good designer, you need to use your talent.

122
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,490
But as my girlfriend,

123
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,000
you can help me

124
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,240
in many ways.

125
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,510
What are you thinking?

126
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,340
- You don't understand?
- I don't know. I don't understand.

127
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,260
- I don't know what you are talking about.
- Don't you?

128
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,570
Should I do

129
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,280
a Chinese cuisine theme design?

130
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,880
I could use Xiao Long Bao to design the wedding dress.

131
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,070
Duoduo wouldn't want to wear it.

132
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:36,130
Think about it. If Duoduo wears a Xiao Long Bao wedding dress,

133
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,310
wouldn't that be interesting?

134
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:42,470
That is interesting, but you wouldn't find a wife in this lifetime.

135
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,640
You women don't understand a guy's romance.

136
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,040
Men don't understand women's hearts.

137
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,310
Xiao Long Bao wedding gown.

138
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,530
I'm going to Suzhou this afternoon.

139
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,540
This afternoon?

140
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,360
Don't forget to confirm the draft.

141
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,110
Then, discuss it well with the embroiderers.

142
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,690
Thank you.

143
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,040
For what?

144
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,990
If it weren't for you, I would be soaked.

145
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,570
Yes, that's right.

146
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,040
- Are you going to Suzhou?
- Yes.

147
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,940
To do what?

148
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,160
Going to the building site and to visit your master.

149
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,340
- What about you?
- I am also going to see my master.

150
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,850
I feel like Water Color is lacking a little charm.

151
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,020
I need to discuss it with her.

152
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,020
Of course, if time allows, I can collect local materials.

153
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,530
What do you think the Water Colors lack?

154
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,400
I think it needs something to grab people's attention.

155
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,360
And... a sense of movement.

156
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,360
So you want to substitute it with Su Embroidery.

157
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,360
You've worked hard.

158
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,030
You don't even get a break on weekends.

159
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,210
I'm fine.

160
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,640
- Your hair is wet. Let me dry it for you.
- I'll do it myself.

161
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,620
- Let me do it.
- Okay.

162
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,760
Give me your glasses.

163
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,020
- I'll give you my eyes.
- Your glasses.
(T/N: Eyes and glasses have a similar pronunciation)

164
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,210
You have my eyes already.

Water Color is the new theme for Songtang's show this time.

223
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,910
I'm planning on using Su Embroidery to make some pendants to decorate the clothes.

224
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,790
My current idea is

225
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:40,770
other than the belt and the decoration, the whole piece is plain colored.

226
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:45,670
So you don't know where to start, right?

227
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,810
I've looked at many patterns.

228
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,940
Those flowers and such are too cliche.

What do you think of koi fish?

232
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,910
Koi fish?

233
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,150
That's a good one.

234
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:09,120
Don't you young people like to repost koi fish pictures for good luck?

235
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,240
This is a good idea.

236
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,010
But even though fish are not a hard pattern,

237
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:18,090
but it's still hard to make it vivid.

238
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,330
That's true.

239
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,060
But...

240
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,950
you could use the Kelin stitch method.

241
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:31,810
First, make a horizontal stitch based on the breadth of the scale,

242
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:36,890
then use a short needle to stitch a small triangle on it.

243
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,860
And then, use two equal-length short stitches

244
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,090
to close the scale.

245
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,720
About the fish's eyes...

246
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,380
Use the knot stitch.

247
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,360
It would look more three-dimensional.

248
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,520
For the decorative water plants, you could use the backstitch.

249
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,720
This way, the angles can be hidden away

250
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,320
and can be enlarged at will.

00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,750

It did take a lot of effort.

281
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,310
We used some light-colored threads

to mix with the dark-colored threads to achieve this shine.

00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:20,110
Even if you do, it's all temporary.

329
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:23,690
What is the biggest problem you have right now?

330
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,340
Water Color only has black and white

331
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,020
as its main color, and then it has ink-splash

332
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,160
to mix those two.

333
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:38,160
But I just think it lacks elegance.

334
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,970
My instincts are telling me that white might be the problem,

335
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:48,900
because white can be added to any piece.

336
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:53,150
For example, light feathers, white snow,

337
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:56,080
and soft clouds. They all give the people

338
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,610
a different sense of white.

339
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:02,380
I remember there was once an intellectual,

340
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,120
who said the character white of oracle inscriptions and bell-cauldron inscriptions

341
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,780
is like the highest rising point of the sun.

342
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:16,350
The reeds are flourishing, white dew turns into frost.

343
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:20,490
The reeds and the frosted dew

344
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:24,130
reflect the scenery of the water.

345
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:27,710
The stream runs clearly, the white pebbles are spotless.

346
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:32,040
The surging river water keeps splashing

347
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:36,020
and makes the color of the rocks become translucent.

348
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,160
White...

349
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,230
is the color of light.

350
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,350
It's power.

351
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:49,290
It accumulates a lot and gives a little. It's the power of dripping water dripping to rock.

352
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:54,350
Thank you for inspiring me.

353
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:58,430
I finally know what Water Color lacks.

354
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:02,190
Thank you! I need to make note of it.

355
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:07,370
Are you just thanking me with words?

356
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,360
Then...

357
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,360
I will buy you crabs.

358
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,600
I just had it last night.

359
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,850
What do you want then?

360
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,450
Is there anything else you can thank me with?

361
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,450
Like what?

362
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,000
Let me think.

And there's no reward.

00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,220
It's so sad.

367
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,100
I'm sad.

You're not even showing your appreciation a little.

370
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,050
That's not enough.

It's an emergency.

- I'm asking you how is she right now!
- Don't agitate yourself.

How long has she been there?

407

I need to wait for Tang Mingxuan to get here.

I just called him. He said he will be coming right now.

Why did you call him here?

She doesn't want to see you or me.

She wants to see Tang Mingxuan the most.

How is she doing?

420
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:10,390
She is out of the danger zone,

421
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:13,220
but she is worse than we predicted.

422
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,170
What does that mean?

423
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:17,300
Fang Qian's condition got worse.

424
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,750
Also, it's evolving very rapidly.

425
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:24,160
What we did today is just to keep her stable for a while.

- Temporarily...
Is there anything else to be done?

427

Stabilizing her is the best we can do today.

What?

Not even a little bit?

439
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,920
If you say a little bit,

440
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:43,220
then it has to be between brother and sister.

494
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,650
You can never keep a daughter around you.

495
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:05,150
I just asked you one question and you react like this.

496
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,050
All right. I will have to believe that

497
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,440
he is an outstanding young man.

498
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:13,700
You trust me so much?

499
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,020
Because you are outstanding.

500
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:20,180
She wouldn't want someone who has no goals,

501
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,760
no dreams and no ambitions.

502
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:28,120
However, for guys like them,

503
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,860
love is not the only thing in their lives.

504
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,700
In his life,

505
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:37,130
there's always something more important than you.

506
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:40,520
Are you ready to accept that?

507
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:44,800
Also, not only will

508
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,710
he treat work as his life,

509
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:51,750
you also have to accept the complicated relationships around him.

510
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,990
I can.

511
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,890
Does he love you?

512
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,250
Do you believe him?

513
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,450
Yes.

514
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,510
Okay. Since you've decided.

515
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,250
Enjoy.

516
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,740
How did this happen?

517
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,640
Really?

518
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:22,380
Okay, okay. Got it.

519
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:33,050
What happened?

520
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,050
Qian Qian is back.

521
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:41,380
Qian Qian is back? That's good news.

522
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,550
But just then when you were on the phone, your attitude was...

523
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,990
weird?

524
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:49,180
She is sick. Very sick.

525
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,400
What is it?

526
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,050
Brain cancer.

527
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,830
That's serious.

528
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,430
Since she is back, we have to go see her.

529
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,820
I don't want to go.

530
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:09,050
We have to be there together. She is very sick. How could you not go?

531
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:12,430
It's not good for me to go. You go. You represent me.

532
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,780
Why are you still saying things like this?

533
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,350
Right!

534
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:19,800
The party Old Xia hosted last time,

535
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,420
there was a brain cancer specialist.

536
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,610
You still have his number.

537
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:27,310
Call him and ask him to come here.

538
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:29,650
We will pay for everything.

539
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,180
Okay, I can call him.

540
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,560
But it's been so long.

541
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:39,210
maybe the Fang family wouldn't want our help.

542
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:43,000
We were the ones in the wrong.

543
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,630
It's our obligation to visit, and it's up to them to accept our help.

544
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,830
You are right.

545
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,360
Good.

546
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:55,530
Have you seen Director Xia this morning?

547
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,320
No. Why?

548
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,560
She wore heels this high,

549
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,400
like she is here to kill someone.

550
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,760
Who is she trying to kill?

551
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,740
Who else? Must be Mo Fei.

552
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:09,070
Mo Fei went to Suzhou, and President Tang also went.

553
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,320
- Really?
- Really!

554
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:14,290
Shen Jiaxi saw they got in the same car and left together.

555
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:17,230
She said she went scouting. What a pretender.

556
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,900
The excuses she made.

557
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,900
Our Director Xia has an enemy now.

558
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,260
I thought you were staying longer in Suzhou.

559
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:27,000
I'm back when my job is done.

560
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:30,190
Let me show you.

561
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:37,130
Look! This is the ink-splashed painting I saw in the Suzhou museum. What do you think?

562
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:40,180
I've never seen that kind of splashed ink before.

563
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:43,160
It's interesting.

564
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,650
That's right. So that's why I thought we can

565
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:48,580
have a simpler

566
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,910
waistline.

567
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:53,960
The focus can be the belt

568
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,250
and the embroidery.

569
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:58,900
There can be more empty space on the piece.

570
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,620
This way, the piece looks light.

571
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,690
Is that the Chinese style of beauty?

572
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:08,950
It gives more space to enjoy the beauty of watercolor.

573
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:23,650
♫ I say you're an April day ♫

574
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:27,750
♫ The sound of your laughter lights everything up ♫

575
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:31,210
♫ Even the spirit of a light breeze ♫

576
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:37,310
♫ In the midst of the brightness and beauty of spring,
shift as one would in a dance ♫

577
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:42,440
♫ You're the mist on a dry April day ♫

578
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,920
♫ The gentle breeze blown during dusk ♫

579
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,580
♫ The unintentional sparkle of the planetesimal ♫

580
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:55,370
♫ The fine rain that's sprinkled in front of the flower ♫

581
00:42:56,590 --> 00:43:01,270
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

582
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:06,060
♫ Like a shy water lotus that bows to a cool breeze ♫

583
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:10,840
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

584
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:15,810
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫

585

♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

586

♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫

587
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:40,110
♫ You're like the ivory field after snowflakes ♫

588
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:44,600
♫ You're the round moon every night ♫

589
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,340
♫ You're the naïve ♫

590
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:52,700
♫ white lotus that floats on the water ripples of your dream ♫

591
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:59,750
♫ You're the flower blossoms of tree after tree ♫

592
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:04,250
♫ The swallow twittering within the beams ♫

593
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:07,790
♫ You are love, hope, and warmth ♫

594
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:12,280
♫ You're an April day ♫

595
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:17,010
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

596
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:21,950
♫ The bittersweet parting words of "take care" ♫

597
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:26,650
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

598
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:32,830
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫
