[Episode 9]

3
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,410
You just want an answer, right?

4
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:41,560
Then let me tell you very clearly today.

5
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,490
We didn't destroy you. It's you who destroyed yourself.

6
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,370
Let's not talk about this competition. Let's talk about the charity banquet night.

7
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,520
The charity banquet night... I...

8
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,850
You made a huge, grand announcement to the models,

9
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,030
saying that I would take you to the charity banquet. Right?

10
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,050
What else did you say?

11
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,330
Did you say that I'm interested in you?

12
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,410
That I like you?

13
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:07,240
- No, that was really a misunderstanding.
- Let's talk about what happened at the Xiong Ying's showcase then.

14
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,700
Although you hid it well, it's very obvious to a discerning person

15
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:15,350
that you took the assistant's scissors to intentionally ruin the outfit.

16
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,750
You are a model.

17
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,040
Designers work painstakingly hard to create their outfits and give you to wear. How can you ruin them?

18
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,380
You care about your hard work, but do you not care about other people's hard work?

19
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:34,470
Is that the clear conscience that you're talking about?

20
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,120
Since you already think of me that way,

21
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,390
you don't care about my explanation at all.

22
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,490
Even if I'm being misunderstood, you don't care. Right?

23
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:49,310
At this point, whether you did it or not, doesn't matter anymore.

24
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,160
To me, you brought this outcome upon yourself.

25
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,600
Director Fang. Director Fang!

26
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,770
Save it, okay?

27
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,400
Your pathetic act might work with Linda,

28
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,220
but it really won't work on me.

29
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,540
Director Fang, I'm begging you.

30
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,450
Let's mutually save some face and have some dignity.

31
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,520
You are not giving me any leeway, Director Fang.

32
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,030
You caused your own doom.

33
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,450
Leave your entry badge at the counter when you exit.

34
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,340
I'll find someone to take care of your resignation procedure.

35
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,410
Fang Xiaoyu, I will make you regret acting this way to me.

36
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,860
I never expected that a ruined outfit

37
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,980
would actually make Chinese Style Fashion trend on the internet.

38
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,930
It really is a blessing in disquise.

39
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,700
How is this a blessing?

40
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:51,130
Do you know how big of a deal it is for a designer to have her outfit ruined

41
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,970
- and to lose the competition?
- What!

42
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,380
President Tang, do you not know?

43
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,470
What is it?

44
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,240
The reports in the media during the last few days...

45
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:04,740
There's so much noise on the Internet, I didn’t even want to look.

46
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,820
No wonder. You may not know

47
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,590
but that designer, Mo Fei,

48
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,640
is very popular on our platform right now.

49
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,520
Everyone wants to know what kind of work she would have designed and made for her fifth outfit.

50
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,100
Is that so?

51
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,360
You should know that this is the Fashion Daily's first collaboration with Lanmu.

52
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,280
In the beginning, I felt very uneasy.

53
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,390
Unexpectedly, there were so many talents who appeared in the competition.

54
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:34,690
It was very beneficial for us, so I can finally feel at ease.

55
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,010
So I'm here today to inform you in advance

56
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,040
to get ready to go online as soon as possible

57
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,180
Xiaoyu, I think you should contact the top three contestants of the competition.

58
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,070
Although Mingyuan hosted the competition,

59
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,990
I don't think they can sign that many designers at once.

60
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,260
The top three contestants are all pretty good.

61
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:01,180
I've already looked over the contestants' information. I want this one.

62
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,490
[Mo Fei, 8th Place]

63
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,700
Eighth place?

64
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,030
Yes, eighth place. I definitely want her.

65
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,060
This person didn't even finish the competition.

66
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,950
You don't want any of these great ones but you want someone who placed eighth?

67
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,690
Is there a problem?

68
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,700
I'm not considering someone who placed eighth.

69
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,360
Come! President He, sit.

70
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,580
Take a look one more time.

71
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,850
Look over it carefully first.

72
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,130
If she's not good enough, then fire me.

73
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,530
What do you think? Not bad, right?

74
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,660
She's okay.

75
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,910
Xiaoyu, I must inform Paris headquarters when I hire someone.

76
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,860
How do you want me to tell them about an eighth-place contestant?

77
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,780
Who's in charge of the design department?

78
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,620
Is it me or the Paris headquarters?

79
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,870
You're in charge.

80
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:15,850
Since it's me, then I want her. You take care of the rest.

81
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,310
Hey, Xiaoyu, let's discuss it some more.

85
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,120
What's wrong? What's happened?

86
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,210
Man Man.

87
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,160
Why do they have to treat me like this?

88
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,570
Why does everyone help Mo Fei?

89
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,380
Is it that Mo Fei again?

90
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,550
Don't worry. I'll help you get revenge.

91
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,480
There's no use. Everyone will help her.

92
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,770
Everyone will protect her, don't you know?

93
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:39,810
Why is God so unfair?

94
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,320
Don't be upset, all right?

95
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,320
"Don't be upset"?

96
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,540
Is that all you know how to say?

97
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,350
I'm about to be bullied to death

98
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,040
yet all you know how to say is, "Don't be upset"?

99
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,580
Man Man, I'll take you somewhere to eat something delicious. All right?

100
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,960
Something delicious?

101
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,580
Yes.

102
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:25,470
This time... are you going to take me to eat barbecue

103
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,940
or spicy hotpot at a street food stall?

104
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,270
Let me ask you. Is that what you consider delicious food?

105
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,220
Man Man.

106
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,660
Leave. Leave. I don't want to see you.

107
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,420
Man Man.

108
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,400
Delicious food.

Stop drinking!

110

Do you not understand what I'm saying? I want you to leave!

111
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,610
Leave! Scram!

112
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:48,450
What you need to do now is not to thank me, but to believe in me.

113
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,830
Believe that as long as I'm by your side,

114

I'll take care of everything for you.

115
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,180
"You still have me."

116
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,810
What does that mean?

117
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,730
What are you saying?

118
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,680
Go away. None of your business.

119
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,060
Come back.

120
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,740
What?

121
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:22,400
Let me ask you. In what circumstance would you tell a girl,

122
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,500
"No matter what happens, you still have me"?

123
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,420
What does that mean?

124
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,720
That..

125
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:35,630
That question is hard to answer.

126
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,800
Then let me change the question.

127
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,690
What kind of girl would you say that to?

128
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,580
You. Mom, too.

129
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,520
Look at you. You got the floor dirty.

130
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,510
Leave. Leave.

131
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,700
But-But aren't you the one who told me to come back?

132
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,860
How dare you talk back again.

133
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:12,290
"I no longer need to pass each day as if it were a year. I no longer need to stay awake until dawn.

134
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:17,830
It's slowly becoming warm outside now." Are you familiar with these lyrics?

00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,890
I feel much better now.

154
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:08,290
You're still young. It's normal to face some obstacles.

I understand. Thank you, Teacher Pan.

156
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:16,130
I saw all your designs for this competition and think that they were all quite good.

157
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,320
But there are also many places where you could improve.

158
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,250
For example, using batik as your main element.

159
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,690
In terms of innovation, there are some things lacking.

160
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:28,420
Your own personal style is not very clear yet.

161
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,370
Take your time figuring it out.

162
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,630
Director Fang also told me that I cannot just focus on techniques.

163
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:39,630
I'll need to slowly internalize what you both advised.

164
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,110
President Tang?

165
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,640
- Teacher Pan.
- Long time no see.
- Yes.

166
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,010
Can I help you with something today?

167
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,400
I'm here to talk to Mo Fei.

168
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,260
- You two chat then.
- You can get back to work first.

169
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,090
What a horrible company.

170
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,130
They dare be picky with me.

171
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,650
I don't even want to be there.

172
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,300
They're crazy!

173
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,630
Hello, Older Brother.

174
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,600
Do you have any work?

175
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,400
There's work.

176
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,790
Just come and choose whichever big role you want.

177
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,870
That's great. Then I'll head over to the company to discuss it with you.

178
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,880
I'm at home right now. How about you come to my house?

179
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,050
We can have a good talk here at my home.

180
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:42,050
Talk, talk, talk. Jerk! Go die! Talk my butt.

181
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,230
I've gotten all the security footage.

182
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,460
Take a look.

183
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,810
Bai Xiaoman... she wasn't lying.

184
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:52,370
When she received the outfit,

185
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,840
there was already a stain on it.

186
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,530
Looks like we really wronged her that day.

187
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,230
Thank you, President Tang, for telling me the truth.

188
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,690
I have something to do right now.

189
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,290
I'll go with you.

190
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,890
Do you know where I'm going?

191
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,060
To find Bai Xiaoman.

192
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:29,080
No matter what, I still want to say,

193
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,010
thank you.

194
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,680
I already heard you say that.

195
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,980
On the radio.

196
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,710
I'll give you a ride.

197
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,370
Let's go.

198
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,880
I'm sorry.

199
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,440
Sorry about what?

200
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,150
There was a misunderstanding about the clothing last time.

201
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:12,390
So? Are you here to apologize?

202
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,100
I know things already happened.

203
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,690
Nothing will change if I say anything but...

204
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:20,050
I still want to apologize to you.

205
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,000
Mo Fei,

206
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,960
do you want to get rid of me with just a few meaningless words?

207
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,480
Do you not know that you've ruined me?

208
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,940
I've been fired from Cayman.

209
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,900
The photo of me undressing is being criticized online.

210
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,850
I still can't find a job right now!

211
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,280
Do you think "I'm sorry" will fix everything?

212
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,940
I didn't know the consequences would be like this.

213
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,950
In this incident, I should bear a great deal of responsibility.

214
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,740
Bear responsibility?

215
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,450
Okay.

216
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:02,690
I want to know how you plan to take responsibility for this.

217
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,930
I'm planning to discuss with Mingyuan's President Tang

218
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:08,750
whether he could give a statement on your behalf

219
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,280
to explain what happened that today...

220
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,250
I understand.

221
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:18,120
You're here to hit a person when they're down.

222
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,020
Your so-called solution

223
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,880
is to give out a lame statement?

224
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,020
Then push me into the public limelight so they can humiliate me once again, right?

225
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:32,030
You– Mo Fei, why have I never realized how bad of a person you are?

226
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,310
You're so lame.

227
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,250
What's wrong? Are you not happy today?

228
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,130
Nope.

229
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,370
Are you still mad?

230
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,470
Mad about what?

231
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,460
If you're not mad, that's good.

232
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,610
Are you talking about what happened at Mingyuan?

233
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,690
Even though you put me in a very embarrassing situation that day,

234
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:17,840
you did help me in the final round.

235
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,120
So, we're even now.

236
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,610
Even?

237
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:24,220
How are we even? We're not even.

238
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,160
Otherwise, it would mean I'm not important to you at all.

239
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,080
By the way, let me tell you something.

240
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,610
- I fired Bai Xiaoman.
- What?

241
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,120
Why did you fire her?

242
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,810
She is scheming and cunning. Cayman doesn't tolerate people like that.

243
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:44,450
But she didn't ruin my outfit.

244
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:48,120
- Are you sure?
- Yes, we were mistaken.

245
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,420
Even if she didn't ruin it, she can't just hit people. Right?

246
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,120
But she doesn't deserve to be fired over that, right?

247
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,240
We don't welcome this kind of person at Cayman.

248
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,620
But... she...

249
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,990
Do you remember what happened backstage at Xiong Ying's showcase?

250
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,690
Do you really think it was the assistant who accidentally

251
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,690
bumped into her?

252
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:14,800
You and I are people who use fabric sheers often.

253
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,040
Are the edges of the cloth when torn by the scissors

254
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,430
and deliberately cut by the scissors the same?

255
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:27,980
So, are you here today to tell me this?

256
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:33,640
No. I've been thinking about something these past few days.

257
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,440
I think about it every day.

258
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,760
I'm thinking about it so much, I can't even sleep.

259
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,710
I've been thinking, what can we do

260
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:46,250
so that you'll never be bullied by Bai Xiaoman again.

261
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:50,240
- What do you mean?
- How about you become my girlfriend?

262
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,080
What do you mean by that?

263
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,370
Do you agree or not? Why are you laughing?

264
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:05,060
I think you're being very weird right now.

265
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,000
No. If I become your boyfriend, then I can protect you.

266
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,870
Since you like to protect others so much,

267
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,520
why didn't you become a police officer?

268
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,670
How about we work together to remake that ruined outfit of yours?

269
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:24,410
If I want to remake it then I can do so myself. I won't bother you, the elderly. I still have something to do. Bye-bye.

270
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,170
Regardless, I'm still an internationally renowned designer.

271
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,700
Working with me is not an embarrassing thing, right?

272
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,250
I need to speak to you.

273
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,270
If you have something to say, then say it quickly.

274
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,070
It's fine that you don't like me,

275
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,640
but stop harassing Mo Fei.

276
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:00,050
Do you know her? I know her better than you do.

277
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,980
I think I'm a better fit for her.

278
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,130
Also, I don't like you

279
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,730
because you harmed my little sister in the past.

280
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:09,500
Therefore, I don't want you to hurt Mo Fei.

281
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,600
I don't quite understand.

282
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,080
How did I hurt your little sister?

283
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:23,120
Why are you so persistent in that matter? So many years have passed.

284
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,490
You should clearly know about what happened back then.

285
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:33,520
Also, don't treat Mo Fei the way you treat other women. All right?

286
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,700
It's only because she's not your little sister.

287
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,540
Also, you're a bit too inexperienced

288
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,670
to be my love rival.

289
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,400
Let's just leave it at that for now.

290
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,380
Today is just the beginning.

291
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,480
Must you make things so difficult and irreversible?

292
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,930
Two different matters.

293
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:09,770
Then let's... just leave things here.

294
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,360
How about you be my girlfriend?

295
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,140
If I am your boyfriend, I can protect you.

296
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,780
He says he wants to protect me.

297
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,300
It'll already be great if you don't cause me trouble.

298
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,320
Director Fang, if you are that bored,

299
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,900
help me get some water. Hot water. Thank you.

300
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,440
Who are you asking to get you water?

301
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,630
Why did he come to see you again?

302
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:13,220
Nothing. He just said some nonsense.

303
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,450
What nonsense did he say?

304
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:23,040
He said...

305
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,960
Did he say he likes you?

306
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,860
How did you respond?

307
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,660
Did you accept him?

308
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,660
You can't accept him. I've already told you many times.

309
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,820
Getting close to him won't do you any good.

310
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,540
Unless you are enjoying him being nice to you.

311
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:59,870
President Tang, with what status are you telling me all this?

312
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,950
Whom I'm friends with

313
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:08,060
is my business. It has nothing to do with you.

314
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:34,650
- Zheng Hang.
- Yes.

315
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,710
I still have something to do. You go ahead.

316
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,210
What about Mr. Li?

317
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,410
You go handle Mr. Li for me.

318
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,440
Xiao Li.

319
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,360
President Zhu.

320
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,690
Give me a glass of whiskey and put this lady's order on my tab.

321
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,550
Okay. Please wait a minute.

322
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:13,880
Miss Bai, what a coincidence.

323
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,530
Are you here drinking alone?

324
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,560
- President Zhu.
- Since we're so fated,

325
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,740
I'll toast to you.

326
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,780
You're really not giving me face, Miss Bai.

327
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,150
Is that enough for the drinks your paying for?

328
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,370
Miss Bai, your smile is worth millions.

329
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:56,280
Do all gorgeous girls have bad memories?

330
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,150
Do you really not remember who I am?

331
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,650
I'm Zhu Haitian from Haiyao Group.

332
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,980
We met at the charity banquet.

333
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,650
Your heel broke that day.

334
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,070
Charity banquet?

335
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:16,270
I remember.

336
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,370
That day...

337
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:28,180
Fang Xiaoyu took her inside.

338
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,910
Hey, don't drink so much or you'll get drunk.

339
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:36,580
Who are you? Why are you concerned about me?

340
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,800
I'm just a friend who is concerned about you.

341
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,590
Concern?

342
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:55,600
In this world, no one is concerned about me.

343
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,620
How can that be? You're so beautiful.

344
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:03,500
You must have many admirers and followers, right?

345
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,820
Nonsense!

346
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:11,500
They are all bastards!

347
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,410
Each and every one of them only know to bully me.

348
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,450
No one cares about me.

349
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,580
Did something bad happen?

350
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,500
Do you want to tell me about it?

351
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,090
Perhaps I can help you.

352
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,110
That dress.

353
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:41,870
That dress...

354
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,610
I really didn't do it.

355
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,770
I really didn't.

356
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:50,960
But not one person is willing to believe me.

357
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,740
Do you believe me? It wasn't me.

358
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,660
I believe you.

359
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,250
I've worked so hard.

360
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,980
Every day,

361
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,190
I live like...

362
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,220
But in the end,

363
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,470
unexpectedly, I can't even compare with a dress.

364
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:23,750
Why do I lead such a sad life?

365
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,900

Hurry up!

373
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,910
Sister!

374
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:42,160
Why are you yelling so early in the morning?

375
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,720
Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed today? Are you going through heartbreak?

376
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,680
Heartbreak my ass!

377
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,560
Just now, I dreamed that I got into ECSCP.

378
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,600
The admission letter was almost in my hand but then you knocked, knocked, knocked...

379
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,850
Don't panic. All dreams are the opposite of reality. It clearly means that you didn't get in.

380
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,380
Stop spouting your nonsense!

381
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,650
All right, I was just joking.

382
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:10,300
With your beauty and wisdom, how can you not get in?

383
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,940
Right?

384
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,120
Scram!

385

I'm complimenting you!

386
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,960
Sister, we're siblings. Don't be so ready to punish your own family even if justice demands it.

387
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,760
I'm telling you! I'm going to punish you, my brother, righteously today.

388
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,670
Sister, take a look at this.

389
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:31,030
How many times did I tell you to not look at your phone while your eating?

390
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,690
No, take a look at this!

391

Sister Jiaxi went to Yunnan.

392
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,080
The people with her were in competition with you, right?

393
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,250
When did she go on a trip? How come I didn't know?

394
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,640
Look at her, then look at yourself.

395
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,800
She can expand her circle of friends by participating in one competition.

396
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,290
What about you? Every single day, you are either sewing clothes at home or at Mingyuan.

397
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:55,370
Say, you can't shut your mouth even when you're eating, can you?

398
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,470
Just anger me to death.

399
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:05,370
Once I die of anger because of you, then you'll be happy.

400
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:08,750
By the way, I'm going to the batik workshop in the afternoon

401
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:11,450
to finish what I couldn't finish during the competition.

402
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:15,170
I won't be home for dinner tonight. You just eat whatever you want.

403
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:18,740
But the competition is over, why are you still going there?

404
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,990
Once you start working, you forget to sleep and eat. Mom will definitely scold you when she returns.

405
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,850
When is she coming back?

406
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:28,350
She sent me a message yesterday. If she isn't back today then tomorrow.

407
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:34,200
I think you should worry about yourself.

408
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:39,050
Mom doesn't know about you being a model at Cayman, right?

409
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:41,410
If she knows, what will you do?

410
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:44,600
Sister, you can't abandon me.

411
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,880
If Mom gets mad, you have to help me.

412
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,910
Why should I help you?

413
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,690
I'm begging you.

414
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,250
That's all you got?

415
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:57,260
Please!

416
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,970
All right. I won't abandon you.

417
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:03,160
You're the best! Here, eat some more.

418
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,770
What do you want to eat tomorrow? I'll make it for you.

419
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,170
That's more like it.

420

Your toasted bread is a bit hard.

421

Hello, Miss Bai.

You're here. Have a seat.

Yes.

I saw that you were drunk.

00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,670
I didn't want to leave you there by yourself. It was too dangerous.

Miss Bai, have you ever considered working with Haiyao Group?

454
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,810
President Zhu, are you joking?

455
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:57,320
Of course not.

456
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,970
I've read about what happened to you online.

I'm extremely angry about it.

who worked together to bully you.

They sacrificed you, a small model, to become famous.

462
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,740
They're despicable and shameless.

463

So I've decided to help you.

464
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,960
Bai Xiaoman, do you know what your biggest problem is?

465
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,960
You lack self-confidence.

466
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,330
You need to increase your self-confidence.

Gain more confidence.

468
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,400
Say, you are so beautiful

469
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,530
and elegant, especially when you are on the runway.

470

So radiant and extremely charming.

You need to be on a bigger stage. For example, my Haiyao.

but I have a few conditions.

484
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,520
Tell me.

485
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:26,280
I only want to do ads

486
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,160
and participate in product launches.

487
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,680
As for promotional activities, I don't want to participate.

488
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,680
No problem. I don't want you to be exhausted.

489
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,920
Also, if I'm not satisfied with the clothing that I'm endorsing, I have the right to change it.

490
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,970
You can choose any of Haiyao's clothing and change it however you see fit.

491
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:45,960
If you're not satisfied with something, I'll be the first to object to it.

492
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,650
I also have a personal request.

493
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:54,160
Personal request?

494
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,760
What kind of personal request? Tell me.

495
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:01,530
I... Can I have an increase in my appearance fees?

496
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,710
Just that?

497
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:12,810
Is that even a serious matter? Let me tell you!

498
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:16,590
When it comes to money,

499
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,920
it's just a trivial matter to me.

500
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,070
Miss Bai, once you are a part of Haiyao,

501
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:24,910
remember that I'm the backing

502
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:28,190
that you can rely on.

503
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:31,020
No matter what grievances you've experienced before,

504
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,680
once you're here, if anyone dares to bully you,

505
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,130
tell me and I'll be the first to chase them away.

506
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,150
You're so nice to me, President Zhu.

507
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:43,360
Being nice to you is what I should do.

508
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:50,330
It's also something I'm willing to do.

509
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,990
By the way, tonight, at my house...

510
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:00,960
at my villa, I'm having a small party.

511
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,360
The company's executives will be coming.

512
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,040
If you're available, come.

513
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:10,510
Then I can introduce you to them since we're all going to colleagues in the future, right?

514
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:13,960
Also... one more thing.

515
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,270
From now on, don't call me President Zhu.

516
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,610
Call me Haitian.

517
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:22,640
From now on, I won't call you Miss Bai anymore.

518
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:26,900
I'll call you Xiaoman. We are a family now.

519
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,780
Tonight, consider it

520
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,760
a small welcoming party for you.

521
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,460
All right?

522
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,840
I'll think it over.

523
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,130
All right.

524
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,390
After you've thought about it,

525
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,370
you're welcome over at my place at any time.

526
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:48,020
Okay.

527
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,470
Morning.

528
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:57,600
Morning.

529
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,690
What kind of reaction is that?

530
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:01,560
Then, how should I react?

531
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,800
You should at least give me a great big hug.

532
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,130
Say, are you not fully awake yet as it's still early morning?

533
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:11,450
But how did you know I was going to be here?

534
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:13,050
Because I know you.

535
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,880
I know that you didn't finish your last outfit.

536
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,940
I told you I wanted to finish it with you.

537
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,780
- But...
- Mo Fei, you're here?

538
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,500
Mr. Feng...

539
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,410
I came today to talk to you about renewing the lease.

540
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,240
Use it, just use it!

541
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,250
Mr. Fang already renewed the lease for you.

542
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,520
All right.

543
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,620
What are you waiting for? Hurry and get started.

544
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,640
Let's go.

545
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,920
Leave your bike here.

546
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,670
Come on, hurry.

547
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:58,520
How about I pay you the lease money? You can leave.

548
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,400
I already told you, I want to complete the outfit with you.

549
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,630
Do you find me that annoying?

550
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,860
You're even trying to give me money to chase me away.

551
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:10,700
I'm not annoyed at you. I just don't know what you want.

552
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:15,310
Very simple. I just want to see what your final outfit will look like once it's completed.

553
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:18,720
Just think of it as satisfying my curiosity, okay?

554
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,500
Director Fang, I don't have time to mess around with you.

555
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:27,400
When it comes to designing, I never mess around.

556
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,270
- These are the tools, right?
- Yes.

557
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,840
Do you really know how to make batik?

558
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,760
Let me make myself clear first.

559
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,630
If I'm not satisfied with this outfit,

560
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:56,820
just like in the competition, I'll give you a low score.

561
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:25,760
Isn't that the pattern I designed?

562
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,450
- How come you remember it?
- Of course.

563
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:31,280
What? Are you not going to help?

564
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:46,500
♫ I say you're an April day ♫

565
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,700
♫ The sound of your laughter lights everything up ♫

566
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:54,200
♫ Even the spirit of a light breeze ♫

567
00:41:54,200 --> 00:42:00,260
♫ In the midst of the brightness and beauty of spring,
shift as one would in a dance ♫

568

♫ You're the mist on a dry April day ♫

569
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,870
♫ The gentle breeze blown during dusk ♫

570
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:13,410
♫ The unintentional sparkle of the planetesimal ♫

571
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:19,380
♫ The fine rain that's sprinkled in front of the flower ♫

572
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:24,260
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

573
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:29,140
♫ Like a shy water lotus that bows to a cool breeze ♫

574
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:33,770
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:03,170
♫ You're like the ivory field after snowflakes ♫

579
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:07,580
♫ You're the round moon every night ♫

580
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:10,360
♫ You're the naïve ♫

581
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:17,610
♫ White lotus that floats on the water ripples of your dream ♫

582
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:22,740
♫ You're the flower blossoms of tree after tree ♫

583
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:27,130
♫ The swallow twittering within the beams ♫

584
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:31,450
♫ You are love, hope, and warmth ♫

585
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:35,110
♫ You're an April day ♫

586

♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

587
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:44,830
♫ The bittersweet parting words of "take care" ♫

♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫
