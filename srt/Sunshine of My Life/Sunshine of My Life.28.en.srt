4
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,210
You must be tired, aren't you?

5
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,800
No, just that I have been a little bit tense lately.

6
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,690
I wanted to take advantage of being alone and make a phone call,

7
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,090
but you are here now.

8
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,390
If you are too tired, you should stop working and go home.

9
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,550
No way! This is something I like doing!

10
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,610
And besides, it's very important to me.

11
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,320
It is also very important to you.

12
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,730
Even though I can't become your right hand,

13
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,880
I can't hold you back, either.

14
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,780
What's wrong?

15
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,620
You are just so good.

16
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:34,160
When you are like this, you are v-very cheesy!

17
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,190
Am I?

18
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,250
I will drive you home, okay?

19
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,090
- Let's go!
- I will take this off first.

20
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,160
Did I stab you?

21
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,730
It's fine.

22
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,860
Let's go!

23
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,090
Shanghai's skyline is so beautiful tonight.

24
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,740
It is so good that...

25
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,220
you're in Shanghai.

26
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,440
How could it be?

27
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,810
How did Fang Qian get a malignant brain tumor?

28
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,320
You tell me...

29
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,120
How could this happen to my sister?

30
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,470
I haven't seen her in three years.

31
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,820
And when she finally came back,

32
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,590
I thought that my only family member is finally back at my side.

33
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,640
I will take good care of her.

34
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,880
And that Fang Weiguo.

35
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,020
If it hadn't been for him and Zhuang Yuerong who killed my mother,

36
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,780
would Qianqian have been suffering this much?

37
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,720
Tang Mingxuan also got involved in it.

38
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,820
All right, Tang Mingxuan.

39
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,020
Couldn't you have sweet-talked my sister?

40
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,520
Couldn't you have rejected her nicely?

41
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,330
Xiaoyu, I think—

42
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:24,050
Did he have to push away my sister that way, making her run away from home?

43
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,030
Fine. My sister has just come back,

44
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,310
and Tang Mingxuan is so desperate to make a public display of affection...

45
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,630
Dragging Mo Fei into the company and exposing himself together with her.

46
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,280
What if my sister sees that?

47
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,400
Won't she get hurt?

48
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,360
Will my sister not get hurt seeing them displaying their affection in public?

49
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,880
She hasn't let go of Mingxuan at all!

50
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,840
Xiaoyu! Calm down!

51
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,000
How can I calm down?

52
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,030
She has a brain tumor! How can I calm down? She is my only family!

53
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:58,150
Xiaoyu, no one wanted Fang Qian to get this sickness!

54
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,940
But this has already happened.

55
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,400
Who can we blame?

56
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,780
They are all at fault!

57
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,500
President Fang is your father.

58
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,870
He's the father of you and Qianqian.

59
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,710
There's no father in this world who wishes for his own daughter's misery.

60
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,390
He doesn't deserve to be called our father. Fine?

61
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,080
Xiaoyu...

62
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,600
Tang Mingxuan is also a bastard!

63
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,980
You already made me come all the way here.

64
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,150
And you told me all of these things, which means I am more than an outsider to you.

65
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,350
Deep down, I have always seen you as my own brother.

66
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,080
So today I must persuade you.

67
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,100
Fang Qian is now all by herself at the hospital,

68
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,920
and the one she needs the most is you.

69
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,810
If you have a mental breakdown and lose control, what is she to do?

70
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,130
Therefore, you must calm down. All right?

71
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,780
There's no way I can calm down!

72
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,310
I know.

73
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,920
Therefore I will drink with you today, and you can vent as much as you want.

74
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,620
But the most important thing now,

75
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,850
is to find one of the best neurologists

76
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,930
to treat Fang Qian.

77
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,270
Medicine has improved a lot nowadays.

78
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,860
I do believe she can be cured!

79
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:29,480
Xiaoyu, you really can't have a mental breakdown now. Fang Qian depends on you.

80
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,580
If you have a breakdown, what is she to do?

Hello?

84
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:22,190
Mo Fei, I am in front of your building.

85
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,450
It's so late. Why are you looking for me?

86
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,610
Could you come downstairs?

87
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,000
It's too late. It's not convenient for me.

88
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,280
All right. Then I will be waiting for you.

89
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,720
Waiting for you to come here.

00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,330
look so vulnerable right now?

93
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,540
I am asking you what you want from me.

Tang Mingxuan...

95

Tang Mingxuan really is a bastard.

Tang Mingxuan is just a bastard. How could...

97
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,730
How could you like him?

98
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,830
You drank too much. Go back home.

99
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,310
I don't want him to hurt you!

100

Mo Fei, you can't like him!

101

Why are you two like kids?

116

Anyway, I think it is annoying.

Tell me a story.

I want to listen to Little Prince.

Wait.

121

I will get the book to read to you.

The fox said, if

126
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,330
you came at 4:00 in the afternoon,

127
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,240
then starting at 3:00,

128
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,630
I started to have a feeling of happiness.

129
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:00,120
The closer it is to 4:00, the happier I feel.

130

When it is 4:00,

131
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,260
I am distracted and anxious.

132
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,720
Mo Fei!, where are you going?

133
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,180
Going to the pantry.

134
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,590
Why didn't you call me if you're going to the pantry? You are getting more and more uncaring.

135
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:18,870
I am caring, okay? I saw you were so busy. I didn't want to bother you.

136
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,030
You didn't say yesterday, Cheng Yang was stunning.

137
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,570
That water color, you contributed a lot, right?

138
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:28,010
Where? It was all created by designer Cheng Yang himself.

139

We didn't.

145
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,170
It is just that it's working hours.

146
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,060
I don't want to talk about personal matters.

147

No, Mo Fei.

148
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,870
Right now, are you trying to be the boss' wife?

149
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,400
You are treating me less as a friend.

150
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,000
How would I?

151
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,710
It is just that this is the company. People talk.

152
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,350
I don't want to find too much trouble.

153
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,100
Then, when does your school break end?

Soon.

00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,990
Then... what day have you reserved to leave?

156
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,220
I just came back, how do I reserve?

157
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,580
I know, recently the fashion show

158
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,770
has caused everyone to be busy.

159
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:45,330
How about this? After this period ends,

160
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,050
you come to my house. I'll make you crawfish, okay?

161
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:52,640
Also, I have a lot of things to tell you and I don't have time.

162
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,770
All right, don't be angry anymore.

163
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,390
- Then, I'm going to leave.
- Okay, go be busy.

164
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,440

00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,990
Miya's assistant sent a fax saying Miya

166
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,860
is extremely willing to attend our Symphony of Clouds and Mist Show.

167
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,350
Then she said when we set the date, we just need to inform her.

168
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,080
She will try her best to arrange a time to come to Shanghai.

169
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:26,100
Quickly share this good news with Chairman.

170
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,600
Okay.

171
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,280
[Food with carbohydrates gives a feeling full of happiness!]

172
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,700
[Tang Mingxuan]

173
00:14:54,910 --> 00:15:01,270
[Mo Fei: Have you eaten yet?]

174
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,230
- Dad.
- I really didn't think

175
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,960
Miya would be so interested in our fashion show this time.

176
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,460
To someone who works in the fashion industry,

177
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,490
fabric technology craftsmanship is what they care about the most.

178
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,020
I believe through this,

179
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,240
it'll be beneficial to us in acquiring SLC.

180
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,630
I remember I asked you before,

181
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:30,260
what exactly is Songtang to you?

182
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,130
At that time, Songtang was

183
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:38,640
a clothing brand that needed to increase its sales.

184
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,260
How about now?

185
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,510
Now to me, Songtang

186
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,940
is not only a fashion brand.

187
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,570
From the embroidery workshop to design,

188
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,780
to all of the fabric selections,

189
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,230
I've invested a lot of emotion into it.

190
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:56,770
On its own, Songtang also carries the many types of Chinese Culture's

191
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,670
duty to transfer to descendants.

192
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,290
Great.

193
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,920
You now understand an outstanding business

194
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,420
where its ultimate value is.

195
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,160
Now, no matter what matter I give you, I will be at ease.

196
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,320
Come in.

197
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,220
Director Xia, your coffee.

198
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,740
Thank you.

199
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,460
Right now you are even more considerate than Liu Pei.

200
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,020
You were the one who promoted me.

201
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,700
Naturally, I have to think of everything in your best interests.

202
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,350
Or else, wouldn't I have wasted your efforts?

203
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:40,380
It looks like you are someone who looks greatly on sentiments.

204
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,690
With what you said, I feel embarrassed.

205
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:48,350
Then in the meeting, I rejected Mo Fei's suggestion.

206
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,770
As an old classmate, would you feel it's unfair?

207
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:53,290
What thoughts do you have?

208
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:56,530
I treated her as an old classmate, but she doesn't think the same of me.

209
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,850
When I was at the pantry, I saw Mo Fei.

210
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:02,160
Right now, she is Mingyuan Group's current popular designer's assistant.

211
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,680
She is super capable. Of course, she won't pay any attention to this former classmate of hers.

212
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,290
Then that is too improper.

213
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,510
I miss her, but she might not miss me.

214
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,220
Just now, she kept on elaborating to me saying her school break is too short.

215
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,210
She has to go back soon. Catch up later.

216
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:21,660
College students that have just gone into society like you guys,

217
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,150
when you are at a big company, there naturally will be some things you need to adjust to.

218
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:28,680
In a short time, having some problems is understandable.

219
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,270
She has always been like this.

220
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:34,490
No matter where she goes, she likes to be noticed and the center of attention.

221
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,520
Jiaxi, you are so smart. As long as you are hardworking,

222
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,020
remaining at Mingyuan should not be a big problem.

223
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,600
Really?!

224
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,100
Right.

225
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,030
This is a small gift I brought back from Milan.

226
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,480
I am someone who doesn't like to socialize.

227
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,560
I originally wanted to keep it for myself,

228
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,450
but I saw your outfit today,

229
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,780
and thought it is really suitable. I'll give it to you.

230
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,770
This... This is not good for me to take.

231
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:08,170
It's all right. Try it on and see.

232
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,070
Here, try it.

233
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,020
It really looks pretty.

234
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,080
Thank you, Director Xia.

235
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,690
You're welcome.

236
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,030
Doesn't this scarf look beautiful?

237
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,350
Beautiful.

238
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,730
Director Xia gave it to me.

239
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,910
Director Xia really treats you differently.

240
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:01,240
For people, what matters is fate.

241
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,610
Director Xia and I are people whose heads are really round.

242
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:08,050
Heads really round?

243
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:11,350
You are so dumb. It means that we get along well.

244
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:15,390
Right, fate is destined by God.

245
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,540
We cannot compare.

246
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,700
Come in.

247
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:30,210
President Tang, you were looking for me?

248
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,790
I just called you. You are still working overtime this late?

249
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,300
Aren't you also working overtime?

250
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,820
What's the matter? I have been so busy on my side.

251
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,840
Let's first forget about our work. I'm going to treat you to dinner.

252
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,880
After eating our fill, we'll roll up our sleeves and work hard.

253
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,250
Have some more. Here.

254
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,850
Thank you, President Tang.

255
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,770
President Tang, I really didn't think

256
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:00,270
with your status, you would come to this type of place to eat.

257
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:03,390
I really didn't come to save money.

258
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:07,870
It is because drinking and chatting here are really comfortable.

259
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:12,230
Did you not realize the way you're talking is more and more like...

260
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,960
Mo Fei?

261
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,820
Really?

262
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,600
Here, have a drink.

263
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,860
Comfortable. I really like this type of place.

264
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:35,270
In this type of place, you can actually see a family atmosphere.

265
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:38,740
Only with this atmosphere is there the human touch.

266
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:43,000
When I was in France, I wanted to eat these the most.

267
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:48,160
Are all of you designers so sentimental?

268
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,430
I personally am sentimental.

269
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,820
I think that only with sentiment can you really feel things.

270
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,540
Only when you feel, can you create.

271
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,680
I think it's a good thing to feel.

272
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:06,240
This way, it'll bring an endless feeling to your design.

273
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,010
President Tang, I have always had a question I wanted to ask you.

274
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:15,850
Stop being so polite with me.

275
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,500
Say it.

276
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,590
Songtang is not a brand that makes the most money for Mingyuan.

277
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,970
So why did you use so much effort

278
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:26,160
to buy the embroidery workshop?

279
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,530
Why do you have to carry such a heavy burden for a brand whose future is unknown?

280
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,270
Only after I came to Mingyuan,

281
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:35,700
did I slowly realize for Songtang,

282
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,440
how much energy and money you have put towards it.

283
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,840
From my eyes, this already is not

284
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,520
a regular expanding plan.

285
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,800
Then I will answer your question.

286
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,790
First off, Songtang's future isn't unknown.

287
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,360
You still have Mo Fei.

288
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,480
Also, I have a group of people like you guys to help me

289
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,450
expand the traditional Chinese culture.

290
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:02,200
If there weren't people like you guys by my side,

291
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,340
then I would feel that it is really hard.

292
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:08,400
Under stress, there is a courageous man.

293
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:14,750
Here, for your words. Cheers.

294
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:23,990
To tell you the truth...

295
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,890
When I first took over Songtang,

296
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,250
I really didn't think much about it.

297
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:33,160
I only wanted to fulfill my father's dream.

298
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,760
But in the end, from buying the embroidery workshop,

299
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,020
to looking for designers, trying to acquire SLC,

300
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,770
in my journey,

301
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:45,230
I came to realize that I had unconsciously

302
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,120
invested myself in it.

303
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,190
It wasn't only for the sake of my father's dream,

304
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,600
but also for the sake of my dream.

305
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,000
And most importantly, for the dream of China!

306
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,600
Your thoughts...

307
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:07,100
and feelings are particularly understood by me.

308
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,320
This is probably the charm of the traditional culture.

309
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,950
People like us are drawn to it

310
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,260
and become fascinated.

311
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,220
When we see the arts that we appreciate

312
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,460
become more accepted and well-liked by more people,

313
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,800
that kind of anticipation and joy

314
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,630
is not easily understood by others.

315
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,970
You are really great like this.

316
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:37,250
I feel a bit shameful sitting here with you.

317
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,470
Compared to what you've done, I've done so little.

318
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,670
You can't compare something like this.

319
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,870
First of all, you are a designer.

320
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:49,480
You should do the best that you can do.

321
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,420
To make Songtang shine bright,

322
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,650
you must be confident in yourself.

323
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:59,300
You should know that I'm your strongest support.

324
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,360
A toast to Songtang.

325
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,580
Toast to Songtang.

326
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,460
You can't drink it up?

327
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,120
President Tang, I have to say another word.

328
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,940
After drinking this cup,

329
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:29,120
I will think of you as my trusted confidant.

330
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,450
A gentleman will die for his confidant.

331
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,870
Mingxuan?

332
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,780
It's so late, why are you here?

333
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:09,970
I was drinking with Cheng Yang. When I went home,

334
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,110
I suddenly missed you a lot.

335
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,530
So I wanted to come over to see you.

336
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,910
You went drinking with Cheng Yang without taking me along.

337
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,000
Why will a man bring you along to drink with another man?

338
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:31,250
How can you be this kind of person?

339
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,100
What kind of person am I?

340
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,510
Nothing.

341
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,250
Speak.

342
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,010
You are a male chauvinist.

343
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,660
I'm a male chauvinist?

344
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,800
I really respect women.

345
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,880
Is that so? So why did you say when drinking,

346
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,540
only the men drink. Can't a woman drink, too?

347
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,780
Is drinking only made for men?

348
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:12,420
I'm going to find Cheng Yang tomorrow to drink together.

349
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,820
You can only drink with one man: me.

350
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,720
Male chauvinist,

351
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,260
plus a high desire to control.

352
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,800
You are not cute like this.

353
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,010
Add to that, not telling what you really think.

354
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,160
This is the company.

355
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,870
But we are off work.

356
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,420
We are off work.

357
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,310
What are you doing?

358
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:04,810
What were you talking with Cheng Yang about?

359
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,420
Good stuff.

360
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,470
What good stuff?

361
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:15,500
Everything that's happened since you got back.

362
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,980
It's all been good.

363
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,220
In that case,

364
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,360
I'm your lucky star then?

365
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,450
You are not only my lucky star,

366
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,000
to my life

367
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,620
and to my work,

368
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,960
you are always my motivational force.

369
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,340
The weather is still a little cold in Shanghai.

370
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,050
Are you cold?

371
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:50,690
- Withstand it.
- Withstand it?

372
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,820
Do you feel warm this way?

373
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,360
Yes.

374
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,910
Let's not go home then.

375
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:04,550
How about I keep hugging you here?

376
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,600
Won't it be colder if we don't go home?

377
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,230
You won't be cold if I keep hugging you.

378
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:12,900
It's still a little cold.

379
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,640
Originally, I was going to walk you home.

380
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,270
How did it turn out that you are the one walking me home?

381
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,630
It so happens, after walking you home,

382
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,990
I'm sober from the drinking.

383
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,000
Brother-in-Law. Sister.

384
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,860
It's so cold today.

385
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,140
Under this weather,

386
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,450
I even saw a lovey-dovey couple hugging and kissing at the intersection.

387
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:35,720
They must be crazy.

388
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,760
He's talking about you.

389
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,480
Why did you come out without many clothes on?

390
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,600
I went to buy something to eat.

391
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,330
Aren't you on a diet?

392
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:50,480
I'm so hungry that I can't sleep.

393
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,920
Sister,

394
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,960
don't you always drag me to eat midnight snacks?

395
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,720
Why are you reminding me about dieting today?

396
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,540
Am I bothering you?

397
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:03,350
You continue. I'm leaving first.

398
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,420
You are asking for a beating!

399
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:08,870
Brother-in-Law, you don't have to escort her next time and she will get home safely.

400
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,470
Why?

401
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:21,320
What does that mean?

402
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,950
I'm fat.

403
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,670
You're not fat. You've lost a lot of weight.

404
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,710
Okay.

405
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,310
You worked hard tonight.

406
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,970
What hard work?

407
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,230
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
- Good night.

408
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,980
Go back safe.

409
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,310
Bye-bye.

410
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,460
Go. Go home.

411
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,060
Still looking?

412
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,180
Did I say something wrong? Why doesn't your honey walk you upstairs?

413
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:14,720
Wait.

414
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,920
You and Brother-in-Law are progressing quite fast.

415
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,550
Should I prepare a red envelope already?
 (T/N: for a wedding gift)

416
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:22,080
I haven't asked you yet. When did you start calling him that?

417
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,150
That's not important. I'm just concerned that you might be taken advantage of.

418
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,430
Taken advantage? Who would do that?

419
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,910
No idea. But I know that

420
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:34,910
our family and President Tang's family backgrounds are hugely different.

421
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:37,130
I'm afraid that you'll be bullied when you are married.

422
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:40,280
Shut up. We're nowhere close to that.

423
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,790
I'm being serious.

424
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,110
You and President Tang are so in love now.

425
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:49,810
Sooner or later you'll discuss marriage.

426
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:53,490
Weren't you hungry? Eat. Eat something.

427
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:55,440
This is all for you.

428
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,540
Sister, I'm really worried about you.

429
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,470
What are you worried about?

430
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:07,040
I'm concerned that you're addicted to love.

431
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,760
When you and President Tang really reach the happy ending,

432
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,050
will you forget your ideals and pursuits?

433
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:15,780
I'm different from you. To me,

434
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:18,410
I want both love and career.

435
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,760
You want to grab onto love with one hand and career with the other hand.

436
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,920
What will you use to fight in life?

437
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,680
You've always lectured me this.

438
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:30,390
One shouldn't be too greedy and want everything.

439
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,660
That does make quite a bit of sense.

440
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:37,520
It's not just quite a bit, but a lot of sense.

441
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,150
You are just a new graduate.

442
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:44,810
Why are you acting like a wise old man?

443
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:46,860
Then you tell me if that makes sense.

444
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,950
You should take care of your own affairs first.

445
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:52,580
I am the one who is different from you.

446
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,380
I will achieve career success first before entangling myself in romance.

447
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:00,420
That's quite a lot of self-confidence. Let's see how long you'll last.

448
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:03,520
Why shouldn't I last? I don't have a girlfriend.

449
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,250
If you don't understand, then just go rest early.

450
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,160
Meng Jing and I still have to discuss some design issues.

451
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:15,120
- Go, go.
- No more talking. I'm going to bend then.

452
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:23,340
Everyone is working very hard during this period of time.

453
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:28,130
However, I want to say that our hard work is worthwhile.

454
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:31,690
I just got the news. Our Water Colors series

455
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:33,900
and Director Xia's Sunset Glow series

456
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:37,390
are both entering the main show of the Symphony of Clouds and Mist product launch.

457
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,280
At that time, there will be many domestic and international designers

458
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,930
along with top-tier media attending the event.

459
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:46,400
Wow. Yes!

460
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,470
Therefore, we can't slack off.

461
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:51,720
We have to keep working hard to successfully complete this mission.

462
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

463
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,150
Our designing portion has basically been completed at this time.

464
00:34:57,150 --> 00:35:00,330
We are about to enter the fabric's production and material selection.

465
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:04,620
Dong Dong, go to the fabric workshop

466
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:09,560
- to gain understanding and make contacts. Speak politely with the older craft masters. You must respect the elders.
- Yes.

467
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:14,250
I am responsible for plate making. Mo Fei is responsible for embroidery, as she is good at that.

468
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,990
Yu Xia, you will assist me.

469
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:20,050
- Dong Dong, remind everyone about the specific tasks.
- Yes.

470
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:22,650
Roll up our sleeves and press forward!

471
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,690
Okay. Great.

472
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,720
Director Xia, we applied for the fabric three days ago, but still haven't received it.

473
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,010
When will we receive it?

474
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:35,210
Wait a little while. Fabrics are in shortage lately.

475
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:37,880
When the fabric arrives, someone will notify you.

476
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,680
But I just saw Designer Liu's assistant holding

477
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,920
the same fabric that we want.

478
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,730
- Why don't we have any?
- Because they applied in advance.

479
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:49,880
But based on what I heard, they applied just yesterday.

480
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,970
Should I report to you Liu Pei's daily work progress

481
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:57,480
to match up to your special status?

482
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:02,700
I don't have any special status. I only hope for equal treatment.

483
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,660
Besides, Director Xia, you are the design director.

484
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:09,680
Why are you always making it difficult for a designer's assistant?

485
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,250
What is this attitude?

486
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:14,720
I find it difficult to respect you based on your behavior.

487
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:21,030
We both understand your purpose in coming to Mingyuan.

488
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,530
I came to Mingyuan only to help a friend finish his designs.

489
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,820
Nice excuse. Finish his designs?

490
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,990
If you really want to do designs,

491
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:35,930
why come to Mingyuan as an assistant to a designer?

492
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:38,110
Just say a few nice words to Mingxuan.

493
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:41,530
He will naturally give you a higher position.

494
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,120
I've already told you.

495
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,540
I came to Mingyuan to help Cheng Yang finish the design for Water Colors.

496
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:50,180
It has nothing to do with President Tang.

497
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,330
I've seen too many women like you.

498
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:56,070
With young age, good looks, and some talent, you become greedy without shame.

499
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:59,720
But to me, it's just trivial.

500
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:03,050
Since it's so trivial, why does Director Xia

501
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:07,660
keep trying to get me away from President Tang?

502
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,930
Aren't you contradicting yourself?

503
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:12,780
You really don't know what Mingxuan needs.

504
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,320
You also don't know what a huge burden he carries on his shoulder.

505
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,890
His being with you is a total waste of time.

506
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:23,610
Arguing with you is a total waste of my time.

507
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,580
Those who want to marry Mingxuan

508
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,460
have lined up from Mingyuan all the way to Huangpu River.

509
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,730
I advise you to face reality.

510
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:36,070
I didn't realize that Director Xia

511
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:40,520
thinks a woman's aspiration is to get married to someone.

512
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,990
That's quite childish.

513
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,230
Don't talk big principles with me,

514
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:50,010
unless you swear that you don't have such thoughts.

515
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,670
Why should I swear to you?

516
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:55,750
Even if I marry President Tang tomorrow, it will still be my affair and has nothing to do with you.

517
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:58,450
I don't need to explain it to anyone.

518
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,350
What are you two chatting about instead of eating lunch?

519
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:06,590
We were talking about fabrics.

520
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,300
I will call the purchasing department right now

521
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,690
to tell them to prepare the fabrics and deliver them to you.

522
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,580
I'm leaving first.

523
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,610
Mo Fei.

524
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,710
Sorry.

525
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,690
Why are you apologizing?

526
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:53,420
I was a little impulsive and said some words

527
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:57,530
that may have some negative effect upon you.

528
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,550
Director Xia is making it difficult for you again?

529
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:07,580
She didn't gain any advantage, so it doesn't really count.

530
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,180
So do you plan to marry me tomorrow?

531
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,510
What?

532
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:17,900
I was just looking at the calendar. Tomorrow is an auspicious day.

533
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,000
A sunny day with no clouds.

534
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,390
How about this? In a few days, it will be Saturday. Let's have our parents meet one another first.

535
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:28,870
Then we go buy a house on Sunday.

536
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:31,840
You confirm a list of guests on Wednesday.

537
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,910
This time next month,

538
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:36,470
we will hold our wedding.

539
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:41,130
I-I-I don't know what you are talking about.

540
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:44,990
You prefer the Chinese style for the wedding, right? I like it, too.

541
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,820
Oh yes! Do you want to make your own wedding gown?

542
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:51,700
Is one month too rushed?

543
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,080
You... Do you know what you are saying?

544
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,980
I was only saying it out of anger just now.

545
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,550
But I'm taking it seriously. What now?

546
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,580
It's rare to see you speechless.

547
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:15,460
You are fooling me, right?

548
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:19,650
You are bullying me. I'm gone.

549
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,740
Can I apologize?

550
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,120
I don't accept your apology. I'm going back to France right now.

551
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,770
No, I'll go back as soon as the project is finished.

552
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:33,450
I don't want to be stuck between you and Director Xia and get doused with anger.

553
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:36,020
What will I do if you leave?

554
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,570
You-You... I tell you,

555
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:43,080
you better not do this.

556
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,980
♫ Falling into love's black hole just like that ♫

557
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:54,470
Everything I said just now, I meant it.

558
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:01,010
I will always be here, waiting for you.

559
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,870
♫ You always like to look at me dazedly ♫

560
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:09,520
♫ Eyes so gentle, we all laugh ♫

561
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,950
This is in the company. Bad impression. What if people see us?

562
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:15,070
So what if they see us?

563
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:18,620
How can you be so domineering?

564
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,280
Let's go. I'll take you to lunch.

565
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,040
Let's see how you perform.

566
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,960
See how I behave?

567
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,370
You don't even want to marry me. What good is eating lunch?

568
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:34,380
♫ Slowly, slowly get close to me ♫

569
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,580
I-I-I-I'm hungry.

570
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,580
You are so fat already. You still want to eat?

571
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,320
How am I fat?

572
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,640
Go. Let's go eat.

573
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,620
- Let's go eat.
- All right.

574
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:57,780
♫ I say you're an April day ♫

575
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:01,930
♫ The sound of your laughter lights everything up ♫

00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:05,410

shift as one would in a dance ♫

00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,030
♫ The gentle breeze blown during dusk ♫

580
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:24,730
♫ The unintentional sparkle of the planetesimal ♫

581
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:29,220
♫ The fine rain that's sprinkled in front of the flower ♫

♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫
