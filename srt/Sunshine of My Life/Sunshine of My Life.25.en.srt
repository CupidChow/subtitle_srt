3
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,130
Hello, Duoduo.

4
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,080
Mo Fei.

5
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,680
Guess where I am right now.

6
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,310
Cheng Yang's home.

7
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,780
How did you know?

8
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,900
Did Cheng Yang tell you?

9
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,880
Is it necessary for Cheng Yang to tell me? Just look at your face...

10
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,460
Looking too happy...

11
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,880
Obviously, the two of you are back together.

12
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,940
Every day, I am hoping and wishing,

13
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,880
wishing that you will come back soon. Will you be on vacation soon?

14
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,090
How did you know? You are so well-informed.

15
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,110
It's not that I am well-informed. I just care about you.

16
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,670
Even though I'm not in France...

17
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,800
but my heart is always with you.

18
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,860
Also, I want you to come back soon...

19
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,720
so we can hang out.

20
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,970
Also, Cheng Yang also wants to discuss something with you...

21
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,230
Cheng Yang wants to discuss something with me?

22
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,660
He didn't tell me why.

23
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,380
I will ask him for specifics when he gets back.

24
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,900
I just heard about it.

25
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,930
It's so late! He's still not home?

26
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,850
Isn't that right? He works overtime every day.

27
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,530
I don't know what kind of work that person named Xia

28
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,060
gave him that he can't finish it every day.

29
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,760
Person named Xia?

30
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,930
Duoduo, I'm home.

31
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,520
Come over quickly.

32
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,760
- Who are you talking to?
- Cheng Yang is home.

33
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,700
- Mo Fei. Aren't you looking for her?
- Mo Fei?

34
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,080
- Aren't you looking for her?
- Yes, yes.

35
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,070
Hello, Mo Fei. Long time no see.

36
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,800
Long time no see.

37
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,550
I heard you will return to China when you're on school break.

38
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,970
Do you want to come and be my assistant?

39
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,320
Me? Is it okay for me to be your assistant?

40
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,050
What do you mean?

41
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,790
It's fine when you're not home, but as soon as you're back, you're stealing her from me.

42
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,030
If she becomes your assistant, what about me? Who's going to have fun with me?

43
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,080
Duoduo, don't be fussy. Mo Fei, let's talk about official business.

44
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,600
I especially need an assistant now. Come and be my assistant.

45
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,810
Wait a minute. I'll send you some of my design sketches.

46
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,410
Wait, okay?

47
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,980
I'll send it to you, you accept the pictures.

48
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,810
Is it appropriate to send them to me?

49
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,210
How is it not appropriate?

50
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:05,230
You right now, are Mingyuan's lady boss.

51
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,580
This is just a concept sketch. It's fine.

52
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,440
Being with Duoduo, she's really a bad influence on you.

53
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:18,180
What do you mean? I'm here right now, why are you talking bad about me?

54
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,370
I really like this concept.

55
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,730
I also like the designs for this series.

56
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:28,460
This belt-wrapped dress set is really unique.

57
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,790
It has its own appeal.

58
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,520
It has the elegance and tranquility of a landscape painting

59
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,330
as well as the randomness and natural look of ink splashes.

60
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,310
And the waist belt

61
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,530
will bounce on the skirt when walking.

62
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:47,190
When it is windy, the sleeves will definitely flutter.

63
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,620
Stop complimenting him.

64
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,790
If you continue, he'll become arrogant.

65
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:57,430
Mo Fei, since you like it, come back and help me.

66
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:02,350
You also know how important this press conference is to President Tang.

67
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,660
But my school break is not that long.

68
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,360
And I still have to prepare for my assignment for school.

69
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,810
I don't need you to work daily.

70
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:17,980
To be honest, if it's anyone else, I won't be at ease.

71
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,070
This is my first showcase since joining Mingyuan.

72
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,770
I can't tarnish our school's reputation.

73
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:29,560
Well, how about this. Let me think about it. Besides, I still have many days before I return.

74
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,930
Then, I will wait for your good news.

75
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,590
Bye-bye.

76
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,820
Mo Fei, the end-of-term exam has already been arranged.

77
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:57,350
You will be taking your break soon. As soon as you return, turn in your assignment.

78
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:02,840
After a week, your grades will be posted on the school's educational administration system.

79
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:09,170
How will you present your design this time?

80
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,020
I want to use a fabric called ramie for my design.

81
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,420
This is one of the oldest fabrics in China.

82
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,590
Chinese people have been using it to make clothes

83
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,330
for the past 4,700 years.

84
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,400
This fabric is part of the

85
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,190
Chinese traditional culture for thousands of years?

86
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,300
Is that it?

87
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,680
Yes.

88
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,530
That is why I want to try using this oriental fabric to make clothes

89
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,680
and see how it can be fused

90
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,730
with the Western style.

91
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,220
Very interesting.

92
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,200
I think the most important thing in making designs

93
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,350
is finding the right fabric

94
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,860
to present the best results.

95
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,820
I don't think that oriental fabrics

96
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,190
can only be used for oriental designs.

97
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:05,820
I also don't think that Western designs

98
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,050
can only use Western fabrics.

99
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,480
I really agree with your point of view.

100
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,430
You will do as you said and use...

101
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,290
- ramie fabric.
- Exactly.

102
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,270
You will use this fabric

103
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,470
together with Westernstyle designs.

104
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:26,160
I believe this will be an innovative breakthrough

105
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,020
in the fusion of Chinese and Western styles.

106
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,120
Yes.

107
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,710
You'll be leaving for your break, enjoy it.

108
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:41,160
Above all, I wish you good luck in the preparation for your final exam.

109
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,390
We will, thank you.

110
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,280
Good luck.

111
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,750
Finally, our break is here. I can rest and sleep well now.

112
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,860
I think you'll be catching up on your dramas.

113
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,520
I know, right? I don't have much ambition in my life. I just love to catch up on dramas.

114
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,670
But I'll still do the work you give me.

115
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:01,670
During the process of the exam, I'll be your best teammate.

116
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,900
All right! You catch up on your dramas well and I'll take a rest.

117
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,790
After two weeks, let's do our work well.

118
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,290
Do you still need to rest?

119
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,970
Of course, I need to rest.

120
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,110
I'm planning to go back to Shanghai.

121
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,730
You finally have a break and you're still going back to Shanghai?

122
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,660
I want to go find ramie and collect some local cultural materials.

123
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,930
I must get a good grade on this assignment.

124
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,630
Are you sure that's all?

125
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,640
I think you want to go back and see President Tang.

126
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,680
You value your boyfriend more than your friends.

127
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,210
I value my boyfriend more than my friends?

128
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:35,220
I want nothing more than to be with you 24 hours a day. You still can't get enough of me?

129
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,100
If you say it that way, you're right.

130
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,340
But don't just think about dating when you go back.

131
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,930
Bring some snacks back for me.

132
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,440
Otherwise, I'll be mad.

133
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,090
All right, I got it.

134
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,350
What do you want to have for dinner?

135
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,110
Tonight, I want to eat anything.

136
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,040
I'm starving.

137
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,660
I want to eat hotpot.

138
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,670
Mo Fei, can we chat for a few minutes?

139
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,090
What's up?

140
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,730
Wait for me.

141
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,060
Go in and wait for me.

142
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,100
What is this?

143
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,350
The clothes we discussed that night.

144
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,770
Now, the show has come to an end.

145
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,560
It turned out so well and I want you to have it.

146
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,640
I can't. I didn't do anything, only giving some advice.

147
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,480
It's too precious, I really can't accept these.

148
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,020
Of course, you can take it.

149
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,490
Without your excellent advice,

150
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,150
there wouldn't be these great clothes.

151
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:43,110
The show's turnout wouldn't have been this good either.

152
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,490
And it's not a gift.

153
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,750
It's the result of our cooperation.

154
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,560
Don't be nervous. I don't mean anything.

155
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,720
Okay! Thank you so much.

156
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:59,630
I hear you are on your school break.

157
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,150
Yeah.

158
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,500
Any plans?

159
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,720
Just doing my assignments. There will be exams after the break.

160
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,860
You make vacations sound so boring.

161
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,940
You know, vacation is vital for the designer.

162
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,010
Visit Europe during the vacation,

163
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,480
for inspiration. It's really important.

164
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,520
Thank you for your suggestion. I have to go if you don't mind.

165
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,130
Sure.

166
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,870
Come! There's no need to be too polite. We have a lot of dishes here

167
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,400
all made by Xueling.

168
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,600
Go ahead and taste them.

169
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,380
I've tasted Xueling's delicious food before.

170
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,400
So today, I'll eat a lot.

171
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,600
As long as Auntie Lu likes it, then it's good.

172
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,800
Mingxuan, make sure to eat more too.

173
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,900
I'll take care of myself.

174
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,400
Old Tang,

175
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,400
I've saved this alcohol for 30 years.

176
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,600
I've brought it out today for an important reason.

177
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,600
I'm announcing it here.

178
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,100
Old Xia brought out his secret alcohol that he's saved for 30 years.

179
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,700
He definitely wants to discuss something important.

180
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,400
Here it is. I'd like to transfer all my company shares

181
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,200
to my daughter, Xueling.

182
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,800
Dad, what are you saying?

183
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,500
I've decided.

184
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,000
Old Xia... this is a very important matter.

185
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,400
Shouldn't you take more time to think about it?

186
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,400
I'm even older than you by a few years, yet I haven't thought about retirement yet.

187
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,100
Uncle Xia, although Xueling is excellent at her job,

188
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,400
but it has nothing to do with your retirement.

189
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,800
Yes, this is so sudden. You haven't discussed it with me yet.

190
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,800
All of you may think this is very sudden, but I've thought about it for a long time.

191
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,000
Although it looks like my health is better than Uncle Tang's,

192
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,400
but I've noticed that these two years, I've lost motivation.

193
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,600
So I think that based on my current condition, if I stay at Mingyuan,

194
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,600
it won't be good for the company's development.

195
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,000
That's all.

196
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
When Old Xia puts it that way, I feel like my health is getting poorer, too.

197
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,000
Let's eat first.

198
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,400
This problem... let's discuss it more later.

199
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,000
- Okay, let's give a toast.
- Okay.

200
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

201
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,800
What do you think? Our Xueling's cooking is pretty good, right?

202
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,700
Of course. I often ate Xueling's cooking.

203
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,300
What? In the future, do you want to come to freeload and eat at our house every day?

204
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,620
What do you mean, coming to freeload and eat?

205
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,800
Your Xueling is mine, too.

206
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,800
Who said she's yours?

207
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,600
You don't believe it?

208
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,200
Xueling?

209
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,400
Okay, okay.

210
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,200
I haven't mentioned it yet that several days ago,

211
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,320
my Xueling was pissed off because of your brat.

212
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,600
And you don't even lecture him.

213
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,390
Youth has his temper.

214
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,200
Besides, it's normal for young couples to quarrel.

215
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,300
Didn't he bring her back to you?

216
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,400
Easy for you to say.

217
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,600
It was not your daughter who was being wronged.

218
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,100
I just want them to be happy and get married soon.

219
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,700
And have babies before we are too old.

220
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,200
Then, we will have something to do.

221
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,600
I promise you that day isn't far.

222
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,400
Good! I'm looking forward to your marriage proposal.

223
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,600
Just wait for it.

224
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,860
You scared me! Why are you here? Aren't you undergoing closed training?

225
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,400
Aren't you afraid of being punished?

226
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,820
How is training more important than my elder sister?

227
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,800
Of course, I have to pick you up when you come back home.

228
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,800
That's right. Seems like you have a conscience.

229
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,000
Come to think of it, after a few days of training,

230
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
your manners seem different, like of a model.

231
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,200
Of course, they do.

232
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,200
You are not bad yourself. After going to France, you look a little like a designer.

233
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,600
What do you mean a little? I, your sister, was a designer, to begin with.

234
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,400
All right! You are the best designer.

235
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,600
Did Mom tell you she would be back?

236
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,000
No, she didn't.

237
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,600
She only told me.

238
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,100
When will she come back?

239
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,000
In a few days.

240
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,800
I'm used to her coming and leaving without a trace.

241
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,500
Yeah, she's like this every time.

242
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,600
Let's go. That way.

243
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,400
I'm back! Did you miss me?

244
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,500
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

245
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,360
Your home is well cleaned.

246
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,600
So tidy.

247
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,900
East or west, home is the best.

248
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,600
Don't lie there.

249
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,000
Can't your posture be a little more elegant?

250
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,100
This is my home, I can lie down wherever I like.

251
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,800
Leave me alone.

252
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,200
I would, if you were not my sister.

253
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,400
I asked for leave just for picking you up.

254
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,600
I have to go soon.

255
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,000
Okay, just go.

256
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,600
Big Sister, such murderous intentions.

257
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,800
You will break my heart if you're like this.

258
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,000
Besides,

259
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,200
don't you wish to spend more time with your little brother

260
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,100
who's going to be a supermodel, famous around the world?

261
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,370
I don't have the time.

262
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,800
Even though I came back for my vacation,

263
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,800
I have a lot of things to do. I have to write my assignments.

264
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,100
Also, I need to prepare lots of materials and select fabric.

265
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,720
You know, when I was in France,

266
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,600
I knew a brilliant designer.

267
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,000
I came back to be his assistant this time.

268
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
We will together attend the launch of Mingyuan's new designs.

269
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,800
Just thinking about it overwhelms me.

270
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,800
Isn't it a piece of cake for you?

271
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,600
My sister has both beauty and brains!

272
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,000
The incarnation of Athena and Venus.

273
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,400
You're smart enough to be an assistant, capable enough to participate in a press conference.

274
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,600
And besides that...

275
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,400
You are right!

276
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,600
Did you just say Mingyuan?

277
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,200
Isn't that the company of President Tang?

278
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,000
Can't I?

279
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,000
I understand.

280
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,000
You have something on your mind.

281
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,800
What are you thinking about?

282
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,600
Do you think your sister is the kind to abuse power for her personal gain?

283
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,200
Oh my...

284
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,400
I didn't even tell him I came back.

285
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,300
Why didn't you tell him?

286
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Because... I want to surprise him!

287
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,800
This is a problem between adults, you wimpy kid! Why are you meddling in our affairs?

288
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:38,100
Also, you can't tell him! If you tell him, your death is guaranteed!

289
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,000
Sister... you are the most unpredictable person I have ever seen!

290
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,800
There's no one like you.

291
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,200
Look how you behave towards President Tang!

292
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,400
Towards me? There is no brotherly love!

293
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,600
You still know what brotherly love is.

294
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,700
You must not tell him!

295
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,200
Fine, I got it!

296
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,900
Sis, the fridge is packed with meat and vegetables.

297
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,000
If you want to cook in the afternoon, you may. If not, just order takeaway.

298
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,800
I guess you will come back pretty late.

299
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,800
She already fell asleep?

300
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,300
She's a grown-up yet she doesn't know that if she sleeps there she will catch a cold!

301
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,600
Where are you taking me to?

302
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,800
I am taking you to sleep. If you catch a cold, I will have to take care of you!

303
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,700
I want to sleep on the couch.

304
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,500
I have just seen the material you sent regarding the construction of the new embroidery workshop.

305
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,000
I am proud of you, Mister Tang.

306
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,900
You attach importance to traditional craftsmanship.

307
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,400
It is very impressive.

308
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,400
Thank you, I hope that I can make you be even more sure about it.

309
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
And besides that,

310
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,400
Suzhou Embroidery is not only a part of traditional Chinese culture,

311
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,000
but also a part of the world heritage, in my opinion.

312
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,800
Right. As designers,

313
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,200
we should promote and spread a culture like this.

314
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,000
I have already forwarded the material to my superiors.

315
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,600
Now, they are even more interested in cooperating with Mingyuan.

316
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,400
I hope we will have the opportunity to create even more surprises.

317
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,000
Thank you so much!

318
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,300

♫ I want to give you the world's gentlest understanding ♫

322
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,800
She hung up on me?

323
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,200
♫ When you feel tired, ♫

324
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,200
♫ I'll be your softest pillow ♫

325
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,600
♫ I want… ♫

326
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,000
♫ you to personally tell me you love me too ♫

327
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,200
Who is there?

328
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,300
It's me!

329
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,600
♫ You're the one I love extremely ♫

330
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,600
Mingxuan?

331
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,000
I mean... why are you calling me at this hour?

332
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,800
What are you doing?

333
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,400
Right, at this time I should be sleeping!

334
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,900
I will hang up! Let's talk tomorrow!

335
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,600
Right, it must be afternoon in France, by now!

336
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,000
How come you are sleeping during day time?

337
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,300
Are you skipping classes again?

338
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,200
No, no, today, André...

339
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,000
has some stuff to deal with... therefore, he changed the time of the class.

340
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Yesterday, I stayed up the entire night until noon...

341
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,200
I just came back, so I am taking a nap.

342
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,100
Yes...that's how things are.

343
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,000
How could you develop such a bad working and rest habit?

344
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,800
I am telling you,

345
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,200
from 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.,

346
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,200
it's the best time to work. Afterwards...

347
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,600
no matter how strong you feel, physically or mentally, you will just overwork yourself.

348
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
Of course, it will affect your health!

349
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,400
It will also affect your skin!

350
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,500
No matter how many makeup products you buy, they will be useless!

351
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,200
Right, right! I can't stay up the entire night!

352
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,600
I can't stay awake!

353
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,100
Why are you so tired?

354
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,200
Wake up, now!

355
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,200
How will you sleep in the night if you sleep now? You will have insomnia again!

356
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,000
No, I won't!

357
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,500
I wonder how an absent-minded girl like you

358
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,100
would look lying next to me.

359
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,800
Who is absent-minded?

360
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,600
You!

361
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,800
All right, go back to sleep!

362
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,400
Bye-bye!

363
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,030
That brat.

364
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,630
Director Fang.

365
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,870
Where's Mo Fei?

366
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,580
She's not here.

367
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,720
Not here? Is she at work?

368
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,080
Let's say that she is, but she's not in Paris.

369
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,510
Not in Paris?

370
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:14,290
She has a design friend who called her to be an assistant, she went to help.

371
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,980
Who?

372
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,040
I think his name was Cheng Yang.

373
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,020
Didn't Cheng Yang return to China?

374
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,810
Yes, Mo Fei also went back two days ago.

375
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,970
Oh, all right. Thank you.

376
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,640
Bye-bye.

377
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,590
How did you get in?

378
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:58,730
Your keys are always under the doormat.

379
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,090
Attracts thieves too much, huh?

380
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,520
What? Am I not welcome here?

381
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,310
Of course, you are. Why not?

382
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:09,040
I just knew it.

383
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,690
Right. Once I'm finished with work,

384
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:15,390
I will have more time to take care of you.

385
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:18,330
I'm not a child. I don't need you to look after me.

386
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:21,520
To me, you're always going to be a child.

387
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:27,960
Actually, I want to go back.

388
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,050
I just came back and you want to leave? You won't eat dinner with me?

389
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:35,100
I'm not talking about Paris.

390
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,930
It is China.

391
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:44,230
I want to go back home, to China.

392
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,590
If I want to go back,

393
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,110
will you go with me?

394
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:10,520
If you want to go, I will go with you.

395
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,810
Really? That's amazing!

396
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,680
I knew you cared for me the most!

397
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,230
You are always a sister that can't grow up.

398
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,900
Right?

399
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,850
I already have it. Thank you.

400
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:40,210
I know you have it.

401
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,520
Then, why did you give it to me?

402
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,780
To help me twist off the cap.

403
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,460
Didn't you already twist it off earlier?

404
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,280
You don't get it.

405
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,040
This is a benefit for you.

406
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,760
Let me ask you.

407
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,090
If there was a girl who

408
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:14,320
asked you to help twist off her bottle cap, what would you do?

409
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,550
I'd help her twist it off.

410
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,480
- No!
- What are you doing?

411
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,500
You can only help me twist off bottle caps!

412
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,260
Why? Isn't it just a bottle cap?

413
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,480
Stop asking why. You just can't.

414
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:31,620
Twisting a bottle's cap is a girlfriend's privilege, stupid.

415
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,870
What did you say?

416
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:36,120
Nothing.

417
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,500
Fine. I'll promise you.

418
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,200
I won't twist off caps for other women.

419
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,080
Can you answer a question of mine?

420
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,230
What?

421
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,720
It is, when you girls start dating,

422
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,990
do you guys all become really scary?

423
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:03,190
What are you trying to say, Mo Fan? How am I scary?

424
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:06,120
I'm talking about my sister, not you.

425
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,290
Your sister? What's up with your sister?

426
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:15,040
I feel like after she started dating your cousin, she's changed a lot.

427
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:20,250
Isn't it normal for girls to change after they start dating?

428
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:26,170
Also, who doesn't want to become better for the person that they're dating?

429
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,810
I didn't see anywhere that she became better.

430
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:33,680
I feel like I'm living with a stranger at home.

431
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,100
Your sister is back?

432
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,580
No, she's not back.

433
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:43,560
It was just an example.

434
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,360
Just giving an example.

435
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:49,360
You're going to cause misunderstandings with these examples.

436
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,850
No, no. It's a misunderstanding.

437
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:56,810
I-I'm not wrong, she'll come home one day. Right?

438
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:03,300
You... You must have been infected by my brother.

439
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,160
Why don't you learn something good?

440
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,700
You learned his obliviousness.

441
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,540
What did I say wrong?

442
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:14,290
You two need to team up.

443
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:19,320
Your team will be called GT Men.
(T/N : From 'Gang Tie Zhi Nan', meaning dense guys)

444
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,450
- GT Men?
- Yeah.

445
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,070
What does that mean?

446
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:28,020
Dense guys!

447
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,590
What a very dense guy.

448
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:41,700
President Tang, the current market value of Mingyuan is at a warning level.

449
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,710
The drop in the market recently is great.

450
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:48,080
As to whether or not the market will continue to drop, the stock brokers are also unsure.

451
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,540
So, this time I came to give you a reminder.

452
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:56,580
If the stocks continue to drop, you should prepare repayment.

453
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,010
- Please come in.
- Dad.

454
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,690
Mingxuan.

455
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:06,590
Mr. Zhou, I understand everything you said.

456
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,290
All right, Chairman Tang. I'll take my leave.

457
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,780
Okay.

458
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:17,570
Mingxuan, have a seat.

459
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,820
You are aware of Mingyuan's current situation, right?

460
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,790
What's the matter, Dad?

461
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,960
The international economic market has been very volatile.

462
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,280
The stocks are being volatile.

463
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,280
Look at this.

464
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,400
Mingyuan's stocks have been affected and keep dropping.

465
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,710
If it continues, I am worried.

466
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:54,470
So right now, our collaboration with SLC is really important.

467
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:58,830
Especially the news conference coming up soon.

468
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,220
We cannot make the slightest mistake.

469
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:05,620
That is very important to increasing market confidence.

470
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:10,930
I came especially to talk about our collaboration with SLC.

471
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:13,190
Okay.

472
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:15,350
This is a really great chance, speak.

473
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:18,040
Just now, I finally contacted Miya.

474
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,400
She mentioned a few requirements we need to meet.

475
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,560
Yes, I am dating Mingxuan.

476
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,080
There are some things you don't mind,

477
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,610
but he minds.

478
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:49,060
And I... care about him. Because I care about him,

479
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,300
so... I will avoid you.

480
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:56,690
To me, you are just a really good friend.

481
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:14,820
Hello, Sir. Can I help you?

482
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,670
A glass of whiskey, please.

483
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:20,150
We provide red wine and different flavors of liquor.

484
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:23,550
We only offer low-alcohol beverages.

485
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,020
No whiskey?

486
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:29,180
Sorry, Sir. For this flight, we do not provide liquor with high alcohol content.

487
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:32,230
Okay, no need.

488
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,370
Brother, what's wrong?

489
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:42,230
Nothing, I wanted to have some liquor.

490
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,230
Drink liquor?

491
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,880
I thought you don't drink liquor?

492
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:51,080
I am a bit tired lately. I wanted to have some.

493
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,660
All right.

494
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,260
Who's this?

495
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,540
You drew her so well.

496
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,830
Hurry up and rest.

497
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,200
Yang Guang, come in please.

498
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,200
Why did you come...

499
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:51,600
♫ At five past ten, you suddenly appear ♫

500
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:57,200
♫ The sunlight instantly becomes hot ♫

501
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,800
♫ Like a little deer, a bump my head and blush for days ♫

502
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,000
Why didn't you tell me that you were coming?

503
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,400
Isn't it surprising and unexpected?

504
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,200
♫ The stars instantly open their eyes ♫

505
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,000
♫ The leaves and cicada start to secretly fall in love ♫

506
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,000
I missed you so much.

507
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,800
That's why I came back.

508
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,400
♫ My world changed since that moment ♫

509
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,800
♫ Tell me how to miss you less ♫

510
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,100
You should have told me when you arrived so I could pick you up.

511
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,800
If I had told you then it wouldn't have been a surprise. So unromantic!

512
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,800
Only you know romance.

513
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,400
You hit me again.

514
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,100
How do you feel seeing me just now?

515
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:51,900
I just experienced what it feels like when your heart skips a beat.

516
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,100
What do you mean?

517
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,800
When I first saw you just now,

518
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,000
my heartbeat stopped for a second.

519
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,400
Then I became so happy.

520
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,400
I just want to hold you in my arms forever.

521
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,400
Ming—

522
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,800
President Tang, do you not know this is the company office?

523
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,400
I know.

524
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,200
Did I cause you any trouble?

525
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,200
No trouble.

526
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,200
But just now..

527
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,800
Well,

528
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,400
you just came back, you should go back and unpack. I'll meet you tonight.

529
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,600
- Then I'll be going.
- Okay.

530
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,900
Don't miss me too much.

531
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,000
Be careful on your way back.

532
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,400
Try this, too.

533
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,800
Hello, everyone. May I have your attention, please?

534
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,500
Let me introduce a new colleague.

535
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,200
Hi, everyone. My name is Mo Fei.

536
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,200
I'm the assistant for Teacher Cheng. Please look after me.

537
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
That's it?

538
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,600
Mo Fei, you're too modest. Say some more.

539
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,000
I don't have much to say.

540
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,200
Okay, I'll speak for Mo Fei. She's my junior.

541
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,000
She's very devoted to Chinese Fashion.

542
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I believe, her being here, will help us a lot.

543
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,800
That's too exaggerating.

544
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,600
I'm excited.

545
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,400
Mo Fei, I recognize you. You participated in Mingyuan's competition.

546
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,600
You're the designer of the "Old tea-horse road."

547
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,400
It was well liked.

548
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,600
It's even better than award-winning works.

549
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,200
Thanks for everyone's praise.

550
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,400
I am still in the learning stage.

551
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,100
I hope we can make progress together.

552
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,800
You're too modest. With designs like yours,

553
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,200
your works have won market recognition. Unlike some people,

554
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,000
grades are average. Abilities are average, too.

555
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Besides flattering others, they're not good at anything.

556
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,200
Enough.

557
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,000
Come.

558
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,600
Time is of the essence.

559
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,100
Today, let's talk about the meeting's main topic.

560
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,800
When do we need it finalized?

561
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,400
The faster the better.

562
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,000
But there're some details we need to focus on.

563
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,200
What details?

564
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,400
To reveal the splash-ink method.

565
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,600
Look at this.

566
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,200
Director Xia! Director Xia!

567
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,300
Why are you so flustered?

568
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,800
Cheng Yang got a new assistant.

569
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,000
She's my college schoolmate, Mo Fei.

570
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Actually, President Tang's thoughts are understandable.

571
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,200
They are in love and want to see each other all the time.

572
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,000
These thoughts are nor—

573
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,200
I-It's normal.

574
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,140
Scared me.

575
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,400
My goodness. Girls are too scary.

576
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,600
Take these art books and seek some inspiration.

577
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,600
You can come to me anytime when you have any.

578
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,400
Okay?

579
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,600
What happened?

580
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,600
Nothing.

581
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,800
I just wanted to say...

582
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,000
does Director Xia know I'm here helping you?

583
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,800
She doesn't know. Why?

584
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,800
I'm scared that I will cause you trouble.

585
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,400
Cause what trouble?

586
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,400
I wrote it clearly in the contract.

587
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,200
I have the power to pick my own assistant.

588
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,300
Then that's fine. I'll go over there.

589
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,000
Wait.

590
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,480
You're acting strange today.

591
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,600
Do you have jet lag?

592
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,400
Are you trying to go meet President Tang as soon as possible?

593
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,200
Shouldn't you thank me for this opportunity?

594
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:12,300
Since you already know, you still assign me so much work.

595
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,000
I might see Duoduo and tell on you.

596
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,800
Don't.

597
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,200
Don't tell Duoduo. I'm just joking.

598
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,100
I know.

599
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,200
Mo Fei!

600
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,600
- Jiaxi!
- I missed you.

601
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,000
Long time no see. I miss you so much.

602
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,600
Freshly squeezed juice just for the amazing you.

603
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,600
Thanks.

604
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,800
How did you know I was here?

605
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,800
My colleagues told me. If they hadn't told me,

606
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,600
you would've even held it from me. Do you still take me as your friend?

607
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,800
That's not it! Didn't I just come back?

608
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,400
Why did you come back?

609
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,200
Cheng Yang wanted me to be his assistant. So I came back.

610
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,800
You're amazing. You went to France for only a little bit.

611
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,400
And you become an assistant for a famous designer soon after you come back.

612
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,200
Look at me, I am still an intern after a long time.

613
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,600
Seeing you now makes me feel envious and jealous.

614
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:20,000
It's not as great as you say. I'm only a temporary assistant.

615
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,200
You don't understand. You got a perfect supporter.

616
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,200
Cheng Yang is very popular at Mingyuan.

617
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,200
He even steals Director Xia's thunder.

618
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,000
Really? He is not someone who likes to show off.

619
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,600
It‘s not up to him.

620
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:40,200
How is it with you and President Tang?

621
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,800
It's okay.

622
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,800
You're still shy about it.

623
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,670
Then the news about you being Cheng Yang's assistant,

624
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:50,000
was it President Tang who organized it?

625
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,200
Why do you think that? It was Cheng Yang who came and found me.

626
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,200
If it wasn't me who greeted him in his office, he wouldn't have known I came back.

627
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,400
Fine. I misunderstood you.

628
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,800
He is Mingyuan's president.

629
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,100
You two have a relationship.

630
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,820
Even if I don't think that way,

631
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,200
doesn't mean other people won't see it that way.

632
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,600
Let me tell you. When Director Xia knew you came back,

633
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,100
her face became so long from anger.

634
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,800
Who cares? It's not like I'm working for her.

635
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,000
Then you're not scared of her making things hard for you?

636
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,200
Let her. It's not like I did anything.

637
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,800
Seems like our Mo Fei is the strongest.

638
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,800
Come on. Cheers to our friendship.

639
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,700
Cheers.

640
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,200
I have to go back. It's still busy over there.

641
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,200
Sure you can leave.

642
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,200
Remember to find me to hang out with.

643
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,800
Bye.

644
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:58,000
How can President Tang not know of you coming to Mingyuan?

645
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,600
Mo Fei,

646
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,700
you went to France and became less bright.

647
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,100
Xueling.

648
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,600
Why were you absent for no reason

649
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,200
from the regular company meeting this afternoon?

650
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,800
Don't be excessive. It's not an unexcused absence.

651
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,800
I didn't want to embarrass somebody. That's the reason.

652
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,800
How come?

653
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,100
What happened?

654
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,000
A few days ago, someone said sincerely that

655
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,400
business is business, private life is private life.

656
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,600
It hasn't been long,

657
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,600
he broke his words.

658
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,600
How did I go back on my words?

659
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,200
According to company rules,

660
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,400
it's forbidden for there to be a relationship between employees.

661
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,800
Does this rule apply only to me?

662
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,400
What about you? You broke this rule.

663
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,400
Our company has this rule which states that co-workers can't fall in love.

664
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,200
But Mo Fei is my girlfriend and she's not even employed at our company.

665
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,400
Is there something wrong with that?

666
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,200
So what if she comes to the company to visit me?

667
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:12,400
So... you knew that she would be coming to the company.

668
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,000
What do you mean?

669
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,800

♫ I say you're an April day ♫

671
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:34,000
♫ The sound of your laughter lights everything up ♫

♫ In the midst of the brightness and beauty of spring,
shift as one would in a dance ♫

♫ The gentle breeze blown during dusk ♫

676
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,800
♫ The unintentional sparkle of the planetesimal ♫

677
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:02,600
♫ The fine rain that's sprinkled in front of the flower ♫

678
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:07,400
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

679
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:12,400
♫ Like a shy water lotus that bows to a cool breeze ♫

680
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,000
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

♫ You're like the ivory field after snowflakes ♫

685
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,800
♫ You're the round moon every night ♫

686
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,600
♫ You're the naïve ♫

687
00:43:53,600 --> 00:44:00,800
♫ white lotus that floats on the water ripples of your dream ♫

688
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:06,000
♫ You're the flower blossoms of tree after tree ♫

689
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,400
♫ The swallow twittering within the beams ♫

690
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,800
♫ You are love, hope, and warmth ♫
