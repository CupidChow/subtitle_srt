[Episode 39]

3
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,380
I was right about you, Jiaxi.

4
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,230
You are not only beautiful but also very smart.

5
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,360
This time, your hitting two birds with one stone

6
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,610
is very surprising.

7
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,500
But I can't compare to you.

8
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,060
During Haiyao's product launch that day, you were so beautiful.

9
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,070
You looked like an international star.

10
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,000
Thank you, my dear.

11
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,190
Speaking of, the credit goes to you.

12
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:29,180
If not for you, how would Haiyao's product launch have been so successful?

13
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,460
Then, come on. I wish you and your Haiyao's

14
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,810
business to be thriving and prosperous.

15
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,650
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

16
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,950
Today is Mo Fei's last day.

17
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,850
But she still hasn't come to work yet.

18
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,990
Xueling,

19
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,780
are you serious about this?

20
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,480
Mingxuan,

21
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,850
are you really going to protect her so brazenly?

22
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,320
I'm not trying to protect anyone.

23
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,170
I'll only ask you about the results of this matter.

24
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,430
So many days have passed yet what were we able to save?

25
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,160
The new designs that the shareholders were looking forward to so much

26
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,600
have no real progress at all.

27
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,460
How long are we going to grapple with this matter?

28
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,000
Mingxuan, let me ask you.

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,090
If Mo Fei is really involved in this matter,

30
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,180
what do you plan to do?

31
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,170
I have two documents in my hand.

32
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,340
One is a personnel notice.

33
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,740
During his employment,

34
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,980
Cheng Yang used his job

35
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,620
to steal the company's confidential splash-ink design sketches

36
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,750
and gave them to a rival company

37
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,380
to accomplish unknown personal ulterior motives.

38
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,290
Now, the company has decided

39
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,860
to fire Cheng Yang

40
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,990
and will never hire him again.

41
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,950
The other one is a lawyer's letter drafted by our legal department.

42
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,430
Due to personal reasons, Cheng Yang caused Mingyuan's reputation

43
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:12,150
great financial loss and damage.

44
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,990
Now, the company has decided to seek

45
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,180
legal responsibility

46
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,460
from designer Cheng Yang.

47
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,180
Mingxuan, I know you appreciate talent.

48
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,900
But in addition to talent,

49
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,310
one must have good virtue. I don't have any other choice, either.

50
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,710
If you have no objections, this is how we'll handle this situation.

51
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,440
Also,

52
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,740
I've already informed the relevant department.

53
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,700
They'll take Cheng Yang

54
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,920
for interrogation later.

55
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,970
Is this the result we wanted?

56
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,260
No.

57
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,220
However, this is an explanation we can give the shareholders.

58
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,160
Brother Xuan, Mo Fei is here.

59
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,280
I found new evidence.

60
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,160
However, if men don't get drunk, how would women have opportunities?

61
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,200
After we finished drinking that night, only Dongdong and I were left.

62
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,490
I convinced Dongdong to go home. Then I took him to the hotel directly.

63
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,750
Once he got into the cab, he passed out.

64
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,360
Because of that reason, I had to help him walk and accidentally got my lipstick on his clothes.

65
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,750
His girlfriend, Duoduo, that "clapped in the name of love."
(intercourse)

66
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,240
She came straight to the office to make a big scene.

67
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,430
This is illegal imprisonment!

68
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,670
I can sue you all.

69
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,250
My phone.

70
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,980
Are you deaf? Give me my phone.

71
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,500
Give me my phone! Return my phone!

72
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,940
We are also just doing our job.

73
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,960
Hello, Director Xia.

74
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,650
- You two may leave.
- Yes.

75
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,990
This is illegal imprisonment.

76
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,450
Don't you know I can sue you all?

77
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,730
When did you start to work for Bai Xiaoman?

78
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,980
Director Xia, is there some kind of misunderstanding?

79
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,230
I'm college friends with Bai Xiaoman

80
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,980
but we are not that close to each other.

81
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,800
Has the company not treated you well enough? Or have I not treated you well enough?

82
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,720
Why did you give the design sketches to Bai Xiaoman?

83
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,980
The design sketches were leaked from Cheng Yang.

84
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,620
What does it have to do with me?

85
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,810
I don't even have an ID to access them. How can I steal them?

86
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,230
Yesterday, Mo Fei was like a fool.

87
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:08,000
She questioned me and asked if I gave you and Haiyao the design sketches.

88
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,810
Say, she had no evidence,

89
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,030
- Director Xia.
 - yet she came to see me. Isn't she just humiliating herself?

90
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,920
Let me explain.

91
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,230
I...

92
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,600
I was wrong. I...

93
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,680
Give me a chance. I can make up for it.

94
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,910
How can you make up for it?

95
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,300
Because of what you did, do you know how much money the company lost

96
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,000
and how negatively impacted the company is?

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,310
You want to make up for it?

98
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:39,250
I'm afraid you'll have to be reduced to poverty and have nothing to rely on when you are old.

99
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,440
As long as you can spare me,

100
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,580
I can work for the company for free. That's fine.

101
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,710
As long as you don't report me to the police, I can do anything.

102
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,590
Let me tell you! Even if there are 10 of you working for the company for free

103
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,110
until you die, you wouldn't be able to make up for it.

104
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,590
Director Xia,

105
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,400
I was wrong. I was wrong.

106
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,810
Director Xia, I'm begging you.

107
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,800
My parents' health is not great.

108
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,320
They've always lived in a rural area. They don't know how to do anything.

109
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,080
As long as you can spare me,

110
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,410
I can do anything you want. Really, Director Xia.

111
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:17,690
I just lost my head for a moment so I listened to Bai Xiaoman.

112
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,390
Get up first.

113
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,680
I was tricked by her.

114
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,450
I shouldn't have done that and caused the company to suffer such a huge loss.

115
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:32,250
Let me ask you. If the company and Haiyao were in a lawsuit,

116
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,750
will you testify against Bai Xiaoman?

117
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,830
Yes. I definitely will.

118
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,320
I'll get back everything that the company lost.

119
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,420
I'll also tell others that Bai Xiaoman plagiarized our company's designs.

120
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,820
All right, I got it.

121
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,920
Director Xia, what should we do with her?

122
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,290
Let her finish crying and then pack her things at the Design Department.

123
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,810
After that, take her to the human resource department to process her resignation.

124
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,230
All right.

125
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,120
Mingxuan, I want to discuss Shen Jiaxi with you.

126
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,240
Is there anything else we need to discuss about her?

127
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,710
Isn't everything already very clear?

128
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,160
Even if we send her to the police,

129
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,160
we can't make up for our previous loss.

130
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,960
Xueling,

131
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,930
do you still remember what you told me?

132
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,070
I know that you also appreciate talent,

133
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,620
but should we also consider their moral conduct?

134
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,670
Since she did such a lowly thing

135
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,280
and caused such a huge loss for the company,

136
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,910
she takes responsibility for it.

137
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,910
You also know that Shen Jiaxi is a nobody.

138
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,720
The mastermind behind her is Haiyao.

139
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,710
The person who truly benefited from this is Bai Xiaoman.

140
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,350
Why should we punish Shen Jiaxi?

141
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:06,300
We should be going against Haiyao now, not her.

142
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,780
It's very easy to fire someone like Shen Jiaxi.

143
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,180
If we don't uncover the person behind all this,

144
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,340
then this hidden danger will remain.

145
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,660
Do you think I will let Bai Xiaoman go?

146
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:20,320
It's just that we need to take care of the product launch right now. After the product launch,

147
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,860
I'll settle this slowly with her.

148
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,660
It looks like you were confident when you made the

149
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,520
three-day agreement with Xueling.

150
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,860
No. I was just acting rashly because I felt wronged.

151
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,840
Weren't you afraid she'd fire you?

152
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,720
But I was more afraid of remaining silent and going with the flow

153
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,630
when I clearly knew someone was wrongly accused.

154
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:52,220
I didn't want to be that kind of person.

155
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,940
Why do I feel like you are implying something?

156
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,500
I'm not.

157
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,470
Are you secretly criticizing me?

158
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,770
If I wanted to criticize you, I would say it directly.

159
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,810
Can you tell me how you found the evidence?

160
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:24,950
The day the design sketch was leaked was the same day that Cheng Yang got drunk.

161
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,750
That day only Shen Jiaxi was with him.

162
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,950
I directly asked Shen Jiaxi

163
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,120
but she denied it.

164
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,660
I kept feeling that something wasn't right.

165
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,960
So I asked Lu Zhu to secretly follow her.

166
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,880
As a result, she really met up with Bai Xiaoman.

167
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,100
In gatherings, everyone takes a sip when drinking.

168
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,050
He's not like that. He couldn't wait to go straight to the bottle.

169
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:53,240
However, if men don't get drunk, how would women have the opportunities?

170
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,380
After we finished drinking that night, only Dongdong and I were left.

171
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:05,140
So... how do you plan on handling her?

172
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,830
What?

173
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:13,570
It's that... Jiaxi was my friend for many years.

174
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,860
Actually, her character isn't bad.

175
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,860
It is just that because of some reasons she took the wrong path.

176
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,650
So can you give her another chance?

177
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:26,700
You... You are too soft-hearted.

178
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,980
Do you know that you can "see" rules

179
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,090
but you cannot see a person's heart?

180
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:37,030
We in business encounter a hundred things we must take care of.

181
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:40,570
Everyone has a different way of doing things. Sometimes, I feel like their way of doing things is very strange.

182
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,770
I don't know what they are thinking.

183
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,470
But what is the only thing that is set in stone?

184
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,330
It is rules as well as a company's regulations.

185
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:51,470
Or else in this society, what would we need the law for?

186
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,900
Jiaxi.

187
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,330
Why?

188
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,110
Why did you do that?

189
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,460
Why?

190
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,860
Don't you know?

191
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,630
Ever since entering Mingyuan,

192
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:33,780
I found that our relationship has gotten more and more distant.

193
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:38,240
I don't know what exactly I did to you to pick on me in every way.

194
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,400
When you first entered Mingyuan,

195
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,720
why could you directly become Cheng Yang's assistant?

196
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,040
Yet I was still an unrecognized little soldier.

197
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,970
No one saw me as important.

198
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,610
I don't work any less than others.

199
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:58,770
So I turned to Bai Xiaoman not only for money.

200
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,780
So you never...

201
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,840
thought of me as a friend?

202
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,150
Friend?

203
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,010
Hearing you say that we're friends,

204
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:17,480
I will tell you another secret.

205
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:33,180
[Chinese Style Fashion - Mo Fei]

206
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,910
Everyone, it's time for breakfast!

207
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,820
Teacher Cheng, you're finally back!

208
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,390
- We missed you so much!
- Here.

209
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,700
Thank you.

210
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,320
I also missed you guys.

211
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,750
Teacher Cheng, I always said you were innocent,

212
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,220
but no one believed me.

213
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,330
Our team ended up not having a backbone.

214
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,070
How am I considered the backbone?

215
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,870
The design is everyone's hard work.

216
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,760
The job requires everyone to work hard together.

217
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:06,850
Teacher Cheng, I also hoped deep down that you didn't do it.

218
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:11,430
We have worked together for so long. I shouldn't have questioned your character.

219
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:15,070
Actually, the person who should say sorry is me.

220
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,940
If it weren't because I didn't safeguard the account,

221
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,300
the company wouldn't have suffered such a huge loss.

222
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,720
Everyone also wouldn't need to rush to finish the work.

223
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,140
Enough. What is most important now is working together to make new clothes

224
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,230
to make up for the company's loss. Right?

225
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,090
- Yes.
- Yes.
- That's right.

226
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,800
We have to work well on the designs.

227
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,820
We create something even better than the splash-ink. What do you say?

228
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,560
- Okay.
- Okay.

229
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,880
Let us overcome this hardship.

230
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,660
We can do this!

231
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,410
You have been caught?

232
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:56,240
It is all Mo Fei's fault. She asked someone to follow me and secretly record a video of us.

233
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,790
And then? Are they going to sue you now?

234
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,670
- No.
- No?

235
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:04,190
Are they going to let you off so easily after such a serious matter?

236
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,190
They want me to promise to say that you are the mastermind.

237
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,410
That way they won't pursue the matter.

238
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,090
Did you agree to it?

239
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,750
Xiaoman, this is just a way to stall.

240
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,530
If I didn't say that,

241
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,520
how could they possibly let me off?

242
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,020
Besides, you treat me so well.

243
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,230
How could I bite the hand that fed me?

244
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,320
Right now, only you understand me best and I rely on you the most.

245
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,160
Don't worry, as long as I'm at Haiyao,

246
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,600
I will keep my mouth closed.

247
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,000
I knew you were the best.

248
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,700
We have such a close relationship, right?

249
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,750
Liu Rui! Liu Rui!

250
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,280
Yes, Director Bai.

251
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,800
In a bit, take Miss Shen to fill out the paperwork to work here.

252
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,930
Then, directly appoint her as a design team leader.

253
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,260
In the future, anything related to design,

254
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,890
she has the right to participate in discussions.

255
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,300
Understood?

256
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,410
Yes. I understand.

257
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:04,340
Xiaoman, thank you. I will definitely work hard and perform well.

258
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,270
I know what you are capable of.

259
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:10,450
It is just that... if someone asks about this again...

260
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:15,120
Don't worry, even if they beat me to death, I will not give you away.

261
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,790
You're awake, Brother Xuan.

262
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,690
Hey, why haven't you left yet?

263
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,310
You still haven't left so how can I leave?

264
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:56,570
Also, no one from the Design Department has left. They're working overtime.

265
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,900
All of them?

266
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,850
Yes, all of them.

267
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,830
Brother Xuan, honestly,

268
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,090
the designers at our company, compared to the designers at other companies,

269
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,830
are so hard working.

270
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,100
Now you can finally rest assured, right?

271
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,930
Tomorrow morning, help me tell the Legal Department

272
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,930
to review all of our contracts with our partners.

273
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,470
Annex some compensation fees.

274
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:42,780
Also, slightly delay our final payment to the factories for now.

275
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,290
Let's pay the final payment after our product launch.

276
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,980
You must explain to them

277
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,740
that it is to avoid unnecessary losses for both parties.

278
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,610
One last thing.

279
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,920
You may go home.

280
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,580
What?

281
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,910
How about this? When you are done,

282
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,830
- I'll take you—
- Then let's do this.

283
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,000
You work overtime through the night with me.

284
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Wait! Aren't you going to be polite and decline?

285
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,900
I will give you 3 seconds to consider.

286
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,510
Goodbye.

287
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,100
The overall feeling is not bad.

288
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,240
However, on a smaller scale,

289
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,620
it is still lacking a bit. What do you think?

290
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,560
I feel...

291
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,050
that we only considered how the fabric looks

292
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,220
from a distant view.

293
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,500
But we didn't consider how it would look up close.

294
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,720
Also, since we used the techniques of painting, then we should continue it to the end.

295
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,120
Considering the time and the cost,

296
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,720
if we change the fabric again and rush to put it together,

297
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,850
the difficulty level is too high.

298
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,010
How about...

299
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,790
How about what?

300
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:05,980
Say it.

301
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,380
How about we add some beaded decorations to it?

302
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,770
Right now, the entire dress is too simple and elegant.

303
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,930
If we add some layered Suzhou embroidery,

304
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,510
would the result be better?

305
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:19,140
Would the bead embroidery

306
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,540
be too complicated?

307
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,650
How do we choose the pattern?

308
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,600
I feel that pearl embroidery's result would be really good.

309
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:33,130
However, I recommend adding a crystal gauze blouse.

310
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,660
An extra layer of hazy gauze

311
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,610
will soften the originally bold effect of

312
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,320
the splash-ink.

313
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,690
Also, the crystal gauze fabric is a bit reflective.

314
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:47,420
It can make the entire dress look subtly elegant.

315
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,850
Even though crystal gauze is transparent,

316
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,460
it is also like a misty cloud in a scenery painting.

317
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,950
When one is walking, the view will be just like a painting

318
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,690
being slightly lifted by the breeze.

319
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:05,350
In that way, we would add some poetry to it.

320
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:08,040
It is a good idea, but, Cheng Yang,

321
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,560
you need to think more about the pattern in the design.

322
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,870
If the entire outfit uses purple-blue beads,

323
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:19,190
the pattern needs to be layered and elegant.

324
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,560
The usual flowers, birds, fish, and insects won't do.

325
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,430
How about deer?

326
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,470
- Deer?
- Wouldn't that be too complicated?

327
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:33,320
Because it is complicated, that's why people aren't willing to do it.

328
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,310
The craftsmanship is cumbersome, so no one is willing to copy it.

329
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,540
The nine-colored deer of the Dunhuang murals

330
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:44,830
have a mythological meaning.

331
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,540
Additionally, our Su embroidery

332
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,620
will sparkle under the sun.

333
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,000
Wouldn't it be perfect for the imagery of the nine-colored deer?

334
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,760
Also, the layer of its antlers. What do you think?

335
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:00,530
We can try it first. Let's hope it can solve this problem.

336
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:08,180
♫ The true love of my life ♫

337
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:14,150
♫ You understand the struggles I happily go through the most ♫

338
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,900
Thank you.

339
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,550
You helped us solve a very serious issue.

340
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,610
I wasn't helping you.

341
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:57,840
The sooner the new clothes are completed, the sooner the losses can be stopped.

342
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,540
Then Mingxuan can eat and sleep in peace.

343
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,770
Therefore, I'm helping him and helping the company.

344
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:11,070
Regardless of who you are helping, I'll definitely say thanks when I should.

345
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,130
Even when the other person doesn't accept it?

346
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,440
All I want is to do is what I need to in order to have a clear conscience.

347
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,520
"The ugly little duckling flapped its wings

348
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,300
and tried to fly.

349
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,530
Now, its wings are much more sturdy.

350
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:21,370
They are also stronger when flapping now."

351
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:24,200
Tell me. Do you like the little ugly duckling?

352
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,650
I do.

353
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,640
Why do you like it?

354
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,540
Because it is very strong.

355
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,840
Then will you be like it?

356
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,880
Yes.

357
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,640
Sister, will you come back here?

358
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,340
Of course, I will.

359
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,850
I promise you, I'll come back to visit you. Okay?

360
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:44,570
- Okay.
- When I come back to see you,

361
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,250
you will have recovered already.

362
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,270
Here, I'll continue to read to you. Okay?

363
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:51,710
The child is saying goodbye to her.

364
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,060
She is very popular in the hospital.

365
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,030
Any difficult child

366
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:01,240
becomes obedient and does not fuss when they are with her.

367
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,110
The doctor has even told me that he wishes she would stay a few more days.

368
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:07,390
Ever since Qian Qian was young,

369
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:10,230
she could get along with younger children.

370
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:14,610
Lowering the green branches into the meandering canal.

371
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:18,160
Okay, let's not interfere with their farewell now.

372
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,070
- Let's go take a walk over there.
- Okay.

373
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:29,430
I heard something happened regarding your product launch press conference.

374
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:32,610
- Is it resolved yet?
- Everything's all right now.

375
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:36,510
Our new press conference will be held according to schedule.

376
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:43,700
Is it still possible for you to work with SLC?

377
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,460
We're still in the process of discussions.

378
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,430
Do you still want to acquire them?

379
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,810
Uncle Fang, you should know me very well. I am quite tenacious.

380
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:58,920
It's very hard for me to give up unless I'm at the end of the road.

381
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:03,410
Previously, I heard you wanted to acquire SLC.

382
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:07,250
Rumor. It's all rumors.

383
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:11,820
I've already acquired Cayman. If I also acquire SLC,

384
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:15,740
it would be too financially burdensome.

385
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,380
I won't do it.

386
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,730
You, on the other hand, are really something.

387
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:24,870
When I see you, I am really envious of your dad.

388
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,870
Even though you are the only son,

389
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:30,590
your work capability is so much better than Xiaoyu's.

390
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,250
Don't say that, Uncle Fang.

391
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,860
Xiaoyu is also outstanding. We just don't do the same kind of work

392
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,550
in different fields.

393
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,350
H-How is he outstanding?

394
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,500
He's living off his past gains right now.

395
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,360
Luckily my bones are still sturdy (I'm still healthy)

396
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,560
and I can let him chew on them.

397
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:49,970
Otherwise, who will Qian Qian rely on in the future?

398
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:52,410
Isn't Qian Qian getting better and better now?

399
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:56,530
Uncle Fang, you don't need to worry so much now.

400
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,870
About Qian Qian's illness,

401
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,110
I plan to take her abroad for her recovery treatment.

402
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,550
That way she can avoid any annoying disturbances.

403
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:10,240
Once she is fully recovered,

404
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,890
I can then return with peace of mind.

405
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:17,060
Yes.

406
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:22,140
- Qian Qian.
- Brother Mingxuan, you're here.

407
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,710
Yes, I came to see you.

408
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,610
Didn't Mo Fei come with you?

409
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,170
She's quite busy at the company today.

410
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,880
Let's get together another day, okay?

411
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,400
Please help me tell Mo Fei that her health is the most important. She must not stay up late.

412
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,340
Otherwise, she'll be like me and it'll be too late once she's hospitalized.

413
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,990
Understood. That includes me, okay?

414
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:49,000
Then, shouldn't you give Mo Fei time off?

415
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,420
Why?

416
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,050
Did you forget what you promised me?

417
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,150
Don't worry.

418
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:04,200
♫ I want to write the sweetest song for you ♫

419

♫ You to personally tell me you love me too ♫

426
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,480
- Brother!
- You're back.

427
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,890
I want to get on that one.

428
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,000
That one?

429
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,020
Your body hasn't completely recovered yet.

430
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,250
You cannot ride that now. That will take your life away.

431
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,120
Do you want to take your brother's life away?

432
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,000
When can I ride that then?

433
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,740
One year later. I'll definitely bring you here in a year.

434
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:55,240
Come, come. I'm going to battle him.

435
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,440
Why do I think you'll still be afraid in a year?

436
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,760
Why?

437
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,200
Did you forget? When we were young, we rode a roller coaster and you threw up all night

438
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,120
and your dad beat you up.

439
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:08,890
Tang Mingxuan, are we talking about our childhood now? Don't you have unspeakable history yourself?

440
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,660
- You have a lot of unspeakable incidents.
- Go ahead and tell.

441
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,140
His four limbs are uncoordinated.

442
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,240
He tried to learn to ride a bike but still couldn't do it after half a year. That's him!

443
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,490
You can't ride roller coasters.

444
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,750
He's particularly afraid of cockroaches.

445
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,410
Every time he saw a roach, he would cling to my leg. That's him.

446
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,120
You can't ride roller coasters.

447
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,420
Also, during biology class, he didn't dare feed the silkworm.

448
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,800
He didn't go to school for a whole week. That's him.

449
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,760
You can't even ride roller coasters! Ride this, or ride that!

450
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,940
- Enough, don't argue anymore. You two are the same.
- Try it.

451
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,610
Mo Fei, it's not that I don't dare ride it. I can. It's just that

452
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,730
my sister hasn't recovered yet.

453
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:40,100
Brother, I just remembered. You indeed can't ride roller coasters.

454
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,250
Stand on that side.

455
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,630
What do you mean by that?

456
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:45,140
Get on it.

457
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,600
- Whoever doesn't ride it is a coward. Let's go.
- Coward.

- Get started! Come on!

468
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:48,260
Don't pat me. Don't move. Don't talk.

469
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:52,170
Hey, you are quite similar to Tang Mingxuan sometimes.

470
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:54,380
Especially when you pretend to be tough.

471
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,250
I-I'm perfectly fine.

472
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:01,500
Don't shake. Don't move.

473
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,980
Here, here. Drink this to ease your nausea.

474
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,370
I'm fine. What do I need to ease?

475
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,590
Hold it. Then it'll be more convenient for you to vomit.

476
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,990
Here.

477
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:16,140
Don't expect me to thank you for this.

478
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,570
Are you three hungry?

479
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:18,920
I'll go buy some lunch.

480
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,580
- I'll go with you.

00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,210
I can't eat anything.

482
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:30,490
Shall we sit over there for a bit? There's a table.

483
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,720
Let's go.

484
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,960
Do you want to eat some ice cream?

485
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,590
When I got car sick as a child,

486
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:47,140
my mom gave me this. I was fine once I ate this.

487
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,040
Really?

488
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,830
Mo Fei,

489
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:07,510
I am going to leave Shanghai with Fang Qian.

490
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:09,930
Why are you leaving Shanghai?

491
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,780
Her surgery was very successful, right?

492
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:15,380
But I'm afraid that she'll encounter some complications after.

493
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,240
I've discussed it with the doctor and decided

494
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,780
to take her abroad for some checkups.

495
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,070
I'll be more at ease that way.

496
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,350
When are you planning to leave?

497
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:29,150
We're going to buy the tickets in a few days. Once we buy them, we're leaving.

498
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,810
I originally planned to have some fun with Qian Qian before heading back to France.

499
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,220
It's all right. When everything is normal with her,

500
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,220
I'll take her to visit you.

501
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,490
Mo Fei,

502
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,960
thank you.

503
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:06,250
Let's go continue to play.

504
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,530
- Are you sure you can?
- I can.

505
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:10,960
- Really?
- I can ride the carousel.

In regards to your love life,

00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,060
you seem to have never mentioned it to anyone before.

550
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:48,910
I wonder if I'd be lucky enough to get a direct answer from you today.

551
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,810
I'm just a painter, not a celebrity.

552
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:55,820
Who would be interested in my love life?

553
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,880
All right. Then let me ask a different question.

554
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,150
Is there a girl whose appearance would bring you inspiration

555
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:03,380
for your work?

556
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,840
The time I studied abroad was my most productive time.

557
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:14,790
Back then, I indeed had a crush on a girl.

558
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,370
Those feelings

559
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:19,250
stimulated my imagination.

560
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,660
Too bad it was just a crush.

561
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:26,470
I couldn't express my feelings, so I was only able to paint.

562
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,870
Poverty and love

563
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:31,180
indeed can easily incubate artists.

564
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:35,020
Yes, I had both of those things back then.

565
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:39,870
What about later on? It seems that you are not as productive now.

566
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:44,030
Perhaps the heavens became envious of me

567
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:46,740
and took both of those things away from me

568
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,850
so I became less productive.

569
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,900
Okay, one last question.

570
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,640
If you could only have one thing, which would you pick?

571
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,620
The girl, wealth,

572
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,450
or talent.

573
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,780
Can I say I want them all?

574
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:11,610
- Didn't you know that I especially liked you when we were in school?
- What?

575
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,490
Did you really not know?

576
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:18,830
It's not surprising that you didn't know.

577
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:22,740
Back then, it was at most a crush.

578
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,600
I was most productive at the time.

579
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,150
At that time, I indeed had a crush on a girl.

580
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:45,690
Those feelings stimulated my imagination.

581
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:48,110
Too bad it was just a crush.

582
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:52,090
I couldn't express my feelings, so I was only able to paint.

583
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:03,450
Have you discussed the SLC matter with Fang Weiguo?

584
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:05,610
Actually, I guessed long ago

585
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:07,310
that he wanted to acquire SLC

586
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:12,010
just to increase the price and sabotage our acquisition. Think about it, Dad.

587
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:16,330
Fang Weiguo just acquired Cayman. How does he have that much money?

588
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,740
Fang Weiguo has fought with us our entire lives.

589
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,360
He's our strongest rival.

590
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,510
He's also a rival who deserves our respect.

591
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:33,110
- Have you set the date for the product launch?
- Yes.

592
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:35,440
As long as we launch smoothly this time,

593
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,690
I believe that SLC will

594
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:40,200
take the initiative to contact us.

595
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:44,690
You should focus on the product launch.

596
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:50,310
By the way, Qian Qian is leaving. Shouldn't you see her off?

597
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:53,030
She specifically asked us

598
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:55,160
not to see her off.

599
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:01,150
