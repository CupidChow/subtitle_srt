3
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,990
Come in.

4
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,890
- Mingxuan.
- Uncle Xia.

5
00:01:54,550 --> 00:02:00,020
Not bad, Mingxuan. Really not bad.

6
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,040
Today, I received Daily Fashion's report.

7
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,560
Sales keep rising.

8
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,680
The younger generation will indeed surpass the older one.

9
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,850
We just launched it so we won't know about the specifics of the sales

10
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,620
until later on.

11
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,920
Okay, thank you.

12
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,260
The current results are already impressive. Don't give yourself too high of expectations.

13
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,060
It'll cause my daughter to throw herself into work every single day.

14
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,760
Look at you.

15
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,530
Xueling has been working hard lately.

16
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,430
I've talked about this seriously with her, too.

17
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,900
I told her that her job right now is design director,

18
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,680
so she should do her own work well.

19
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,660
As for the rest, there's you.

20
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,720
Guess what she told me.

21
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,590
She said it was because you need to do all the rest of the work,

22
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,360
so she has to share the burden with you.

23
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:59,090
Xueling really has helped me a lot.

24
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,540
I did not come here today with the intention to blame you.

25
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,620
But I am going to criticize you on behalf of my wife.

26
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,480
Your Aunt Xia is not happy and nags me every day,

27
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,630
saying that we raised our daughter for nothing.

28
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,510
We have raised her for your Tang family instead.

29
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,270
Look! If she is not at your house,

30
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:24,040
then she is at work. Your aunt doesn't even see her daughter twice a week.

31
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,990
You also know, when women get old,

32
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,790
they like to nag, but I have relayed your Aunt Xia's words.

33
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,610
Uncle Xia, have some tea.

34
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,400
I was indeed inconsiderate in this matter.

35
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,060
I assure you...

36
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,390
I will try my best to not have Xueling work overtime so she can go home earlier to spend time with you and Aunt.

37
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,400
That's not what I mean. She acts on her accord.

38
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,240
If she is happy, what can we do?

39
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,400
As long as your family treats Xueling well in the future, it is fine.

40
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,740
Don't make us go to your house in the end

41
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,510
and take what we deserve with interest.

42
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,150
That would be embarrassing.

43
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,480
Don't worry, our family will not let her down.

44
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,920
Okay.

45
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,970
Mingxuan, I will remember these words of yours.

46
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:16,730
Right! What did I want to discuss with you today?

47
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,080
We were talking about trivial matters for so long.

48
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,960
Oh, right! The designer that caused trouble backstage at the competition last time...

49
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,680
Mingxuan,

50
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,620
why are her clothes still on the platform? What are you thinking?

51
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,770
Uncle Xia, perhaps you are not familiar with the whole incident.

52
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,840
The situation has already been cleared up.

53
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,970
You don't have to worry.

54
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,260
Mingxuan, this is not about clearing matters up.

55
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:49,160
Look! Although you work very hard and you have achieved great results,

56
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,570
I have to criticize you in this matter.

57
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,550
You have made a common mistake that all the young make. Do you know what it is called?

58
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,510
It's called short-sightedness, only focusing on the immediate benefits.

59
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,180
Right now she is really popular

60
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,640
and has some fame. But you know what? Her popularity comes from notoriety.

61
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,110
Using her to attract attention,

62
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,310
have you thought of Mingyuan's image?

63
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,850
I have also heard

64
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,370
that Xueling does not agree on this matter as well.

65
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:23,050
Look! You are the president of the company.

66
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,130
She is the design director.

67
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:29,180
I think you two need to discuss the specific affairs of the company

68
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,650
just like how your father and I were back then. Right?

69
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,020
Even if it’s something he had already decided,

70
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,030
as long as I disagree,

71
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,970
- he couldn't go through with it...
- Uncle Xia.

72
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:44,880
I run and manage this company now.

73

Right, right. You are extremely right.

74
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:51,310
This company is now yours to manage.

75
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,040
We shouldn't get too involved and shouldn't bother you anymore.

76
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,330
Very good. This work you are doing now...

77
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,750
I'm very satisfied with the sales performance.

78
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,210
I believe your father is also very satisfied.

79
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,020
Look, I'm old now.

80
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,460
Like your Aunt Xia, I have started to nag.

81
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,850
I won't bother you anymore.

82
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,940
You just discuss with Xueling the designer's matter.

83
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,830
- Uncle Xia, take care.
- All right.

I am very sorry, we're not hiring right now.

can I work in accordance with my class schedule?

111

No problem. You can be in charge of closing.

What does closing mean?

113
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,590
It means that after closing every day, you are in charge of washing the dishes and kitchen.

The hygiene requirements in France are stricter, so we have to clean every day.

162
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,510
At the airport,

163
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:02,210
what was the meaning of everything you said to me?

164
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:06,490
♫ I'll no longer bother your life ♫

165
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:14,480
What's the point of recording this? Even if I record this, I won't broadcast it.

166
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,980
Even if he hears it, so what?

167
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:27,240
Mo Fei, why aren't you sleeping yet?

168
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,250
You artists are so strange.

169
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,680
Sitting here looking at the moon in the middle of the night.

170
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,450
Why aren't you sleeping either? Come and sit.

171
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:38,600
I'm doing business right now.

172
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,110
At this time right now, all those working women in China

173
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,610
are exchanging their shopping experiences.

174
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,630
How can I miss out on this time?

175
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:53,550
Has that guy responded to your WeChat Moment?

176
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:02,080
That can't be right. A normal man should have some reaction.

177
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,620
That's why... I said

178
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,650
he probably already has a girlfriend.

179
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,160
He has a girlfriend yet he still chased you to the airport

180
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,720
and gifted you that doll.

181
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,800
That doesn't make sense.

182
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,770
It actually doesn't make sense if he doesn't have a girlfriend.

183
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:24,380
You have no idea. That girl is really beautiful.

184
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,340
Do you think you're bad-looking?

185
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,290
You are not bad-looking, all right?

186
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,400
But they are childhood sweethearts,

187
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,580
and their families are well matched.

188
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,590
In the eyes of outsiders,

189
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:42,230
they are a match made in Heaven.

190
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,440
Then that's a bit difficult to deal with.

191
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,910
See, you think so too. Right?

192
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:53,120
It's not important how the two of us think.

193
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,210
What's important is, do you like him?

194
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:04,240
- I don't like him right now.
- See, then it's resolved, right?

195
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,410
Since you've already thought it through so clearly, what is there that you cannot let go of?

196
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:12,610
Let me tell you. Starting tomorrow,

197
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,840
forget him.

198
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,450
The "forest" in France is waiting for you.

199
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,080
My dear Miss Mo Fei,

200
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:26,470
do you remember the handsome guy downstairs? Do you like him?

201
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,130
- Give back the little prince.
- No.

202
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,660
- Hurry.
- No.

203
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,940
- Brother Xuan.
- What's the hurry?

204
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,330
The financing department of the embroidery workshop's construction site has been pressing for money.

205
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,120
They say our funds never arrived.

206
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,160
So I checked. I heard that Xia Zhendong's people

207
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,240
have been blocking the funds from being distributed.

208
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,200
Hello.

209
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,500
I just found out.

210
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,570
I'm heading over right now.

211
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,840
Brother Xuan, where are we going right now?

212
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,480
The Xia family's residence.

213
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:29,240
- Auntie.
- Mingxuan.

214
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,270
You haven't come over for quite a while.

215
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:34,200
- Have you eaten breakfast?
- I've already eaten.

216
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,240
- Where is Uncle Xia?
- He's upstairs.

217
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,390
I don't know why but he's been arguing with Xueling since this morning.

218
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,980
Go inside and sit first. I'll get him for you.

219
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,400
Okay.

220
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,230
Why are you here, Mingxuan?

221
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:56,150
Don't argue with your dad. It's not worth it.

222
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,240
I'll talk to Uncle Xia in a bit.

223
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,300
He was wrong in the first place.

224
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,920
How am I wrong? How am I wrong?

225
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,600
Mingxuan.

226
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:13,480
Look, about the construction funds, I really didn't want to make it difficult for you.

227
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,710
But I also have my own difficulties right now.

228
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:22,820
Uncle Xia, didn't we already confirm the budget at the stockholders' meeting?

229
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,770
What's happened now?

230
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:27,190
There are indeed some sudden developments.

231
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,910
You know it, too. Our Mingyuan is a big enterprise.

232
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:32,800
There are places other than yours where we need to spend money.

233
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,440
How about this, Mingxuan? We each take a step back.

234
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,400
It's not that we won't do the embroidery workshop, but just postpone it for a little while.

235
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,330
Dad, a lot of people have been watching the failed SLC acquisition.

236
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,690
We really can't have anything go wrong with the embroidery workshop.

237
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:50,030
We're just waiting for money in order to start the construction right now.

238
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:53,500
If the follow-up funding doesn't come through, then the money spent in the earlier stage will be wasted.

239
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,810
I know that many elders aren't accepting of it.

240
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,750
But you are different from them.

241
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,730
You must be able to see the big picture.

242
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,160
How do I not look at the big picture?

243
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,160
I am currently considering the overall big picture.

244
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,260
It's for Mingxuan's sake. What do you know?

245
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,570
Mingxuan, in these past few years where you're in charge,

246
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:14,140
everyone saw the outstanding results and robust endeavors.

247
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,210
You have lead Mingyuan to move forward.

248
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:18,650
However, without meaning to,

249
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,100
you've neglected some of the old guys.

250
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,880
Their hearts got cold.

251
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,660
When people lose their hearts and their hearts are cold, it doesn't matter how big the company is,

252
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,490
it will collapse at the drop of a hat. Right?

253
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:38,240
Uncle Xia, let me make a stand first.

254
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,240
About the construction fund for the embroidery workshop,

255
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,250
it is already an arrow pulled back on a bow. It must continue.

256
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,940
I understand what you just said.

257
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,680
During the process of me working,

258
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,490
perhaps I have neglected some elders' feelings.

259
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:56,290
If there are things they don't understand,

260
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:59,350
I can visit each and every one of them

261
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,890
to explain things clearly to them.

262
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,280
That is a solution.

263
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,650
You also know that these elders

264
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,240
followed your father in building this company up.

265
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:14,200
To be frank, after you became in charge, you can hurt anyone else's feelings but theirs.

266
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,160
Isn't that right? Mingxuan,

267
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,620
if you really have this kind of attitude, I think it will be easily resolved.

268
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,260
- Thank you, Uncle Xia.
- You're welcome.

269
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:48,040
Although this is just a movie,

270
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,740
through it, we can feel

271
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,680
the soul of a tailor in the 1950s.

00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,760
Are you Chinese?

292
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,930
Yes.

293
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,880
This is great. By the way, I'm Mo Fei.

294
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,650
I am Meng Jing.

295
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,780
Did you understand everything discussed in class just now?

296
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:23,100
No. With that speaking speed, it would be strange if I could understand it.

297
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:27,720
I didn't expect to take so many theory classes to learn fashion design here.

298
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,300
Oh, right! Do you know what the name of that movie was?

299
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,250
It's called Phantom Thread.

300
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,120
Did the male lead actor win an Oscar before?

301
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,490
Yes, he's the one.

302
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,580
Looks like we need to really study well.

303
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,360
By the way, where do you live?

304
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,610
I live nearby. How about you?

305
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:50,180
I am staying at a place with a friend. Her boyfriend helped us find the place.

Okay. We can walk around together from now on.

00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,470
Please.

320
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,600
Here's the menu.

321
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,520
Thanks.

322
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,340
I want an order of fried rice.

323
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,470
Okay.

324
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,690
- Stir fried mushroom on lettuce.
- Okay.

325
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:06,100
Also, crispy tofu, please.

326
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,160
Okay.

327
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,200
- A bottle of red wine.
- Okay.

328
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,010
A moment, please.

329
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,230
Thank you.

330
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,360
This restaurant seems nice.

331
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,350
Take a look.
- Wow.

332
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,140
I bought it for my mother.

333
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,690
A diamond necklace?

334
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:28,960
Yes.

335
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,420
This necklace is so beautiful.

336
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,710
It must be expensive.

337
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:37,120
It's for my mother's birthday.

338
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,060
- It's magnificent.
- Very beautiful.

339
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:43,060
You have good taste. She'll surely be very happy.

340
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,260
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

341
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,430
- Maybe, 25.
- Yes, same.

342
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:12,290
- Yes, I think so.
- I think so too.

343
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:13,460
Your dishes...

344
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,460
Here you go.

345
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,790
Thanks.

346
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,750
It looks good.

347
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,960
Do you want to try it?

348
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,700
- So, is it good?
- Is it good?

349
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,920
Miss, your bag.

350
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,770
Thanks.

351
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:36,280
No...

352
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,700
Xiao Chen.

353
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,860
- Is the Sweet and Sour Fish ready for table No. 4?
- It'll be ready soon.

354
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,910
- Hurry.
 - My necklace!

355
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,220
You thief! You stole my mother's necklace.

356
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,150
Thief, give it back to me!

357
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,680
What's happened?

358
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:56,110
She said I stole something from her, but I didn’t steal anything.

359
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:58,230
Everyone, please calm down.

360
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:02,710
Miss, what was it you lost?

361
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:05,370
A necklace for her mother.

362
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:09,610
It's my mom's birthday gift, you know?

363
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,230
She stole the necklace.

364
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,530
They say you stole a diamond necklace.

365
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:18,450
Diamond necklace! I never saw a diamond necklace.

366
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:22,050
It's you! You purposely made my bag drop on the floor. I clearly put it in my bag earlier.

367
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,980
Please stay calm. Please stay calm.

368
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,930
You gave me the bag, and it's gone.

369
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:30,150
- You stole it! Otherwise, why can't I find it?
- Please calm down.

370
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,870
What happened with her bag?

371
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,760
Her bag fell to the ground and I picked it up for her. That's all.

372
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,160
Everyone saw that.

373
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,560
Why is it gone then?

374
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,880
Hello, police? Yes.

375
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,300
- No, no, no.
- We caught a thief.

376
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,980
- Don't call the police.
- Yes, at a restaurant.

377
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,550
Don't call the police, please.

378
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:48,230
- He called the police?
- Yes.

379
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,010
Yes. She's here.

380
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:56,400
This makes me angry. It's a disaster that came out of nowhere.

381
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,220
That woman scolded loudly at me just because she has two men backing her up.

382
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,730
This is the first time I'm glad I don't understand French.

383
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,870
What happened next?

384
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:08,490
Later, the police came. There was even a female cop who searched my body.

385
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,360
Searched your body?

386
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,000
This is too much.

387
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,790
Say, who did I offend?

388
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:18,250
My own bag is lost too, and it's still missing.

389
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,770
Now I'm even mistaken as a thief.

390
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:25,080
It's a diamond necklace. Do you know how expensive it is? She wants me to repay. I cannot afford that at all.

391
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,550
That's ridiculous!

392
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:29,870
You didn't take it, so why should you repay it?

393
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:36,210
Older Brother! Older Brother?

394
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,190
Can't you knock before you come in?

395
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,090
Cousin, you'd better treat me better.

396
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:47,360
I came with big news.

397
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,220
What is it?

398
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,960
A couple of days ago, Fang Xiaoyu came to look for Mo Fan.

399
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,550
He asked for Mo Fei's phone number in France.

400
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:58,290
I noted it down for you, too.

401
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,210
Pretty good job.

402
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:08,750
Also... Brother, Sister Mo Fei was robbed in Paris.

403
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,940
When did this happen?

404
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,350
She got robbed as soon as she got there.

405
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,850
I got it.

406
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,880
- Yang Guang.
- Yes.

407
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,910
Go keep an eye on the construction site again.

408
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:26,000
You must be thorough. There must not be any shoddy work and cutting corners in this construction.

409
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,820
All right. Rest assured.

410
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,510
Brother Xuan, it's raining so hard.

411
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:35,060
They probably can't do any construction work today. You should head back to Shanghai.

412
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,630
I'll go check on things.

413
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,210
Go ahead.

414
00:28:55,230 --> 00:29:00,120
♫ The sun points to the direction ♫

415
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,450
I wonder who's the one who said I'm an evil businessman.

416
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:07,950
I... How could I have possibly said something like that? That's impossible.

417
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,570
Do you think I have no evidence? I have a recording.

418
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,800
I never said anything bad about President Tang.

419
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,480
President Tang is the...

420
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,180
the kindest, the most handsome,

421
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,370
and the most responsible boss that I've ever seen.

422
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:24,580
How could I slander you?

423
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,310
Are you serious about what you said?

424
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,950
Yes, very serious.

425
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,660
Okay.

426
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:36,620
You lied to me! How could you do that?

427
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:47,950
♫ My heart, just this one is for you ♫

428
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:55,420
♫ Protect me, hold me in the palm of your hand ♫

429
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:59,100
♫  Your smile  ♫

430
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:03,420
♫  is branded into my heart  ♫

431
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:11,280
♫ Make a wish that you'll love me a long time ♫

432
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:19,720
Mo Fei! Mo Fei, your phone!

433
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,030
Help me get it!

434
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,700
Hello?

435
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,350
Mo Fei?

436
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:32,120
Sounds so familiar.

437
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,180
Hello, this is Mo Fei's phone.

438
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,960
But she is in the bathroom now. Can you call back in a bit?

439
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,130
Okay. Thanks.

440
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,820
He hung up.

441
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,170
Who was it?

442
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:46,690
I don't know. A Chinese person. I told him to call back later.

443
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,500
What was it then?

444
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,950
Just call back and ask.

445
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,330
Hello.

446
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,950
It's me.

447
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:05,950
That guy at the airport.

448
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:09,250
Why is he calling? To confess?

449
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,790
Hello.

450
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:16,710
I heard my cousin say that you were robbed.

451
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,650
Are you hurt?

452
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,730
That happened when I first got here.

453
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:23,590
I'm fine already.

454
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,050
Thank you for caring, President Tang.

455
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,800
That's good then.

456
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,360
I...

457
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:42,960
Have you been well lately?

458
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,660
It's the same. Every day, I go to class, work...

459
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,330
I spend my days living a pretty fulfilling life.

460
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:53,470
That's pretty great.

461
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:05,260
Then, President Tang, if there isn't anything else, I'll...

462
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,790
I'm standing in the garden that we used to come to often.

463
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:11,510
It's raining here.

464
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,800
What are you doing?

465
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,050
I just finished washing up and am about to head out.

466
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,750
I almost forget about the time difference. Then I won't bother you.

467
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,550
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

468
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,120
Director Fang, why are you here?

469
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,920
- I came to find you.
- Find me?

470
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,120
You came to France to find me?

471
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,290
There's something that's really important

472
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:59,240
I had to tell you in person.

473
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,310
What's so important?

474
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,410
The batik design that we made

475
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:07,520
needs to be accredited. Is that important enough?

476
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,740
I didn't help much with the batik. I was just doing trivial work on the side.

477
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,960
- It doesn't matter if I get the credit.
- How can that be?

478
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,330
I am very respectful of original creators.

479
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,190
Since you participated in the creation,

480
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:21,030
your name should be credited.

481
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,970
Have you not seen that area?

482
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:29,930
- I'll show you around.
- Thanks.

483
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,840
I think it looks nice.

484
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,080
Look at this work.

485
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,640
It's here every time I come to Paris.

486
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,890
It's been at least over ten years.

487
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:12,080
Over ten years, and it's still not sold?

488
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:16,880
I think this artist is probably very sad.

489
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,260
I think it's waiting for someone who truly understands it.

490
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:27,600
Every piece of art here is from the blood and sweat of the artists.

491
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,640
They are children born by the creating artist through extreme pain and effort.

492
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,780
You don't object to my view, do you?

493
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,920
That's why if you don't sign your work,

494
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,530
then it will be like an abandoned baby.

495
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:48,560
Perhaps the works here aren't as noble

496
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,970
or as precious as those in the Pompidou Center,

497
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:53,820
but they are also the fruits of creativity.

498
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,620
How could you bear to let them become orphans?

499
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:04,190
That's why the signed name is very important to a piece of work.

500
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:07,970
But it's even more important to yourself.

501
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:11,510
If you want other people to respect your work, you must respect yourself first.

502
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:14,680
Signing your name is a form of respect.

503
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,140
After all that talking, you still haven't told me how you found me.

504
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:29,110
Have you forgotten that I also graduated from this school?

505
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:32,410
My junior brother is also at this school.

506
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:35,340
- Junior brother?
- Cheng Yang.

507
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:39,670
Cheng Yang? This is too coincidental. He is my roommate's boyfriend.

508
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:43,870
That's why I think it's an intriguing fate.

509
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,790
It truly is.

510
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:48,480
It's quite late. Let's schedule for another day then.

511
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,020
Can you not rush to get away every time you see me?

512
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,320
- I still have to discuss something with you.
- What is it?

513
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,530
Come be my assistant at Cayman's press conference.

514
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,610
I'm not interested.

515
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:03,080
Can you consider it for a while? Aren't you being too perfunctory?

516
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,710
Okay, I'll consider it.

517
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,880
I'm not interested.

518
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:12,230
Mo Fei...

519
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,920
Do you know what it means to be my assistant?

520
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,950
- If this press conference—
- Director Fang, I still have to work and time is ticking.

521
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:22,150
I'll buy you coffee another day. I appreciate your kindness.

522
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:25,340
Bye-bye, bye-bye! We'll set up another time to meet.

523
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:30,100
You really don't know how well I treat you.

524
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:34,680
- Dad.
- Yes.

525
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:39,200
- Why haven't you gone to bed yet? Its so late.
- I just finished talking with your Uncle Wei on the phone.

526
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,940
- Has the embroidery workshop's problem been solved?
- It's been solved.

527
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,930
What are your thoughts?

528
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:49,230
I'm a junior, so there are many things that I can't say.

529
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:53,880
Uncle Xia must have his own thoughts.

530
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,260
You know it in your heart.

531
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:09,200
Oh, right! About SLC, I plan to make a trip there myself.

532
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,800
So far we've been communicating over the distance.

533
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,690
I think this whole thing is not progressing much.

534
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:17,010
If we talk in person, the result may be different.

535
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:19,080
Going to France?

536
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:26,920
That's good, too. To do business, we must have views about the ecosystem, the overall situation, and the future.

537
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,080
We cannot only pay attention to our own industry.

538
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,860
We must have our own core technology and have a view toward the future.

539
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:35,880
If you can successfully acquire SLC this time,

540
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,040
it is a crucial step for Mingyuan.

541
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,820
Don't worry, I'll take care of it well.

542
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,470
Big...

543
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,020
Big news!

544
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,440
- My cousin is going to Paris.
- Is it true?

545
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,200
Of course, it's true.

546
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,720
My cousin, the 10,000-year-old iceberg is finally enlightened.

547
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,680
Wait.

548
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:13,000
You didn't give my sister's phone number to your cousin, did you?

549
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:20,920
- It was an accident. An accident.
- How could you...

550
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,450
How could you do this? My sister especially told me not to tell anyone.

551
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:26,930
Even me, she wouldn't let me... You...

552
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:30,030
You... are not being a good friend.

553
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,300
You really don't understand a woman's heart.

554
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,520
Sister Mo Fei told you to not bother her.

555
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,080
She didn't say my cousin can't bother her.

556
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,640
- You're just distorting logic.
- This is a reasonable analysis.

557
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,800
Let me ask you this. The doll that my cousin gave her,

558
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,550
- did Sister Mo Fei take it with her?
- Yes.

559
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:50,560
That's right. If she didn't like my cousin,

560
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,950
she could have just thrown that doll away.

561
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,900
- Why did she take it to Paris with her?
- No.

562
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:59,040
No, what? This is the fact.

563
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,920
They definitely like each other and have love in their hearts.

564
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,000
Why are you slow-witted just like my cousin?

565
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,210
[Mo Fei]

566
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,780
I'm doomed. It's my sister calling.

567
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:19,290
Teacher Linda seemed to be looking for me just now. It's something urgent. She looked particularly anxious.

568
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:22,250
You go ahead and take the call. Don't panic. I'll go take a look. Bye.

569
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,360
You should at least tell me when your cousin is going.

570
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,520
You... don't you care if I live or die?

571
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,580
- Sister.
 - What kind of young brother are you?

572
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:44,250
You didn't ask me first and just gave my phone number away.

573
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:49,440
Sister, then... aren't I trying to redeem myself right now?

574
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,620
I just got a front-line battle report, and I'm reporting to you immediately.

575
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,920
- What battle report?
- Let me tell you.

576
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,410
Lu Zhu just said that her cousin is about to go to France.

577
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:02,240
Sister, if you really run into President Tang in a foreign country,

578
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,970
wouldn't he treat you to a good meal and trip?

579
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,000
Sister, if you run into President Tang,

580
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,810
just have a good chat with him. Don't always act so fierce every time you see him.

581
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:17,960
Chat, chat, chat! What is there to chat about? What relationship do we have? Why would he take me out to eat and have fun?

582
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,430
I have hands and feet. Why can't I go by myself?

583
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:26,300
Sister, I didn't say much.

584
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,330
Why are you so angry?

585
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:31,220
Did President Tang offend you somehow?

586
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:34,160
Why are you so angry when he is mentioned?

587
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:39,510
I-I'm busy. I'm hanging up.

588
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,810
He is coming.

589
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:04,590
♫ I say you're an April day ♫

590
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:08,670
