3
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:40,020
All right then. You can just take me to here.

4
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,990
Remember what I said, take care of yourself as well as home.

5
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,900
Little Brother, don't act like this. It's not like your sister won't return.

6
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,920
If you want, in a couple of days, get a ticket to France and go see her.

7
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,130
I want her to leave. It'll be great being home alone.

8
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,330
Look at you, being stubborn again.

9
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,090
All right. Hurry home. We have to go through the security check now.

10
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,280
But, Sister...

11
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,510
Looks like I'm not the only one who wants to send you off.

I feel a bit embarrassed about you coming to see me off.

00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,490
Why?

17
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,030
You've been so busy with work lately, yet you came to see me off.

18
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,420
You'll be away for such a long time.

19
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,550
I should come and say goodbye.

20
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:25,740
Are you not afraid of having your salary deducted?

21
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:31,730
Do you think anyone within Mingyuan can deduct my salary?

22
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,590
Director Xia.

I have to go through the security check now. Bye-bye.

26
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,790
I don't like things being vague..

27
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,930
Before you leave, I hope that we can make things clear.

28
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,500
President Tang, what haven't we made clear?

29
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:18,770
Since last time, you've kept mentioning Director Xia. Is that right?

30
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,020
Did someone say something to you?

31
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,710
No. I'm not stupid, I can tell what type of relationship you two have.

32
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,130
What can you tell?

33
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,320
Childhood sweethearts, a perfect match.

34
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,920
Lovers who end up happily ever after together.

35
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,990
I'm really happy for you two.

36
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,780
If Director Xia and I were actually together,

37
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,670
would you be delighted?

38
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,830
I would wish you happiness.

39
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,220

- Wish you success with your studies.

I'll exchange seats with whoever is next to you.

62
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,010
- That's not very appropriate, is it?
- How is it not?

63
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:03,500
Otherwise, it will be so boring for us two not to have anyone to talk to.

64
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,170
You're just afraid you'll be bored.

65
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,160
These international flights are over 10 hours long.

66
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,760
If a foreigner sits next to me,

67
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,750
we wouldn't understand each other at all. I'll be bored to death.

68
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,460
Leave it to me. I'll definitely get it done.

69
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:29,130
Welcome, thank you for choosing Air France, the flight from Shanghai to Paris.

We can't play with our phones anymore.

What is it? Since I accompanied you all day, do you want to buy a doll for me?

79
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,500
This little fox is quite cute.

80
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,150
Say, you picked up the little prince...

81
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:37,310
you don't have a prince syndrome, do you?

82
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,430
I'm buying it to gift to you!

83
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:42,660
Besides a doll, someone like you

84
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,030
will never meet a prince.

So you think I'm a good person because I'm nice to your master,

93
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,420
or do you think I'm a good person

94
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,460
because I'm inherently good?

95

you're an inherently good person.

97
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,090
What you need to do now is to not thank me,

98

but to believe in me.

99
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,730
Believe that, as long as I'm by your side,

It's so good to have you sitting next to me.

108
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,770
I have someone to talk to.

109
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:39,570
By the way, are you going to Paris to visit?

110
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,130
- I'm going for school.
- Which school?

111
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,450
School of Union Chamber of Parisian Couture.

112
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,320
ECSCP?

113
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,210
No way!

114
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,640
What a coincidence! My boyfriend graduated from there.

115
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,600
When we get to Paris, I have to introduce you two.

116
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,300
Let me tell you! My boyfriend is extremely handsome.

117
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,040
Originally, he was going to return home after graduation so we could get married.

118
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,480
But he told me that he wanted to stay in Paris for two more years.

119
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,230
He would return back home after he gains some experience. As for me,

120
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,320
I am afraid that those vixens in Paris will steal him.

121
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,760
That's why I'm sitting on such a long flight

122
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,690
to travel halfway across the globe to chase my husband.

123
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:28,560
So... you're going there for love?

124
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,690
Brother Xuan.

125
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,940
Why does it take you so long to get some blueprints?

126
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,460
Have they been revised?

127
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:03,610
They've been revised; the expansion areas have been revised according to what you want.

128
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:08,800
- You have a look. I'm heading out.
- Where are you going?

129
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,600
Don't you want to look at the blueprints?

130
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,170
I haven't finished looking at the blueprints and you want to leave?

131
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:16,600
In the past, didn't you dislike my presence when you looked at documents?

132
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,890
I indeed disliked that in the past, but that doesn't mean I dislike it now.

133
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,280
What I used to dislike before,

134
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,470
can't I like them now?

135
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,090
You can.

136
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,960
Brother Xuan, are you in a bad mood today?

137
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,040
- Is it very obvious?
- Yes.

138
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,510
- You may go.
- Okay.

139
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:13,640
[Tang Mingxuan: Xueling and I are really only...]

140

We finally arrived!

141
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,570
It was so tiring to fly for over 10 hours.

142
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,840
You've suffered, wifey.

143
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,330
Mo Fei, look at my boyfriend. Isn't he handsome?

144
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,000
Isn't he extremely handsome in person?

145
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,170
Don't say that. I'm embarrassed now.

146
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,970
By the way, Cheng Yang, Mo Fei also came to France to study design.

147
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:16,220
Apparently, she's attending the same university as you did! Isn't it such a coincidence?

148
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,880
Really? That is such a coincidence. You're my official junior sister.

149
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,250
- Hello, Junior Sister.
- Hello, Senior Brother.

150
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,870
Duoduo has been talking about you the entire trip here.

151
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,120
You've been troubled with taking care of Duoduo.

152
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,430
No way. I am the one who is troubling you.

153
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,900
I'm even troubling you two with giving me a ride.

154
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,760
No problem, I have a car anyway.

155
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,920
It's not a big deal for me to give you a ride to the youth hostel.

156
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,240
It's just that, you...

157
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,440
living at a youth hostel alone, isn't that a bit unsafe?

158
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,620
That's right. I also think that. I want her to live with me.

159
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,740
But she wouldn't. Say, wouldn't it be great if she stayed with me?

160
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,040
We could also split the rent...

161
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,510
No need to mention rent now.

162
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:59,880
I just think that both of you could live in Duoduo's place.

163
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,140
It will be safer for you two to stay together.

164
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,160
It's just... wouldn't it be inconvenient for you? That's what I'm afraid of.

165
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,420
How would it be inconvenient?

166
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,520
Are you afraid that I would bother you?

167
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,140
No, no! Why would I?

168
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,690
Pay attention. Strike a pose.

169
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,750
Not bad.

170
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:25,610
Shoulders back, how many times do I have to say it? Shoulders back!

171
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:33,960
Not bad. Strike a pose. Good. Now, turn.

172
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,830
All right. All of you have walked, right?

173
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:43,480
All right. Everyone, come here.

174
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,000
Throughout this training period,

175
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,820
I think everyone has improved a lot.

176
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,500
At first, I thought that you youngsters wouldn't be able to bear the hardships.

177
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,980
Unexpectedly, throughout the training,

178
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,000
you have all endured.

179
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,150
Don't be happy so fast.

180
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,650
The main point I want to say is

181
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,800
that your careers have only started.

182
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,920
Therefore, practice the basics. Those are the assets for your survival.

183
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,760
- Do you all understand?
- Yes.

184
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,120
All right. Rest for a bit.

185
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,780
Brother Xiaoyu, what a rare visitor.

186
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,730
Are you looking for me?

187
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,560
Of course.

188
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,920
I heard you have been performing quite well lately.

189
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,570
- Even Sister Linda praised you.
- What did she say?

190
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,720
She said...

191
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,040
She said...

192
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,360
Wait. Where is that Mo Fan who is always with you?

193
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,190
Such a liar! I knew you didn't come to see me.

194
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:03,660
Lu Zhu, you stepped so hard on my foot!

195
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,680
There he is, the person you were looking for.

196
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,380
He was looking for you.

197
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,110
Director Fang, were you looking for me?

198
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,740
He purposely came to see you and completely ignored me.

199
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,400
I came to ask you, why is your sister's phone turned off?

200
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,760
My sister... Is there something you need to reach her about?

201
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,250
Yes. Before, didn't we collaborate on a design?

202
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,010
We haven't finished the outfit, and I haven't been able to get in contact with her, so I came to ask you about it.

203
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,420
Mo Fan, you must not believe him. He has a lot of wicked plots.

204
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,740
You can't tell him your sister went to Fra—

205
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,130
- I...
- You...

206
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,350
You just said it!

207
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,830
Mo Fei went to France?

208
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,950
- Did she get accepted?
- What?

209
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,610
I...

210
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,410
Just tell me already!

211
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,170
I...

212
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:50,740
Did you forget who protected you

213
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,340
when you were fighting with your cousin?

214
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,830
Brother Xiaoyu, I...

215
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,530
Director Fang, don't put her in a difficult position.

216
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:03,120
This is the situation. My sister went to study at ECSCP.

217
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,000
Then... please give me your sister's contact information.

218
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,680
Director Fang, it's not that I don't want to give it to you.

219
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,300
My sister has just arrived in France and she hasn't even got a sim card...

220
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,940
Fine. I will be back in a few days to ask you again.

221
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,250
You lad... you treat her quite well.

222
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,160
What does it have to do with you? You're so nosy.

223
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,200
Let me tell you... Girls have to learn to be more gentle

224
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,940
in order to be charming. Hurry on inside to practice.

225
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,800
- I'm leaving.
- Wait, Director Fang.

226
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,490
- Are you really looking for my sister because of the outfit?
- Of course!

227
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,340
If you don't believe me, ask her.

228
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,500
Remember. Contact information.

229
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,720
Take care, Director Fang.

230
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,840
Mo Fan, are you really going to sell your sister out just like that?

231
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,880
You are so disloyal.

232
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,250
I'm disloyal? I simply don't want to be loyal.

233
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,760
I said all that because Director Fang was putting you in a difficult position.

234
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,390
As for you, you even stepped on my foot. You really are too much.

235
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,380
- Is your foot okay?
- Yes, it is. I was just lying to you.

236
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,720
But why do you call him Brother Xiaoyu? Are you two really close?

237
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,160
We are. We've known each other since we were really young.

238
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,560
Our parents are friends, so we played together when we were young.

239
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,500
Childhood sweethearts...

240
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,140
Who is his childhood sweetheart? Am I that old?

241
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,360
When they were in high school, I was still in elementary school.

242
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,260
- They?
- Yes. My cousin and Brother Xiaoyu.

243
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,850
They are the same age and were even classmates.

244
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,140
Classmates?

245
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,520
Then, why did my sister say their relationship was bad?

246
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,120
Don't worry about that.

247
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,450
Their fight is between them. But they both treat me very well.

248
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:42,020
Also, Brother Xiaoyu may look like he's fooling around

249
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,860
but he's actually quite reliable.

250
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:47,820
Indeed. He was quite reliable last time backstage.

251
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,020
If it weren't for my cousin,

252
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,090
he and Sister Mo Fei would make quite a nice couple.

253
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,720
You can't say such words so casually.

254
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,480
All right, I am leaving now. Don't be late.

255
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,440
Wait for me! Why are you walking so fast?

256
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,800
But... today, we'll be a bit exhausted.

257
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,450
Duoduo, the elevator is broken.

258
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,400
It's fine.

259
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,690
Mo Fei, you were right.

260
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,050
The stairs are so beautiful.

261
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:29,400
Right? Doesn't it look like the one in the movie, The Professional?

262
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,490
The one that Natalie Portman lived on the top floor of.

263
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,640
Yes, yes! That's the one!

264
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,640
Cheng Yang, I like this staircase so much!

265
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,860
It's great that you like it.

266
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,820
Let's go upstairs and see the place.

267
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,410
Which unit is it?

268
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,450
On the fourth floor.

269
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,520
Careful.

270
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:08,860
Duoduo, what's in your suitcase?

271
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,520
It's so heavy.

272
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,520
- Cheng Yang!
- Yes.

273
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,630
- Coming.
- Help me carry this.

274
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,120
When will this elevator be repaired?

275
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,960
How about... we...

276
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,020
go in and take a tour first?

277
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,000
All right.

278
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
- Mo Fei.
- Please come in.

279
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,400
Come, come.

280
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
- Cheng Yang, is that my room?
- Yes.

281
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,900
Yes, it is.

282
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,400
My goodness!
♫ How could that be? ♫

283
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,400
♫ Thinking of you makes my heart thump ♫

284
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,400
♫ What should I do? ♫

285
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,400
♫ Seeing you makes my cheeks turn pink ♫

286
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,800
- It's huge.
- Yes.

287
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,800
It's so big.

288
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:15,000
♫ Even the air becomes overly sweet ♫

289
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,000
♫ I haven't even had time to react ♫

290
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,500
♫ yet I'm possessed ♫

291
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
♫ Walk forward ♫

292
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,500
♫ another step and it's a rainbow ♫

293
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,600
Let me take a look.

294
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,200
It's beautiful, isn't it?

295
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,000
Let's take a look at the living room.

296
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
There's more?

297
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Heavens, it's huge.

298
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,250
Look at this.

299
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,800
It's just so beautiful.

300
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,000
♫ Could it be that this is the impulsiveness of love? ♫

301
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,300
- It's so nice.
- I'm exhausted.

302
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,600
- Mo Fei.
- Yes?

303
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,550
I think you should stay here for now. Okay?

304
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,000
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

305
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,500
Thank you, thank you! I'm so happy!

306
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,400
Cheng Yang!

307
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,400
Cheng Yang!

308
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,200
Cheng Yang!

309
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,800
I really like it here.

310
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,210
It's great that you like it. If you don't like it,

311
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,400
we can get you a different place once I'm not so busy.

312
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,000
How is that possible?

313
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,400
Cheng Yang, one look and it's obvious you put a lot of effort into this place.

314
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,000
You redecorated this place. Everything is new.

315
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,700
- You've worked hard.
- She's obviously in the same industry as me.

316
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,000
What a coincidence.

317
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,100
You'll definitely be able to use this.

318
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,200

480
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,370
You spoke so beautifully.

481
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:06,520
I got it from watching TV.

482
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,880
You are so clever, no wonder everyone adores you.

483
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,460
I'm just a little clever.

484
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:15,950
My Cheng Yang is a true genius.

485
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,550
Do you know something, Mo Fei?

486
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:21,580
For the outstanding graduates, your school

487
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,560
has something like a development program.

488
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,680
When Cheng Yang graduated,

489
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,000
the school gave him a large sum of money so he could start his own studio.

490
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,580
But he didn't take it.

491
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:36,100
He insisted on going to someone else's workshop to work as an assistant.

492
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,880
Being able to be an assistant is really amazing, too.

493
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,300
Before that, he even won an award...

494
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,330
LV something...

495
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:47,280
LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers?

496
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,920
Yes, yes! That's the one.

497
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,870
I can only remember the "LV."

498
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,440
My goodness! What kind of outstanding people have I just met?

499
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,290
Turns out Cheng Yang is that amazing!

500
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:59,250
- He is so amazing yet he works as an assistant for someone else?
- I know, right?

501
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,390
I also think it's a waste of talent.

502
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:04,030
But Cheng Yang doesn't think so.

503
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:08,210
He said there are easily a bunch of people like him in Paris.

504
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:10,550
He is too humble.

505
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:14,020
He is not humble. He has aspirations.

506
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,860
Cheng Yang said he will definitely achieve something

507
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:21,320
to show the French that you don't have to be French to understand fashion design.

508
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,030
He is right.

509
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:27,660
I must work harder, and use Chinese design

510
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,850
to make an achievement in France.

511
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,180
You can definitely do it.

512
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,770
- Are you going to eat this?
- No.

513
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,010
I'm going to take it all then.

514
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:41,110
I have business to tend to.

515
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:07,460
[The sunshine in Paris was really nice today!]

516
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,730
[Post]

517
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:20,380
[Mo Fei: The sunshine in Paris was really nice today!]

518
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:28,000
Sunshine (yang guang). It seems that you've really let things go.

519
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:32,860
What did you say that I let go of?
 (His name literally means "sunshine")

520
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:39,840
Can you take these documents back to your office to sort them out?

521
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,800
Yes.

522
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,350
I'm leaving then, Brother.

523
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,140
I'm going.

524
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,560
- T-This. Where is this in France?
- I know, I know.

525
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,340
Don't you think this photo is a bit ugly?

526
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,450
- So nice.
- This picture is really pretty.

527
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:05,660
I am so envious of Sister Mo Fei.

528
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,640
I want to go to Paris again.

529
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,860
Is that right?

530
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,630
Let me see.

531
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:16,590
What are you looking at?

532
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,960
Tickets to Paris.

533
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,420
You-You are going to Paris? Are you not going to train anymore?

534
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,390
Teacher Linda will break your legs.

535
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:24,490
Calm down, okay?

536
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:28,420
So annoying.

537
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,480
Forget it.

538
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,910
The person who wants to go to Paris the most, isn't me anyway.

539
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:36,270
Who is that then?

540
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:41,060
The person who can't sleep every night and lies awake with his thoughts.

541
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:47,080
- We should go practice.
- Okay.

542
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,360
I'm coming to Paris.

543
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,730
Xiao, that's great!

544
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:55,840
I really like your new batik collection.

545
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,220
Also, I've decided

546
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:02,070
I will present a series of batik designs for next season's clothes.

547
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,940
You will be the chief designer.

548
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,650
I have to emphasize something first.

549
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:09,420
This design was jointly designed by me and a young designer.

550
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,850
If next season's big show will use this series,

551
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:17,340
I hope that both of our names will be on it.

552
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,600
I don't mind that.

553
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,770
If you don't have a problem with it, then I don't either.

554
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:24,660
You know that I always respect the designers.

555
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,130
Thanks.

556
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:27,800
I'll wait for you in Paris then.

557
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,330
Okay.

558
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:35,060
Li Qi.

559
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,400
Director Fang, has your meeting ended?

560
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,420
Make preparations. We're going to Paris.

561
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,620
Paris?

562
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:44,950
By the way, don't let the old man know that I'm going back.

563
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:48,760
Going to Paris so suddenly,

564
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,100
is it because of that Mo Fei?

565
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,680
You didn't fall for that girl, did you?

566
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,530
Can't I?

567
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:12,090
♫ I say you're an April day  ♫

568
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:16,010
♫ The sound of your laughter lights everything up ♫

569
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:19,580
♫ Even the spirit of a light breeze ♫

570
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:25,600
♫ In the midst of the brightness and beauty of spring,
shift as one would in a dance ♫

571
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:30,960
♫ You're the mist on a dry April day ♫

572
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,210
♫ The gentle breeze blown during dusk ♫

573
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:38,930
♫ The unintentional sparkle of the planetesimal ♫

574
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:44,880
♫ The fine rain that's sprinkled in front of the flower ♫

575
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,600
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

576
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:54,500
♫ Like a shy water lotus that bows to a cool breeze ♫

577
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:59,160
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

578
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:04,090
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫

579
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:08,660
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

580
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:16,750
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫

581
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:28,590
♫ You're like the ivory field after snowflakes ♫

582
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:33,000
♫ You're the round moon every night ♫

583
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,730
♫ You're the naïve ♫

584
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:41,440
♫ white lotus that floats on the water ripples of your dream ♫

585
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:48,250
♫ You're the flower blossoms of tree after tree ♫

586
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:52,610
♫ The swallow twittering within the beams ♫

587
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:56,280
♫ You are love, hope, and warmth ♫

588
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:00,650
♫ You're an April day ♫

589
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:05,280
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

590
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,230
♫ The bittersweet parting words of "take care" ♫

591
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:14,820
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

592
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:22,070
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫
