[Episode 2]

3
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,740
Why are you here?

4
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,990
I wanted to ask you why you were here.

5
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,810
Did you mail me my sketchbook?

6
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,530
- Not yet.
- But you clearly promised me the other day!

7
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,300
I did promise you, but did I say which day I'd return it?

8
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,600
You're playing word games with me! Why are you like this?

9
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,960
Let me ask you something.

10
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,130
Why?

11
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,310
No, no, no. Ask, ask, ask! Go ahead and ask.

12
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,620
When you were evaluating the red-crowned crane design,

13
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,510
why did you replace some of the drawnwork silk with organza?

14
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:39,390
Because using organza makes the whole outfit feel more ethereal.

15
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,020
Reducing the drawnwork makes it better overall.

16
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,250
Not bad.

17
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,680
How do you know my evaluation?

18
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,960
You eavesdropped on me?!

19
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,640
Although I'm a very low profiled businessman,

20
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,720
I don't deserve you associating me with "eavesdropping."
 (T/N: wordplay - eavesdropping is composed of two characters, one of which means "stealing" which isn't good for business)

21
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,410
- How did you know—
- I'm an honest person and will definitely do what I promised.

22
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,190
As to why I didn't send it to you,

23
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,740
it is because the phone number you left me was missing a digit.

24
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,200
Take a look.

(T/N: China's phone numbers should be composed of 11 digits)

26
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,980
Sorry.

27
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,420
T-This is right.

28
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,590
I'm truly sorry.

29
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,230
Hello?

30
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,240
My pig brain...

31
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,360
How does he know my evaluation?

32
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:52,060
Brother Xuan, someone saw Lu Zhu at Cayman, and she saw Fang Xiaoyu.

33
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,610
She said she wanted to enter a competition to be a model trainee.

34
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,090
- Let's go to Cayman.
- Okay.

35
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,960
- Lu Zhu.
- Yeah?

36
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,710
Say, you're back in Shanghai but you're not going home.

37
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:24,310
If Auntie finds out, I won't be able to explain it.

38
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,790
What's there to explain?

39
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,060
What is it? Are you afraid my aunt's going to misunderstand?

40
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,720
Don't worry. She knows me.

41
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,450
My standard for guys isn't that low.

42
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,130
Ha. Ha. Ha.

43
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,840
President Tang! President Tang!

44
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,080
Cousin?

45
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,930
Come home with me.

46
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,810
I still have to have dinner with Brother Xiaoyu.

47
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,170
Want to take your cousin home?

48
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,150
Well, my sister's been missing for three years.

49
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,730
I'd like to take her home, too.

50
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,120
When will I be able to do that?

51
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,590
I don't want to waste time on you. Come out.

52
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,950
Go back with him. I'll meet with you another time.

53
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,000
- Then, call me.
- Okay.

54
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,180
Auntie!
(T/N: paternal)

55
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,450
Zhu Zhu?

56
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,850
Are you surprised? It's unexpected, isn't it?

57
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,470
You're really back?

58
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:45,260
When your brother called to tell me you were coming back, I didn't believe it. Why did you suddenly come back?

59
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,600
Mom, you guys chat first.

60
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,020
Come, come, sit.

61
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,350
Did your cousin scold you?

62
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,740
Even if he really scolded me, then everything would be fine.

63
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,180
Do you know? He didn't say anything since he picked me up.

64
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,480
He's too scary.

65
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,970
You're getting bolder and bolder now, not saying anything and coming back. You didn't even come home.

66
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:12,020
It was because I was afraid he'd scold me, so I didn't dare come home.

67
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,450
I'll call your uncle in a bit and have him come home early.
(T/N: paternal)

68
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,200
What do you want to eat?

69
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,510
Hairy crabs.

70
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,900
- Nanny Wu!
- Yes!

71
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,020
Eat slowly. This is all yours.

72
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,430
No one even think of stealing it.

73
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,190
Zhu Zhu, it's not a holiday now.

74
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,500
Why did you suddenly come back?

75
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,100
Say something.

76
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,580
Your uncle is asking you something.

77
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,330
What's going on?

78
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,950
Our young lady here decided to take a leave of absence from school.

79
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,280
Take a leave of absence from school?

80
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,470
Why would you take a leave of absence from school?

81
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:56,280
I... I want to be a model trainee at Cayman.

82
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,090
I've already passed!

83
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,910
Do you really want to go to Cayman? Well, you should finish school first.

84
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,100
I don't like the major.

85
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,370
I really don't like Business Management at all. I want to be a model.

86
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,340
What's good about being a model?

87
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,640
You need to study well and graduate.

88
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,670
Help your uncle and cousin manage the company in the future.

89
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,360
That is a promising future.

90
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,890
Indeed, when your cousin and I helped you choose your major, we did have thoughts

91
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,150
of you entering the company to help out after graduating.

92
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,440
I really don't like the major and I don't want to manage the company either.

93
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,130
I just want to be a model.

94
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,410
You're really being ridiculous.

95
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,830
If the Business Management major could speak, it would say it didn't like you.

96
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,970
How am I being ridiculous? Why can't I be a model?

97
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,890
Why can't I pick the major that I like?

98
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:44,330
Don't drag my future down just because you are at odds with Fang Xiaoyu!

99
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,890
I'm already an adult! I have the right to make decisions about my own life!

100
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:51,660
Enough, enough. Let's not fight the moment we see each other.

101
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,560
Zhu Zhu, actually, you wanting to be a model

102
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,560
is not a bad thing.

103
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,970
Your cousin knows a lot of people in the industry. He can actually talk to some senior people.

104
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:04,670
When you are on vacation, you can come and have fun. You don't need to take an absence from school.

105
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,200
Have fun? I'm really not here to have fun.

106
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,140
I want to be a model. I want to be a professional model. A world-famous supermodel.

107
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,370
It's not impossible for you to become a world-famous supermodel.

108
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,850
If there were child supermodels, I would be the first to recommend you.

109
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,510
What do you mean by that? Can't I have my own dream?

110
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,780
That's right! You only care about your own well-being.

111
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,230
Since I was young, you've arranged everything for me.

112
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:30,430
But have any of you asked what I want or what I like?

113
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:34,730
- No one has ever cared about how I felt. I'll go. I'll leave, okay?
- Zhu Zhu.

114
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,490
- I can make my own decision. You guys don't need to bother with me.
- Lu Zhu!

115
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,790
Zhu Zhu!

116
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,100
- This child.
- Hurry and go check on that child!

117
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,850
Why chase after her? Mom!

118
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,540
Dad, what are you thinking about?

119
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,760
How's Zhu Zhu now?

120
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,750
She's just a child throwing a tantrum.

121
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,130
She'll be fine tomorrow.

122
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,570
Cayman is considered to be the

123
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:10,030
leading model agent company in the country.

124
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,360
If Lu Zhu really likes it,

125
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,650
I think it's okay to let her be a trainee.

126
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:19,560
It's just that Fang Xiaoyu...

127
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,650
No matter how much Fang Xiaoyu hates me,

128
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:26,820
I think he's not that close-minded.

129
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,540
Say, Lu Zhu with that personality of hers,

130
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,060
if we don't let her go,

131
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,660
wouldn't she run away from home?

132
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,560
That's right.

133
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,740
All right, let's not talk about that for now.

134
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,040
I want to discuss something.

135
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,350
After acquiring SLC, I want to merge it with Songtang.

136
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,760
So that Songtang won't look so bare.

137
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,450
I'm going to say something you might not like to hear.
- Go on.

138
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:58,360
Within the whole company, Songtang

139
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,440
is indeed the subsidiary brand with the worst sales performance.

140
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,790
What do you mean?

141
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,390
Do you also support ending Songtang?

142
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,690
When I was twenty-something, I was a worker at a textile factory.

143
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,340
Later on, I went into foreign trade and produced many ready-made clothes.

144
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,450
Now we have Mingyuan Group.

145
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:46,590
You can say that I've gone through many hardships in the clothing industry my entire life.

146
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:50,190
The enterprise I want to make big the most is Songtang.

147
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:55,310
Its craftsmanship, its oriental motifs, and its spirit

148
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:59,630
are worthy for us who are in this industry to pass down from generation to generation.

149
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:05,260
But it's a shame, I didn't manage it well.

150
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:09,510
Dad, I know you have invested a lot of effort into

151
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,890
and sacrificed a lot for Songtang.

152
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:15,000
However, this is a problem that pertains to the times. It's not your fault.

153
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,420
Don't shift the blame.

154
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,820
We're the people who guide consumer preferences.

155
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,470
Songtang contains oriental motifs. What does it represent?

156
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,750
Our ethnic elements. It's international and ever-lasting.

157
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:34,340
So this brand is worth us promoting to the world.

Imagine if one day, Mingyuan no longer has Songtang,

then where is Mingyuan's spirit?

Being sexy doesn't mean you have to show skin.

192
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:14,880
Besides, models are just tools to showcase clothes.

193
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,120
If you can't even do that, then why be a model?

194
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,540
But the problem is,

195
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,450
I can't see what's aesthetic about this design.

The overall standard of students this year

It's fine. The quality of students differs every year.

If there are none who are up to standard this year, then perhaps next year.

It's just that I made you come here today for nothing.

It is my student's drawing but it's not her graduation piece.

272
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:53,960
- From what I see, this is much better than the others.
- Really?

273
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,700
It's rare that there's a piece of work here that catches your eye.

Isn't this data enough to clearly point out the problem?

281
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:41,890
Old Xia, Songtang is the brand we started with when we built this enterprise.

282
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:44,750
It's our start and foundation.

283
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,850
If we didn't have Songtang back then,

284
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:51,050
we wouldn't have Mingyuan Fashion Group today.

285
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:53,160
I just think that

286
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,230
if you continue to hold onto Songtang like this,

287
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,870
in the end, what will be gone is our Mingyuan.

288
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:03,500
Old Tang, I know that it's very important to globalize Chinoiserie.

289
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,800
However, to shareholders like us, profit is more important.

290
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:18,090
If I say I have a way for Songtang to overcome the current predicament

291
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:22,920
and earn bigger profits, what would you all do?

292
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,990
Mingxuan, continue.

293
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:35,180
In the past few days, I've done a comprehensive analysis of Songtang.

294
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:39,880
If we break free from an inherent way of thinking when it comes to traditional Chinese clothing,

295
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,560
then starting from the clothing material to the traditional skills,

296
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,780
we can make overall changes to ultimately change Songtang's image.

297
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,680
By elevating Songtang to a luxury level,

298
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,680
we'll have a win-win situation by bettering our reputation and profiting at the same time.

299

How do you plan on realizing this dream of yours?

300
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:02,570
There is a total of three steps. First:

301
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:06,250
we have to have an in-depth collaboration with Fashion Daily.

302
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:10,190
Songtang will be the first in a series of collaborations between Mingyuan

303
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,360
and Fashion Daily.

304
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:18,670
Second: I insist on acquiring SLC. Third:

305
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:23,330
our Mingyuan Fashion will promote a new variety show, called

306
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,600
"Chinese Fashion."

307
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,530
Through this program, we will be able to use television and internet platforms

308
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,500
to publicize and market.

309
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,700
At the same time, we will choose

310
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,230
some young, talented, and passionate participants to enter Songtang.

311
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:43,240

If it were 10 years ago, I would surely support you.

316
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,560
Also, I would take the chance with you.

317
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:13,040
Right now, you need to know that every decision you make

318
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:17,000
is connected to your future and fate here at Mingyuan.

319
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:22,370
I think what you discussed with me last time makes a lot of sense.

320
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:26,850
You, me, Songtang, as well as Mingyuan.

321
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:29,470
We're destined to be inseparable.

322
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,880
If Mingyuan doesn't have Songtang today,

323
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,190
then would it still be Mingyuan?

324
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,470
So I am willing to take a gamble.

325
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:42,140
Earlier at the meeting, you mentioned SLC.

326
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,630
The acquisition price is certainly a point of contention.

327
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:49,660
But what is more important is everyone's belief is not the same.

328
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:53,740
For example, they believe that our clothing processing technology

329
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,360
is not up to their standards.

330
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,470
Fashion Daily's President Wu also mentioned that point.

331
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:04,360
He asked how we can make our fashion more acceptable and liked by younger people.

332
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,970
Our craft is a really important link.

333
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:10,270
Then, what are your thoughts on that?

334
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:16,570
I know there's an old embroidery workshop in Suzhou. Li Embroidery Workshop.

335
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,570
Their craft has been passed down for hundreds of years.

336
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:21,110
Think about it. If our Songtang

337
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:25,710
has Li Embroidery Workshop's craft, wouldn't that be interesting?

338
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:28,860
You're talking about veteran craftsmen?

339
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,850
Because of some historical reasons,

340
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:34,170
most of them are operated by families.

341
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:38,110
So, towards brand marketing and distribution,

342
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,870
they don't have much notion.

343
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:43,000
I just need to do whatever I can to meet their requirements.

344
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,220
This is not what I mean.

345
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,800
I am talking about humanity.

346
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,040
Business is business, why talk about humanity?

347
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,840
Look, you are still young.

348
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,340
In the past, I was like you.

349
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,910
What I am worried most about right now is

350
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:04,000
your nature to divide things so clearly.

351
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,920
You have to know if you speak like this to those veteran craftsmen, you won't get anywhere with them.

352
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:15,200
Compared to business, what they may view as more important are feelings and sentiments.

353
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,870
Remember, feelings and sentiments.

354
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:22,750
Enough. Stop lecturing me, Old Dad.

355
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:25,580
Here, have a sip.

356
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,390
Are you used to it?

357
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,880
I still can't taste what's so good about it.

358
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,190
It will be better in the future; drink more.

359
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:59,300
Mo Fei, do you not understand human language or something?

360
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,030
Didn't I already say that this neckline

361
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:05,040
has to show my collarbone's sexiness? Collarbone.

362
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,640
Look at your neckline! It is neither really high nor low. What is this?

363
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,210
Say, do you understand design? If this collar is any lower, it won't be showing your collarbone,

364
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,220
it'll be showing your breastbone.

365
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,830
In order to fix your frontal curves, I've already racked my brain.

366
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:21,530
Besides, you're also a professional. Don't you understand what hiding one's inadequacy is?

367
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:25,280
Hide what inadequacy? Hey, what is it with this attitude with yours?

368
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,580
What is it with this attitude of yours? You don't know how to grow vegetables,

369
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:31,250
so you go to another garden to nitpick.

370
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,860
Because... I am your client.

371
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,410
So you think you're god?

372
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:38,530
Excuse me.

373
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,700
Director Fang.

374
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,660
Sorry, did you make this outfit?

375
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,060
I am Cayman's Design Director, Fang Xiaoyu.

376
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:56,660
You... You're Fang Xiaoyu?

377
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,390
You're the gifted designer who got the France Youth Design Award at

378
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:02,010
age sixteen?

379
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,560
This gown is not bad. Two days ago, Teacher Pan and I were even praising it.

380
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:12,490
Clothing still has to be worn by people.

381
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:16,650
Some designers have too many opinions.

382
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:20,360
They don't consider their client's needs at all.

383
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,990
Yes, the client's needs are really important.

384
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,770
They've spent money after all.

385
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:32,410
So they think they have the right to not respect the designer's aesthetics and insights.

386
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:37,420
I have seen your original design. What you wanted was not this.

387
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:40,970
But it still didn't affect your potential, isn't that right?

388
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,250
Thank you, Director Fang.

389
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:46,350
Do you have time for coffee?

390
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,750
But I am not finished here.

391
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:53,950
What else do you need to do? Miss Bai, you don't need her to help you change clothes, right?

392
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:56,920
Of course not! Of course not...

393
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,750
T-T-Then let's go next door.

394
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,710
Sure, let's go.

395
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,590
Are you not on good terms with Bai Xiaoman?

396
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:14,640
It's not good or bad, we are just acquaintances.

397
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,220
Teacher Fang, can I ask you a question?

398
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:22,830
Regarding the neckline matter mentioned earlier,

399
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,820
what do you think?

400
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,310
Weren't you quite confident earlier?

401
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:33,090
Actually, a lot of people have different opinions

402
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,800
towards the neckline.

403
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,910
Recognition comes from understanding. It relates to one's appreciation for another's thought process.

404
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:44,550
If I were to take care of it, I would do the same.

405
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,020
See, that's my thought.

406
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,860
Because of this neckline, I have to explain a lot every time.

407
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,220
It's actually quite lonely to be in this profession of ours.

408
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,680
If you can meet someone who has the same belief as you,

409
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,970
then you would think it is a gift from god.

410
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:02,150
Like... us two being able to drink coffee here,

411
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,250
isn't it a miracle?

412
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:07,650
We chatted pretty happily today.

413
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:11,810
Oh, right! Miss Mo, this is my name card.

414
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,690
If you need anything, contact me at any time.

415
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,440
- Thank you, Director Fang.
- I'm leaving now.

416
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,460
- Take care, bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

417
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,130
Mo Fei!

418
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:38,000
- What is it?
- "What is it?"

419
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,270
Don't you know what?

420
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,120
You stole another man I like.

421
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,900
I stole another... What exactly are you talking about?

422
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,230
Stop pretending to be innocent. Do you think I don't know?

423
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,760
When we were in college, you caused me to be expelled.

424
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,120
In front of the senior I liked, you took all the spotlight.

425
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,720
It's the same today! You caused me to look really bad in front of Fang Xiaoyu.

426
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,840
I haven't finished!

427
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,280
Do you think I am easy to bully?! Do you think I don't dare to do anything to you?!

428
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,590
What do you want?

429
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,820
I'm warning you, stop ruining things for me.

430
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,490
Or else, I'll slap you every time I see you.

431
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:15,490
I am talking to you!

432
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,110
How is it going with Master Li?

433
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:26,130
The coordinators we sent were all chased away.

434
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:34,030
Hey, could it be that our rival is up to something?

435
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:39,200
Let's not think too much now and do well ourselves first.

436
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,940
Mingxuan, do you want to consider it some more?

437
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:46,330
Since the embroidery workshop isn't willing to work with us in the end,

438
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:50,500
why does our Mingyuan need to lower itself to beg them?

439
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,280
Didn't you show me a lot of work?

440
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,450
But in Su embroidery,

441
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:59,300
Master Li has the most work and has the most complete set.

442
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:03,490
How about you take care of your work for Chinese Fashion first?

443
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,610
I'll make a trip personally.

444
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:07,910
You'll go personally?

445
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,710
Why not?

[Application Work for ESCSP - Send Out By April 25th]

Wow, Sis, you—

448
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,290
Did you clean this whole place up?

449
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:13,460
Wait! Why did you bring more stuff back again? Tell me! Where am I supposed to put it?

450
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:16,810
Sister, I found money and specifically bought you good food.

451
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:18,600
Really? Where did you find it?

452
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,700
On your bed.

453
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:27,650
Isn't this the outfit you were going to bring to that design school in France?

454
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,350
It isn't anymore.

455
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:32,780
Why? Doesn't it look pretty nice?

456
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:36,060
Look! The sleeve here is not right.

457
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,990
The sleeve looks really nice.

473
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:00,920
I am going to an embroidery workshop to learn about Su embroidery.

[Then you're most likely taking the earliest high-speed rail.]

475
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,290
Wait. How do you know?

476
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,710
Could it be...

477
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:20,630
that he’s a pervert who’s stalking me?

478
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,590
Why are you offline now?

479

00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,490
- Yang Guang.
- Yes.

481
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,880
- Ask for directions.
- What?

482
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,120
Ask her how to get to the embroidery workshop.

483
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:10,000
Isn't she the very stubborn girl?

484
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,590
Miss Mo! Miss Mo, Miss Mo.

485
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,160
- It's you?
- I...

486
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:24,450
It's so good to see you. Do you know how to get to the Su embroidery workshop?

487
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,830
Why?

488
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:29,380
It is... our boss. He has to go to the Su embroidery workshop to discuss business.

489
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:34,310
- My GPS c-can not find the way there.
- What?!

490
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,730
- Then I'll help you look it up.
- Hey, hey.

491
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,710
Our boss is especially hard to get along with, you know?

492
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:49,610
Both of us are people oppressed by their boss,

493
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,450
so can you take me to the Su embroidery workshop?

494
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:23,120
You're taking a ride in someone else's car yet you're not going to say thanks?

495
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:28,920
Needing someone to navigate doesn't require thanks either?

496
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,320
Hello.

497
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,920
What is President Tang doing? Why isn't he answering his phone?

498
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,620
Did he forget about the event in the afternoon?

499
00:37:55,620 --> 00:38:00,760
Director Xia, our President Tang is a bit busy right now.

500
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,920
So, his schedule was suddenly changed.

501
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,360
I already told your secretary, didn't he tell you?

502
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,510
What is he busy with? Why didn't he tell me the schedule was canceled?

503
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,030
Sorry about that, Director Xia.

504
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,570
Then have him answer the phone.

505
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:20,220
It's not really convenient for President Tang to answer the phone right now.

506
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,870
All right, then tell him to

507
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,460
call me when he has time.

508
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,560
All right.

509
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:56,470
President Tang, thank you for coming from afar in regards to the embroidery workshop.

510
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:59,060
However, I'm very sorry.

511
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:03,830
I have actually already told Director Xia on the phone that Li Embroidery Workshop

512
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:07,530
has never had plans to be acquired.

513
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,660
Is it because of money?

514
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,880
No. The price you offered

515
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,410
is much greater than what I could possibly imagine.

516
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:20,870
From what I know, there also several other companies trying to acquire the embroidery workshop.

517
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:23,190
However, I believe you can tell that

518
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:26,030
our Mingyuan has the most to offer.

519
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:30,210
Taking the high-end route is most beneficial for the future of the embroidery workshop.

520
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,780
You are correct.

521
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,980
Please have tea, President Tang.

522
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,760
Master Li,

523
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,670
I'm actually quite aware of the embroidery workshop's financial situation.

524
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,600
The embroidery workshop indeed has some problems.

525
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,370
However, compared to pushing the embroidery workshop into a commercial business,

526
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:58,090
these problems

527
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:01,290
are not worthy of headaches.

528
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:03,660
Is that really so?

529
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:08,690
But from what I know, the embroidery workshop hasn't had any income in the past six months.

530
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:12,320
Also, within that half a year, five embroiderers have already left.

531
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:18,880
Master Li, don't ruin the future of the embroidery workshop

532
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,710
because of your own selfishness.

533
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:29,090
Why are you so sure

534
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:32,850
that collaborating with Mingyuan will give the workshop a future?

535
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:37,650
Of course, I am sure. As long as the embroidery workshop agrees to collaborate with us,

536
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:41,410
we can give the workshop a large amount of funds in a short period of time.

537
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:43,610
Also, in accordance with our globalization plan,

538
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:46,500
we can promote the embroidery workshop.

539
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,530
It can elevate the notability of the embroidery workshop overseas.

540
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:52,240
I believe that through our brand's effect,

541
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,990
it can cause more people to join. I even have the idea

542
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:58,590
of collaborating to open a school.

543
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:01,320
President Tang, I really have matters to attend to.

544
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,350
Please go back first.

545
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:07,050
I think we don't have the need to discuss this any further.

546
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:20,490
Regardless of whether the collaboration happens or not,

547
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,500
I still need to thank you.
