[Episode 42]

3
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,180
Xueling.

4
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:49,340
What's been going on with you lately? Why aren't you picking up my calls?

5
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,620
Is there something going on with you, or...

6
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,440
I think...

7
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,890
we shouldn't see each other anymore.

8
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,610
Did I do something to upset you?

9
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,530
Tell me. I will change.

10
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,850
I know you are sincere towards me.

11
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,520
You treat me really well.

12
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,540
But we aren't suitable for each other.

13
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,970
We can't possibly be together.

14
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,450
Don't waste any more time on me.

15
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,890
I don't want to waste your time.

16
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,420
Why?

17
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,520
We weren't like this before.

18
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,550
During this period of time, didn't you like spending time with me?

19
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,250
You also have feelings for me, right?

20
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,060
Why are you being like this?

21
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,790
Why are you being like this towards me?

22
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,240
Why are you being like this towards yourself?

23
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:48,340
Because he is still in my heart.

24
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,270
Auntie, I came here to apologize to you.

25
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,560
After I got home, my cousin told me all about

26
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,780
my mom coming here to cause trouble.

27
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,050
Cousin?

28
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,570
I told Lu Zhu.

29
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,080
Who is Lu Zhu?

30
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,520
Mom, we will talk about that later.

31
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,820
Listen to what he has to say first.

32
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,330
Auntie, my mom is sharp-tongued but soft-hearted.

33
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,550
She acts like a little girl when she gets angry.

34
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,530
She has no filter for what she says.

35
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,120
Therefore, Auntie, please just forget about it and do not hold a grudge against her.

36
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,180
I am angry.

37
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,720
But from a mother's point of view,

38
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,980
I can understand her.

39
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,890
Because she is concerned about her son.

40
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:29,420
From my point of view, as long as you are serious about Mo Fei,

41
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,180
I have no issues.

42
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,950
However,

43
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,650
if you two end up together,

44
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,300
both families' approval

45
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,160
is the key to your happiness.

46
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,820
Therefore, about your mother,

47
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,450
you must resolve that yourself.

48
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,690
Auntie, in regards to that, you do not need to worry at all.

49
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,890
It's my mom, so I will deal with her.

50
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,370
Even if I can't get through to her, my mom has always disapproved of my relationships.

51
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,840
I can make my own decisions when it comes to my relationships.

52
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,850
Ever since the day Mo Fei and I got together,

53
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,570
I wanted to eventually get married.

54
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,230
Since you have said that,

55
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,770
I am relieved.

56
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,390
But you should also think carefully

57
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,920
about how you will tell your mother about this.

58
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,730
I understand.

59
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,440
I am sorry.

60
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,630
Xueling said she won't get married anymore. She is angry now.

61
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,450
Go comfort her.

62
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,760
What's wrong, Empress Dowager? Are you in a bad mood?

63
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,040
How could I dare be in a bad mood?

64
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,950
Every day, I must act accordingly to your will. I dare not. I am in a great mood.

65
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,420
Forget that. Whose will have you ever acted according to?

66
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,300
Yours.

67
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,440
How could I dare to?

68
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,530
I'm not angry at Xueling.

69
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,620
I'm just thinking, you are not young anymore,

70
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,180
so why are you still so immature?

71
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,850
Why are you so slow-minded?

72
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,860
Do you think your son is slow-minded?

73
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,860
He wasn't before, but he is now.

74
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,650
Now that you've been met with love, not only you are slow-minded,

75
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,160
you are a little dummy.

76
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,510
Listen, Mom. Let me talk to you about the Fang Weiguo situation.

77
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:41,610
Since the beginning of this matter, I have thought of a resolution.

78
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,080
- What resolution?
- I can't say right now.

79
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,180
- You are just trying to pacify me.
- I am not!

80
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,610
If I cannot resolve this matter, no matter what you say in the future,

81
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,240
I will listen to you.

82
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:58,270
Keep delaying it. Delay it until Mingyuan isn't ours anymore and then you will finally be happy.

83
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,210
Trust me, Mom.

84
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,890
You've got blinded by that Mo Fei. You can't see anything clearly anymore.

85
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,660
You should know she is very formidable.

86
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,640
Her little mouth won't stop talking.

87
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,530
There is logic, reasoning, and parallelism in her words. So annoying.

88
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,890
Does she have that side to her?

89
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,440
Of course, she wouldn't show this side of hers to you.

90
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,870
But I saw it.

91
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,570
She's a small person doing great mischief.

92
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,960
She's so young and already two-faced. What will she be like in the future?

93
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,620
Look at how outstanding of a girl Mo Fei is. I have never seen this side of her.

94
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,350
W-What does this prove?

95
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,650
That she is intelligent and responsible.

96
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,630
Did you know that, after meeting you a few times now, she has never told me about it?

97
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,880
Mom, what you and her need most

98
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:46,290
is to communicate and interact more. I will bring her home to chat with you and dad when I have time. Okay?

99
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,200
Thank you, Young Master.

100
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,620
Please don't bring her here. I don't want to get to know her, I don't want to see her.

101
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,430
Move. I want to rest now.

102
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,570
Mom, Mo Fei is especially great at making clothes.

103
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,480
I will have her make a few outfits for you, all right?

104
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,320
Am I so destitute now that I have to ask her to make my clothes?

105
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,890
I still have money for that.

106
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,710
She also knows how to make jewelry.

107
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,880
I don't believe that.

108
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,780
Let me tell you! Don't even think about marrying her.

109
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,420
I must marry her.

110
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,870
"Little mouth won't stop talking?"

111
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,350
She depicts her quite vividly.

112
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,670
Mom.

113
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,310
Thank you.

114
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,000
For what?

115
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:46,570
Thank you for not making it difficult for Mingxuan.

116
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,910
Did you think I am that kind of person?

117
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,190
I feel so happy.

118
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,830
Since my daughter is happy, I, as your mother, am happy too.

119
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,220
However, my daughter,

120
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,300
this is only your first step on this long journey of love.

121
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,840
There will be many obstacles and hardships you will have to put up with in the future.

122
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,210
You will have to face them by yourself.

123
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,000
Because... in this world,

124
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:35,520
even the most unwavering love

125
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,670
may become weaker

126
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,820
become bad,

127
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,710
or disappear with the passage of time.

128
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,440
Mom,

129
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,860
you must trust your daughter.

130
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,340
I definitely will

131
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,250
live very happily.

132
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,590
I believe that.

133
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,980
When did you become so romantic?

134
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:30,640
- It's for you.
- I know. Who else would you gift it to?

135
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,390
Do you remember what you promised me?

136
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,350
- What did I promise you?
- Give me your phone.

137
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,840
- Why do you need my phone?
- Give it to me.

138
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,540
What are you doing?

139
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,410
What are you doing? Let me see.

[I want to wash each other's hair, and give each other body and foot massages.]

144
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,420
Brother Xuan, these are the 10 things that couples must do.

145
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,480
Have you guys done these before?

146
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,940
However, every version doesn't seem the same.

147
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:20,210
It depends on the type of couple they are.

148
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:24,440
I think you and Mo Fei can make a list to go do.

149
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,610
Have you done all of these before?

150
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,550
Of course. When I date, they are all normal relationships.

151
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,370
Have you never done these things?

152
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,760
No way.

153
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,040
I was wondering why you're always so busy after work?

154
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,650
Have you been dating everyday?

155
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:54,910
No! How would I dare let my work be affected?

156
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,290
Nice.

157
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,210
The stuff that your boss hasn't done before, you've already done them all.

158
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:03,010
You've even done them so well.

159
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:07,130
No, Brother Xuan, look. Don't you think this is especially vulgar?

160
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,120
And it's intolerably vulgar, right?

161
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,570
You have the overbearing CEO image, right?

162
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,630
This just... doesn't suit you.

163
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,690
Are you done sitting?

164
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,360
It's quite comfortable. Have a seat.

165
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,330
All right, get to work. I must learn these well.

166
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:30,310
- How about I teach you?
- You want to teach me?
- I was joking.

167
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,720
- I'll get going.
- Come sit here and teach me.

168
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,530
Look at it yourself.

Auntie, I personally made this clothing and want to gift it to you.

182
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:56,510
I suddenly don't feel very well.

183
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,860
- I'll be leaving first.
- Mom.

184
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,820

190
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,280

♫ Follow me in taking a huge step forward ♫

201
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,350
The distance between Shanghai and Paris

202
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,450
is 8,240 km.

203
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,450
I know, it isn't far.

204
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,660
But I will miss you.

205
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,400
The time it takes to reach Paris from Shanghai by plane

206
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,040
is only 12 hours.

207
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,280
I know, it isn't that long.

208
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,720
But I will still miss you.

209
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,600
The fox said to the little prince,

210
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,280
"If you come at 4:00 in the afternoon,

211
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,160
starting from 3:00, I'll start feeling very happy."

212
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,160
Even if I know when you'll be coming back,

213
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,200
I'll still miss you.

214
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,170
Mo Fei,

215
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,880
my feelings are firm.

216
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,070
So I am not afraid of a temporary separation.

217
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:26,720
It's just, I know how much I will miss you

218
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,990
after you leave.

219
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,600
That's why I don't want you to leave me.

220
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,730
Do you know?

221
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,150
Because I miss you too much,

222
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,620
I can't help but wish you would leave everything behind

223
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,730
to stay by my side at all times.

224
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,740
♫ The sun points to the direction ♫

225
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,600

You take care of yourself, too.

252

You're always so busy at work.

253
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,680
Don't stay up late, okay?

254
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,600
You also have to be happy every day.

This was my presentation. Thank you for your attention.

267
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,290
Thank you, Mavis.

268
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,360
Now, I'll invite Mo Fei

269
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,000
to present her design concept.

270
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,000
Hello, everyone.

271
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:47,000
My creation is based on the materials I chose.

272
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,110
The fabric I chose is a natural fabric unique to China,

273
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:53,250
ramie.

274
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,990
It is a plant of the nettle family,

275
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:03,310
native to southwest China.

276
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:06,370
It was one of the main fiber crops

277
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:10,030
during ancient Chinese civilization.

278
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:18,290
We call it the king of natural fibers.

279
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:22,200
Since the Yuan Dynasty in China,

280
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,530
they used ramie to make fabrics.

281
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:28,180
The process of making ramie

282
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,550
is really complicated.

283
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:40,660
Mo Fei, your presentation was outstanding.

284
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,840
I really liked the Chinese culture part that you talked about.

285
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,820
If you have a chance,

286
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:49,410
would you allow us to get to know more about it?

287
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,900
Yes, in fact, what I said was

288
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,490
just a small part of the Chinese culture.

289
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:00,760
In the future, I will surely share more with you all.

290
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,730
That's awesome. We're really impatient to hear it.

291
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:07,070
We are leaving. See you next time.

292
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,740
Okay, see you.

293
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,840
All right, we're going too.

294
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,370
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

295
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:19,280
Mo Fei, what you said at the podium today was so inspiring.

296
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,890
You almost became one of my idols.

297
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,500
Actually, I felt a little bad.

298
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,940
Why?

299
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,600
You saw the reaction among the classmates. However, within our country,

300
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,310
many experts in the field aren't interested in handmade ramie at all.

301
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:36,460
Not to mention those not in this field.

302
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,740
That's true.

303
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:42,210
Classmate Mo, you are taking a long road with a heavy burden in the future.

304
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:45,250
I think you can definitely do it. Fighting!

305
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,860
Fighting!

306
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:51,450
By the way, our school has many elective courses

307
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,560
that I think are helpful to you. Do you want to take a look?

308
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,140
Okay.

309
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:02,340
There really is a lot. My eyes are going blurry looking at all of them.

310
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:07,740
Appreciation of Oriental National Costumes.

311
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,050
This is good. I'll choose this one. How about you?

312
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,240
It looks good.

313
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,560
But this Professor Nicolas, I don't think I've heard of him.

314
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,870
Hello, Babe.

315
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,330
I just got out of class.

316
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:32,160
I also just left work. So tired.

317
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:36,260
What time is it? Why did you just leave work?

318
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,720
You are not here, so it doesn't make any difference if I leave work. I might as well stay at work longer.

319
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,720
It's boring at home anyway.

320
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,520
Then... are you eating well?

321
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,130
I haven't eaten yet.

322
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:52,360
In a bit, I'll be at home eating alone by myself.

323
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:57,200
Listen, I talked about ramie in class today.

324
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,560
How did you perform?

325
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,990
The reaction was excellent.

326
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:05,310
So I am especially making this call to thank you for taking me on that tour.

327
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,150
Silly.

328
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:10,060
Why are you always so polite with me?

329
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,540
I miss you.

330
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:20,150
I'm driving now so I'll call you back when I get home. Bye-bye.

331
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:31,500
Coming, coming.

332
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,170
Stop knocking!

333
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,120
Why are you here?

334
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,190
Why can't I come here? You haven't come home for so many days.

335
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:45,410
Of course, I want to see what temptress you're with.

336
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:50,540
Who told you that I live here? Was it Zheng Hang?

337
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,290
Temptress, right? Look for her. The closet is big.

338
00:25:56,290 --> 00:26:00,530
Open it and search. Look under the bed. Search anywhere you like.

339
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,160
Fine.

340
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,350
No one is here, right?

341
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,120
Then come home with me right now.

342
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,550
Go back to what home?

343
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,640
You won't come home, is that right?

344
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,220
Fine. If you don't come home today, then don't ever come home.

345
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,520
I'm going to change the lock right now. Even if you want to, you won't be able to come back.

346
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:19,980
Bai Xiaoman, say, why are you still clinging to me?

347
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,610
Didn't I tell you already?

348
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:24,580
We've broken up.

349
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:29,070
I wasn't joking. We have really broken up.

350
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,150
You want to get rid of me by simply saying that we've broken up, is that right?

351
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,890
You're quite simple-minded, Zhu Haitian!

352
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:41,060
I think you don't understand the situation.

353
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,760
The house you live in is my house.

354
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,330
On the deed, it's written Zhu Haitian.

355
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:48,960
Whenever I want to go back, I'll go back.

356
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,190
Anything wrong?

357
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:54,510
Now that you talk about this, I'm reminded of something.

358
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:58,680
Instead of staying in my own home, I'm staying at this worn out hotel.

359
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,380
Am I crazy?

360
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,530
You should be the one who moves out.

361
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:11,500
Zhu Haitian, what are you saying? Say it again.

362
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,160
Was I not clear?

363
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:19,520
I should go back to live in the big villa, and you should go live in a small hotel.

364
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,430
Zhu Haitian, you want me to move out, is that right?

365
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,920
- What are you doing?
- I'll beat you to death!

366
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,220
- Don't get physical!
- You jerk!

367
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,480
You want me to move out?

Sit tight.

385
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:26,790
Chairman Fang.

386
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:30,390
MIngyuan's stock has risen to its daily max again.

387
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,490
I saw.

388
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,670
Other than us,

389
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:38,480
there appears to be other people in the market pushing Mingyuan's stock price higher.

390
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,970
That rascal Tang Mingyuan indeed has some tricks up his sleeves.

391
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,360
Based on the current situation,

392
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,630
Mingyuan's stock price will keep rising.

393
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:55,000
Our funds will obviously be tight. If it continues like this,

394
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,480
I'm afraid it will become more and more difficult

395
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,560
to become Mingyuan's biggest shareholder.

396
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:06,230
Therefore, to continue or to give up, we need to make a choice.

397
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,780
Mingyuan's stock rising is not a bad thing for us.

398
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:15,110
Even though we can't be the largest shareholder,

399
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:20,270
if we cash it out, we can make a huge profit.

400
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:24,810
Therefore, based on the current situation, we won't lose in any case.

401
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:27,760
We can either attack or retreat.

402
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,890
What follows...

403
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:36,640
I'd like to know what moves they will make.

404
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,660
If it's based on the current rising trend of Mingyuan's stocks,

405
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,400
Fang Weiguo won't be able to continue buying.

406
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,950
So, I've determined that this is not Fang Weiguo's doing.

407
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,900
What do you think?

408
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,630
It's time to tell you now.

409
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:00,650
This is the solution that I mentioned.

410
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,700
This plan you've come up with is not bad. On the one hand,

411
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,390
the lawsuit is resolved. On the other hand, you can make money.

412
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:14,030
But you need to let me know why I should agree to it.

413
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,430
I know, President Tang, that this matter isn't that simple.

414
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:24,070
Therefore, if you have any additional demands, lay them out.

415
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,140
We can discuss it.

416
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,980
I don't really have any demands,

417
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,420
but I do have a problem to solve.

418
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:36,670
You should know that Fang Weiguo acquired a lot of our stocks in the secondary market.

419
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:40,100
Say no more. I understand everything now.

are my problems.

Otherwise, how would we get to where we are today?

433

It isn't enough to just have my assistance.

434

The crucial thing is that you have a good son. He is outstanding.

Without sacrificing a pawn, he can shoot down two birds with one arrow. The younger generation is really formidable.

436
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:46,140
Mingxuan, doing that, you're just forcing us old folks

437
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,780
to quicken our way towards retirement.

438
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:53,110
Uncle Fang, what Mingyuan did is only for self-preservation.

439
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:56,660
Say, how can I possibly let what my father achieved after a lifetime of hard work

440
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,180
change its name?

441
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,290
A tiger father doesn't have puppy sons. Old Tang, you have a good successor.

442
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,750
I think it's about time you retire, right?

443
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,750
Yes, I actually have that thought.

444
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,630
After enduring a lifetime's trials and challenges, I've been tired long ago.

445
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:16,950
Mingxuan is doing quite well now. The entire group has been doing better because of him.

446
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:19,960
I can't catch up to his thought process now.

447
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,850
Therefore, I've already thought it over. At our age,

448
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,880
we can be steadfast in going home

00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,360
I don't agree.

483
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,220
The child hasn't finished talking.

484
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,060
Doesn't he just want to marry Mo Fei?

485
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:29,610
He's already brought her home. Can I not tell?

486
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:33,920
No, Auntie, Sister Mo Fei is really good. Why won't you agree?

487
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,320
Is she good? Why can't I tell?

488
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,990
So young. Her temperament isn't settled. Xueling is better.

489
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:45,970
Xueling is more mature.

490
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:49,760
Even though our family isn't super-wealthy, we don't have particular demands or requests,

491
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,540
but the basic requirement is having matching family backgrounds.

492
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,750
We can't just drag any girl from the streets to be my daughter-in-law.

493
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,590
He and Sister Mo Fei didn't meet on the street.

494
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,220
They met at a press conference for a product release.

495
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,330
Yes, a press conference.

496
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:04,440
Is there a difference compared to the streets?

497
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,830
It's just phrased differently.

498
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:10,210
Auntie, you are being too traditional.

499
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:12,820
You should change much of your thinking.

500
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:16,510
Cousin is marrying for love, not qualifications. Isn't that right, Cousin?

501
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,110
Yes, love.

502
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,430
You are a kid, what do you know?

503
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:25,520
Listen! Only matching family backgrounds can create real love.

504
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,410
Only when the backgrounds are about the same, the problem of who is taking advantage of whom won't exist.

505
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:32,110
People will then have common topics to talk about when they sit together.

506
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:34,340
Only when the financial and spiritual aspects are equal

507
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:39,630
can we have equality between personality and family status in the long process of getting along.

508
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,370
Yes.

509
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:46,420
Do you think love can grow from mismatched conditions?

510
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,880
That is wrong. It will only result in a divorce.

511
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,620
Why are you kicking me?

512
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:58,840
I just want you to eat. The food is getting cold.

513
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:04,600
Listen, Mingxuan can be fiercely decisive at work,

514
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,970
but in his love life,

515
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,660
he is an innocent dummy.

516
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,070
Come on. You eat, too.

517
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,120
I'm full from Mom's words.

518
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,980
You... Hey!

519
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,730
- You haven't eaten...
- Hello.

520
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,770
Okay, I know.

521
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:19,980
Wait a second. I'm going out to make a call.

522
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,980
Look at what you did to the kid. He couldn't even finish eating.

523
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:27,870
I'm speaking the truth. You listen to me.

524
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,950
Auntie, go ahead.

525
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:35,090
I heard that this lecture's instructor is Chinese.

526
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:38,400
Based on what I know, Appreciation of Oriental National Costumes

527
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,220
usually has a Japanese instructor or a Chinese one.

528
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:45,240
It doesn't matter which country. The point is that he is very handsome.

529
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,850
He is also very young.

530
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,090
And then?

531
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:52,810
Then? My spring is about to arrive.

532
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,650
Okay then.

533
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,180
Hello.

534
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:08,790
It's not mine. It's yours.

535
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,510
Hello, everyone, do you remember me?

536
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:20,520
My name is Fang Xiaoyu.

537
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,860
Some students might have an impression of me.

538
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:29,380
I already talked to you about Chinese culture.

539
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,740
This semester, we'll have seminars together

540
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:35,980
on the evaluation and observation of

541
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:39,070
oriental national costumes.

542
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:42,710
Here, President Tang, let's have a drink.

543
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:50,300
I asked you out to drink with me.

544
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,150
Why are you having more fun than I am by drinking?

545
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:55,170
I really want to drink.

546
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:58,100
Duoduo keeps me under strict control.

547
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,760
She says I'm alcohol-dependent.

548
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,710
She won't let me go anywhere. Isn't that annoying?

549
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:09,120
So you should toast to me for letting you come out.

550
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,990
A toast to you, President Tang.

551
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,120
Thank you.

552
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,560
I didn't expect to see you there. What a surprise.

553
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,040
Why?

554
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,540
Wasn't your career on a rise in China?

555
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,720
Very few people will get out while they are rising.

556
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,030
I can tell what my real worth is. If I want to become

557
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:33,590
a truly outstanding designer, there is still a lot to learn.

558
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,350
By the way, how is Fang Qian doing?

559
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:40,540
Thank you for caring. She is doing quite well now.

560
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:44,720
She has a new life living overseas, and she's made a lot of new friends.

561
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,420
I knew it. She has such a good personality, surely everyone would like her.

562
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:53,150
You are not bad yourself. I heard that you used ramie to finish your assignment

563
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:56,240
and received unanimous praise from your teacher as well as classmates.

564
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,350
It's really awesome to create such a refined piece using ordinary material.

565
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:04,870
Am I awesome or is it Chinese culture that is awesome?

566
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:07,620
Both are awesome for sure.

567
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:11,430
I just didn't expect that you would return.

568
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:14,660
Don't I look like an instructor?

569
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,600
I didn't expect that you'd come back to teach.

570
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:21,650
I'm still very serious about my profession.

571
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:25,950
Previously, I only researched Chinese traditional clothing. The research result was pretty good.

572
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:30,210
My Alma Mater invited me to become the instructor for the elective course.

573
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:33,370
I can't help but say this, "A god is indeed a god."

574
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:35,760
I have truly benefited from your class.

575
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,840
Also, everyone really likes your class.

576
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,540
Really?

577
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,160
Of course. Look at today's class turnout rate.

578
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,790
I'll keep that in mind then.

579
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:47,250
From now on, I will pay close attention to your attendance rate.

580
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:51,020
If you are absent, that means you are lying today.

581
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,790
Don't worry. I will diligently attend your class.

582
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:55,420
I'm leaving.

583
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:14,840
♫ I say you're an April day ♫

584
