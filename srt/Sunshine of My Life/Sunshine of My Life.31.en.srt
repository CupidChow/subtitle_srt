[Episode 31]

3
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,130
Lu Zhen!

4
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,980
Why are you at my home?

5
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,350
I-I was just passing by.

6
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,650
I was really hungry so I came up here to find something to eat.

7
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,980
No, wait, then how did you come in?

8
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,970
Y-Your sister told me the passcode.

9
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,740
- Isn't she at Suzhou?
- Yes.

10
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,630
Yes, yes.

11
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,800
S-She is afraid of what dangers you would have at home

12
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,140
these few days. She specially asked me to come here to check on you.

13
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,090
My sister.

14
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,490
- Asked you to come and check on me?
- Yep.

15
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,220
- She will only be gone for a few days–
- Stop worrying about it.

16
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,660
Right now, I am really hungry. Can you make something good for me to eat?

17
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,670
Make me a sandwich.

18
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,270
All right.

19
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,510
Here.

20
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,760
H-Hurry up and wash your hands.

21
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,880
Okay.

22
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,290
Hey!

23
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,360
- What?
- Are you here to start a fire?

24
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,830
No.

25
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,020
Nope.

26
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,570
You're eating two sandwiches now? You're not on a diet anymore?

27
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,260
That is for me to take home.

28
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,970
Take home?

29
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,300
Yes, I'm going to eat it tomorrow.

30
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,530
I can't come to your house every day to eat sandwiches.

31
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,100
Why... are you still not leaving?

32
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,150
With you sitting here watching, I can't eat.

33
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,320
H-How long were you planning to stay at my house?

34
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,840
I will leave after I finish eating.

35
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,940
What? You're afraid of me stealing your house's stuff?

36
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,510
All right, then I'll be leaving.

37
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,310
Remember to lock the door later. You didn't earlier.

38
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,080
Okay!

39
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,960
Why are you still–

40
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,300
Why is there a bag of my sister's clothes?

41
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,160
Where is she exactly?

42
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,900
She's at...

43
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,480
Hurry up and say! What happened to her?

44
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:25,240
- She...
- If you don't tell me, spit out the sandwich.

45
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,610
Okay, I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

46
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,940
Everything is normal. Looks good.

47
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,730
It's nothing. Please rest.

48
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,830
Then, does that mean I can be discharged?

49
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,640
For the time being, you cannot. You have to stay for observation.

50
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,340
But I feel like my body is fully recovered.

51
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,760
Or is it...

52
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,670
I have some type of incurable disease and you're not telling me?

53
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,800
You're overthinking.

54
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,590
You only have a small concussion.

55
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,840
Don't worry. It is not really serious.

56
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,130
It will be good with some rest.

57
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,950
Isn't it just a concussion?

58
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,150
Is this necessary?

59
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,090
Did you need anything?

60
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,120
I... am here to look for Mo Fei.

61
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,160
Oh, she's not here.

62
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,610
I think she took leave.

63
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,450
Is there something else?

64
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,650
Nothing. I just wanted to talk with her.

65
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,270
I'm going to get coffee. Are you going?

66
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,020
I haven't finished my work.

67
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,780
All right then, I'll let you continue with work.

68
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,360
Alice, you forgot to get your water bottle.

69
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,490
Please wait for me. I'll go back to get it.

70
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,430
- A-Are you okay?
- Thank you.

71
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,800
Y-You hold onto it.

72
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,010
I just wanted to go out for some sunlight.

73
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:20,830
Have we met before?

74
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,180
Sorry. After I got ill,

75
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,110
my memory is a bit hazy.

76
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,120
If I forgot about you, I am sorry.

77
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,210
I-It's all right. It's all right.

78
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,740
Then, how about...

79
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,300
- I'll push you downstairs?
- Thank you.

80
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,700
I also don't have anything to do.

81
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,420
Be careful.

82
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,940
My name is Mo Fei. How about you?

83
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,940
- Call me Alice.
- Alice.

84
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,650
I still need to thank you.

85
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,780
What are you thanking me for?

86
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,630
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have been able to come out for sunlight.

87
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,040
Why?

88
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,800
My brother told the nurses

89
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,790
that they could not bring me anywhere further than 30 meters of the doctor's office.

90
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,220
I am about to be bored to death.

91
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:10,300
I think your brother is way too protective of you.

92
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,070
People are like flowers and grass.

93
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,140
If they don't have sunlight, they will wither.

94
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,550
Especially since you're sick, you have to get more sunlight.

95
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,210
When you go back, you have to harshly criticize him.

96
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,670
My brother is like that. I can't beat him.

97
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,390
I can only listen to him.

98
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:30,380
All right, but the hospital is like a cage locking me.

99
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,820
I only have a small concussion.

100
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,830
The doctors aren't letting me get discharged.

101
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,970
I am about to be suffocated to death.

102
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,990
How about you? What illness do you have?

103
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:46,340
- I have frequent headaches. It's neurological.
- Headache...

104
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:50,420
Is it migraines? I heard that migraines

105
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,780
are pretty bothersome.

106
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,490
But... I had surgery.

107
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,520
I should be able to get discharged soon.

108
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,890
You just had surgery?

109
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,530
Then you should listen to your brother.

110
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,670
Don't wander everywhere.

111
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,900
But you just said that my brother was too protective.

112
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,480
That was then, this is now. Right?

113
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,110
You're over here?

114
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,350
The nurse is here.

115
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,700
It looks like I have to leave.

116
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,620
It's all right, I can look for you.

117
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,640
Sure.

118
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,970
How did you get out here?

119
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,320
Let's go. Let's hurry up and go back.

120
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,280
How would she not know me?

121
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,930
Didn't she look for Fang Xiaoyu in France?

122
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,830
Like I say, my brother treats me the best!

123
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,940
You have brought me so many things! Look!

124
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,460
You even brought me a pencil.

125
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,720
Why are you so understanding, right?

126
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,280
You even brought me a sandwich!

127
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,180
How did you know that I'm not eating well at the hospital?!

128
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,600
Let me tell you! The chefs here, they're not even a little bit as good as you.

129
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,370
Completely...

130
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,520
This is for Lu Zhu to eat.

131
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,150
My head hurts again.

132
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:38,390
Your sister really is pitiful.

133
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:43,050
She got a concussion, got admitted to the hospital, and can't even have a sandwich.

134
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:46,840
You know that you have a concussion and have ben admitted to the hospital?

135
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,430
Sorry, I know I'm wrong.

136
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,180
I shouldn't have not told you.

137
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,860
I just didn't want you to worry.

138
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,160
Now you know you're wrong?

139
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,800
Something this big happened to you, and you didn't tell me?!

140
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,420
Is our relationship only going to rely on blood in the future?

141
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,990
I have already apologized! Why are you so harsh?!

142
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,450
What else do you think our relationship was for, for it to continue to now?

143
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,210
You are already like this and you're still talking back to me?!

144
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,360
What am I like?! I'm pretty good!

145
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,450
Look at me all lively and moving. My brain is fine, too.

146
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,810
You are really good right now?! Do you have to get some surgery to be satisfied?!

147
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:20,050
- Do I need to get a surgery for a concussion?!
- Stop arguing!
- Do you have a brain?!

148
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,400
It is all my fault. I caused Sister Mo Fei to be like this.

149
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,510
If it weren't because of me, she wouldn't have gotten admitted to the hospital and her head wouldn't be like this.

150
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,750
I even caused you two to argue. I am really sorry.

151
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,070
It is all my fault, Sister Mo Fei.

152
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,790
Lu Zhu, we usually interact like this.

153
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,470
- Yes, we do this every day.
- Yes, yes.

154
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:45,250
You two... really didn't argue?

155
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,760
- Of course not!
- Of course not!
- You guys are arguing.

156
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,830
How would that be possible? How would we argue? We...

157
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,360
Right? Look at how good our relationship is!

158
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,480
All right! Let's... hurry and tidy up.

159
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,590
- Hurry and tidy up for your sister.
- Don't, don't, don't.

160
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,340
Hurry up and eat it!

161
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,330
Mo Fei, hurry up and come in.

162
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,410
I just knew you would be bored! Why isn't your brother accompanying you?

163
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,590
He went out for some business. He'll come in a while.

164
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,300
Your room is really big.

165
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,550
Are you some type of wealthy family's daughter?

166
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:37,280
If not, your family's background must not be small.

167
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,380
It is that my brother exaggerated it a bit.

168
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,330
Your brother is so good to you! You have such a good life!

169
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:48,410
Unlike me, I have a little brother that won't rest if he does not make me super mad.

170
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,060
Your personality is so good.

171
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,300
Your family must be really happy.

172
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,950
That is. My brother and I, we are pretty heartless.

173
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,970
But we've argued till now since we were young.

174
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,280
Unlike other families who are warm.

175
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,510
When it is our family, it's a small cross-talk show.

176
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,660
I believe what you're saying is true.

177
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,770
Then... what do you do?

178
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:16,350
Is your work doing cross-talk?

179
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,950
How would I be someone who does cross-talk?

180
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,610
I am just an optimistic person.

181
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,350
Next time, I have to introduce my brother to you.

182
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,620
Him, his personality is also really good.

183
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,970
No, no, no.

184
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,400
I already have a boyfriend.

185
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,460
It is just that my boyfriend,

186
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,170
he is a bit odd.

187
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,330
He doesn't like it when I am alone with other men.

188
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,750
If not, his face will become...

189
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,600
You really are a happy person.

190
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,620
- I'll help you.
- Okay.

191
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,250
A-Are you tired?

192
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,490
Then, how about you rest early. I'll go back first, too.

193
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:00,190
Then go back earlier.

194
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,270
My brother will come soon.

195
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:06,510
Then, I am going to leave. If there is anything, call me anytime.

196
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,600
How about we add each other on WeChat?

197
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,450
I don't use phones.

198
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:19,380
Is it because you're ill and your brother isn't letting you use it?

199
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,560
It's all right! Then I'll come and find you if I'm free.

200
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,270
Recently, I've been in a bad mood.

201
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,550
Qian Qian is ill.

202
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,950
Everyone thinks it is my responsibility.

203
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,100
Actually, Qian Qian getting ill,

204
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,360
I also feel bad.

205
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,180
But... I really didn't cause her to get ill.

206
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,570
I feel like a criminal.

207
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,930
Auntie, no one said it was your fault.

208
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,930
No one is blaming you.

209
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,690
Your Uncle Tang said some ugly words.

210
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:08,470
He said because I did things to the extreme, causing today...

211
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,530
So Qian Qian would get ill.

212
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:13,520
Actually, Mingxuan also got angry at me for this.

213
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,710
He has been angry for a few years.

214
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,900
I see their faces every day.

215
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,310
I feel really depressed.

216
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,630
I feel wronged.

217
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,350
Actually, I treat Qian Qian pretty well.

218
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:33,140
Because then, you were all young, but Qian Qian was a bit younger.

219
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,610
Anything yummy or fun,

220
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,200
I would leave the good things for her.

221
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:43,580
Actually, I really feel bad about her getting ill.

222
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,960
I know. Auntie, your goodwill, I know all of it.

223
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,190
I feel it may be because Qian Qian suddenly got ill.

224
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,800
Everyone feels bad.

225
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,630
In a short period of time, they don't know how to take care of it.

226
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,290
So it caused you to be wronged.

227
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,390
Actually, it is all right if I have some difficulties.

228
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,880
I hope the Fang family does not blame Mingxuan.

229
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,250
Don't look to him for trouble.

230
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,610
If there is anything, they should come at me. I am not afraid.

231
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:13,780
Auntie, don't think too much.

232
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,380
How about this? If I have time, I'll go visit Qian Qian more.

233
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,100
Enlighten her more.

234
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,740
This can also lessen the burden in Mingxuan's heart.

235
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,810
Thank you, Xueling.

236
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,510
Only you understand me the best.

237
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,970
Bring all of these back for me.

238
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,490
[Fashion Week]

239
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,480
I am amazed by you. Did you come to stay at the hospital

240
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,670
or did you change your location for designing?

241
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:49,040
I was too bored, so I killed time.

242
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,660
You can't be a well-behaved patient.

243
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,180
There is so much yummy food.

244
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,800
I think you are here for a spring trip.

245
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,470
So what? Take all of these back.

246
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:04,850
All right, you guys go back first. I still have to see a friend.

247
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,820
I will call a car back myself. I can't fit in your small scooter.

248
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:12,180
Sister Mo Fei, you just stayed at the hospital a few days and you already made a new friend?

249
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,640
Who let me be someone people love? When they see

250
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,960
flowers bloom, they see Little Mo Fei.

251
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,590
That's it for now, bye-bye!

252
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,350
Stick your tongue out again?!

253
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,870
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

254
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,580
Mo Fan, can she really do it alone?

255
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,000
Don't worry about her. Don't say hospital.

256
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,750
Even if you threw her to a mountain, she would become friends with a monkey.

257
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,900
That's a bit exaggerated.

258
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,580
I only finished this one, and I don't know if you like it.

259
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,840
But use it for now. When I go back, I'll make another one for you.

260
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,300
Mo Fei, I like it a lot!

261
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,170
- Thank you!
- Really? You're welcome!

262
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,980
But... would that be really bothersome?

263
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,340
How would this be bothersome? I usually like to make these.

264
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,750
How about this? After you are recovered,

265
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:02,060
I'll make you a beautiful outfit for you to be really pretty!

266
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,860
Okay.

267
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:10,160
But... I don't seem to have anything I can give you.

268
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,620
You can... just...

269
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,210
give me your smile!

270
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,620
- Okay.
- Fighting! You for sure can recover.

271
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,810
- Today is so sunny, oh my god.
- Today's weather is so nice.

272
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:33,840
Would you get even tanner?

273
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,240
- What?
- If you get even more tan, Teacher Linda might really not want you.
- I'm going to hit you.

274
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,720
Fang Xiaoyu.

275
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,180
Why is he here?

276
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,970
- Would he be here to look for Sister Mo Fei?
- No way.

277
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,890
Brother-in-Law doesn't even know my sister got admitted to the hospital. How would he know?

278
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:57,060
Don't care so much. Get into less trouble.

279
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:07,620
Why are you looking at me? Hurry up and call, or else they will meet soon.

280
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,520
- Hurry up! Hurry!
- C-Call my sister?

281
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,760
Who else? Hurry! If they meet it won't be good.

282
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,510
She's not answering.

283
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:30,130
What should we do? They can't meet.

284
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,200
- Forget it. I'm calling cousin.
- Wait.

285
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,240
Didn't my sister say she can't let Brother-in-Law know?

286
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,110
Sister Mo Fei said I can't let my brother know when she is at the hospital and ill.

287
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:43,180
She is already discharged, of course, I can tell.

288
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,210
- Is this what she meant?
- Of course!

289
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,330
You idiot! You men don't understand!

290
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,910
Women understand women the most.

291
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,950
Hurry up and answer!

292
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:00,920
Hello, Brother. I'm at the hospital right now.

293
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,390
Sister Mo Fei she-she was in the hospital...

294
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,160
Qian Qian, why aren't you laying in the bed? Why are you standing there for?

295
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,890
Who are you waving to?

296
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,560
A friend. She got discharged today.

297
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,770
If not, I for sure would introduce her to you.

298
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,650
She is so fun!

299
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:38,270
- Really? You are in such a good mood.
- Of course!

300
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,160
Brother, I want to go for a walk outside.

301
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,630
Sure, let's go.

302
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,170
Give me your bag.

303
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,360
It's okay, I'll put it at the front.

304
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,010
It's not convenient for you to hold it. Wear the helmet.

305
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,350
Okay, you wear it, too.

306
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:01,820
- You ready?
- Yes.

307
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,620
Hold onto me tight.

308
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,450
Hold on tightly. If you fall down later, I won't care.

309
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,620
Coming.

310
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,040
We're so in sync.

311
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,950
I just came back from Suzhou, and you came here immediately.

312
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,970
How long were you going to hide it from me?

313
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:08,160
I was afraid that you guys would be worried.

314
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,040
I didn't want you guys to worry and now both of you came to look for me.

315
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,470
Don't you know that I'll be more worried if you didn't tell me?

316
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,080
I'm sorry.

317
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,050
Was it a serious injury?

318
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:23,920
Look! It's all healed now. It's okay now, I'm fine.

319
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,630
I feel bad hearing you say that.

320
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,190
Come here.

321
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,910
- Come here.
- That hurts.

322
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,780
I'm telling you no matter what happens in the future,

323
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,280
you need to tell me at once. Okay?

324
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,540
Or I'd feel even more worried about you. Okay?

325
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:42,410
- Understand?
- It hurts.

326
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,140
I promise.

327
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:54,450
How were you doing at the hospital all by yourself?

328
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,740
It was great. I ate well and slept well.

329
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,530
As for you, your dark eye circles are really bad.

330
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:02,380
Is it because I didn't supervise you to sleep, so you didn't sleep properly.

331
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,550
If I can't see you then I get insomnia.

332
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:09,320
Not sleeping well, then I miss you a lot.

333
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,130
I missed you a lot, too.

334
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,390
Come on.

335
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,530
Take a nap with me.

336
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:25,200
♫ Make a wish that you'll love me a long time ♫

337
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,790
It's so nice to hug you while sleeping.

338
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:39,780
The phone is ringing.

339
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,430
It's not my phone.

340
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:45,020
♫ Your look of happiness ♫

341
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:49,350

00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:56,830
♫ Holding your hand, walking to the end of time ♫

343
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:00,030
[Yang Guang]
♫ Look at the light shining in the sky, love is like that for now ♫

344
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,690
What if it's really important?

345
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,240
No one is allowed to disturb us while we're sleeping.

346
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,800
It's not as important as you.

347
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:21,550
It'll get windy later, so let's come back earlier.

348
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:24,840
Yes, what's going on with the weather these days?

349
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,050
Hi.

350
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:32,000
- Do you not feel cold?
- I'm fine.

351
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:42,220
Sister Xueling.

352
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,150
Qian Qian.

353
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:45,110
What a rare visitor! Why did you suddenly come here?

354
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,130
Brother!

355
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:48,600
It's so important to visit Qian Qian, so how could I not come.

356
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,130
What's the matter? Am I not welcome here?

357
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:52,540
I am. How can I not welcome you?

358
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:56,590
If you can leave Mingyuan and work for Cayman, I will welcome you even more.

359
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,670
I can consider that.

360
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:01,080
Really? Then I'll make the arrangements right now.

361
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,600
I was kidding! You took me seriously?

362
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,650
I'll really make arrangements for you.

363
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,160
Okay. Someone is accompanying you for me, so I'll go ahead.

364
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,560
Okay.

365
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,300
It's fine even if you don't come.

366
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,130
You... are getting influenced by her. I'll get going.

367
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,090
Brother, take care.

368
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,370
Thank you.

369
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,230
Does your brother come every day?

370
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,590
Almost.

371
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:37,830
As soon as I got sick, he has gotten extremely tired.

372
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:43,080
He's going through all this is to wish you to recover soon.

373
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,210
Qian Qian,

374
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:51,680
I heard from Mingxuan that you're still not willing to undergo surgery.

375
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:56,730
Sister Xueling, you don't need to persuade me.

376
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:01,000
Actually, I'm still thinking about it.

377
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,880
If this matter is true,

378
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,300
then I should really persuade you.

379
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,660
While you were gone these past few years,

380
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,350
everyone had been having a hard time.

381
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,260
Your brother, Mingxuan,

382
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,510
Aunite Lu, and myself.

383
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:24,520
Sister Xueling, I don't want to talk about these things.

384
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,720
I know that you don't want it to be this way, too.

385
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:32,660
If I had a choice, I wouldn't talk to you about these things.

386
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,940
You know Mingxuan.

387
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,400
He's a meticulous person.

388
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,190
Ever since you left,

389
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:45,250
he did not once not blame himself every day.

390
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,190
Every time Fang Xiaoyu sees him, he mocks him.

391
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,820
He accepted that, too.

392
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,450
Also,

393
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:59,150
he still hasn't forgiven Auntie Lu.

394
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:05,250
Qian Qian, I'm not telling you these things to blame you.

395
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:10,820
I just want to tell you that if only you're healthy,

396
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,690
then everyone will be at ease.

397
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:16,820
Everyone is concerned about you.

398
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:21,090
You must recover, understand?

399
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,780
I will.

400
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:54,160
Mo Fei, what are you looking for?

401
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,740
There's a design sketch that is missing.

402
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,590
We were the only ones here at the office, and haven't seen anyone come here.

403
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:03,410
Did you forget where it is? Look again.

404
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,560
I've searched everywhere, but I still can't find it.

405
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,380
- What's wrong?
- There's a design sketch that is missing.

406
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:15,340
It's not the watercolor concept sketch, right?

407
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,840
But I remember clearly that I placed it here and the other stuff is still here.

408
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,240
Only the most important one is gone.

409
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,090
First, don't be anxious. Think about it carefully.

410
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,340
Did you take it home?

411
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,050
That's impossible.

412
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,430
- You two help her look for it, too.
- Okay.

413
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,660
Losing a design sketch is not a small issue.

414
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,530
Mo Fei, come out.

415
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,360
What's wrong?

416
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:49,840
That day, aside from the people in our office, Shen Jiaxi came by.

417
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,610
When?

418
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,290
That day, she said that she came to find you.

419
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,430
Then she stayed at your desk for a while,

420
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:57,080
being very sneaky.

421
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,250
She seemed to be hiding something behind her, but I didn't see it clearly.

422
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,140
Are you sure? Sure that she's the only one who came here?

423
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,090
I wouldn't make ridiculous things up about this situation.

424
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:09,690
What about you go and ask her? But don't tell her that I told you.

425
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,010
Mo Fei, you're here for coffee, too?

426
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,910
I came to find you.

427
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,750
Me? What's the matter?

428
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,290
I need to make coffee for Director Xia. She needs it now.

429
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:34,200
I want to ask you something. It won't take too long.

430
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:36,570
Go ahead and ask then.

431
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,700
What about we go over there?

432
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,130
Okay? Come on, let's go.

433
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:58,600
What's the matter? You're being so mysterious and insisting on talking to me here.

434
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:03,170
Jiaxi, when you went to the design studio that day,

435
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,780
did you see my design sketch?

436
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,460
What design sketch?

437
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,800
That day, I only saw two design books on your table.

438
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,370
I just flipped through it randomly. I didn't see anything else.

439
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,540
My concept sketch was underneath the design books. Did you not notice it?

440
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,630
Things like a concept sketch, don't you think I would know what it looks like?

441
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,890
What's wrong?

442
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:23,780
I lost a concept sketch, but I remember clearly that

443
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,630
it was placed under the design books.

444
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:28,880
If you had flipped through the books, then you must have seen it.

445
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,180
I didn't see it. If there's nothing else then I'll leave first.

446
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,190
Think about it carefully again, you also know

447
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,950
how important a concept sketch is.

448
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,140
Hey, Mo Fei!

449
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:39,400
What's the matter with you today? Are you suspecting me?

450
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,860
I'm not suspecting you. It's just that...

451
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:46,080
You were the only person who went to the design studio that day.

452
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,010
There are so many people in your team,

453
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,880
and the first person you're suspecting is me!

454
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,940
Mo Fei, we've been friends for so many years. I'm so disappointed in you.

455
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,730
I just don't want others to misunderstand you.

456
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,910
That's why I came over to ask you first.

457
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:59,640
Also, if this turns into a big deal and they check the security footage–

458
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,970
You can check the security footage. You can also report it to the police if you want.

459
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:05,650
But I, Shen Jiaxi, swear that I didn't steal your concept sketch.

460
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,650
Jiaxi.

461
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,490
Mo Fei, our friendship is over.

462
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,060
Jiaxi.

463
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,810
Mo Fei, come over here for a moment.

464
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,880
Mo Fei, I'll remember today.

465
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,300
Since the concept design sketch is so important,

466
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,800
why didn't you keep it on you at all times?

467
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,570
It is your fault for not protecting it well.

468
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:35,150
It's not surprising someone would steal it.

469
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,010
One day,

470
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:40,860
I–

471
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:46,030
I've waited twenty minutes for this cup of coffee.

472
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,660
I thought you went to Mars to get water.

473
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:53,430
I didn't interrupt you speaking with the coffee, right?

474
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,070
I...

475
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,450
I had some circumstances earlier. I apologize.

476
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:00,240
I won't do this in the future.

477
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,460
Also, tell me clearly.

478
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:06,640
Mo Fei and the concept design sketch you just spoke of, what is it?

479
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,660
Jiaxi...

480
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,570
Director Xia, were you looking for me?

481
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:36,220
I heard your concept design sketch has gone missing.

482
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,100
Yes, I'm in the process of looking for it.

483
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,580
Are there any updates?

484
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,320
Not yet.

485
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,490
I am Mingyuan's Design Department Director.

486
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:51,260
The company's problems are all handled by me.

487
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,370
Anything that affects Mingyuan's benefits,

488
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:56,040
I don't allow any of it to occur.

489
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,290
I won't listen to others say anything randomly.

490
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,390
I also won't listen to you passing the blame.

491
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:02,800
Losing the concept design sketch is a big matter.

492
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,400
You have to find accurate evidence.

493
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,570
I won't be biased.

494
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:12,050
Also, before the verdict is made in the matter,

495
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,670
everyone should keep to some extent when talking.

496
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,570
What type of concept design sketch did you lose?

497
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:26,080
It is just an abandoned sketch.

498
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:30,080
Director Xia, don't worry. If something happens, I will take the blame.

499
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,180
There are some responsibilities I am afraid you cannot take.

500
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,280
Try to hurry up and find the result and notify me.

501
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,730
Okay, you can go back to work.

502
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,040
It is such a beautiful car accessory!

503
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,030
Where did you buy it from, Brother?

504
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:26,490
I didn't buy it, a friend gave it to me.

505
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,830
A gift?

506
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:32,470
Whose hands are this skillful?

507
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,590
I know!

508
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:40,990
Is it that mysterious girl?!

509
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,340
It looks like it is true love!

510
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:48,060
Brother, hurry up and tell me! I am so curious!

511
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,790
What type of person is she?!

512
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:53,040
You can't even tell me?!

513
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,890
Brother, please tell me! I am so curious

514
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:58,310
for you to become like this!

515
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:01,410
In the future, if there is an opportunity, I'll introduce her to you.

516
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,970
When will that be?!

517
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:06,310
Why don't you tell me what type of person she is?

518
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:10,260
Let me tell you. Right now, you should concentrate on treating your illness well.

519
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,710
In the future, if there is a chance, all my future girlfriends,

520
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:15,750
I will introduce them to you, one by one. Okay?

521
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,220
You're not serious again!

522
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,250
Doctor Xiao said

523
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,640
you can faint anytime. You cannot live at home for a long time.

524
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,340
So when he calls you, you must answer it.

525
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,930
Okay.

526
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:40,410
Seriously, you were doing good at the hospital. Why did you have to be discharged?

527
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:42,950
No matter how good the hospital is, can it be as good as home?

528
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:46,350
At home, I can see you and Dad every day.

529
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,370
Brother,

530
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:55,550
if Dad comes back,

531
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:58,720
are you going to not be willing to live at home?

532
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,220
I will go visit you every day!

533
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:19,560
You still aren't willing to forgive Dad.

534
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,630
I don't think it will be possible this lifetime.

535
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:38,010
Brother, Dad did do something wrong to Mom,

536
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:41,450
but it has already been so many years.

537
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:43,630
Also, Dad has always been considerate of your feelings.

538
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:47,910
You know that feelings cannot be controlled.

539
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:51,600
In order to be considerate of your feelings,

540
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,120
he only married Aunt Zhuang a few years ago.

541
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:59,530
Actually these past years, they might not have been actually happy.

542
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:04,200
Whether or not he is happy is his matter.

543
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,890
Forgiving him or not, that is my matter.

544
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,730
You're just being stubborn.

545
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:12,760
You know that the person Dad cares most about is you.

546
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:17,230
You are exactly the same as him, the same stubbornness.

547
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:21,450
Okay, if you don't go home, I'm also not going back to the hospital.

548
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,950
You're messing around with me, right?

549
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:26,020
Do you believe that I will send you back right now?!

550
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,760
You're bullying me!

551
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,930
I-I-I just wanted you to go back to stay a few more days with me.

552
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:35,740
You can't even promise me this?!

553
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:41,020
- Just accompany me, Brother!
- I'm driving.

554
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:45,140
Brother! Just accompany me for a few days! All right?

555
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,830
My good brother, okay?!

556
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:51,260
Just accompany your sister!

557
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,900
- Okay?!
- Okay, okay!

558
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,070
I promise you, I will accompany you for two days.

559
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:59,550
Great! This is my good brother!

560
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,270
Is the door broken? Really.

561
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:11,580
They have come back.

562
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,300
Qian Qian!

563
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,920
Dad! Aunt Zhuang! Uncle Zhong!

564
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,090
- You're back!
- So good!

565
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,970
Uncle Zhong, please tidy up Brother's room as well.

566
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:30,320
He will be staying at home for the next few days.

567
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,680
Sure thing!

568
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,420
That is good, too.

569
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:39,610
All right, all right. Hurry up and go rest.

570
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,510
- I'm going to head up first.
- Let's go.

571
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:50,460
Right now, you should be at ease. Right?

572
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,580
Anyway, this matter is my fault.

573
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,930
I should have watched you 24/7.

574
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:00,740
I shouldn't have looked away for a second. Right when I looked away,

575
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:03,900
- you made yourself handicapped.
- Stop with this.

576
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,780
When I was at the hospital, you didn't answer a single call of mine!

577
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:12,330
I was in a rush to look for jobs.

578
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:15,890
Also, you told me that a woman should have their own job.

579
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:18,300
I cannot keep on relying on Cheng Yang.

580
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,330
But after all,

581
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:23,840
it is still my fault. I didn't take good care of you.

582
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,870
Have some more pig brain. Nourish yourself.

583
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:29,350
You are the best!

584
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:33,410
When you were at the hospital, your President Tang,

585
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:37,240
was he your good filial boyfriend?

586
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,930
I didn't tell him.

587
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:42,880
You didn't tell him? Why?

588
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,150
I felt this was a minor injury. Also, he was busy at work. I didn't want him to worry.

589
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:49,470
But I told him after I got discharged.

590
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:52,760
- Mo Fei.
- Yes?
- Is there really something wrong with your brain?

591
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,390
- Or were you already brain-impaired?
- W-Who's brain-impaired?

592
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:58,380
Such a big matter! You didn't tell him?

593
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:02,360
Do you know? Men, you have to make them understand

594
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:06,120
how to have compassion for women. But you have to give them the chance!

595
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:10,180
You didn't even give him the chance, and you wasted such a good offer!

596
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:13,410
You got hit on the head for his cousin for nothing!

597
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:18,070
If I were you, I would make his whole family take care of me.

598
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,360
Whole family take care of you?

599
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,130
Can you manage?

600
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:25,130
Anyway, I don't care.

601
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:29,160
You. Eat more pig brain.

602
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:34,090
This whole plate of pig brain is yours. Nourish your brain well.

603
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:37,680
- I-I haven't finished eating–
- I think you still can be saved.

604
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,610
- I haven't finished eating–
- I will cook it for you right now. Eat all of it.

605
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:45,810
Chairman Fang, when do you plan on telling him?

606
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,290
I haven't thought about that yet.

607
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:55,020
The earlier you tell him, the better.

608
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:59,520
With Xiaoyu's temper, if he finds out from others,

609
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,940
I am afraid he will misunderstand your intention.

610
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,920
What do you think?

611
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,670
That's also right.

612
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:15,610
The earlier he knows, it is also good.

613
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:23,390

00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:17,060
♫ You're an April day ♫

636
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:21,670
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

637
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:26,420
♫ The bittersweet parting words of "take care" ♫

638
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:31,350
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

639
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:39,080
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫
