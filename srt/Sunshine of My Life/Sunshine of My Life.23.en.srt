00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,980
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,080
Old Xia. You can smell osmanthus in the air.

4
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,110
Old Tang, you didn't ask me over

5
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,320
just to play Go and smell osmanthus, did you?

6
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,000
When you are old, you think about the past.

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,160
I have no one else but you, my old friend.

8
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,740
So much happened in the past. What's on your mind?

9
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,880
We didn't have a lot of money back in the day when we tried to start a company.

10
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,280
Orders came in from our foreign customers and we put them together. It was hard work and not a lot of money.

11
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,880
We've come a long way to Mingyuan.

12
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:15,310
Right. It hasn't been easy.

13
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,410
And I'm really grateful to you

14
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,790
and Old Wei, my old friends.

15
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,130
Mingyuan wouldn't be where it is without you.

16
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,710
But how did we manage to get into today's predicament?

17
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,780
First off,

18
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,360
things are different now.

19
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,410
Secondly, you are not.

20
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,200
You are still so conservative.

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,570
I don't like hearing this. What makes you think I am conservative?

22
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,280
You cling on to Songtang. If you're not conservative, who is?

23
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,780
I like Songtang. It's Chinoiserie.

24
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,080
That's the soul of our company.

25
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,160
- It's what makes us different.
- But why do we have to be different?

26
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,010
- It's safer to follow the trends.
- What about our personality?

27
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,900
What personality? You can barely stay afloat.

28
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,390
Tang, we are not young anymore.

29
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,600
Can you really look us in the eye and ask us to follow you into danger?

30
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,520
Here is what I think.

31
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,400
As a businessman, I'm happy to do what makes me money.

32
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,660
But we also have to look beyond short-term gains.

33
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,660
Right? If we can acquire SLC,

34
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,520
Mingyuan will be even bigger. Everybody wins.

35
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,930
Right. You are absolutely right.

36
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,670
You paint me a tantalizing picture, but again, I'm an old man.

37
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,690
Don't talk to me about the future.

38
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,660
I don't want to think about the future.

39
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,600
I, too, am a businessman. I, too, am happy to make a lot of money.

40
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,000
But you know the size of Mingyuan's assets, don't you?

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,690
Don't you?

42
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,330
- Now...
- Dad. Uncle Tang.

43
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,340
Aunt Lu said dinner's ready.

44
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,040
Okay. Let's go.

45
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,310
You think about it. Don't be whimsical.

46
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,480
- I have confidence that we can do it.
- Where is the money?

47
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,160
Good, very good.

48
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,090
Start.

49
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,440
I am looking forward to the end product.

50
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,240
Yes.

51
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,280
Very good.

52
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,880
Let's begin.

53
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,970
It is a pressing matter.

54
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,460
I am wearing this

55
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,720
to my daughter's wedding.

56
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,060
We are extremely sorry. However, this dress

57
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,800
has to be sent to the main department for it to be fixed.

58
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,220
- How long would it take?
- Four days.

59
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,060
No, no. I have to go tonight.

60
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,000
Since the embroidery is on the sleeves,

61
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,530
our embroidery frames are too big.

62
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,440
Is there no other way to fix it?

63
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,350
- Can I have a try?
- You have an idea?

64
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,410
Yes, I have an idea.

65
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:52,040
But I may not be able to fix it exactly the same.

66
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,840
What is this technique?

67
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,710
This is Chinese Suzhou Embroidery.

68
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,150
A very old and ancient way of embroidery.

69
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,050
Thank you. Thank you very much.

70
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,340
Can I take a picture of your clothing?

71
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,810
I want to keep this memory of a French Arts and

72
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:50,650
- Chinese Skills combination.
- Of course.
- Thank you.

73
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,290
I am going to tell Miya everything

74
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,480
that happened today.

75
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,050
Your effort today deserves great praise.

76
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,800
Thank you.

77
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,600
Have a look.

78
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,750
This will be your studio.

79
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,860
I hope you like it.

80
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:41,170
Thank you, President Tang. I like it very much.

81
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,920
I expect to see you do something great in here.

82
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,130
I won't let you down.

83
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:51,780
- I'm putting a foldaway bed right here. I'll live here.
- You can't.

84
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,480
You need good rest if you want to get some good work done.

85
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,250
- Mingxuan.
- Hey.

86
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,640
Come here. Let me introduce you.

87
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,020
This is Xia Xueling, Mingyuan's Design Director.

88
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,530
- Nice to meet you, Teacher Cheng.
- Call me Cheng Yang.

89
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:09,520
I saw your work, but never the person who created it until now.

90
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,740
Welcome to Mingyuan.

91
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,040
This is Liu Pei.

92
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,990
- Talk to her if you need anything.
- Teacher Cheng.

93
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,770
I've heard so much about you.

94
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,440
Let me introduce your two assistants.

95
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,840
This is Yu Xia. He joined us after the contest.

96
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,570
He may be new but he is one of the best we have here.

97
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:31,370
This is Chen Dongdong, our most valuable intern.

98
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,160
They'll be working for you.

99
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,480
- Teacher Cheng.
- Teacher Cheng.
- Hi.

100
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,840
- I'll let you be. I have something I need to take care of in my office.

101
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,460
- Okay.
- It was nice meeting you.

102
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,790
Director Xia is not how I pictured her.

103
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,780
How did you picture her?

104
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,350
She reminds me of Elsa.

105
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,650
- Who?
- You know, the Snow Queen?

106
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,920
♪ Let it go! Let it go! ♪

107
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,800
♪ Can't hold it back anymore. ♪

108
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,310
All right, you get each other already.

109
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:15,750
Work can wait. Please give Teacher Cheng a tour.

110
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,320
Okay.

111
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,320
- I'll enjoy it.
- Go get them.

112
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,660
Good-bye, President Tang.

113
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,540
This just came in, right?

114
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,940
- P-President Tang.
- Busy?

115
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,360
I was just showing her how that computer works.

116
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,170
- I hope I didn't interrupt.
- Not at all.

117
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:43,680
President Tang, it is some good news that Mr. Cheng joined us.

118
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,520
This way, even if Director Xia gets busy,

119
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,000
you won't be scurrying about...

120
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,260
I mean we've been straining our brains for so many days now.

121
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,960
Don't we deserve a break?

122
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,460
- You're tired?
- No, I'm not.

123
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,450
You wish you'd get to take a break, don't you?

124
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,850
Get the car. We're going somewhere.

125
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,490
- Where?
- The embroidery workshop.

126
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,530
Here, drink some water. You haven't had a drop the whole day.

127
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,080
Thank you.

128
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,480
Have you made the appointment with Master Li?

129
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,600
Yes. She is at the museum and will be here in no time.

130
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,220
Okay. Let's have a look.

131
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:51,080
President Tang, you look thinner.

132
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,520
Yes, I've been busy.

133
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,660
Mo Fei said you were in France.

134
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,640
How is she?

135
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,290
I haven't seen her for a while. I miss her.

136
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,920
Don't worry. That girl...

137
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,040
She is taking very good care of herself.

138
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,920
She is just like her mom.

139
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,290
Strong and independent.

140
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,280
You know her mom?

141
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,800
Yes. Her mom is a very busy woman.

142
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,720
Travels around the world.

143
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,910
She'd send her little girl here

144
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,880
for winter and summer breaks.

145
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,650
I was supposed to be the one looking after her.

146
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:31,450
Instead, I had myself a little assistant.

147
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:35,920
She took such good care of the workshop.

148
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:40,220
I find that hard to believe.

149
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,220
She is a stubborn child. No filters.

150
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,400
So she can make a lot of enemies.

151
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,820
President Tang, you are a few years her senior.

152
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,120
I'd appreciate it if you'd put up with her temper

153
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,800
and with her being in France.

154
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,640
I hope you will keep an eye on her little brother.

155
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,880
Don't worry. I will.

156
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,760
Mo Fan.

157
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,280
President Tang.

158
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,300
Get in the car. I want to see how you are doing.

159
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,750
Here.

160
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,280
Please, come in.

161
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,140
Mo Fan, sit down.

162
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,970
Okay.

163
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,220
Here.

164
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,980
Is it... ice cream?

165
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,510
Yes.

166
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,820
Your sister told me

167
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,120
you liked this ice cream growing up.

168
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,920
Yes, I did.

169
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,710
But I'm still in the middle of my training. I'm not supposed to have desserts.

170
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,240
Right.

171
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,360
Then I'll have one.

172
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:41,330
- President Tang...
- Why did you call me?

173
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,330
- President Tang.
- Think again.

174
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,200
Brother-in-Law.

175
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,810
You've been living here alone since your sister left?

176
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:55,010
Yes. It feels lonely

177
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,090
without sis.

178
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,740
- You miss her.
- No, I don't.

179
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,660
We fought a lot growing up. Sometimes we got physical.

180
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,590
President Tang... Brother-in-law, listen.

181
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:07,890
My sister was quite a fighter. She kicked my butt.

182
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,430
That's when you were small.

183
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:17,370
- You mustn't bully your sister anymore.
- Yes.

184
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,750
Although she is a big girl and a tough fighter...

185
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:24,680
Exactly, President Tang... Brother-in-Law.

186
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:29,330
I'll tell your sister you said that.

187
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,600
Don't, Brother-in-Law.

188
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,510
I'd have to stay at your place for a few days.

189
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:37,670
Why? You want to see Lu Zhu?

190
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:41,710
She keeps coming to us and getting me to cook for her.

191
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,820
It's okay for you to share a meal.

192
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,740
It's late.

193
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,090
Put this in the fridge if you are not going to eat it now.

194
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,730
Okay, I will.

195
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:03,210
You are living by yourself in Shanghai. Call me if you need anything.

196
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,890
Yes.

197
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,550
Take care, Brother-in-Law.

198
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,990
Good boy.

199
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,540
- Don't stay up too late.
- Of course. Bye.

200
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,660
Bye.

201
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,490
How did you find time to talk with me?

202
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,190
You never reach out.

203
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,540
I thought you were too busy falling in love to catch up with your friend.

204
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,080
Listen to you. Am I that kind of person?

205
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,650
I've been having so much school work lately that I have no time for anything else.

206
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,420
Yeah, right.

207
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:40,530
Seriously. Plus, I know you joined Mingyuan. You must have been busy,

208
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,240
so I didn't want to distract you.

209
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,940
I may be busy, but I'll never be as busy as your President Tang.

210
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,400
When Director Xia went missing, your President Tang had to work all day and all night for a few days.

211
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,930
He is visibly emaciated. It must make you feel awful.

212
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,520
When did Director Xia go missing?

213
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,360
Did President Tang not tell you?

214
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,620
Just a few days before the new recruits came in.

215
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,410
He never talks to me about work.

216
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,520
Has Mingyuan recruited more people?

217
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,440
Yes, a man called...

218
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,160
Cheng Yang. He recently came back from Paris.

219
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,570
President Tang didn't say it out loud, but everyone knows

220
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,440
he might replace Director Xia.

221
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,610
I guess Director Xia thinks so, too.

222
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,930
So she has been extra strict lately, just to show how important she is.

223
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:29,320
The designers have been so busy.

224
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,450
To think such a high-powered woman

225
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,690
also feels insecure.

226
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:39,360
Maybe Director Xia is overthinking it. It could be just a normal change with personnel.

227
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,260
I think she is overthinking it, too.

228
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,780
I heard President Tang personally talked to her to get her to come back

229
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,520
just so she will feel comfortable working here.

230
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,290
That could be his way of telling the world that Director Xia is his right-hand man,

231
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,550
no matter who comes along.

232
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,520
I don't get it.

233
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,140
Go ask President Tang. Someone is here. Got to go.

234
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,530
You are not the manager. What do you have to worry about?

235
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,160
Which one do I choose?

236
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,540
What's this product like?

237
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,770
It has some very good reviews.

238
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,440
Let's order some.

239
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,320
What about this one?

240
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,560
Its country of origin and raw material...

241
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,520
Reviews.

242
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,520
Get some of those as well.

243
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,920
Get it done now. Go.

244
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,140
- Who is it?
- Delivery!

245
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,180
- Miss Mo Fei?
- Yes.

246
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,900
This is a package from China.

247
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,420
- Thank you.
- I hope you have a good day.

248
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,890
- Bye!
- Bye!

249
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,160
Mingxuan?

250
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:29,280
You've just moved in and yet you are already receiving packages.

251
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,270
What is it?

252
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,360
I don't know. Let's see.

253
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,170
Careful.

254
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,000
Soft. What is it?

255
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,350
Ju Hong Gao, a snack from Zhejiang.

256
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,040
This one is Yun Pian Gao. I've tasted it before.

257
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,660
Who sent you all these?

258
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,930
Your President Tang?

259
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,920
How did he have time to get me snacks

260
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,720
when he is so busy as it is?

261
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,650
You don't get it. People do incredible things

262
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:18,280
when they are in love.

263
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,590
I want to try this one.

264
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,020
- This one is no good.
- Then, this one?

265
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,280
This makes you fat.

266
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:38,020
Is there anything I can eat in here? How about this one?

267
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:41,360
I'll tell you what. Let me take you out for a big meal.

268
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,860
These snacks make you fat.

269
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,090
Just empty calories.

270
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,410
- Come on, give me some.
- Stop it.

271
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,570
Excuse me. Do you have your identity card?

272
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:55,070
I work here.

273
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,400
Do you have a worker's identity card?

274
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,230
- I didn't bring it.
- Please come with me.
- Okay.

275
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,420
Hello, Miss.

276
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:23,760
Sorry. I can't speak French.

277
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,230
If you are not a worker, you cannot go in.

278
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:29,280
What? I...

279
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,900
- I...
- What? Is there a problem?

280
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,810
- Hello.
- Hi.

281
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:38,280
I work with...

282
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,570
Cayman.

283
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,990
I don't know what you are talking about.

284
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,840
Fang Xiaoyu.

285
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,980
Fang Xiaoyu. Fang Xiaoyu.

286
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,520
Fang Xiaoyu...

287
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,730
Fang Xiaoyu.

288
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,640
He's my friend.

289
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,560
This lady is here to look for Director Fang.

290
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,570
How about we give him a call?

291
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,220
Her whole body is filled with name-branded items.

292
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,160
She might even be Director Fang's lover.

293
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,300
Let her in.

294
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,040
- Please, we welcome you.
- Welcome.

295
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:20,850
But she must be allowed in.

296
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,550
I'm here to see someone. I'm with Director Fang.

297
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,100
Does anyone speak Chinese here?

298
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:52,420
Madam? Yes, you...

299
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,240
Why are you still here?

300
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,070
Hurry, hurry.

301
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,170
Girls, let me have a look at your number card.

302
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,010
Take your numbers.

303
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:10,680
How's it feeling? Good?

304
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,020
Good.

305
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,560
Everyone you want.

306
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,880
Please get ready fast.

307
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,700
So, guys, you know everything, right? What to do. How to walk. How to smile.

308
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:28,140
How to get what you want. So I wish you luck. And you are the best.

309
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,680
Thank you.

310
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,710
Director Fang, shall we lower the bar a little? Otherwise, no one will get to stay.

311
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,700
Wait.

312
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:26,160
I hope that next time you walk to here,

313
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,830
you can show more of your body line.

314
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:31,830
Your body is really beautiful.

315
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,760
More eyesight...

316
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,740
Yes, yes, very good.

317
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:02,190
What are you doing here?

318
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:07,670
I'm a model. Isn't this where I'm supposed to be?

319
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:17,110
If I remember correctly, Cayman fired you a long time ago.

320
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,980
Do you remember?

321
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,730
I became a model because of you.

322
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:34,290
The first time I walked on the runway,

323
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:38,360
you were walking with me, by my side.

324
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,450
- I don't remember.
- But I do. I...

325
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:45,820
What's going on? Are you just letting anyone walk in here now?

326
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,810
I'm so sorry, Director Fang. This is all on me.

327
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:51,010
I'll take her out now.

328
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,360
Let's go. You are making a scene here.

329
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,600
You...

330
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:01,960
I...

331
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,730
Please get up.

332
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,320
I can't.

333
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,600
I strained my ankle and broke my heel.

334
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,650
- Putting on a show again, aren't we?
- No.

335
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,800
Director Fang, the heel is broken.

336
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,650
What do you want?

337
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:25,190
I have important things to tell you.

338
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,740
What do you have to say to me that's so important?

339
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:30,620
Drag her out.

340
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:33,600
It's really important. It's about work.

341
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,670
Do what I say.

342
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,730
Fang Xiaoyu, you are just too much, you know?

343
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,450
Look, you got up.

344
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:44,310
- I...
- Take her to my office.

345
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:49,960
Let's go. Can you walk?

346
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,510
Li Qi, go get a pair of shoes for Ms. Bai.

347
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,020
- Shoes?
- Yes. Now.

348
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,140
Okay.

349
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:18,660
Director Fang, we are in France.

350
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,610
Can you at least have some compassion for your fellow Chinese?

351
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:30,100
I'm sorry. With you, I really can't.

352
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,870
Can't you be a little bit nicer to me?

353
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:35,550
You sneaked in pretending to be a model.

354
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:39,100
And you accusing me of showing no compassion.

355
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:43,740
Do you know what will happen if you get caught by a senior manager here?

356
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,700
- I...
- Stay where you are.

357
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,890
Isn't it because I had no other way?

358
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:57,330
I called you and you wouldn't answer. You never agreed to see me.

359
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:00,120
This may be a bad idea, but it's all I could do.

360
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,630
Let's cut to the chase.

361
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:05,340
Tell me. What do you want from me?

362
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,470
We are rushing into business, aren't we now?

363
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,690
No time for some catching up?

364
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,260
Answer me.

365
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,920
All right.

366
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,700
I'm here to talk to you about a cooperation possibility.

367
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,300
Cooperation? With me?

368
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,250
You are not thinking of getting into Cayman in France, are you?

369
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,280
Forget it.

370
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,440
Don't underestimate me.

371
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,130
I guess you don't know.

372
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:46,500
I'm the girlfriend of the chairman of Haiyao.

373
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,100
So, you came as the boss' woman.

374
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,700
No. I just wanted to tell you

375
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:59,810
Haiyao is willing to be your foot soldier if that's what you want.

376
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,520
Miss,

377
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:08,270
do you think I will ever sell my clothes at a grocery store?

378
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:12,040
Do you not have any idea what Haiyao can or cannot do?

379
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,830
You came here to talk about working with Cayman.

380
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:17,010
Where did you get that courage?

381
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:20,400
Director Fang, you have a strong prejudice against Haiyao.

382
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,500
We have boutique stores. We are professional.

383
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,670
Really?

384
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:28,250
Do you have any decent designers?

385
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:31,990
Your line of clothes is structurally simplistic

386
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,500
and tedious to look at.

387
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,280
And you strive to be billed as a graceful brand.

388
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:41,070
You may as well print the words "good taste" on your clothes.

389
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:47,330
We don't have designers. That's why we would like to codesign with you.

390
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:51,060
What an idea!

391
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:54,200
I'll pretend I believe you when you say you came to talk business with me.

392
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,110
But there is no way I will work with Haiyao ever.

393
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:00,200
Working with Haiyao

394
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,000
would be career suicide.

395
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,230
- How can you think that?
- What should I think?

396
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,810
Think about the cooperation.

397
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,860
Think about all the benefits

398
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,920
of working with us.

399
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,960
You just name your price.

400
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:26,230
You do have a lot of confidence in yourself, Ms. Bai.

401
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,420
Even if I named my price,

402
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,830
what makes you think you have the authority to negotiate?

403
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,600
I'm making you an offer now.

404
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,860
That's enough authority.

405
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,530
My husband is super good with me.

406
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:44,330
He does everything I say.

407
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,890
Zhu Haitian is such a loser,

408
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:50,390
nothing like his father.

409
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:56,600
Come in. What are you doing?

410
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,150
Shoes.

411
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,060
Ms. Bai, put them on and go.

412
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,900
Director Fang...

413
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,950
You don't want me to call security, do you?

414
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,270
- I...
- Ms. Bai.

415
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:15,720
Director Fang is very busy. Let's go.

416
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:18,560
Sneakers?

417
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,410
They don't even go with my look! Fang Xiaoyu!

418
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,200
These are our more in-season type of clothing.

419
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,000
Then we have some pants and skirts. Look at this skirt.

420
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I think it suits you. Do you want to try it?

421
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,100
Okay, please come with me.

422
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,600
You were the one who served that customer?

423
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,900
Yes.

424
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:03,300
That customer sent a letter to give thanks.

425
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,800
If she is pleased, then that is good.

426
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,800
Have you learned Suzhou Embroidery before?

427
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,400
Yes, you also know?

428
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,800
I know that in China there are many

429
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:22,200
magnificent embroidery techniques.

430
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,200
I don't believe you.

431
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,800
China...

432
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:30,200
is improving.

433
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,000
Of course, I am more concerned with the Chinese Market.

434
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
At the same time, I hope in our accessories...

435
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,600
there are more Eastern elements.

436
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,900
The Eastern elements today, most of it is a transplant,

437
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:48,000
it is not the making inside.

438
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,800
There are even many elements that are used wrong.

439
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:56,600
Not understanding the cultural content.

440
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,600
I agree very much with your insight.

441
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,000
This is also why I have been looking for a new concept.

442
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,200
Do you know Mingyuan Fashion Group?

443
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,400
Yes.

444
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,400
This is a very hard-working

445
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,010
company that really wants to bring

446
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:16,600
Chinese Culture to the whole world.

447
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,200
Really?

448
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,500
At the same time, their boss

449
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,140
is committed to protecting

450
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,800
craftsman culture.

451
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,200
Suzhou Embroidery is one of them.

452
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,800
I understand. It means that in his hands he has a lot of workshops

453
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,200
that can support their products.

454
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,400
Yes.

455
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,820
His collaboration with them

456
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,000
has preserved the craftsman's living.

457
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,200
At the same time, it has brought

458
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,600
a new design towards accessories.

459
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,200
Just now,

460
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:57,600
in the back, I saw you send a small cake to your colleague.

461
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,800
Sorry, I shouldn't have...

462
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,600
You misunderstand.

463
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,800
I just feel that dessert

464
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,300
is really beautiful, it is really meaningful.

465
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:58,250
Okay.

466
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,200
Mo Fei?

467
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,400
Hello, Mengjin where are you?

468
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,000
What's wrong? Are you okay?

469
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,300
I'm having pain in my stomach.

470
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,140
It'll take me two hours to get to your place.

471
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,400
Maybe you should call for an ambulance.

472
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,200
No. Call Fang Xiaoyu. He is right next to us.

473
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,200
That's okay. I'll handle it. Bye.

474
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,200
Hello...

475
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,800
Mo Fei, what's wrong?

476
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,200
Pain in my stomach.

477
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,400
Let me take you to the hospital.

478
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,400
I already called.

479
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,900
We can't wait. I'll make an appointment for you.

480
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,990
That's okay. Let's go.

481
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,000
Hello, this is Paris Medical Center.

482
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,400
Hello, please help me make an appointment for Dr. Michele.

483
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,600
It is really urgent. My name is Fang Xiaoyu.

484
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,000
Mr. Fang, please wait a moment.

485
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,400
After half an hour, Dr. Michele has time.

486
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,200
Okay, thank you.

487
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,200
You're welcome.

488
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,400
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

489
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,600
What is wrong with her?

490
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,000
She has stomach pain.

491
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Can you give her a checkup?

492
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,100
Of course, please wait outside. I'll give her a checkup.

493
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:36,380
I'll be out there. Call me if you need anything.

494
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,700
Please lie down here.

495
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,600
It's nothing serious.

496
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,800
You have a high white blood cell count. You'll feel better once the inflammation is mitigated.

497
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,400
I was scared.

498
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,320
Can you do me a favor?

499
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,820
What is it? Where does it hurt?

500
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,000
Can you keep this between you and me?

501
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,900
Don't tell anyone I was rushed to the hospital.

502
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,200
By "anyone," you mean Tang Mingxuan, don't you?

503
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,400
I don't want him to worry.

504
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,600
He's been very busy lately. He doesn't have the time.

505
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,400
I don't want to distract him.

506
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,800
- So...
- Okay.

507
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,100
Don't worry. I won't tell him.

508
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,200
But you have to promise me that

509
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,000
you will let me know right away

510
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
if something like this happens again. Okay?

511
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,200
You are lucky my family physician was available. You would've been in a lot of pain for a lot longer.

512
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,200
That's enough.

513
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,600
Am I done here?

514
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,800
Almost.

515
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,000
- I'll go get the nurse. Then I'll take you home.
- Hey.

516
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:23,710
Thank you for today.

517
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,090
Hi!

518
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,600
Mo Fei.

519
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,000
You don't look well. What's wrong?

520
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,800
Really? Is it that bad?

521
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,900
It could be the lighting.

522
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,100
Lighting?

523
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,100
Are you still working?

524
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,600
Yes. There are loads of work to be done.

525
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,000
Hmm...

526
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
and you said I don't look well. You are the one looking emaciated.

527
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Is that right?

528
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,200
Mo Fei, are you all right?

529
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,800
You had me scared.

530
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,800
What did the doctor say? Does it still hurt?

531
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,100
Mo Fei, what was that?

532
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,400
Are you hurt?

533
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,200
If You're Well, It's a Lovely Day by Jin Zhiwen

534
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,300
♫ I say you're an April day ♫

535
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:16,400
♫ The sound of your laughter lights everything up ♫

536
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,000
♫ Even the spirit of a light breeze ♫

537
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
♫ In the midst of the brightness and beauty of spring,
shift as one would in a dance ♫

538
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,200
♫ You're the mist on a dry April day ♫

539
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,600
♫ The gentle breeze blown during dusk ♫

540
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,200
♫ The unintentional sparkle of the planetesimal ♫

541
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:45,200
♫ The fine rain that's sprinkled in front of the flower ♫

542
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:50,000
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

543
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,800
♫ Like a shy water lotus that bows to a cool breeze ♫

544
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,600
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

545
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:04,400
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫

546
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,000
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

547
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:16,500
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫

548
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:28,800
♫ You're like the ivory field after snowflakes ♫

549
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,200
♫ You're the round moon every night ♫

550
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,000
♫ You're the naïve ♫

551
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:42,000
♫ white lotus that floats on the water ripples of your dream ♫

552
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,500
♫ You're the flower blossoms of tree after tree ♫

553
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,800
♫ The swallow twittering within the beams ♫

554
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,200
♫ You are love, hope, and warmth ♫

555
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,000
♫ You're an April day ♫

556
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,500
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

557
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:10,600
♫ The bittersweet parting words of "take care" ♫

558
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:15,200
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

559
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:23,000
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫
