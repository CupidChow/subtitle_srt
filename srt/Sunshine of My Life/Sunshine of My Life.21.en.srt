[Episode 21]

3
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,070
Dad, you're not sleeping yet?

4
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,040
You're mature now. Even have a girlfriend in France.

5
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,740
Why haven't I heard you mention it?

6
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,430
It wasn't confirmed before.

7
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,660
- Is it confirmed now?
- Yes.

8
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,260
Look at you. You've always been sensible.

9
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,760
When it comes to you handling your personal things, I don't want to say much.

10
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,770
I hope that you won't fight

11
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,640
with your mom about this, okay?

12
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,980
We can forget what happened in the past.

13
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,690
But you must remember one thing.

14
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,480
That woman in that room who gave birth and raised you is your mother.

15
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,490
You know when Mom is being domineering,

16
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,940
who can deal with her?

17
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,880
I promise you then. When she's being domineering, I'll defend you.

18
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,490
- Remember what you said.
- Of course. Here.

19
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:31,360
But you have to give her some time and let her adjust slowly.

20
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,210
You know she's the person in this world who is most concerned about you.

21
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,590
That you have to admit.

22
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,120
I understand.

23
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,640
So when dealing with women,

24
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,480
you must have the right way. Right?

25
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,730
You can't ruin relationships just because of this matter.

26
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,740
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yes.

27
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,960
I must learn more from you in terms of dealing with women.

28
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,440
She's all worked up in the room.

29
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,410
Get some of her favorite grapes and take them to her. Be good.

30
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,460
You're such a great husband.

31
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,400
Hurry and go.

32
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,950
- Don't tell her I told you to do it.
 - Okay.

33
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,660
Even if...

34
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,090
we haven't known each other for a long time, and I haven't been in Paris for long,

35
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,080
I feel like we're colleagues.

36
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,050
Today is the last time we will see each other.

37
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,840
Tomorrow, I'll be heading back to Shanghai.

38
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,240
Do you have anything you want to say to me?

39
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,170
Translate, please.

40
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:21,200
Please give this cute woman a hug.

41
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,300
Do you have anything to say to me?

42
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,500
- All right. Okay. All right.
- But...

43
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,760
That's enough.

44
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,540
Miss, can you please pull yourself together?

45
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,860
How can I pull myself together?

46
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,850
I have no one to rely on now.

47
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:51,950
Who can handle being cheated on twice within two short months?

48
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,820
Who can take that?

49
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,010
Miss, can you stop being so dramatic?

50
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,920
To Cheng Yang and Bai Xiaoman, the relationship is only a working relationship.

51
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,920
Didn't he already explain it to you?

52
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,130
Then, why don't I misunderstand others? It's just him.

53
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,130
He's the one with the problem.

54
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,420
I must say something to you then.

55
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,910
Because of you, he has given up his job.

56
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,980
If he didn't really love you,

57
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,600
why would he take the risk and go back to China with you?

58
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,650
Fine. Even if you are right,

59
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,280
but I've already given up.

60
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,810
Given up? You should stop being stubborn.

61
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,020
You look at your phone 100 times a day. Who are you waiting to call you?

62
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,370
Mo Fei, why are you still mocking me?

63
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,500
I'm not mocking you. I'm telling you the truth.

64
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,920
You've been together for so many years.

65
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,520
How can you just break up and end it?

66
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,850
Before, Cheng Yang was my everything,

67
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,640
but that is now in the past.

68
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,550
I want to start over. I want to establish myself.

69
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,420
Let's work hard together.

70
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:04,080
Why don't you pack some more? I'll go out and buy some things.

71
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,860
Then let's have a drink.

72
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,400
All right.

73
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,520
Mo Fei.

74
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,310
Mo Fei, I'm sorry about last time.

75
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,340
I was at fault.

76
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,100
I heard Duoduo is leaving.

77
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,880
Can I treat you both to a meal?

78
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,400
Can you let me finish before you go?

79
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,520
This time the Cayman's Haute Couture is batik.

80
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,050
It's the design method you have been pursuing.

81
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:56,390
You and I both know with regards to batik, no companies will dare to try it.

82
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,760
Cayman is taking a big risk in boldly making this decision.

83
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,910
If it's not well accepted in the market,

84
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:05,230
no companies will dare to try it again.

85
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,490
Do you dare to accept this challenge?

86
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,630
The Chinese style on the market now is really out of place.

87
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,460
If you want to do classic Chinese style design,

88
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,840
Cayman's Haute Couture is your opportunity this time.

89
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,170
If you are willing, I want to collaborate with you.

90
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:31,220
I'm sure we will defeat the Japanese, Americans, and Spanish.

91
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,760
What do you think? Tell me.

92
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,230
- What do you think? It's okay?
- Not bad. It's much better than me.

93
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,340
- Seriously?
- Yes.
- Today, Linda even complimented you.

94
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,940
- It's true.
- Okay, I'll buy you a meal next time.

95
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,330
- Okay. Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

96
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,770
Mo Fan.

97
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,560
Thank you.

98
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,530
- W-Will you be singing at the bar today?
- Yes.

99
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,970
Can I come and listen to you sing?

100
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:30,160
Okay. If someone goes there, the boss will be happy.

101
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,180
The boss being happy has nothing to do with me.

102
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,250
I hope you will be happy.

103
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,620
Mo Fan, can I bring banners there?

104
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,960
I was joking.

105
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,930
Well...

106
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,760
If there is nothing else, I'm heading out first.

107
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,110
- Thank you for the water.
- Don't need to be polite with me.

108
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,180
Lu Zhu, how did you know I finished my water? You especially bought one for me.

109
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,330
Who said it was for you? It's for me.

110
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,370
You... Two bottles?

111
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,390
I like to drink water. Why do you care?

112
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,120
Zhu Zhu,

113
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,310
what's the matter? Did Linda scold you again?

114
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:22,070
Yes. I love to get scolded daily. How can I compare to you?

115
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:24,760
You are Linda's treasure. I'm like the grass on the roadside.

116
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,560
I-I-I said the wrong thing.

117
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,820
You are the treasure and I'm the grass on the roadside, okay?

118
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,500
Zhu Zhu...

119
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,960
Let's forget about training. Kitty is coming to the bar to hear me sing tonight. Why don't you come, too?

120
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,880
Me?

121
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,530
Why would I go with her?

122
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,040
Did you have some misunderstanding?

123
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,380
You were very fiece with her last time.

124
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,010
Kitty doesn't seem to have a good attitude lately.

125
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:52,950
If there is anything, why don't you talk it out? We're all friends.

126
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:56,910
Who wants to be her friend? You can be her friend. I won't.

127
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,730
Lu Zhu, why can't you be more reasonable?

128
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,510
I don't see how Kitty might have offended you, but you keep aiming at her.

129
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:07,350
Right. I'm unreasonable. I'm the most unreasonable person, okay?

130
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,640
No... I didn't mean it like that.

131
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,310
Well... How about this? If you come, I'll treat you to dinner.

132
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,680
I'm not going.

133
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,080
I want to share something with all of you.

134
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,850
- Go ahead.
- When I went to Paris this time...

135
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:50,570
Mingxuan, eat first.

136
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,290
Director Xia.

137
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,340
Director Xia.

138
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,830
What?

139
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,690
The meeting with President Wu is set for 2:00 p.m. today.

140
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:09,080
We have to finalize the proposal. President Wu is super anxious.

141
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,260
He sent people to ask us many times. He's afraid something might go wrong,

142
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,390
and our design sketch was already sent to the factory.

143
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:18,080
If you don't have any more changes, please sign.

144
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,250
- Then we can start production.
- Okay.

145
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,780
And the Milan meeting is also very urgent.

146
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,730
If you have time, please call JK immediately.

147
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,580
I know.

148
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,320
What's the matter?

149
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,080
I'm fine.

150
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,130
[Shut down]

151
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,200
Something on your mind?

152
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,410
Where are you going?

153
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:49,130
For the meeting later, you can't be late.

154
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,810
You have been tired from work recently, right?

155
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,160
No.

156
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,820
You should take a break. Haven't you always wanted to go to Switzerland?

157
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,150
Switzerland?

158
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:02,080
All right. Will the company pay for it?

159
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,220
Why did you buy such a late flight? It's not safe.

160
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,620
I had no other choice.

161
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,660
The red-eye tickets are the cheapest.

162
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,990
Let me hug you.

163
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,830
- You're leaving.
- I can't bear to leave you.
- Be safe on the way.

164
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:19,500
I will miss you. Take care of yourself.

165
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,890
Send me a WeChat when you get to the airport. You can even call.

166
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,320
When I'm in Shanghai, I'll come and visit you.

167
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,700
I'll come over to your house for a meal. You can also come to my house for a meal, too.

168
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,270
I'll take you to see my brother.

169
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,680
Cheng Yang is such a bastard.

170
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,040
I made a WeChat Moments post after I bought the ticket. He didn't even pay attention to me.

171
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,370
Say, I'm leaving and he didn't come and see me off.

172
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,420
He hasn't even given me a call the last few days.

173
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:48,400
If you want to call him, take the initiative. This is what you taught me.

174
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,230
But our situation is different.

175
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,820
The car is here.

176
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,990
I didn't call this ride.

177
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,710
It's not.

178
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,320
Come on, go.

179
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,350
Duoduo, I saw your WeChat Moments post.

180
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,430
I'm taking the same flight as you. Let's go back home together.

181
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,540
I can't live without you.

182
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,800
You said you can't live without me, so I must be with you?

183
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,660
Besides, did I forgive you?

184
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,570
Wait. Wait. I already called for a car.

185
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,610
Wait, listen. If you don't leave now, you'll be late.

186
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,390
Sir, please help. Thank you.

187
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:31,060
If it doesn't work, then split the payment with him.

188
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,940
Fine. I'll give you the money when we get in the car. I don't want to owe you anything.

189
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,080
All right. Let's get in first. You can pay me when we get to the airport.

190
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,240
All right. Go.

191
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,000
Wait.

192
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,050
Give me a call when you return to Shanghai.

193
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:53,050
I'll definitely come and find you. Don't worry.

194
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,200
I'm leaving.

195
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,030
All right. Go, go. Go.

196
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,510
- We're leaving.
- Bye-bye.

197
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:19,240
I'm sorry, President Wu. Please wait for a bit longer.

198
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,660
President Wu.

199
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,800
President Tang.

200
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,250
Director Xia isn't here, yet?

201
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,210
That's right. We've been waiting for her.

202
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,890
I went to her office to look for her and didn't see her.

203
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,220
Is that so?

204
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,720
She's usually very punctual.

205
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,840
Hello.

206
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,690
Brother Xuan, Director Xia turned off her phone.

207
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:49,990
I've contacted Liu Pei. Liu Pei doesn't seem to be at the company.

208
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,690
Give me a minute.

209
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:59,430
It's working hours. Why isn't she at the company?

210
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:04,060
I heard that she's taking annual leave and Director Xia approved it.

211
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,880
President Tang, I'm Manager Wang.

212
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,890
The factory manager said that Director Xia didn't sign the new order contract.

213
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,030
Fashion Daily is in a rush to have this batch of clothing. I can't get into contact with Director Xia.

214
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,890
This is what we'll do. Wait for me at the factory.

215
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:23,110
I'll be right there to handle it.

216
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,780
Okay.

217
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:29,200
I'm sorry, President Wu.

218
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,610
Let's push back our meeting.

219
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,910
No.

220
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,150
Hello, President Tang.

221
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:41,370
Before Director Xia left, did she leave any instructions?

222
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,490
No.

223
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:49,900
President Tang, this is the information of the designers that Director Xia talked to in Milan. She told me to revise it. Anyway, please take a look today.

224
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,540
President Tang, I have five clothing samples waiting for Director Xia's confirmation.

225
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:57,950
If she doesn't confirm, we won't be able to proceed with the next step.

226
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,840
From now on, send all of Director Xia's work

227
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,000
to my office.

228
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,390
Yes, I can't contact Director Xia either.

229
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,240
Boss.

230
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,450
President Tang! President Tang!

231
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:17,390
Brother Xuan, Director Xia's calls are all forwarded to my phone.

232
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,590
How should I reply?

233
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,090
From now on, send all of Director Xia's work

234
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:25,520
to the general manager's office.

235
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,690
What?

236
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,810
Well...

237
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,150
Anything else?

238
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,070
There was a call

239
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,590
from Robert, the designer of JK in Milan.

240
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:41,560
He said he'd only talk to Director Xia.

241
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,380
I understand.

242
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,280
- Brother Xuan.
- Get out.

243
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,430
Hey, Robert.

244
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,250
It's Mingxuan.

245
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,910
Xueling did come home today.

246
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,800
But when she left, she took some luggage with her.

247
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,820
She said she was going on a business trip.

248
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,240
She... Where would she have gone?

249
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,230
Mingxuan.

250
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,000
Old Xia.

251
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,790
We can't find Xueling.

252
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,800
She has turned off her phone. Should we call the police?

253
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,860
She took luggage with her. Why would you call the police?

254
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:48,540
Report she's missing? Wouldn't people laugh at us?

255
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,090
But we don't know where she has gone.

256
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,210
She's a girl alone out there.

257
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:56,250
What if something happens to her?

258
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,710
I think she might just want some peace and quiet for a couple of days.

259
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,720
I don't know why Xueling is making a fuss again.

260
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,580
But in the office, there are many important matters waiting for her to manage.

261
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,960
Uncle and Auntie, if she contacts you,

262
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,860
please tell her to call me immediately.

263
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,030
- Mingxuan.
- We know.

264
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:22,180
This is what we'll do, Mingxuan. Once she contacts us,

265
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,610
I'll tell her that you have urgent matters waiting for her at the office immediately.

266
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,250
All right, I'll head out now.

267
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,630
Why do you think he's like this?

268
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,890
He's so cold-hearted.

269
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:43,390
He's not concerned about Xueling at all. He's just thinking about work.

270
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:47,130
He knows better than anyone why Xueling is doing this.

271
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:51,060
Would it be meaningful if you plainly tell him?

272
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,170
- No.
- Listen...

273
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,680
It's not meaningful.

274
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,250
You...

275
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,910
Hello.

276
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,000
My beloved Miss, where are you?

277
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,170
The company is in a mess.

278
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,420
I heard President Tang just left your house.

279
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,790
He must be extremely anxious.

280
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,580
If this continues, will something happen?

281
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,510
I'm well aware of the situation.

282
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:34,020
This trivial matter won't impact Mingxuan's interests.

283
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,510
Besides, even if something happens, it won't impact you.

284
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,890
Why are you worried?

285
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:41,710
I'm not worried about myself. I'm worried about you.

286
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:45,040
You left. Half of the company is at a halt.

287
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,190
Don't you know President Tang's temper?

288
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:50,080
It will be fine. I know President Tang very well.

289
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,530
Just enjoy your time off.

290
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:56,270
All right. I feel at ease hearing you say that. Thanks to you.

291
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,330
I'm enjoying Switzerland during the off-peak travel season.

292
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:01,590
One word: comfortable.

293
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,720
Have fun then.

294
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,630
All right. Bye-bye.

295
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:13,980
Mngxuan, when you are in a bind,

296
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:18,370
you will know how important I am.

Hello, Mingxuan.

314
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,170
It should be very early in the morning in China. Why aren't you sleeping yet?

315
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:16,120
I'm about to go home. There were a lot of things to do at the office.

316
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,020
What are you doing?

317
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:22,120
Duoduo went back to China. I'm just cleaning up.

318
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,770
Did they reconcile?

00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,720
I think they reconciled on the way.

320
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,530
Duoduo left and I'm the only one cleaning at home.

321
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,520
Out with the old, in with the new.

322
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,060
Can I apply to be your new roommate?

323
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:39,820
Yes. But... you have to line up after Meng Jing.

324
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,270
Meng Jing will move in soon.

325
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:45,060
It looks like she will be staying for two years.

326
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,910
I'm your boyfriend and I still have to line up after Meng Jing?

327
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:52,330
I have no choice. She already signed the rental contract. You can only line up after her.

328
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,840
Did I tell you that your boyfriend is a capable person?

329
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,200
He can buy your entire building.

330
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,070
Yes, right. All right. You go ahead and buy, buy.

331
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:04,000
I don't believe you'd do something that stupid.

332
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,900
All right, I have to go.

333
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,740
Drive carefully. Let me know when you get home.

334
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,700
Good night, baby.

335
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,340

338
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,760

I know you're not asleep yet.

340

Open the door. I want to chat with you.

341
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:43,200
It's already late. Let's chat tomorrow.

342
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,200
I heard Tang Mingxuan and Duoduo left.

343
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,620
So, what do you want to say?

344
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,810
I want to discuss designs with you.

345
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:53,130
I'm putting my design sketches in order.

346
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:55,910
I want to discuss some aspects with you.

347
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:00,800
It's really late. I'm going to rest. Good night.

349
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,460
Miss Qin,

350
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,030
what you said got me so excited.

351
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:25,620
I am a huge fan of gaming.

352
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,590
That's my biggest hobby.

353
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,180
No problem, Director Zhu.

354
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,660
How about this? I can refer a few gaming companies to you,

355
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,870
so that you can take a look.

356
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:37,190
That would be great! I would love that!

357
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,730
If you...

358
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:41,860
Forgive me. I have a phone call.

359
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:47,790
- Hello?
- Hello? Haitian, are you in the office?

360
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:51,270
Of course, it's working hours.

361
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:54,570
How is it going in France? Did you get it done?

362
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:57,100
Work is the only thing you care about, isn't it?

363
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,060
Don't you want to know how I'm doing?

364
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,580
I do, I do.

365
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:06,130
Did you do any shopping in France? Do you need money?

366
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,440
Save it.

367
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,610
All right, all right. You are the best. Come on.

368
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:16,390
I have good news and bad news for you.

369
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:20,520
Which one do you want to hear first?

370
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,160
There is a good one and a bad one?

371
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,130
The bad one.

372
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,860
Cheng Yang was signed by Mingyuan.

373
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,780
What?

374
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:36,230
Director Zhu, please don't mind me. I'll get going.

375
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:39,600
Wait! It's just an emergency work call.

376
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,760
- I am so sorry.
- No worries.

377
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,920
All right, let's catch up on what we discussed earlier.

378
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,190
Thank you so much.

379

No problem, I got it.

380
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,780
Director Zhu, I put my faith in you.

381
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,900
Thank you, take care.

384
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:25,020
Bai Xiaoman, what did you do? You said you had everything under control!

385
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,560
Why are you yelling at me?

386
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,360
I promised Cheng Yang to cover all his expenses and give him a raise.

387
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,050
It was going well.

388
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:35,770
Who knew he would change his mind?

389
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:39,530
We offered him such a good package and yet he is still unsatisfied?

390
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,900
What else could it be? He's got a better place.

391
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,230
A better place? What better place?

392

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,400
Are you kidding me?

394
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,140
Mingyuan is no better than Haiyao.

395
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:58,710
Sure, but Tang Mingxuan showed up himself to win him.

396
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:02,480
Tang Mingxuan showed up himself?

397
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,510
He is the boss. He is rich and powerful.

398
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,180
I have no title in Haiyao.

399
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,920
Of course, his words matter more than mine.

400
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,930
The moment Cheng Yang saw Tang Mingxuan,

401
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:18,910
he walked away with him right away.

402
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,180
What else could I do about it?

403
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,390
Fine. Tang Mingxuan, you want to play dirty?

404
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,700
Also, you know what?

405
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,100
The worst part is Mo Fei.

406
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,420
When did she start hooking up with Cheng Yang?

407
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:38,300
Mo Fei? What did she do?

408
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,020
Who knows what game she pulled.

409
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:45,670
But don't worry, I've still got good news.

410
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:48,680
What good news can you possibly be offering now?

411
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,280
Even if we lost Chang Yang, the small fish,

412
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,760
I can still get you a big fish.

413
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,870
Save it. There's no big fish for you to get.

414
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:02,220
Guess what I found out about?

415
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,560
Fang Xiaoyu is in France.

416
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:10,670
Fang Xiaoyu is useless to us. Do you think he would join Haiyao?

417
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:14,810
Hold on and let me finish.

418
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:18,670
I heard that...

00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,450

420
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:25,690
to do a collaboration.

421
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:28,350
They are going to host a collaboration launch.

422
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:33,080
If we could work with them,

423
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,010
would it be good news?

424
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:44,370
If you put it that way...

425
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,010
it sounds promising.

426
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:48,390
Of course, it is!

427
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:53,300
If you agree to this, I will go to Fang Xiaoyu right away and get this done.

428
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:58,450
Fang Xiaoyu? How much chance do you stand?
Didn't he fire you?

429
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:02,370
Yes, that's why.

430
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:06,750
I think he owes me a favor.

431
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:11,090
I wouldn't go to him if it wasn't for you.

00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:11,190
I've also added the market concept you proposed earlier in the agenda.

483
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:15,790
However... I had been communicating with Director Xia before.

484
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,820
I believe our market concept

485
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:21,120
that connects online and offline shopping

486
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,570
will become a new experience shopping.

487
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:27,660
I admire your vision.

488
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,960
- You were able to come up with such an advanced concept.
- It's just a concept.

489
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,690
The actual implementation will depend on your team.

490
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:37,630
You don't have to worry. I definitely won't disappoint you.

491
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:40,350
Well... About Director Xia.

492
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:44,660
It's fine. She'll probably be resting for a bit longer. If you need anything,

493
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,960
you can contact me directly.

494
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,440
Okay. That sounds good.

495
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,560
I have some other matters to attend to. I'll get going. I won't disturb you any longer.

496
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,400
- I won't walk you out, President Wu.
- No need.

497
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,890
- Bye-bye.
- We'll be in contact.

498
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,960
You're here.

499
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,800
So many years have passed.

500
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,600
This place hasn't changed at all.

501
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,210
You still remember this place?

502
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,930
This is the only place

503
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:27,070
where we traveled to by ourselves.

504
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:29,520
Of course, I remember.

505
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,950
But to be accurate,

506
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:37,000
last time, it was because you ran away from home.

507
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:40,660
Brother Xuan, where is this place?

508
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,760
My uncle opened this resort. We can stay here.

509
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,390
This way you won't have to attend the International Mathematical Olympiad competition.

510
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,130
Brother Xuan, thanks for taking me in.

511
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:51,500
That week I was with you

512
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,270
was the happiest time in my life.

513
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:56,630
So many years have passed.

514
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:59,210
Only this place hasn't changed.

515
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:05,960
Mingxuan, since you are here to find me,

516
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,290
that means many things haven't changed. Does it mean you—

517
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:13,380
But now, the place hasn't changed but the people have changed.

518
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:26,400
So President Wu's sales proposal has been confirmed?

519
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,240
Yes.

520
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:33,000
The new designs are in production, too?

521
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,860
Yes.

522
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,030
Mingxuan, you're here to see me

523
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:47,300
to tell me that without me, Mingyuan will continue to operate smoothly.

524
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,190
To you and Mingyuan,

525
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:52,060
I'm not essential. Right?

526
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:56,560
Or are you here to fire me?

527
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,220
Xueling, let me ask you.

528
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:01,820
Am I too lenient towards you or are you being too reckless?

529
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,830
This is the first time I'm being willful.

530
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,930
Do you not care about my feelings at all?

531
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:10,140
Right now, you are using the company and the entire team's trust and reliance on you

532
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,240
to force me to come and find you.

533
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,640
You should know very well.

534
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,140
I'm the type that separates business and personal matters.

535
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:24,930
To you, am I just a subordinate at work?

536
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:28,280
If you were just a subordinate at work,

537
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:33,120
I wouldn't need to finish all the work you left behind and then come and find you.

538
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,030
As a friend, I trust you.

539
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:37,500
As a colleague, I rely on you.

540
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,130
What about you? You just left like that.

541
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:44,030
Let me ask you.

542
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,360
What do you think I should do?

543
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,710
You've never treated me like that before. After you came back from France,

544
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:53,400
you completely changed.

545
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,670
All you see and think about is Mo Fei.

546
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:58,740
Because of this woman, you've abandoned me.

547
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:01,400
It's inappropriate for you to say that.

548
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,840
I think you should also know by now.

549
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,010
Mo Fei is my girlfriend.

550
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,900
Girlfriend?

551
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:15,280
For what reason is she your girlfriend? Does she understand you?

552
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,900
Does she know what you need? Can she help you?

553
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:22,830
I'm telling you! I'm the only one who can help you with your work. Don't you understand?

554
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:25,620
Why must love be associated with work?

555
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:28,680
Work is work. Love is love.

556
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:32,130
Don't I have the right to choose the one I love?

557
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:35,850
I admit.

558
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:39,630
To Mingyuan, you are irreplaceable.

559
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,700
Let me tell you! The company doesn't belong to just one person.

560
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,600
I'm the company's leader.

561
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,270
I won't allow this situation to happen again.

562
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:52,930
People can leave, but I always have a backup.

563
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:56,650
In the same way, you're also a company leader. What did you do?

564
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:59,560
Not only did you violate the company's rules, you urged

565
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,770
your subordinates to leave their posts.

566
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,930
I'm so disappointed in you.

567
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:21,170
♫ I say you're an April day ♫

568
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:25,200
♫ The sound of your laughter lights everything up ♫

569
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,800
♫ Even the spirit of a light breeze ♫

570
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,810
♫ In the midst of the brightness and beauty of spring,
shift as one would in a dance ♫

571
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:40,130
♫ You're the mist on a dry April day ♫

572
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:44,440
♫ The gentle breeze blown during dusk ♫

573
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,070
♫ The unintentional sparkle of the planetesimal ♫

574
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:54,110
♫ The fine rain that's sprinkled in front of the flower ♫

575
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:58,700
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

576
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:03,700
♫ Like a shy water lotus that bows to a cool breeze ♫

577
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:08,370
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫

581
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:37,790
♫ You're like the ivory field after snowflakes ♫

582
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:42,070
♫ You're the round moon every night ♫

583
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:44,860
♫ You're the naïve ♫

584
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:51,190
♫ white lotus that floats on the water ripples of your dream ♫

585
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:57,340
♫ You're the flower blossoms of tree after tree ♫

586
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:01,780
♫ The swallow twittering within the beams ♫

587
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:05,460
♫ You are love, hope, and warmth ♫

588
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:09,860
♫ You're an April day ♫

589
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:14,580
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

590
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:19,220
♫ The bittersweet parting words of "take care" ♫

591
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:24,050
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫
