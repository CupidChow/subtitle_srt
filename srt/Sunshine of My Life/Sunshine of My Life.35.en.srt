[Episode 35]

3
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,660
You scared me to death!

4
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,360
Why did you suddenly come to the hospital to see me?

5
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,330
I went by your house earlier and your brother said you were at the hospital.

6
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,480
What's the matter? Where are you feeling unwell?

7
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,810
Look at how energetic I am. How am I unwell?

8
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,050
I came here to see a friend.

9
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,560
Friend?

10
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,380
Next time you go somewhere, can you tell me in advance?

11
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,570
- Say, you have such a strong desire to control everything.
- I don't have a strong desire to control.

12
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,890
I'm worried about you.

13
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,490
Fine. Let's go.

14
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,840
I see that you've been live broadcasting more frequently lately.

15
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,880
You're working and doing live broadcasts, but you just don't have time to spend with your boyfriend.

16
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,880
It's not that. It's because I bumped into a friend here.

17
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,680
She has a very severe illness.

18
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,740
I don't have time to go visit her so I can only use this method to accompany her.

19
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,490
Who is it?

20
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,110
Boy or girl?

21
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,000
A girl! Besides, even if I said who it is, you wouldn't know her.

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,160
It seems like recently you have many little secrets.

23
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,660
I don't have secrets! Look! You wouldn't know her even if I told you. Right?

24
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,040
You agree to get the surgery?

25
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,690
Yes, I agree to get the surgery.

26
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,850
Really? You've decided?

27
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,650
If I had the opportunity to be reborn,

28
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,250
why would I fear death?

29
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,020
That's great.

30
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,320
I just knew my little princess would think it through.

31
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,200
I will go arrange it with the doctor now

32
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,530
and have the surgery as soon as possible.

33
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,980
Sorry for the trouble, but this is the standard hospital procedure.

34
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,880
It's no trouble.

35
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,340
We have troubled you more.

36
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,330
Once she gets back home, what else do we need to be careful of?

37
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,470
Fang Qian's current condition is quite good.

38
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:57,690
Just have her take her medicine on time and don't let her be provoked.

39

[Fang Xiaoyu]

40
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,010
I finished filling it in.

41
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,570
All right. You can leave with Fang Qian now,

42
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,990
but remember to come back on time in four days.

43
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,850
There's only half a month before her surgery.

44
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,580
These 10 days of preparation are very crucial.

45
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,360
- Also...
- Also what?

46
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,480
Have that Mr. Tang spend more time with Fang Qian.

47
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,080
If possible, have him see her more often before her surgery.

48
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,800
I can see that he is special to Fang Qian.

49
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,220
He can evoke a strong sense of survival in Fang Qian.

50
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,800
Okay, I understand.

51
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,010
Yang Guang,

52
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,720
I'm going out for a bit. I've already signed all the documents here.

53
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,180
Help me deliver them to the respective departments.

54
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,820
- Let me drive you there.
- No need.

55
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,330
Brother Mingxuan,

56
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,840
I don't want to sit in a wheelchair.

57
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,760
But it's not easy to walk on the path at this place.

58
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,120
Then, can you do what you did when we were little?

59
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,320
Okay.

60
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,210
Be careful, right here.

61
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:31,090
Brother Mingxuan, do you still remember

62
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,750
when we were little, we would come and play here often?

63
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,110
Of course, I remember.

64
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,130
Isn't this our secret hideout when we were little?

65
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,820
- Hurry!
- Qian Qian!

66
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,800
- Come on!
- Watch out! Don't run!

67
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,840
- Qian Qian!
- Brother Mingxuan, protect me.

68
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,480
Don't worry, I'm here to protect you.

What are you thinking?

74
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,540
I'm remembering us playing here when we were young.

75
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,140
Back then, my brother always bullied me,

76
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,630
but you would always protect me.

77
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,950
Brother Mingxuan, how has this place changed?

78

♫ Still remembering you ♫

79
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,370
This place hasn't changed much from our childhood.

80
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,760
It's the same.

81
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,400
Then, have you come here?

82
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,270
After we grew up, didn't we stop coming here?

83
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,680
But this place...

84
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,170
has many of our beautiful memories.

85
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,880
This place also has one of my small secrets.

86
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,850
Small secret?

87
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,740
There is a rock here.

88

89
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,680
- Are you sure it's here?
- I...

90
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,080
Let me think.

91
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,500
Let's forget about it, Brother Mingxuan.

92
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,100
Since I can't see,

93
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,400
I don't know exactly where it is.

94
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,630
I will come and get it myself after my surgery.

95
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,220
I will tell you then, okay?

96
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,070
You've finally decided to get the surgery?

97
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:45,170
I've decided. It's scheduled after my birthday.

98
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,850
I'm having a birthday party.

99
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,370

102
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,650
Lu Zhu, help me...

103
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,340
pick a present that you girls will like. Okay?

104
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,170
As soon as possible.

105
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:38,040
Are you gifting it to Sister Mo Fei?

106
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,030
What's the matter? Did you work last night?

107
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:52,170
It's all because I had to pick a gift for your sister.

108
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,760
Why were you picking a gift for her?

109
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,690
My cousin sent me a WeChat message yesterday

110
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,960
telling me to pick a gift that girls would like.

111
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,000
He even wired me money directly. Look.

112
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,650
- This much money.  [¥3,000]
- Wow

113
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:10,090
If this is not for your sister, who else can it be for?

114
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,790
Nice! Brother-in-Law is quite thoughtful.

115
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,450
No.

116
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:17,760
Shouldn't lovers prepare gifts for each other by themselves?

117
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,400
Now that's thoughtful.

118
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,320
It seems weird that he asked me to buy it.

119
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,900
He is the president of the company. He's so busy, how would he have the time to choose a gift?

120
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,700
That's just an excuse that you guys use.

121
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,900
No matter how busy he is, he must have the time to go to the restroom. Right?

122
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,090
Online shopping is so convenient now.

123
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,400
He can place an order in the time he uses the restroom.

124
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,840
How can he say that he doesn't have time?

125
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,770
Your cousin is so busy, he doesn't even have time to eat.

126
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,160
How is he able to defecate?

127
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,320
Mo Fan, I realized that you are such a... genius.  (sarcastic)

128
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,800
Your brain circuit is a bit strange.

129
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,560
You are right. I've misunderstood my cousin.

130
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,990
He is busy, super busy, too busy to–

131
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:08,090
What? I didn't say anything wrong. My goodness.

132
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,080
- When you eat a cake, you should start from here.
- I just want–

133
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,720
I just want to start from here. Can't I?

134
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,540
You can.

135
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,160
Mingxuan, do you have time this weekend?

136
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,100
What? Do you want to go on a date with me?

137
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,880
I told you about it last time.

138
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,730
The girl I became friends with at the hospital. It's her birthday.

139
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,290
So I want you to attend it with me.

140
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,890
- That great? Then congratulate her for me—
- Brother!

141
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:40,640
I bought the present you asked me to buy for Sister Mo Fei!

142
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,060
What? Is it not pretty?

143
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,310
Mo Fei...

144
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,230
Go on.

145
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,460
- No, Lu Zhu—
- I'm leaving.

146
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:04,850
If you're busy then go to work. We'll talk another time. Bye-bye.

147
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,000
He bought me a present?

148
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,440
I can't believe he bought me a present.

149
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,240
Your brother is here.

150
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,340
Qian Qian, guess what I brought for you.

151
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,770
What yummy food is it?

152
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,850
You only know to eat.

153
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,140
Such a big box!

154
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,150
Brother, you finally made me clothes again?

155
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,120
- You're indeed my sister. Try it on.
- Okay.

156
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:17,300
Brother, does it look nice?

157
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,130
It is really beautiful.

158
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,600
Really?

159
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,160
Wait. I even prepared a necklace for you.

160
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,400
Okay.

161
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,150
Final touch.

162
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:53,870
But... I can't see.

163
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,440
Also, my face must look really thin and pale.

164
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,900
It is a shame about the new clothes you made for me.

165
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,130
It's all right. I'll help you.

166
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,240
Xiao Yang, go open the door.

167
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,530
Brother, who is it?

168
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,360
Guess.

169
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,590
Hello, Miss Fang, allow me to help you.

170
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,440
Do I really look nice, Brother?

171
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,570
Very pretty.

172
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,000
I will go have a look at how the preparations are going.

173
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,290
Wait for me here.

174
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,850
Okay.

175
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,080
You are so pretty today!

176
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,300
This is your birthday present. Happy birthday!

177
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,740
Thank you, Mo Fei!

178
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,240
I am so happy that you could make it today.

179
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,090
Your brother has finally shown mercy and released you from the hospital.

180
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,830
At least you don't have to have your birthday at the hospital.

181
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,680
That is because I agreed to get surgery.

182
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,330
That is why he let me come out for air.

183
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:47,030
Really? That is great!

184
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:51,330
All thanks to you, Mo Fei. You were the one who gave me courage.

185
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,650
You have to think it is yourself who has gotten stronger.

186
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:59,380
Also, it is only a small surgery. It will for sure be a success!

187
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,160
After you have recovered, you can wear the most beautiful high heels

188
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,860
on your soles and go find your prince.

189
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,690
Sure. Also, I have to introduce you to my brother.

190
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:15,460
Your brother... all right then... I'll take it as another bro.

191
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,110
But we can only be bros.

192
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,630
Okay.

193
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,170
- What's wrong?
- Does your head hurt again?

194
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,480
I will get the medicine for you.

195
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,130
Sorry, it is all my fault for making you emotional.

196
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,550
It's all right. It's my own problem.

197
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,620
I just laugh too easily.

198
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,870
Girls like you who like to laugh,

199
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,510
your luck won't be bad.

200
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:44,550
This surgery will definitely be very, very, very, very successful.

201
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:47,850
Okay! I accept your blessed words.

202
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,420
Guess what I bought for you?

203
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,230
I don't know.

204
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,030
Happy Birthday.

205
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,890
- That great?
- Brother!

206
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,940
I bought the present you asked me to buy for Sister Mo Fei!

207
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,000
Brother Mingxuan, you're here.

208
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,360
What took you so long?

209
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:33,550
Mo Fei, he is the person I told you about.

210
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:38,180
He is a few years older than me. You can say

211
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:43,390
we are childhood sweethearts, equal status for marriage.

212
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,170
Do you know

213
00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:00,430
what Tang Mingxuan was doing when you were eating oden?

214
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,490
Right now, he treats me very well.

215
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:06,740
He frequently comes to visit me. He brings me yummy food and fun things to play with.

216
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,280
[Tang Mingxuan: Baby, something came up. I cannot accompany you today, I'm sorry.]

217
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,590
Qian Qian.

218
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,050
Mo Fei?

219
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,430
You all know each other?

220
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,700
How do you know Fang Qian?

221
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,170
I should ask you that.

222
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,600
She is Alice.

223
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,730
She is the person I met at the hospital.

224
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:37,990
She is Fang Qian, Fang Xiaoyu's sister.

225
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:41,320
So... how long did you intend to keep me in the

226
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,150
- dark?
- I didn't intend to keep it from you...

227
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,220
You didn't mention a word about Fang Qian.

228
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,670
You also never say why Fang Xiaoyu hates you.

229
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:57,560
I always thought I was the person closest to you.

230
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:04,660
I only found out today that I'm the only one to not know something everyone already knows.

231
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,950
I've thought about telling you.

232
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,850
But I felt I should find the best time for me to explain it to you slowly.

233
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:16,680
When is the best time?! How long have we been together?!

234
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,190
We go on dates together. We go to work together.

235
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:23,670
Even if we don't see each other, we would send messages or video chat on WeChat.

236
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,880
Do you want to find a better reason?

237
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,700
I'm not trying to find a reason (excuse).

238
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,030
I've thought about explaining this to you,

239
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,160
but I couldn't find the right time.

240
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,130
Right time?

241
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,870
I don't care at all what happened between you guys.

242
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:57,340
Even if you two were childhood sweethearts and almost got married 3 years ago, I don't care.

243
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,530
But what I want to say is...

244
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:03,420
I don't want to hear it from others, but you.

245
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,960
I understand how you feel,

246
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,860
but I can tell you very sincerely

247
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,600
that the feelings I have had for Fang Qian for all these years

248
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,480
are only those between brother and sister.

249
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,560
Do you know? Actually,

250
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:39,130
I have been trying very hard to assimilate into your life and your circle.

251
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,360
But in the end,

252
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,470
I realize that I am an outsider.

253
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,970
Today's matter is my fault.

254
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,220
Don't cry anymore. I apologize to you.

255
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,670
I don't need your apology.

256
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:23,080
So, Mo Fei is the friend who you mentioned that has been encouraging you?

257
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,870
This is such a small world.

258
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:37,570
So... is Mo Fei...

259
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,470
Brother Mingxuan's girlfriend?

260
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,410
- No.
- Yes.

261
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,830
Xiaoyu, if you, Qian Qian, want to get over this

262
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:48,220
then we should tell her the truth.

263
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,530
Mingxuan indeed has a girlfriend.

264
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,600
It's Mo Fei.

265
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:07,010
Mo Fei is a kind and cute girl.

266
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,840
When I'm with her, I'm very happy,

267
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,630
let alone Brother Mingxuan.

268
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,760
Qian Qian,

269
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,290
there is no need for you to pretend to be happy.

270
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:26,120
Brother, I'm not pretending to be happy.

271
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:30,050
At least, it's Mo Fei.

272
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:34,030
A girl who is healthier, prettier,

273
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:36,880
and kinder than me.

274
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,160
It's not a humiliating defeat for me.

275
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,640
But what about Tang Mingxuan? He doesn't deserve you at all.

276
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,820
Brother,

277
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:51,650
stop holding a grudge against Brother Mingxuan.

278
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:54,290
After being with Mo Fei during this period of time,

279
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:58,420
I've really let down a lot of my guard.

280
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:02,250
When I'm with her, I'm really happy.

281
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:06,500
Even I'm so willing to be with her, let alone

282
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,730
Brother Mingxuan.

283
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,880
This is Mo Fei's charm.

284
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,670
But are you sure Mo Fei doesn't know who you are?

285
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,580
I don't understand.

286
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:24,010
Mo Fei isn't just Mingxuan's girlfriend.

287
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:28,290
She's the person he wants to be with even if he disobeys his parents.

288
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:32,720
Even if he disobeys his parents?

289
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,590
It looks like

290
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:38,850
Mo Fei and I have something in common.

291
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:45,920
It's just that she's the one Brother Mingxuan wants to be with no matter what.

292
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,720
And I'm...

293
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:52,310
the one he doesn't want no matter what.

294
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:55,720
Qian Qian, you're too kind.

295
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,570
Have you thought maybe

296
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,890
she approached you to let you see how sweet they are together?

297
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:04,980
To let you know that she is different compared to you.

298
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,960
That's impossible! That's definitely impossible!

299
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,480
- Mo Fei is not that type of person!
- If she didn't know that you were Fang Xiaoyu's younger sister,

300
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,440
and didn't know your relationship with Mingxuan,

301
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,760
then why did she approach you when there are so many people at the hospital? Why is she so concerned about you?

302
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,550
That's not what happened! Mo Fei is not that type of person!

303
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:22,320
Xia Xueling, do you think Qian Qian hasn't been hurt enough?

304
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,140
Why are you provoking her like this?

305
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,590
Besides, I don't think Mo Fei is the type of person you're describing.

306
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,350
Xiaoyu, the four of us grew up together.

307
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:32,440
Could I possibly harm Qianqian? Besides,

308
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,910
do you really know Mo Fei? You may know a person, but not her true nature.

309
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,730
Can you guarantee she doesn't have an ulterior motive?

310
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,790
Enough!

311
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:43,490
Don't get my sister involved in our affairs, okay?

312
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:56,620
Qian Qian, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have shouted.

313
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:00,160
I'm just too worried about you.

314
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,430
Brother,

315
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,310
I'm tired.

316
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:11,210
I want to be by myself for a bit.

317
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,480
- Please go.
- Okay.

318
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,830
What is this?

319
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:54,790
Let's stop watching. It's so scary.

320
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,120
It's such a good movie.

321

Don't be scared. I'm here.

Mo Fan, are you crazy!

323
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,060
Lu Zhu,

324
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,970
are you mad? I was just joking. All right. Let's sit down.

325
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,050
How can you joke like this?

326
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,760
Hey, Sister!

327
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,560
Why didn't you knock?

328
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:33,000
I think your sister has been crying.

329
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,470
Really?

330
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,690
Sister.

[Call Declined]

332
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:50,270
Sister Mo Fei, why did you cry?

333
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:56,330
Didn't you attend a friend's birthday party today?

334
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:00,550
Did someone bully you? I'll tell Mo Fan to teach them a lesson.
[Tang Mingxuan]

335
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:04,190
Right. If anyone dares to bully you, I'll beat him up.
[Slide to Power Off]

336
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,720
Do you know Fang Qian?

337
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,080
I...

338
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,270
So you also know

339
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,150
about her relationship with your cousin, right?

340
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,440
- She... She...
- Tell us.

341
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:31,510
This situation is very complicated.

342
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:34,430
It's a long story. How about I don't say anything?

343
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:36,230
- Tell us.
- Tell us.

344
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,120
Sister Mo Fei, can you first tell me

345
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,160
why you are suddenly asking about this?

346
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,730
I've met her today.

347
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,520
Mo Fei, I really like it. Thank you.

348
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,860
How about this. After you recover,

349
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:10,060
I'll make a beautiful outfit for you so you look gorgeous.

350
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,820
Okay.

351
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:18,060
But it looks likes I don't have anything to gift you.

352
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,690
Well... just give me

353
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:25,310
your smile as a gift.

354
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,510
You have to believe in yourself.

355
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:32,700
Even though I can't come often to see you in the hospital from now on,

356
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,430
I'll still be by your side.

357
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:52,000
That's pretty much what happened.

358
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:57,730
Actually, I think the one to blame is my aunt.

359
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,320
So that's the case.

360
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:07,840
If he really married Fang Qian for some business interests,

361
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,060
then that would have been irresponsible. Right?

362
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,360
In that case, Brother-in-Law doesn't seem to be at much fault.

363
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,120
That's right.

364
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:19,900
That's impossible! How can it not be his fault? He's wrong big time.

365
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,530
Why is he wrong?

366
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:26,520
The first fault, he should have confessed

367
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,320
his very sentimental history with Fang Qian earlier.

368
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,120
Very sentimental history? It can't be considered as my cousin's love history.

369
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,160
At most, it can only be considered Fang Qian's one-sided love.

370
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,870
- Is that so?
- Yes.

371
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,330
His second fault.

372
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:44,200
He shouldn't have left my sister behind on the day of their anniversary

373
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,820
and went to see Fang Qian at the hospital.

374
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,800
At that time, she became blind.

375
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,970
It was an emergency.

376
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,850
Then... all right.

377
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:01,770
Then the third fault... The third fault is terrible.

378
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:05,330
He said the gift for Fang Qian was for my sister.

379
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:08,880
It made my sister happy for no reason. He crossed the line. Unforgivable.

380
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,470
You actually can't blame my cousin for that.

381
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:14,450
He never said that the gift was for Sister Mo Fei.

382
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:17,700
I was the one who assumed the gift was for Sister Mo Fei.

383
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:21,690
Sister Mo Fei, I'm sorry. It was a misunderstanding.

384
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:24,260
How are you two listing his crimes right now?

385
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,460
You're clearly making excuses for him and saying good words for him.

386
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,370
I understand. You should be a little mad.

387
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:36,300
However, my cousin definitely did not intentionally hide it from you.

388
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:41,190
You are his girlfriend. He did this because he doesn't want you to overthink.

389
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,930
He wants to protect you.

390
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:46,600
So, in your hearts,

391
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,690
am I just tofu that falls apart at any moment?

392
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:52,260
I don't need to be protected at all. If that's the case,

393
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,920
I'll just be his bro, why be his girlfriend?

394
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,420
Don't be mad, Sister Mo Fei. Okay?

395
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,700
Please forgive him.

396
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,560
Sister Mo Fei.

397
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,290
I have one last question.

398
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:07,190
Go ahead, ask.

399
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:21,290
What illness does Fang Qian have?

400
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:24,620
Doctors say she has a brain tumor.

401
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:29,030
The tumor is gradually growing now. It's pressing on the optical nerve.

402
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:32,930
So that's why she has become blind.

I just forwarded Miya's email to you.

What is it about?

413
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,340
Collaboration Outline Contract.

414
00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:00,180
Now, they are requiring us to run the Symphony of Clouds and Mists show

415
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,680
smoothly.

416
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,380
Because it's written in the contract that

417
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,620
the entire show must be up to par with their standards and promotion results.

418
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:11,360
That's the only way they will agree to the acquisition.

That's great.

420
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,720
We've already spent so much effort on this matter.

421
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,060
Did they mention when they will sign the Collaboration Outline Contract?

422

that I must return to the office within 30 minutes to sign and stamp it for them.

I need you to do something for me.

464
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,570
It won't be worth this much no matter what it is.

465
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:58,650
It's about the design sketch, of course.

466

Weren't you able to meet with Director Fang at the hospital last time?

Didn't you resolve your problem with the designer?

468

All my designer's friends won't be able to help you complete the design sketch on such short notice.

469

I can't take this money. I'm sending it back to you.

No. I want Cheng Yang's design sketches.

No. Xiaoman, are you crazy?

You've always been so hesitant and indecisive, not daring to just go for it

480
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,670
which is why you're still a small assistant now.

481
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:48,690
No pain, no gain. Don't you know that?

482
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:54,380
Besides, I've told you already. If anything happens, I will take care of it.

483
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:58,000
Even so, it's not that easy to get the design sketches.

484
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,310
During our meeting last week, they specifically emphasized that

485
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:03,560
all the designers must protect their design sketches.

486
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:07,260
If it's that easy, how could it be worth so much money?

487
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:10,130
Wealth has always come from taking risks.

488
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,890
Jiaxi, you are the only hope for me and Haiyao now.

489
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:21,220
Failure is not an option here, understand?

490
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,670
I promise!

491
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:26,730
When this is over, you'll have more than what you have now. Okay?

492
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:39,530
Then... I'll do my best.

493
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,220
Jiaxi, I bought a purse a few days ago.

494
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:46,350
I think it suits you very well. Come and take a look at it with me. Let's go.

495
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:09,290
Will it kill you to coax me a bit?

496

♫ At five past ten, you suddenly appear ♫

00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,330
♫ You turned around without a "goodbye" ♫

509
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,090
Brother Xuan.

510
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,690
As you asked, I've already

511
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:14,040
prepared Miya's itinerary.

512
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,210
I've sent you an email with their plans.

513
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:22,230
By the way, Cheng Yang hasn't submitted their updated designs. Right?

514
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,210
Then... I-I'll follow up with him.

515
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:26,120
Forget it. You're already like this.

516
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,490
I'll ask him myself tomorrow.

517
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,210
Okay.

518
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,890
By the way, Brother Xuan...

519
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:37,330
It's 4:00 a.m. already, aren't you going home yet?

520
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:41,080
This product launch is very important to our company.

521
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,860
If you are sleepy, take a nap on the couch.

522
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:47,150
Okay, I'm going there then.

You're not eating the sandwich you heated.

532
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:35,350
Let me ask you. When Duoduo has a fight with you, how does she punish you?

533
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,870
I can't tell you that.

Why not?

535
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:42,610
Why would I embarrass myself?
