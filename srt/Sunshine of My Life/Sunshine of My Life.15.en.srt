[Episode 15]

3
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,610
I can't walk anymore. Why were stairs designed for your home? What were they thinking?

4
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,150
Okay. We're here.

5
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,600
Wait a second.

6
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,540
Here. It's low-fat. To replenish your strength.

7
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,440
Go watch TV in the living room. I will make you something to eat.

8
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,450
What is this?

9
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,910
Warm chicken salad with quinoa and pumpkin.

10
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,260
Such a big plate? Won't I gain 5kg after eating this?

11
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,210
I made this for you. How could it possibly make you fat? Let me tell you.

12
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,530
This entire plate of quinoa is only 172 calories.

13
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,150
Chicken breast is 130 calories. Even if you eat this entire plate,

14
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:02,460
it's only about the same calories as 1/3 plate of spaghetti.

15
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,000
Is it good?

16
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,390
It's delicious, delicious!

17
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,810
But are you sure you can't get fat from eating such a big plate?

18
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,420
You won't.

19
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,820
Let me tell you! You can't fast to lose weight. That's not healthy.

20
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,060
The pumpkin is really tasty.

21
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,530
If you want to lose weight,

22
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,250
you must have a reasonable diet and exercise.

23
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,680
Got it.

24
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,580
How is your older sister?

25
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,070
Did she get fatter while she is in Paris?

26
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,750
Her get fat?

27
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,190
She's the type of person who doesn't eat when she works.

28
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,800
I'm worried that she will lose weight from starving herself.

29
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,650
Did she mention my cousin to you?

30
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,720
Did they meet?

31
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,180
I'm not too sure about that.

32
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,140
I have been quite busy lately so I have not called her.

33
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,590
How can you be like that?

34
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,960
She is your older sister! Are you not concerned about her at all?

35
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,340
Hey! Who's the one who caused me to be busy?

36
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,240
I have to train with you and cook for you!

37
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,400
Let me call for you then!

38
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,410
- Right now?
- Yes.

39
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,880
I wonder what your sister is doing right now.

40
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,940
Let's surprise her.

41
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,090
Hi.

42
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,290
Hello, Sister Mo Fei.

43
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,610
Are you working right now?

44
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,900
Yes, I'm working right now.

45
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,430
Say, what are you two eating?

46
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,210
Today, Mo Fan made me a super delicious

47
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,510
warm chicken salad with quinoa and pumpkin.

48
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,550
When did Mo Fan become so "warm" (considerate)?

49
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,070
Usually, I had to put a knife to his neck to get him to cook for me.

50
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,140
You should consider the consequences before you speak. It's not like you won't come back.

51
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,610
Hey, Sister Mo Fei.

52
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,480
Working there,

53
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,940
do you get to meet extremely handsome French men frequently?

54
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,680
I'm so busy here that I get dizzy and blurry-eyed.

55
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,730
I can't even tell the difference between men and women. How am I to check out handsome men?

56
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,050
By the way, my cousin also went to France.

57
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,560
Did he go see you?

58
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,940
That expression seems to mean you saw him.

59
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,290
What did he say to you?

60
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,750
Hello?

61
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,620
Hello, hello, hello? Hello?

62
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,610
Hello, hello, hello? Hello?

63
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,570
S-Say,

64
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,890
the signal seems

65
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,010
to be horrible. I didn't hear

66
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,460
anything you said just now.

67
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,640
Sister Mo Fei, I said—

68
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,840
Sister, stop that. Your signal is great. I can even see the cook walking past you.

69
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,870
Mo Fan, I am still going back. You watch what you say!

70
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,850
I have to get back to work. I can't talk to you two anymore.

71
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,190
You two take care of yourselves. Bye-bye!

72
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:48,030
How can she hang up just like that? I didn't get my answer. Did they see each other or not?

73
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,240
I'm so curious!

74
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,560
- Bye.
- Bye.

75
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,510
Miss Mo!

76
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,560
Why are you here?

77
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,030
Originally, we were on our way to the airport

78
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:27,330
but Brother Xuan said he wanted to see you.

79
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,370
Brother Xuan, I'll be in the car.

80
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,500
I want to have a chat with you.

81
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,080
I'm going back to China soon.

82
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,930
But I'm still a bit worried about you.

83
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,530
Do you know that Fang Xiaoyu moved in next door to you?

84
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,080
I know.

85
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,520
What's the matter?

86
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,120
He's not as simple as you think.

87
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,360
So you especially came here to tell me that?

88
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,810
Yes.

89
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,450
Thank you for your concern.

90
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,520
As for what type of relationship I have with him,

91
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,930
in my heart,

92
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,140
I am very aware of it.

93
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,610
You don't need to worry.

94
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,800
Then... you've said what you wanted to.

95
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,690
Be safe on the way there. Have a safe trip.

96
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,750
Wait.

97
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,870
Do you like him?

98
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,940
President Tang, who are you to ask me?

99
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,400
Who am I?

100
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,980
In your heart, you think I like Xueling.

101
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,390
Right?

102
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:14,040
- Isn't that true?
- It's been a knot in your heart this whole time,

103
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,900
so today I'm going to make it clear to you.

104
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,400
We grew up together.

105
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,220
She is my good friend and at work

106
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,800
she is my good partner. That's it.

107
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,370
If you sincerely believe what I say,

108
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:34,490
don't listen to anything that the people around you say.

109
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,230
Their thoughts do not represent me.

110
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,480
Understand?

111
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,680
I also want to tell you...

112
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,300
I like you.

113
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,740

I'll come back to visit you.

121
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,010
Wait for me.

122
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,530
Brother Xuan, we're going to go now.

123

This is so romantic.

143
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:34,560
Mo Fei, you're back.

144
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,520
Yes. You haven't gone to bed yet?

145
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,330
I'd like to ask, what are these lights for?

146
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,130
Mo Fe, don't you know?

147
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,100
Your boyfriend prepared these.

148
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,870
My boyfriend?

149
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,440
Yes!

150
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,220
It's that tall and handsome Chinese man.

151
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,700
The one who was hurt when he protected you.

152
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,250
He told me it's dangerous when it's too dark at night,

153
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,280
so he prepared all this for you.

154
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,040
Tang Mingxuan...

155
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,050
What else did he say?

156
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,960
He left you this letter.

157
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:15,610
He already paid for

158
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,750
the electricity bill.

159
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,730
Mo Fei, just enjoy this lovely surprise.

160
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,940
♫ Watch until we're old with white hair ♫

161
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,030
♫ still holding hands ♫

162
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:35,400
I can't guarantee that every day you are in Paris will be sunny,

163
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
but I hope these lights

164
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,830
can light up your nights.
 [Tang Mingxuan]

165
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,670
Turns out he likes me.

166
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:52,150
♫ There are many love songs ♫

167
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,570
♫ but I sing this song ♫

168
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:59,830
♫ only for you ♫

169
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:08,290
♫ Falling, falling, falling for you. Falling, falling, falling for you ♫

170
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,940
♫ Perfect love song ♫

171
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,440
I like you.

172
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:22,760
♫ Falling, falling, falling for you. Falling, falling, falling for you ♫

173
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:27,260
♫ Perfect love song ♫

174
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,670
I feel like I'm dreaming.

175
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:49,270
♫ I want to take you to outer space ♫

176
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:54,660
♫ until our breathing stops ♫

177
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:59,280
♫ Yet our hearts are still beating ♫

178
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:06,360
♫ There're many love songs ♫

179
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,430
♫ but I sing this song only for you ♫

180
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,610
Hello, everyone.

181
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,280
Lately, I haven't been online.

182
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,570
The reason is I was very busy with school.

183
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:23,560
Another reason is I haven't been in a good mood.

184
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,360
When I first arrived in France,

185
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,910
I tried to forget someone.

186
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,240
I tried to let go of a relationship.

187
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,490
Because I kept thinking that he was the little prince,

188
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:42,080
who will return to his own planet one day.

189
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,510
I didn't want to become a pitiful fox

190
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,630
who quietly stayed in place, waiting for him.

191
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,740
But something happened today

192
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,160
and I suddenly realized

193
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,320
that it doesn't seem to be the case.

194
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:02,600
He didn't leave me.

195
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,360
Instead, he tried to get close to me.

196
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,840
He listens to my heartfelt thoughts

197
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,310
and cares about what I think.

198
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:18,890
After a long time, I realized that it wasn't one-sided.

199
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:23,950
Turns out the person I like

200
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,170
also likes me.

201
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:32,030
Since you've lit up my night,

202
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,050
then from now on,

203
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,050
let me protect your dreams.

204
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:40,430
Why did you suddenly come back?

205
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,930
Why are you smiling?

206
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,240
You're blushing.

207
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:49,490
Oh, you remembered to help get the lipstick.

208
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,820
This is not the one! Didn't I tell you the color number?

209
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,550
If it's not the right one, then you go buy yourself the right one.

210
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:59,560
Wait. Cousin, did you see Sister Mo Fei?

211
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:04,000
Cousin! Did you see her?

212
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,010
Mo Fei, who are you making clothes for?

213
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:22,310
The school has requested that we each make an outfit to submit.

214
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,510
I plan to make a Chinese outfit.

215
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,250
Chinese outfit?

216
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,170
It means an outfit with Chinese elements.

217
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,820
When I applied to schools two years ago,

218
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,100
I used only western-styled tailoring.

219
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,720
This year, I've changed my thinking.

220
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,300
I'm using Chinese Style elements.

221
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,370
Can you guess the result? I'm standing here now.

222
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,300
So I think André will definitely like this, too.

223
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:51,050
Are you planning to use the fabric President Tang gifted you to make this outfit?

224
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,760
What are you thinking?

225
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,120
Do you like President Tang?

226
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,690
President Tang is deep and reserved.

227
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:09,400
The way he looks so reserved is cool and handsome.

228
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,610
As for Fang Xiaoyu, even though he looks a little unreliable,

229
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:17,260
he is funny and has a dashing appearance.

230
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,400
It's not easy to choose.

231
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,390
- Mo Fei.
- Yes?
- I'm talking to you.

232
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:28,210
I think the weather is great today. Why don't we go out?

233
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,610
Don't change the subject.

234
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,030
I'm still waiting for you to answer my question.

235
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,420
Falling in love isn't the same as shopping in the grocery store

236
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,610
where you can buy whatever you want.

237
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,730
But it's Tang Mingxuan and Fang Xiaoyu.

238
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,990
Two outstanding people.

239
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,600
You won't be wrong even if you close your eyes to choose.

240
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,870
I think...

241
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,090
You must have chosen President Tang, right?

242
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,370
You are going to use the fabric that he gave.

243
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:02,460
You like Tang Mingxuan!

244
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,730
Duoduo, this outfit is made according to your measurements.

245
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:10,690
Once I've submitted it and get it back, I'll give it to you.

246
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,450
Mo Fei,

247
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,200
why do you treat me so well?

248
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,240
- Because you treat me well, too.
- Really?

249
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,460
But tonight I have to work late so I can't make dinner.

250
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,030
How about... you go out to buy us something to eat?

251
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,720
- I'll take care of dinner tonight.
- Okay.

252
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,020
- What do you want?
- Anything is fine.

253
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,800
- All right. Wait for me then.
- Okay.

254
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,810
[Tang Mingxuan: I'm home. Do you miss me?]

255
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:11,120
[Mo Fei: Do you know where the coldest place in the world is?]

256
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,650
[Tnag Mingxuan: Yes. Oymyakon.]

257
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:19,580
[Mo Fei: Wrong!]

258
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:26,780
[Tang Mingxuan: Impossible. Then you tell me, where?]

259
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,370
[Mo Fei: It should be the place without you.]

260
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,600
You're so happy. I reserved a bike for you.

261
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,530
Thank you.

262
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,750
I have a design question to ask you.

263
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,040
But I have to go to work now, or else I'll be late.

264
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,380
Then let's talk on the way there.

265
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,320
I actually don't feel like hearing it.

266
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,540
You don't want to hear me talk?

267
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,480
- You want to hear Tang Mingxuan talk?
- Yes.

268
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,450
Do you like him?

269
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,590
Yes, I like him.

270
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:19,540
But, say, aren't you too concerned with my life?

271
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,680
I just want to remind you,

272
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,530
he's not as simple as you think.

273
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,800
Goodbye.

274
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:34,500
Weren't you quite happy earlier?

275
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:40,010
Sister Xueling, why do you have time to meet me for drinks today?

276
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,760
Aren't you really busy?

277
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,010
I have something for you.

278
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,190
Here.

279
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,650
How did you know I wanted this lipstick?

280
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:54,650
I asked my cousin to buy it for me but he ended up getting me the wrong one.

281
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,130
Did he tell you?

282
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,690
He hasn't come by the company yet. I haven't seen him.

283
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:02,020
But I guessed he would get you the wrong one.

284
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,340
Sister Xueling, you're amazing. Impressive.

285
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,680
- Has your cousin gone out?
- No.

286
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,890
He is at home. He said he's jet lagged.

287
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:14,890
He had Yang Guang bring everything home. He's working from home.

288
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,640
Before he really hated working from home.

289
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,920
I don't know what's happened recently.

290
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,280
I thought he wasn't feeling well.

291
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,320
I don't know what he was busy with in France.

292
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,280
He even brought back the wrong lipstick.

293
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,200
I'm guessing he was busy dating some pretty French girls.

294
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,170
How is that possible? Who would like my cousin?

295
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,400
Previously, wasn't there a designer in the competition who also went to Paris?

296
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,260
Sister Mo Fei?

297
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,850
France is a huge place.

298
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,260
Besides,

299
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,410
if my cousin went to Paris,

300
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:58,640
he may not necessarily have gone to see Sister Mo Fei.

301
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,370
Besides, when I called Sister Mo Fei, she said she didn't have time to see my cousin...

302
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,410
Sister Xueling, you're overthinking.

303
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:14,320
My cousin... he is not very normal.

304
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:17,970
I mean abnormality is his normal.

305
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:22,420
Since I was little, I never thought he was normal.

306
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:27,090
Same here.

307
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,650
My lunch break is about over. I need to go back to the office.

308
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:36,010
Okay, Sister Xueling, go ahead. Bye-bye.

309
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,730
Thank you. Love you.

310
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,320
Why are you being so polite with me? I'm heading out.

311
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,980
Bye-bye.

312
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,750
I probably said the wrong thing. What should I do?

313
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,050
- Brother Xuan.
- Yes.

314
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:05,860
This is the email from SLC. Take a look.

315
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,450
Miya wants to see me the day after tomorrow.

316
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,840
Really?

317
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,420
This is great! I'm going to book you a plane ticket now.

318
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:22,140
Wait. Leave tomorrow afternoon open.

319
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,880
Go see Master Li with Xueling.

320
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,750
Are you not going? Let me tell you. If that Lu Jun

321
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:32,290
acts up, only you can handle him.

322
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,950
Let's do this then.

323
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,510
After Xueling finishes her meeting tomorrow morning,

324
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,550
we'll all go together.

325
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,010
All right. Then I'll...

326
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,870
Go home and rest.

327
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:47,970
There is still a pile of paperwork to deal with.

328
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:50,060
Do you not like getting off work early?

329
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,150
I like it. I like it. Then you should rest early. I'll be leaving now.

330
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,430
- Okay. Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

331

[Tang Mingxuan: I'm going to Paris the day after tomorrow.]

332
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,600
[Mo Fei: There's no rain in Paris the day after tomorrow.]

333
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,450
♫ That day, you said some words ♫

334
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:36,410
♫ Her smile ♫

335
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,490
♫ is like the glow in the sky during sunset ♫

336
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,940
I'm sending this voice message

337
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,290
to that person who can't sleep.

338
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:48,720
I want to tell you about what happened at work today.

339
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,550
When I was working today, I met an old couple.

340
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,030
They were about 70 to 80 years old.

341
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:58,290
Sitting there, they looked especially affectionate.

342
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,790
Looking at them, I started to think...

343
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:03,380
Where will I be when I'm 70 or 80 years old?

344
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,710
Who will I be with?

345
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,480
Have you thought about us?

346
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:14,760
♫ Your smile ♫

347
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,900
♫ is branded on my heart ♫

348
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:26,370
♫ Make a wish that you'll love me a long time ♫

349
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,920
By the way, Mingxuan,

350
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:33,310
this is the venue contract for the press conference for our latest release. Take a look.

351
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,090
I'll take a closer look later.

352
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:39,120
Xueling,

353
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,490
there's something I want to have a good chat about.

354
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,250
So you didn't see Miya when you went to Paris this time?

355
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:56,040
Miya sent me an email last night.

356
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,810
She hopes that I go there to talk in person.

357
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,220
That's good.

358
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,720
Mingxuan, I sincerely hope that you can get the SLC project.

359
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,260
Then I won't need to go home and hear my dad's sarcastic remarks.

360
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,550
You don't even know but because I support you going to Paris,

361
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:15,410
he's been mad at me for several days.

362
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:18,410
He even said he raised me as his daughter in vain.

363
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,750
Master Li.

364
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:32,190
Don't be anxious. What exactly has happened? Tell me slowly.

365
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:44,810
[Mingyuan Fashion Group]

366
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,140
The new embroidery workshop isn't equipped with a security surveillance system yet.

367
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,460
So we've got nothing.

368
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,660
Master Li, just let us clean up.

369
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,660
You go rest for a bit.

370
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,550
Such wickedness.

371
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:19,340
These were all embroidered stitch by stitch, thread by thread.

372
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,370
It's all painstaking work.

373
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:26,490
It's all ruined.

374
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:35,170
What do we do now, President Tang?

375
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:43,020
Xueling, take Master Li to get some rest first.

376
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,900
Boss, I just heard the embroiderer say

377
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,260
that Lu Jun came by a few days ago.

378
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:18,420
Aunt, here, drink some water.

379
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,950
You... Why are you looking at me in that way?

380
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,200
I heard that you came by the embroidery workshop a couple of days ago.

381
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,430
Yes! I came to see my aunt. So what?

382
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,990
Nothing much. Just asking.

383
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,190
You... Are you suspecting that I did it?

384
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,030
How could I have possibly done this?

385
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:49,260
What would I gain?

386
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,520
Lu Jun, let me tell you.

387
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,130
This new embroidery workshop has nothing to do with you at all.

388
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,460
If you don't accept that,

389
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,440
you can sue me.

390
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:06,320
I am my aunt's biological nephew. Why can't I?

391
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,370
Lu Jun, stop shouting about here!

392
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,890
The noise gives me a headache.

393
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:15,080
No, Aunt, they are falsely accusing me. They are smearing my name.

394
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,540
Go home first. I'll call you if I need you.

395
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:32,000
President Tang, what do you think we should do?

396
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,720
Before the outfit release press conference, these embroidery pieces

397
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,040
surely cannot be mended.

398
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,540
Let’s adjust the design. Is there any way?

399
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,830
I'll have to go back and look at the designs.

400
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:49,360
But the outfit release press conference's main theme is Su Embroidery artistry.

401
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,080
The design was made around Su Embroidery.

402
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,130
It'll be difficult to make changes.

403
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,870
Do you want me to contact the other embroidery workshops?

404
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,830
It's difficult, but it doesn't mean it's impossible.

405
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,760
Let's head back and try it immediately.

406
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,560
Brother Xuan!

407
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,250
You little brat. Every day, you...

408
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,740
What is it? Did something happen again?

409
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:32,590
No. SLC's Miya...

410
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,440
sent another email.

411
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,140
Didn't we already agree to meet tomorrow night?

412
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,530
My guess is that we won't be able to go this time.

413
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,520
She said that she doesn't want to see us for now.

414
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,100
She also said to meet another time.

415
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,420
"Next time" again?

416
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:53,350
I know. They keep changing the time again and again.

417
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,720
They are too much.

418
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,830
We should still go take a look.

419
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,460
All right. I'll go make the preparations.

420
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,860
- Yang Guang.
- Yes.

421
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:09,170
Forget it. Just cancel it.

422
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:20,200
Xueling, do you have any progress in your love life?

423
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,830
What love life do I have?

424
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:27,400
You are getting older now.

425
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,840
You should get a boyfriend.

426
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:39,000
Mingxuan, all these years, I've tried so hard.

427
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,140
Who is it that I'm doing all these for? Aren't you aware?

428
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:51,140
Ever since we were young, you have been the only person I care about.

429
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,940
Saying all this to me now,

430
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,710
it's because of Mo Fei. Right?

431
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,910
Have you really considered my feelings?

432
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,680
Since you mentioned Mo Fei,

433
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,840
there's something I've been wanting to ask you.

434
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,880
Before I went to France,

435
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,360
did you say something to Mo Fei?

436
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,920
Are you questioning me right now?

437
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,460
Do you think I am?

438
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,320
Let's eat.

439
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,720
Hello.

440
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,290
This is Xia Xueling.

441
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:52,120
Sorry to bother you.

442
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,400
It's fine. Why have you called me?

443
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,560
Are you doing well in school there?

444
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,500
It's going quite well. Thank you for asking, Director Xia.

445
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,970
On Mingxuan's trip to France this time,

446
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:15,240
he went to see you. Right?

447
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:19,510
What are you trying to say?

448
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:22,130
Since you are an intelligent person,

449
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:24,600
then I'll be frank.

450
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,160
Mo Fei, I know...

451
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,810
you have some thoughts towards Mingxuan.

452
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:35,240
But I'm telling you,

453
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,420
please use your thoughts

454
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:40,120
on other men.

455
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,430
What are you trying to convey here?

456
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:52,050
Mo Fei, I studied oil painting for four years

457
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:54,520
at the Academy of Fine Arts in Brera, Milan.

458
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,880
In order to help Mingxuan,

459
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,850
I gave up my dream of being a painter,

460
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:04,620
and went to study fashion design as well business management instead.

461
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,130
During my years in Mingyuan,

462
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:10,320
my relationship with Mingxuan

463
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,590
was obvious to everyone.

464
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:16,470
Do not think that your presence can destroy this relationship.

465
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:22,730
What you've sacrificed and done for him has nothing to do with me, so you don't have to tell me.

466
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:25,910
I would also like to say that Mingxuan is an adult.

467
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:28,020
When it comes to his decisions,

468
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,320
neither of us can influence him.

469
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,660
It seems that I've really underestimated you.

470
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,730
I didn't expect you to be so scheming.

471
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:40,540
I can't compete with you when it comes to scheming.

472
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,100
The day the banquet ended,

473
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,720
you deliberately took a detour to take me to Tang's house.

474
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,250
Wasn't it to tell me to back off

475
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,780
and to voluntarily give up?

476
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:54,340
Director Xia, aren't you tired?

477
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,850
You are thinking of everything too simply.

478
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:59,000
Do you think that love is enough?

479
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,960
Do you actually believe that you and Mingxuan can be together?

480
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,690
Otherwise?

481
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,690
Be like you?

482
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,650
You should know that,

483
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,600
"You can lead a horse to water but you cannot force it to drink," right?

484
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,110
I want to ask you, Mo Fei,

485
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:14,210
what else can you offer Mingxuan besides love?

486
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,730
Can you help Mingxuan with his career?

487
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:20,240
You can't. Only I can.

488
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,080
Don't ruin Mingxuan and Mingyuan

489
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,790
with your momentary stupidity!

490
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:26,480
Director Xia, you think too highly of me.

491
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,480
I am a mere international student.

492
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,840
I'm not capable of ruining Mingxuan nor Mingyuan.

493
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,540
Fine, if you can really remain in your proper place,

494
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,910
then I'd like to thank you.

495
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:46,000
If I were you, I wouldn't even have made this call.

496
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,910
Because those with enough confidence

497
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:51,600
don't need to bluff at all.

498
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:59,120
What kind of person is this?

499
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:18,300
It's already this time.

500
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,730
He must be asleep.

501
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,960
What are you doing here?

502
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,440
What's the matter? Are you in a bad mood?

503
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,100
No. It's late now. Why are you here?

504
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,560
I'm here to eat. Isn't this a restaurant?

505
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,860
Here's the menu. Order whatever

506
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,660
you want, but hurry, we're closing soon.

507
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:43,360
What's the matter? Are you mad at me?

508
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,220
Can we not even be friends?

509
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,320
If that's what you think, then I'll leave immediately.

510
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,300
No. I'm just a little tired.

511
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,340
As long as you're not mad at me, that's fine.

512
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,790
What's the matter with you? You look so listless,

513
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,450
like a frosted eggplant.

514
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:58,950
Tell me what you want to eat.

515
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,330
Wouldn't it be nice if you chose me?

516
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:15,610
I would have taken you all over Paris right now.

517
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:20,360
[Chez M. Huang Chinese Restaurant]

518
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:38,190
Why are you still here?

519
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:41,290
I need to go home, too. Let's go together.

520
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:42,920
Let's go.

521
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:53,880
So you're really not going to tell me what happened?

522
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,800
You two aren't fighting, are you?

523
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,790
Did you discover his true colors?

524
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:07,650
Last time, you told me...

525
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:10,600
that he's not simple. What...

526
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,680
Objectively speaking,

527
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,460
he is hard-working and can work under pressure.

528
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:23,160
He is relatively successful in his career and can be seen as young and promising.

529
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:28,040
I didn't expect you to say that about him. I thought…

530
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,410
Did you think I would talk badly about him behind his back?

531
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:33,490
You think too little of me.

532
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:35,930
No, I'm the "little" (evil) person.

533
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:38,150
You are a man of honor.

534
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,320
But then again, Mo Fei,

535
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,720
if you really like him,

536
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,730
you have to have a great ability to deal with a lot of pressure.

537
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:49,340
Last time I said he's not simple.

538
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,000
I didn't mean anything else.

539
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,320
I just wanted to remind you that he has a Xia Xueling by his side.
