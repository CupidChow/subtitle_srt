[Episode 33]

3
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,490
I like this game so much. Since I was young,

4
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:40,090
I would excel at any game very quickly.

5
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,800
I become obsessed. Of course,

6
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,050
I cannot compare to your father.

7
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,320
Your father is the leading figure in the gaming world.

8
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,030
We are still primary students.

9
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,980
I was thinking,
[Bai Xiaoman]

10
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,880
I still have much to learn from your father.

11
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,800
Your phone.

12
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,770
It's all right.

13
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,450
By the way, I was thinking that if there's a chance,

14
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,370
I could visit your father myself

15
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,720
to chat, discuss and learn. I wonder...

16
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,990
Actually, I admire you quite a bit.

17
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,590
- In front of my father, I said many good things about you.
- Oh, really?

18
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,240
So he's really interested in your project now.

19
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,250
Miss Qu,

20
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,850
thank you so much then.

21
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,820
- I-I must—
- Aren't you going to answer your phone?

22
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,040
It's all right, it's all right. They are misdialing.

23
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,440
It's Miss Bai, right?

24
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,050
Yes, but it's nothing serious. Cheers.

25
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,120
For our cooperation.

26
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,640
I heard that you and Miss Bai are engaged.

27
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,810
Congratulations.

28
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,380
No, that, that... Our engagement

29
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,320
was recklessly done. She was pressuring me to...

30
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,800
- I was just humoring her.
- Whom were you humoring?

31
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,170
W-Why are you here?

32
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,910
I was wondering why you wouldn't answer my calls. It turns out you are here!

33
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,380
- Who is this?
- This is...

34
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,120
You are Miss Bai, right?

35
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,720
- Hello.
- Stop trying to get on my good side.

36
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,080
It just so happens that I was passing by...

37
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,360
If not, I would have missed a great show.

38
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,840
Continue to act.

39
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,900
Have you gone mad?!

40
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,860
Be more respectful!

41
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,880
This-This Miss Qu is the financial advisor of the gaming investment company.

42
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,850
We are talking about business, honestly and openly.

43
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,460
Honestly and openly?

44
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,970
Then, why didn't you answer my call?!

45
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,050
Coming to this kind of place to have a meeting

46
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,120
with a financial advisor?

47
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,340
- Are you kidding me?
- What do you mean by "this kind of place"? Isn't this just a KTV place?

48
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,240
I-It's just more relaxed and less serious for us this way.

49
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,880
President Zhu,

50
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,560
since there is something going on for you today, we can talk another day.

51
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,580
- Wait, Miss Qu—
- Come back!

52
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,760
What do you want to do?!

53
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,250
Zhu Haitian, is any cat or dog more important than me now?

54
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,410
To think I worked overtime at Haiyao until now.

55
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,220
Fine, I won't care about Haiyao's matters from now on!

56
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,880
Bai Xiaoman!

57
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,370
Xiaoman, wait! Listen to me!

58
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,450
You really misunderstood me this time.

59
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,610
Miss Qu and I were talking about business.

60
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,520
Her dad's company wants to invest in us.

61
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,410
Isn't that a good thing?

62
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,770
Then, why didn't you answer my call?

63
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:20,370
Tell me. Every day I work from dawn to dusk. For whom?

64
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,260
Isn't' for you? For Haiyao?

65
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,440
You, on the other hand, are enjoying yourself with other women.

66
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,250
Do you have a conscience?

67
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,450
What do you mean by "enjoying myself with other women"?

68
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,310
I know you've been really tired and have been working hard lately.

69
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,890
You're a great contributor to Haiyao now so you have the capital

70
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:41,480
that allows you to complain and throw small tantrums.

71
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,260
However, you can't slander me and my principles.

72
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,640
Of course, I was wrong. That place was too noisy so I didn't hear.

73
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,950
Or else, there's no way I wouldn't answer your call.

74
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,580
I promise it won't ever happen again. Okay?

75
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,280
- Forgive me.
- For real?

76
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,230
Then swear.

77
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,760
Do I even have to swear? That's too cruel, isn't it?

78
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,130
How about... I pay a fine?

79
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,050
Sure.

80
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,280
- How much are you paying?
- Look at your money-mad expression.

81
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,330
Mo Fei, how is it going on your end?

82
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,450
Not very smoothly. After coming back and investigating,

83
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,380
I realized that handmade ramie is really hard to find.

84
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,130
Nowadays, it is all manufactured by machines.

85
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,300
What's the difference between having it manufactured by machines?

86
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,540
If you don't look closely,

87
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:34,230
you can't tell the difference. But if you look closely, the difference is pretty big.

88
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,900
Then what should we do?

89
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,970
What else can we do? "The revolution has not yet succeeded,

90
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,480
comrades still need to take an effort to find ramie.

91
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,380
Then look for it well.

92
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,600
Hurry and come back.

93
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,210
Once this show is over, I'll return.

94
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,550
Wait a second.

95
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,800
[Tang Mingxuan]

96
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,040
Seeing that expression of yours, it must be your President Tang calling.

97
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,420
Okay, okay! Hurry and go.

98
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,190
Next time, you have to show me your brother.

99
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,120
Sure, bye-bye.

100
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,720
Hello, Mingxuan.

101
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,490
Baby, come downstairs.

102
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,980
Why are you in such a rush for? It's not like I'll disappear.

103
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,240
Because I want to see you a second sooner.

104
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,250
Then I must come even earlier next time.

105
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,160
- Did you come from the company?
- Yes.

106
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,920
Then why did you come this late? I'd rather you sleep more at the company.

107
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,880
But if I don't come here, I can't sleep even more.

108
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,760
If I can't see you, I can't sleep.

109
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,810
Oh, right.

110
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,440
Recently, why haven't you

111
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,990
uploaded your broadcast for me to listen to?

112
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:07,750
You also know that I have been busy with the fashion show.

113
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,800
So hard working.

114
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,630

00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,950
Say, now that you've seen me,

118
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,780
can you fall asleep?

119
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,660
But I'm really hungry right now.

- Yes.

Don't be like this, Mo Fan is at home.

So what if Mo Fan is home?

138
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,400
He is already an adult. What does he not understand?

It is so late.

148
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,230
After I finished eating dinner,

149
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,210
I had nothing to do, so I came to spend time with you.

150
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,940
What book are you reading?

151
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,140
Before, Brother Mingxuan and Sister Xueling came.

152
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,050
This is the book Brother Mingxuan gifted me.

153
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,710
Tell me about it.

154
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,310
In the past, everyone was fine.

155
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,400
I can't believe everyone has come to this.

156
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:17,050
In the past, we all thought too much.

157
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,380
When it comes to Brother Mingxuan and me,

158
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,200
I have the freedom to like him

159
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,480
and he has the freedom to reject me.

160
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,230
However, we thought

161
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,000
I would get the person I loved,

162
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,700
your daughter would get what she wanted, and a strong alliance between the two families.

163
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,440
These were all emotional blackmail toward him.

164
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,730
We had never thought about it from his perspective nor considered his wishes.

165
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,330
If one day,

166
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,010
we really got married, would we be happy?

167
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,000
Good, good.

168
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,960
Qian Qian,

169
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,370
you have grown up.

170
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,780
I feel that you have grown up.

171
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:15,360
Dad, I want the past to truly be in the past

172
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,170
and start my new life.

173
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,450
Fighting.

174
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,680
Eat slowly.

175
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,710
It's delicious. The noodles are not cooked all the way.

176
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,290
Really?

177
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:35,100
T-Then don't eat it. I'll cook it for a bit longer.

178
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,880
Why are you still eating so much then?

179
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,740
It's because you made this bowl of noodles for me with love.

180
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,390
You didn't eat dinner, right? You're eating so much.

181
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,260
I ate a lot for dinner.

182
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,370
But who told you to make such delicious noodles?

183
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,410
I can't control myself.

184
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:59,820
Say, can you promise me something?

185
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,510
You have to eat well, rest well, and take care of yourself well.

186
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:09,510
You have to be healthy. I want to be with you for a very, very long time.

187
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,560
You want to be with me for a very, very long time?

188
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,440
Then, can you not let me work so tirelessly?

189
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,930
When did I make you work tirelessly?

190
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,650
You don't want me to work so tirelessly, right?

191
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:35,500
- How have I made you work tirelessly?
- I'm not going to do anything now that I've finished the noodles.

192
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,620
- I'm going to sleep.
- Sleep?

193
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,560
Do you want to go back to sleep?

194
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:49,070
Why would I want to go back to sleep? I want to sleep here with you.

195
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:53,950
Do you remember why you went to Paris to find me

196
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,990
the first time?

197
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,830
Back then, we argued.

198
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:08,660
Then you disappeared on me, hiding from me.

199
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,230
Right?

200
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,830
This is the first time I realized that you, President Tang, like to bear grudges.

201
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:26,470
I am not bearing grudges. It's that I want to clearly remember everything

202
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,860
that we've gone through together.

203
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,460
Really?

204
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,700
What do you have planned for this Saturday?

205
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,460
Think carefully.

206
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,710
Saturday...

207
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,340
Work.

208
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:02,860
Work, work, work again. All you know is work.

209
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,100
What special day is on Saturday?

210
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,620
First off, Saturday is not your birthday.

211
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,150
It is also not mine.

212
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,390
Saturday isn't Valentine's Day.

213
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,960
It also isn't Chinese Valentine's Day.

214
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,980
I knew it. Men are all big liars.

215
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,740
Just now you said you remember all the details regarding us.

216
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,960
What do you remember?

217
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,180
I have only you in my heart.

218
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,140
Have you only forgotten about me? Or have you forgotten about everything?

219
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,180
Big liar.

220
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,140
Big liar fell asleep.

221
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,460
Holding you as I sleep.

222
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:18,910
- Hello, excuse me. I want an order of tiramisu.
- All right.

223
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:22,260
- Also, a cup of hot chocolate, thank you.
- All right.

224
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,610
- Jiaxi.
- Xiaoman.

225
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:27,390
- Have you waited a long time?
- No, I also just got here.

226
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:30,800
By the way, why do you need to see me this early in the morning?

227
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,570
Nothing much. I just wanted to chat with you.

228
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,980
What's wrong? Your face is sallow. Did you not rest well?

229
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,480
Don't mention it.

230
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,530
Didn't I just decide on the model? I have been so busy.

231
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,640
I don't know how Xia Xueling does it.

232
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,170
She doesn't eat, drink, nor get off work.

233
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,760
We underlings can only follow suit. We don't dare leave.

234
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,340
- You've already decided?
- Yes.

235
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,240
By the way, that day when you called me

236
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,430
about something regarding a designer, why did you hang up halfway?

237
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:07,260
I came to talk to you today about that.

238
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,450
You also know the designers at Haiyao.

239
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:13,530
What kind of clothing can they possibly design?

240
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:16,300
Even with the concept plan you gave me,

241
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,740
they still cannot design something that satisfies me.

242
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,400
So, I want to ask you

243
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,760
if there are any good designers.

244
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,640
Recommend me some.

245
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,110
Honestly, even with the concept plan,

246
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,330
we also cannot design anything good.

247
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,900
Because every designer, when creating the concept plan,

248
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,860
looks up a great amount of information.

249
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,140
Everything is in their brains.

250
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,070
Even if what we got is the result,

251
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:45,420
but we don't have the details nor the process that went into it.

252
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,430
Even if it's a top-notch designer...

253
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,510
I understand everything you are saying.

254
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,000
I also know it is really hard.

255
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,650
So that's why I came to see you.

256
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:58,680
Jiaxi, hurry and think of something for me.

257
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,490
This...

258
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,520
How about this?

259
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,290
You personally help me. What do you think?

260
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,910
Xiaoman, it is not that I won't help you.

261
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:13,090
Mo Fei and Cheng Yang have always been in charge of this project.

262
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:15,100
Even if I don't eat, drink, or sleep

263
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,280
to help you create a concept plan and research,

264
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,930
it's still really hard for me to make what you want.

265
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,970
Then, what should I do now?

266
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,770
I have already promised big things to Zhu Haitian.

267
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,720
Are you just going to forget about it now

268
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,450
and let them laugh at me?

269
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:32,810
With the current situation, how do I compete with Mo Fei?

270
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,420
Xiaoman, how about this? Don't be anxious just yet.

271
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,230
When I get back to the company, I'll help you ask around.

272
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,930
I--

273
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,820
It's almost time for me to be at work.

274
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,460
I'm leaving now. I'll keep this in mind.

275
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,810
Then I will wait for your news. Don't forget about it.

276
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:48,900
I'm leaving.

277
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,940
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

278
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,950
Dad, Mom, morning.

279
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,160
- Morning.
- Sit here.

280
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,550
You're finally here.

281
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,650
If you didn't come, I would have gotten gastroenteritis.

282
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,420
If I don't come you get gastroenteritis... Since I came, what illness did you get?

283
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,730
It is all because of you. Isn't it because of your personal problem?

284
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:05,730
Little kid, stop minding my business. Eat your food.

285
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,670
I also want to eat well but who can endure this every day?

286
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,930
Thank you, Nanny Wu.

287
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:14,170
You only care about going on dates with Sister Mo Fei. You don't even care about me.

288
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,340
Can't you speak louder?

289
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,570
Why are you muttering?

290
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:21,180
Speak louder.

291
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,640
- Eat, Brother.
- Aren't you talking about that Mo Fei?!

292
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,840
I think it's strange. How great is Xueling?

293
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,160
Why don't you know to hold onto her?

294
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,760
Stop minding his business.

295
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,090
I am his mom. How can I not care?

296
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,460
He isn't a kid anymore. He is an adult.

297
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,550
He has the right to choose. We should respect his choices.

298
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,660
Don't leave. Look, look.

299
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,000
I said a few words and he leaves. It is like this every time.

300
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,610
Both of them ran away. All because of your nagging.

301
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:48,850
You've spoiled them.

302
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:51,850
- They can't even eat breakfast.
- You don't eat it as well.

303
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,370
Mo Fan...

304
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,910
Say, this egg is raw. How do you expect me to eat this?

305
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:15,100
- No. Did you say you wanted a soft-boiled egg? I—
- Did I? Did I say such a thing?

306
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,730
- Last time, you clearly—
- Look at the floor today. There are layers of hair. Did you sweep the floor?

307
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:21,270
- Yesterday, I—
- When I was in the bathroom earlier,

308
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,300
there's a mountain of laundry.

309
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,200
Mo Fan, even if I'm your older sister,

310
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,420
don't think I'll let you have your way.

311
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:31,040
When it's your turn, you need to clean seriously.

312
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,100
Sister, are you...

313
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,050
Is it the time of the month? Why are you in such a fury?

314
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:39,400
So what if it's that time of the month?

315
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,090
Go open the door.

316
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,580
Who is it?

317
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,620
- It's for you.
- Is it a delivery?

318
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,770
Go see for yourself.

319
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:02,100
Can't you tell me? Say, why are you such a senseless child, making your sister go over there?

320
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,930
Why are you here?

321
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:15,710
♫ Thinking of you makes my heart thump ♫

322
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:19,600
Today is the 200th day that we've been together.

323
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:24,020
I pretended not to remember before.

324
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,230
Actually, I wanted to give you a surprise today.

325
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,630
♫ Even the air becomes overly sweet ♫
- Thank you.

326
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,440
You... Wait a moment.

327
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,260
Why should I wait?

328
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,840
Just want a moment for me. Wait.

329
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,560
No. Come downstairs now. You're already very beautiful now.

330
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,140
- Wait a moment!
- Go on.

331
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,050
♫ As if I'm still dreaming of a beautiful encounter ♫

332
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:55,940
It turns out he remembers.

333
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,650
Are you still going to eat?

334
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,320
No, no. You go ahead and eat.

335
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:06,310
♫ Slowly, slowly hold hands ♫

336
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,790
When did you notice you couldn't see clearly?

337
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,870
It's been over a week now.

338
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,200
Dr. Xiao,

339
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,930
my daughter's eyesight, is it temporary or

340
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:25,300
will it be like this from now on?

341
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,170
Mr. Fang...

342
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,750
I'm going to go find out what's going on.

343
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,470
Don't worry.

344
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:50,150
Qian Qian, it's all my fault. It's my mistake. I didn't take good care of you.

345
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,760
It's all my fault.

346
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:59,090
Brother, you're not to blame.

347
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:01,300
Don't blame yourself.

348
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,180
I'm going to go find out more about

349
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,430
your condition. Be good and wait for me here, okay?

350
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:24,180
Fang Qian's brain tumor is continuing to grow in size.

351
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:28,010
It's compressing on the optical nerve which is why her eyesight is affected.

352
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,550
Furthermore, the tumor is continuously growing.

353
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:34,030
If we don't do the surgery soon, there is a possibility she will be blind.

354
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:37,410
In addition, other functions may be affected.

355
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,850
However, the most important thing right now is for the patient to be calm.

356
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,200
Spend more time with her and take care of her.

357
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,560
At the same time, I hope that you, as family members, will control your own emotional states.

358
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:53,020
But we still need further examinations to get the final results.

359
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:57,010
Based on Fang Qian's condition, I suggest

360
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:59,680
we do the surgery promptly to remove the brain tumor.

361
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:04,820
Will the tumor come back after removing it?

362
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,180
There is that possibility.

363
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,480
If it comes back, do we need to have surgery again?

364
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,520
Who can handle surgery after surgery?

365
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,930
Dr. Xiao, if that's the case, then I really doubt your level of expertise.

366
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,720
Xiaoyu!

367
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,250
Mr. Fang, don't get agitated.

368
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:26,390
I can responsibly tell you that this treatment proposal is the most suitable for Fang Qian.

369
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,550
It's also the most effective.

370
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,720
Then... what's the success rate?

371
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,240
To be honest,

372
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,090
it's not much higher than the ten percent I'd previously told you.

373
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,770
Sister, are you done?

374
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,910
President Tang has been waiting for you for over an hour now.

375
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:19,510
Okay, all right, fine. Tell him to wait just a bit longer. I'll be done soon.

376
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,140
Uncle Fang,

377
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,190
I'll be there immediately.

378
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:35,020
[Tang Mingxuan: Baby, something urgent came up.]

379
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:40,850
[Tang Mingxuan: I won't be able to spend time with you today. I'm sorry.]

380
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,570
Who is it?

381
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,750
Qian Qian.

382
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:16,420
Brother Mingxuan?

383
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,510
Why are you here?

384
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,350
I just received a call from Uncle Fang

385
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,330
and I immediately came over.

386
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,490
I'm sorry.

387
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,460
You still found out about this.

388
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,910
My dad is just too anxious so he—

389
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:47,970
You're already in this condition so why are you still being so courteous with me?

390
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:51,900
Why do you always shoulder everything alone?

391
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:59,010
I just didn't want you to see

392
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:01,290
me this way.

393
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,090
If a man suddenly stands you up,

394
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,720
there's an 80 to 90 percent chance something came up.

395
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,350
I advise you

396
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,310
to thoroughly investigate.

397
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:24,470
Hey, how did you calculate the 80 to 90 percent?

398
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:29,110
I don't have any scientific basis. I just wanted you to understand the gist of it.

399
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,730
I have experience in this.

400
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:35,540
Let me tell you... Men are the most untrustworthy creatures in this world.

401
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,410
Say, did something really came up for Tang Mingxuan

402
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,570
or is he pretending something came up?

403
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:44,840
Or what exactly came up? You must really investigate it.

404
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:49,240
If this is just the start of something and he becomes nervous when you investigate it,

405
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,430
you'll be stopping what he's doing.

406
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:56,320
I say stop being so paranoid.

407
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,450
I trust him. He's not that kind of person.

408
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:03,650
- You really trust him that much?
- Yes.

409
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,380
Listen. Men are the most unworthy creatures in this world.

410
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,100
"As they eat what's in their bowl, they're thinking about what's in the pot."
 (T/N: the grass is greener on the other side)

411
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,360
Don't believe their lies.

412
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,720
Besides, lots of women like your Tang Mingxuan. You must be careful.

413
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,430
I say you're over exaggerating a bit.

414
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:25,190
Also, I asked you to meet me today to chat with me, not cause me more trouble.

415
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,160
Am I wrong?

416
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,300
If I didn't have my Cheng Yang

417
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,920
and saw a man like Tang Mingxuan,

418
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,490
I would flirt with him, too.

419
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:36,140
Say, you're exaggerating even more now.

420
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,290
I think when it comes to being in a relationship,

421
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:41,220
trusting each other is most important.

422
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,370
Plus, he's been busy recently with the Symphony of Clouds and Mists.

423
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,970
The show will happen soon.

424
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,260
There's a lot of things he needs to take care of.

425
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,290
All right, forget it.

426
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,950
I think you're already hopeless.

427
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,230
A woman in love is hot-headed.

428
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:56,440
Has love made you muddle-headed?

429
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,470
Idiot. Don't forget

430
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:02,170
how I trusted Cheng Yang before.

431
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:04,400
You saw what happened.

432
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,850
Say, I didn't ask you to meet me today to waste my exquisite makeup.

433
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:11,110
If you continue, I'll leave.

434
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:13,930
All right, fine. I won't say anymore, okay?

435
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:18,750
For the sake of your exquisite makeup, hurry and eat so I can take you shopping.

436
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:22,320
Let all the men on the streets see

437
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,090
how beautiful you are today.

438
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,950
How many times I have said it already?

439
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,740
Stop coming to see Qian Qian. Why are you here again?

440
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,510
I was worried so I came to see her.

441
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,280
You and I both know

442
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,700
that you coming to see Qian Qian

443
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,710
is to offset the guilt you are feeling. Right?

444
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,920
This is my last warning to you,

445
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,480
disappear from Qian Qian's world forever. Forever.

446
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,160
You don't have the right to ask me to do that.

447
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,530
Indeed, eating oden makes me the happiest.

448
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:29,700
That's right. It's been so long since I ate this.

449
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,900
- Isn't it delicious?
- Yes.

450
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,900
Who is it?

451
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,300
Is it Mingxuan?

452
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:43,300
Ask whether he knows that you're his girlfriend or not.

453
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,850
What exactly is he doing every day? Answer it.

454
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,500
Hello, Mingxuan.

455
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,500
I'm sorry, Baby.

456
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:56,910
Today, something urgent suddenly came up.

457
00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:01,400
I know I'm at fault. I'll apologize to you another day, okay?

458
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,180
It's fine. I trust you.

459
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,940
I'm with Duoduo.

460
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,890
It's rare for us to come out so we're strolling around.

461
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:14,020
How about this. When I get home, I'll give you a call. Okay?

462
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,350
Work hard then.

463
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,020
Bye-bye.

464
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:22,720
You're such a loser.

465
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,560
Are you forgiving him that easily?

466
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,260
I know he's very busy with work.

467
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:32,040
I don't want to cause him any trouble.

468
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,050
It's so hard to be the big boss's girlfriend.

469
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:40,630
However, you've said that to me all day now.

470
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:45,170
Were you trying to convince me or yourself?

471
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,920
Xueling.

472
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,460
Okay.

473
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,010
I'll come back now.

474
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,280
- Xueling.
- Mingxuan.

475
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,060
Why are you waiting for me here?

476
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:33,900
I want to show you something. I'm afraid it won't be appropriate to let Auntie Lu see it.

477
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:37,930
I asked my friend to find this information on the brain specialist that I told you about last time.

478
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:39,200
Have a look.

479
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,910
If necessary, I'll ask him to fly here as soon as he can

480
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,850
to treat Qian Qian.

481
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:50,210
You should give this to Xiaoyu immediately.

482
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:54,060
Besides possibly saving Qian Qian, I think this information

483
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:57,050
maybe the remedy to the relationship between you and Fang Xiaoyu.

484
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:00,940
So I think it's better you personally give this to him.

485
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,840
What is it? You look like you're in a bad mood.

486
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,450
I just came from the hospital.

487
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:15,260
Is something wrong with Qian Qian?

488
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,230
She's blind now.

489
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,210
Blind?

490
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,320
I want to go home again.

491
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,370
When you are all better,

492
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:36,670
I'll accompany you home for however long you want.

493
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,410
Okay?

494
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:44,130
I'm a bit tired.

495
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,580
All right, I'll take you back to your room.

496
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,310
Come, let's sit on the side for a while.

497
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,410
Brother, lately, I keep dreaming about things from our childhood.

498
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:25,780
We were so happy back then.

499
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:30,540
Qian Qian, you should be thinking about treating your condition.

500
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,790
Don't think of those nonsensical things.

501
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,380
Last night I dreamed of Mom.

502
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,040
Mom said she misses me.

503
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,820
She was even waving at me in the dream.

504
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:50,110
Brother, I miss her, too.

505
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:57,010
Qian Qian, I don't want you to say that.

506
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,070
Is death really that scary?

507
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:23,090
Let's not talk about this in the middle of the night, okay?

508
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:29,610
Didn't you say you still want to go back to Africa?

509
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,990
Your colleagues are still waiting for you there.

510
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:36,590
We must not go back on our word, right?

511
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,740
I still want to take you traveling the world.

512
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,930
Take you to meet many, many good men.

513
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:50,960
Meet a man who will cherish you in the palm of his hand, okay?

514
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:56,650
Brother, are you crying?

515
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,350
No.

516
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:04,040
I'm sorry. I was just randomly expressing my feelings.

517
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,760
Let's go. I'll take you back to your room.

518
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,240
Okay.

519
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,600
[Taxi]

520
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,390
Why are you here?

521
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,520
I'm not in a good mood. Can you chat with me for a while?

522
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,870
Is it because of your sister's situation?

523
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:00,260
Tell me. What's going on?

524
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:05,060
Her condition has gotten worst.

525
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,880
What did the doctor say?

526
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:12,050
She needs to have surgery.

527
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:15,040
But the risk is very high. I'm very worried.

528
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:22,690
Well, she must still have surgery so that there's at least a chance of recovery.

529
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:26,350
Say, be more optimistic.

530
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:30,350
Otherwise, she'll be unhappy to see you this way.

531
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,400
All right then. It's late.

532
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,420
Go and take care of your sister. I'm going to head home.

533
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:40,600
Mo Fei, can you... sit here with me for a little longer?

534
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:46,820
It's really late. I really must go home.

535
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,530
Do you know...

536
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:54,070
what Tang Mingxuan was doing when you were eating oden?

537
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,170
What do you mean by that?

538
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:12,240
♫ I say you're an April day ♫

539
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,250
♫ The sound of your laughter lights everything up ♫

540
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:19,790
♫ Even the spirit of a light breeze ♫

♫ The gentle breeze blown during dusk ♫

544

♫ The unintentional sparkle of the planetesimal ♫

545
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:45,040
♫ The fine rain that's sprinkled in front of the flower ♫

♫ You're the round moon every night ♫

554
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,870
♫ You're the naïve ♫

555
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:41,730
♫ white lotus that floats on the water ripples of your dream ♫

556
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:48,370
♫ You're the flower blossoms of tree after tree ♫

557
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:52,760
♫ The swallow twittering within the beams ♫

558
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:56,410
♫ You are love, hope, and warmth ♫
