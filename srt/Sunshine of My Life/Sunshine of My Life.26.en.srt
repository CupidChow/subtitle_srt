[Episode 26]

3
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,050
Our company has this rule which states that co-workers can't fall in love.

4
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,750
But Mo Fei is my girlfriend and she's not even employed at our company.

5
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,780
Is there something wrong with that? So what if she comes to the company to visit me?

6
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,800
So... you knew that she would be coming to the company.

7
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,730
What do you mean?

8
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,850
Mo Fei introduced Cheng Yang to you.

9
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:58,280
And now Cheng Yang wants to find her and have her become his assistant.

10
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,050
They all follow your instructions, then what am I supposed to do as a Design Director?

11
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,140
Wait a second!

12
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,160
Did you just say that

13
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,140
Cheng Yang asked Mo Fei to be his assistant in our company?

14
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,560
You didn't know about it?

15
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,790
I just found out after you told me.

16
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,440
Get in!

17
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,990
What's the matter with you?

18
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:07,300
I've come back. You're not happy about it?

19
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,600
Cheng Yang asked you to be his assistant.

20
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,140
Why didn't you tell me?

21
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,610
I thought it would be good

22
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,390
if we work in the same company, right? Don't you think so?

23
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,170
But you don't have the same status as them.

24
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,790
How so?

25
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,540
You are my girlfriend.

26
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,820
If I am your girlfriend, does that mean I can't work for Mingyuan?

27
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,170
And besides, I am only his temporary assistant.

28
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:41,730
After the school break is over, I must return to Paris to attend classes.

29
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,560
First off, we have to see each other at the company every day. Right?

30
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,320
The company has a rule which states that co-workers can't date each other.

31
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,100
Do you want me to be the example and break this rule?

32
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,610
Originally, I agreed to be his assistant.

33
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:05,510
I wanted to secretly return to China to give you a surprise, who knew I would give you a scare.

34
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,940
I'll think about it. But if there is anything else in the future,

35
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,340
discuss it with me first.

36
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,000
How about I tell him I will work from home?

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,180
How about letting him change to another person?

38
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,280
No need.

39
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,900
I will think of a way.

40
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,250
Sorry.

41
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,870
All right, stop being upset.

42
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,850
I only feel that I have really not matured enough and I keep causing trouble for you.

43
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,740
I didn't say anything of the sort.

44
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,130
Don't be upset anymore.

45
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,410
I'm not upset.

46
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,160
If you're not upset, then what are you doing?

47
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,270
I am thinking.

48
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,910
What are you thinking about? Did you miss me too much?

49
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,240
I'm going home.

50
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:17,800
If I can't console you, if you go home, who will console you then?

51
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,230
I-I don't need anyone to console me.

52
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,720
What are you doing?

53
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,520
The first night you're back,

54
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,600
how can you go home?

55
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,060
Brother, there's a lot of people!

56
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,250
Yes, what? Do you want me to get rid of all of them?

57
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,660
You...

58
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,120
You didn't want me to come back right? Are you looking for trouble?

59
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,750
What do you mean by I want to look for trouble?

60
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,440
Do you see Li Qi?

61
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,560
I haven't seen him in a long time. Did he come?

62
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,600
Yes. He's here to pick us up.

63
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,150
- Where did he go? Not picking us up.
- Director Fang. Director Fang.

64
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,030
- What's going on with you?
- Sorry. Sorry.

65
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,920
My apologies, there was traffic.

66
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,430
Brother Qi.

67
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,360
Are you surprised?

68
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,480
- S-S-Surprised.
- Unexpected?

69
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,140
- Unexpected.
- I'll tell you in the car.

70
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,480
Let's go.

71
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,020
Okay, let's go.

72
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,820
Welcome back!

73
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,390
Hello, Duoduo.

74
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,250
Mo Fei, what are you up to?

75
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,460
I'm at work, drawing designs. Why?

76
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,280
You are drawing designs?

77
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,150
Cheng Yang told me he went to a meeting.

78
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,820
He said he went to a meeting?

79
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,550
Yeah.

80
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,120
Duoduo, that's it for now. I also have to go to the meeting. Bye-bye!

81
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,630
Mo Fei.

82
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,590
Where are you going in such a rush?

83
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,360
Designer Cheng said there is a design department meeting.

84
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,510
I didn't get a notice at the design office, so I rushed here.

85
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,810
The meeting has already finished. Why are you going?

86
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,230
But it's all right, you don't have to attend.

87
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:30,060
I am really sorry. This was my mistake. I'll be more attentive next time.

88
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,670
Right, your special relationship with Mingxuan,

89
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,540
there are some things that are not good to say.

90
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,590
But it affects the team's work, so I have to say it.

91
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:45,460
Although you are an assistant hired by Cheng Yang, and I have no right to interfere,

92
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,970
but the company has rules.

93
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,430
Workers cannot date.

94
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,530
If they have to date, then one has to leave, you understand?

95
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,470
Yes.

96
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,260
You know?

97
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,840
President Tang told me before.

98
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,070
So?

99
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,610
I have no power to change the company's rules,

100
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,750
but... I feel that this does not relate to me.

101
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:12,040
This is only to Mingyuan's workers, but I am only a temporary worker.

102
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,410
So... also my contract does not have these rules.

103
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:20,220
As long as you work at Mingyuan, not concerning whether you are temporary or official,

104
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,060
you have to follow the company's rules.

105
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,750
But... I feel as long as a worker does their job well,

106
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,990
how is dating involved?

107
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,090
The country has its rules, companies have their rules,

108
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,070
if there aren't rules, it wouldn't become what it is.

109
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,180
If everyone in the company were like you, wouldn't it be in chaos?

110
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,630
Mo Fei, you're over here.

111
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,710
I was looking for you everywhere.

112
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,650
I believe you are someone with boundaries.

113
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:01,780
What did Director Xia talk to you about? Her expression was so stern, it scared me.

114
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,350
Nothing, just work.

115
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,340
Director Xia, your cup.

116
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,720
Do you think what she said is right?

117
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,680
For Mo Fei, her personality is careless.

118
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,400
But no matter what, she can't speak like that to you, that's too much.

119
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,480
You are the company's director.

120
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,600
She might just be a freelancer and is used to being careless.

121
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,730
She doesn't understand the business's rules and has offended you.

122
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,870
Aren't you two best friends?

123
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:33,010
Right now, you're standing on my side, talking behind her back, is that proper?

124
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,420
Then, where should I stand?

125
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,810
Why did you come just now? I was waiting for you to start the meeting.

126
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,440
I was drawing designs and didn't look at the phone.

127
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,330
Right, what did you talk about at the meeting?

128
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,710
Nothing much. It was just a regular meeting.

129
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,930
All of the higher levels of the company were there, and I wanted you to know them.

130
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,130
Thank you for always thinking of me.

131
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,990
That... Director Xia is a leader.

132
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,010
What she says is straightforward. If she said anything you don't like,

133
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:08,160
don't take it to heart.

134
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,570
Don't worry. I didn't.

135
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,460
Brother Xuan, were things in Wuxi handled smoothly?

136
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,960
So are we going back to the company?

137
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,690
Yes.

138
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:50,460
Do you really have to go this far? Just to eat ice cream,

139
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,560
you made me bring you here to eat it.

140
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,430
- The food here is delicious.
- How much is it?

141
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,080
-10 RMB for one.
- We'll take two.
- Here you go.

142
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,120
♫ You'll surely be sad ♫

143
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,030
Thank you.

144
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,150
Try it.

145
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:08,260
♫ You'll surely miss me ♫

146

00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,560

149
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:23,480
Brother Xuan, you can't get off here. It's dangerous!

150
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:29,660
♫ You may be very sad ♫

151

00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,240
If I had known earlier, I wouldn't have let you come.

162
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,830
You dote on me, you would not do that.

163
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,410
Let me tell you.

164
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:16,710
You haven't eaten yet. Don't eat too much of this stuff.

165
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,870
I've been overseas for three years. This taste is what I miss the most.

166
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:25,870
I would die just to have a taste.

167
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,600
That's nonsense. Naughty younger sister.
(T/N: a kind expression of calling someone who doesn't know better).

168
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:34,880
I got it. I won't say it next time.

169
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,700
♫ You'll surely be sad ♫

170
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,800
Brother Xuan, what happened just now?

171
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,760
I think I just saw someone I knew.

172
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,740
I might have been mistaken.

173
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,300
Let's go back to the company.

174
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,620
♫ And just let go ♫

175
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:04,560
♫ If you want me to be crazy with you ♫

176
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:11,610
♫ Then why were you sincerely taken away? ♫

177
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:18,650
♫ Another universe lets me disappear ♫

178
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:26,820
♫ I'll no longer bother your life ♫

179
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,330
We're back.

180
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,020
Hurry, let me see.

181
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,420
Let's go, Brother.

182
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,320
I'm not going in.

183
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,260
You're home, you should go in.

184
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,260
Is this my house?

185
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,260
Brother, coming home with you

186
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,600
has been my wish these past three years. Let's go.

187
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,510
I have other things to do.

188
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,330
I'll find you afterward.

189
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,120
What's more important than me?

190
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,960
Director Fang, it's fine if you don't listen to me.

191
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,400
But you should listen to your younger sister. It's not often that you come here.

192
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,480
Just go in with her.

193
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,050
Sure. I'll leave after I walk you in.

194
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,820
You're the best older brother. Let's go.

195
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,670
When you left,

196
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:14,470
I told them not to touch your room.

197
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,050
I preserved its original state.

198
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,530
Brother, you could never imagine

199
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:24,140
when I was in Africa and India,

200
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,190
how miserable the condition was.

201
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,740
It's so comfortable being at home.

202
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,270
I'm not used to it anymore.

203
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,950
Then take time to get used to it here.

204
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,650
Don't worry. Whenever I'm around,

205
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,950
you will never suffer again.

206
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,920
I will go and make you something amazing to eat. Wait here.

207
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,470
Okay.

208
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:05,290
Brother?

209
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,500
Naughty Older Brother.

210
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,840
You'd better tell me the truth.

211
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,750
Are you hiding something from me?

212
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,280
What?

213
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,600
Where did you find that?

214
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,920
I found it in your clothes. I was going to do your laundry.

215
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,460
Then I found it.

216
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,370
You seem to really like her.

217
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,450
Why do you think that way?

218
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,360
I've seen you draw so many times.

219
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,800
This one used a lot of sincerity.

220
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,610
Why didn't you finish it?

221
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,040
I was just randomly drawing. Just for practice.

222
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,470
Just for practice, but you didn't throw it away after crumpling it up on the plane.

223
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,850
You even brought it home.

224
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,100
You're not telling me the truth.

225
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,550
Everything I said was true.

226
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:08,390
Don't play me. I know you too well.

227
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,460
You only look like a playboy on the outside

228
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,400
who is never loyal to anyone.

229
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,920
But you are actually very stubborn.

230
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,550
Once you start dating,

231
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,990
you are especially devoted.

232
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,180
As your younger sister, I know you the best.

233
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,100
Are you done?

234
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:36,660
I'm hungry. Where's the food?

235
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,450
I can't find anything to cook.

236
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:43,570
How about, let's go out. Go, go, go.

237
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,770
I'll have to make you really pay.

238
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,450
Let's go. I'll treat you to good food.

239
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,950
Do you know why I brought you to this restaurant right after you came back?

240
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,800
Why?

241
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,320
Did you know when I was younger,

242
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,700
whenever I got a really high score in an exam,

243
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,090
or when I got scolded by my teacher and got in a bad mood,

244
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,920
I would always make my mom bring me here to eat,

245
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,650
even though the noodles here are expensive.

246
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,290
So this place,

247
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,810
holds all the happy and sad times of my childhood.

248
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,320
In the future,

249
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,900
I want you to experience the happy and sad times together with me.

250
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,450
Are you willing?

251
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,300
- Why does it seem like you are being reluctant?
- I'm willing.

252
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,430
- You're willing to do what?
- Eat.

253
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,990
Where's the menu?

254
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,250
Right there.

255
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,980
There is Crab Meat, Golden Crab, but Supreme Crab isn't available.

256
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,020
So you only have two options.

257
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,750
Between the two, I heard the owner say that crab meat

258
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,830
is sold out today.

259
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,240
360.

260
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,960
That expensive?

261
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,160
You have money.

262
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,070
- You're treating me.
- Then let's leave.

263
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,080
Leave?

264
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,260
Noodles are coming.

265
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,030
That's the owner.

266
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,490
What do you think?

267
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,900
Is this your girlfriend?

268
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,380
She's pretty.

269
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,640
Since your girlfriend is here, how about some wine for the occasion?

270
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,430
- Is that okay?
- A little bit.

271
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,870
Give me one moment.

272
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,850
Smells good.

273
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,010
Take a look.

274
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,870
Here.

275
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,420
Since my girlfriend came,

276
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,330
why don't you come to sit and drink with us?

277
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:52,180
I won't interrupt young people's business.

278
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,850
Enjoy your drinks.

279
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,540
Great. Thank you.

280
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,520
Do you know what this means?

281
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,030
Means I am great. I am outstanding.

282
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:08,140
What he meant was you found an outstanding man.

283
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:14,400
He said you have great taste because you found me.

284
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:18,380
I found a chubby you.

285
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,090
Look at how skinny you are, like a bag of bones.

286
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,750
What did you just say to me?

287
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,930
Some without-borders organization?

288
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,790
Is that work that a girl should be doing?

289
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:34,010
Brother, don't underestimate girls.

290
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:37,910
The World Without Borders organization doesn't care if you are male or female.

291
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,370
You're making yourself so busy,

292
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,890
is it because you still can't let go of him?

293
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,130
I knew it.

294
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,280
I admit.

295
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:06,410
When I first left, it was very painful.

296
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,540
Every time I thought of him, I cried.

297
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:12,530
But after I joined the World without Borders organization,

298
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,530
I went to several countries.

299
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,690
I met so many people.

300
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:21,150
Compared to their misfortune,

301
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,360
I was being over-dramatic with my problem.

302
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,000
Where did you go?

303
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,570
If I knew of that kind of place, I would've never let you go.

304
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,590
That's not it, Brother.

305
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:37,320
The experience I gained from going to Africa affected me so much.

306
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,080
My teammates are still waiting for my return.

307
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,340
You want to go back?

308
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:50,030
- Then you came back this time...
- I've missed you.

309
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,860
I miss everyone.

310
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,540
I wanted to see how well you lived.

311
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,660
And him.

312
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:09,050
You can come and see me.

313
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:11,280
But don't bother seeing him.

314
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,600
- I want to meet him.
- I object.

315
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:21,040
Are you afraid that I'll crumble like in the past?

316
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:31,620
Qian Qian, do you remember last time

317
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,760
how sad I was when you left without saying goodbye?

318
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,110
Do you know how much I blame myself?

319
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:42,540
I felt like as an older brother, I didn't protect you well enough.

320
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,840
So I don't want this to happen a second time.

321
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:51,230
Brother, don't blame yourself.

322
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,400
This is my own life experience.

323
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,450
Everyone has their own life experience.

324
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,940
I appreciate this experience.

325
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,560
He made me more mature.

326
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,990
It's also been three years now.

327
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,370
Look! I've already grown to be an adult.

328
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:14,580
To me, you'll always be a child.

329
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,910
Brother,

330
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,620
I know what you did for me these three years.

331
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,780
Is it because of me

332
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,860
that you've been giving Mingxuan a hard time?

333
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,880
Brother, don't be like this.

334
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,680
Qian Qian,

335
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:43,080
don't try to comfort me

336
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,650
by forcing yourself to act like this.

337
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:50,030
I can see it. You still haven't let him go.

338
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,120
I've let go of him.

339
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:59,470
I really did, Brother.

340
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,570
My biggest wish...

341
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,730
is to have you let go, too.

342
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:07,310
Weren't you and Brother Mingxuan the best of friends?

343
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,170
There are misunderstandings between best friends.

344
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,130
If you give explanations and understand each other then it'll be fine.

345
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:14,800
What part is a misunderstanding? Really, a misunderstanding?

346
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:19,030
If that was a misunderstanding then why did you leave without saying goodbye?

347
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,170
I don't care about what happened between the two of you.

348
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,900
What he did to me in turn hurt you.

349
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,900
This is why I can't forgive and accept.

350
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:33,350
Nothing is fair and just in love.

351
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,940
Don't act this way because of me.

352
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:41,470
Right now, I already see Brother Mingxuan as a friend.

353
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:44,770
I want a new life.

354
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:49,260
I want to start over and forget the past.

355
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,960
I don't care about Brother Mingxuan.

356
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,860
You're the one I feel bad for.

357
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,990
My real brother. I know what you've done for me.

358
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,830
I don't want you to suffer.

359
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:03,350
I want to embrace our amazing future.

360
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:09,130
I'm begging you. All right, Brother?

361
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,070
Sure.

362
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,660
I promise you.

363
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,570
I-I'm asking you a question.

364
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,970
You have to answer honestly.

365
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:38,510
Fine. Ask away.

366
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,450
It's...

367
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,670
Just like Director Xia said,

368
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,320
is it awkward if you see me at the company?

369
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,600
Depends on the situation.

370
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,690
For example?

371
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,960
Sometimes,

372
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,230
it's a little hard.

373
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:11,100
If this is the case, I'll go tell Cheng Yang that

374
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,240
I'll be working from home in the future.

375
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:22,570
I've been thinking lately about this, too.

376
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:27,200
We both have our jobs. I shouldn't think any less of what you are doing.

377
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,420
So, I'm happy we can continue being colleagues.

378
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,070
Then... should I be...

379
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,930
thanking you, President Tang?

380
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,340
Thank me in what way?

381
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,880
You're doing that again.

382
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,910
Who's calling at this time?

383
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,480
[Mom]

384
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,930
You're tricking me!

385
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,000
- I saw it!
- I really threw it.

386
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,230
Then stick out your hand.

387
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,640
See?

388
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,660
What if it's important?

389
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,670
When I'm dating,

390
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,930
no one can disturb.

391
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,470
Mom, you came back!

392
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,340
Why didn't you tell me earlier? I could've picked you up.

393
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:52,940
If I told you, would you ask your boyfriend to pick me up?

394
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,640
You saw it?

395
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,050
This...

396
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:07,520
Is it the guy I saw at the batik workshop last time?

397
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:12,300
Mo Fei, you came back this time just to meet him?

398
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:18,060
Of course not. I came back during this break to help out a friend.

399
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:21,240
Then, when do you plan to let me meet him?

400
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,960
This question...

401
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,370
I'll have to ask him first.

402
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:31,230
You know he's pretty busy.

403
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:34,390
Okay, okay! I won't force you.

404
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:39,280
Come tell me about your school and work life in Paris.

405
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,060
Good. The teachers liked

406
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,100
my designs.

407
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:50,830
My daughter not only has good eyes, but she is also hardworking.

408
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:54,370
But sometimes when I was designing, I felt

409
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,900
my designs had no soul. They could have been for anyone.

410
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:01,180
Then, I studied Chinese traditional techniques

411
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:05,300
and culture. I think I've found

412
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,100
a direction.

413
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,820
My teacher was also very encouraging.

414
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:13,170
He encourages me to use Chinese techniques to finish my work.

415
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,670
If you think you can do more with your design,

416
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:20,250
then work hard to achieve it. Make it a reality.

417
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:24,490
Chinoiserie isn't widely accepted outside China.

418
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:27,090
But the overall environment is good.

419
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:29,480
You need to get to know designers of other countries.

420
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,140
It'll help you broaden your horizon.

421
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:36,660
Mom, when you first told me to study abroad,

422
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:40,630
I thought it wasn't necessary. I was going to come back anyway.

423
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:43,450
But when I went this time,

424
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,840
no matter if it was during school or work life,

425
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,510
I couldn't bear the hard times.

426
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,690
But as long as I gritted my teeth and got through it,

427
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,770
it felt especially successful.

428
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,480
Learning how to balance your work and life,

429
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,430
isn't that the most important?

430
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,020
You're right.

431
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:20,280
Director Xia.

432
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,750
Aren't you going to talk to President Tang about Mo Fei again?

433
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:30,560
- You really want to leave her in the design department?
- If not then what?

434
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,800
It's not because I have something against her.

435
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,410
You know the last time she came to our design department

436
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:38,420
and talked about our plagiarism,

437
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,470
we are still upset about it.

438
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,670
Anyway,

439
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,370
I'm leaving.

440
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,540
Ming—

441
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,650
I want to discuss something with you.

442
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:07,380
Let's change the style for the next season.

443
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,630
Let's do a Baroque style.

444
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,390
Doesn't it sound great?

445
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:13,090
Baroque style?

446
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:15,670
You are not using Chinese elements anymore?

447
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:20,650
I know the previous conference was successful.

448
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:24,140
Batik was powerful. Everyone liked it.

449
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:28,980
Let me tell you. The higher-ups really want you to come in as the chief designer.

450
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:32,080
But this sudden change will

451
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,110
be hard to accept.

452
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,080
You can replace me then.

453
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,080
I would be glad to be carefree.

454
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:44,840
Xiao, did something happen recently?

455
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,370
Nothing. Why are you asking?

456
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:51,900
Xiao, we're friends. Right?

457
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:55,600
We've known each other for many years. Don't lie to me, okay?

458
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,290
In the beginning, you were very firm in wanting to use Batik.

459
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:03,450
Now you suddenly want to change styles. Why?

460
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:08,100
I'm human. So I want to try something new and fresh.

461
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,330
Listen. In my opinion, this is not trying something new.

462
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:14,090
It's like you're a changed person.

463
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:15,770
What happened?

464
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,230
I almost don't know you anymore.

465
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:24,540
Just see this as meeting a totally new Fang Xiaoyu.

466
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:28,660
Why? What changed your thinking?

467
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,110
Maybe I've suddenly thought through some things.

468
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:37,010
Fine. Since you don't want to tell me, I won't keep asking.

469
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:40,600
Right! When are you coming back to Paris so that we can go watch a game together?

470
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,120
The home field of Paris Saint-Germain Football Club. You can come here.

471
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:48,430
Unfortunately, I might have to stay in Shanghai for a while.

472
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:51,710
If there's nothing important to do there, I won't be going back.

473
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:55,030
- Let's stay connected.
-  Fine. All right.

474
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:57,240
Then let's continue this discussion when you come back. Okay?

475
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,450
Bye, my friend.

476
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:08,840
[ASCENDAS PLAZA]

477
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:17,760
- Director Fang.
- Anything else at the company?

478
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,420
They may need you to go to Mingyuan tomorrow.

479
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:23,430
But don't worry. I'll talk to the secretaries

480
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:26,950
and let them delegate this Mingyuan thing to someone else so you don't have to worry about it.

481
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:29,530
It is work. No worries.

482
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:34,280
But you and President Tang and Miss Mo... This...

483
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,320
There is nothing between us. Only business.

484
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,150
But you used to...

485
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:44,880
"Used to." Go back if you have nothing else for today.

486
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,290
- Is this good?
- Good.

487
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,230
Gorgeous.

488
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,800
It smells good, too.

489
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,940
Did you even look?

490
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:17,210
You are barely home and when you are, all you do is read a book and ignore me.

491
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:20,140
No wonder Zhu Zhu doesn't want to spend time with you.

492
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:23,270
I have to keep up with the financial news.

493
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,380
Do it at the company. Now that you are home,

494
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,990
can you talk to me for one minute?

495
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:29,710
Okay.

496
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:33,330
Stop reading.

497
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,530
Talk to me.

498
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:39,100
Okay.

499
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,810
What do you want to say? I'm listening.

500
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:44,810
About Mingxuan, you have to take it seriously.

501
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,770
Have you noticed that Xueling hasn't been coming over lately?

502
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,950
There must be something going on between them.

503
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:52,450
Do you not care at all?

504
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:55,910
You can't force two people to come together.

505
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:59,510
Xueling is a good girl. Pretty, talented.

506
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:02,260
He'll be lucky to have her.

507
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:05,740
She can help him take care of the company and the family.

508
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,720
Plus, it's important that you marry into a family of the same social status as yours.

509
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,360
- It has to be Xueling...
- Dad. Mom.

510
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,370
- Mingxuan.
- Dad. Mom.

511
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:14,620
There you are. Your mom has a question for you.

512
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:17,120
Ask him yourself. Ask away.

513
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:20,400
You always have questions about me. What do you want to know now?

514
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,120
A lot of things. You are my son.

515
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,810
You have a girlfriend.

516
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:28,240
Don't you think you should bring her home one day?

517
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,090
If you guys are serious,

518
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:33,610
we need to meet her parents as well.

519
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:39,580
I don't like all the formalities when it comes to a relationship.

520
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,200
Neither do we.

521
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,540
But you have to at least make sure you marry into a family that's your equal.

522
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,880
How many people in the world

523
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,160
can be like you and Dad, equal in your status, and happy?

524
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,380
If it's meant to be, it's meant to be.

525
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,000
Feelings and "meant to be"

526
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,680
never last. A marriage only works

527
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,010
when it's between two families of the same social status. Trust me.

528
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:07,330
Mom, I don't think it's the right time.

529
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:10,780
I will bring Mo Fei over when the time is right.

530
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:14,210
Then you and Dad will get to tell me what you think of us.

531
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,550
So it's Mo Fei.

532
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:21,240
I didn't believe it when Xueling told me.

533
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,710
I saw Mo Fei. She was here.

534
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,750
It can't be her.

535
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,930
If you are seeing someone like Xueling,

536
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:30,130
I'll understand. I can accept that.

537
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:33,760
But not her. You are from two different worlds.

538
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,260
- What are you laughing about?
- No.

539
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,750
You know nothing about her. How can you say that?

540
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,990
From what I saw, I know enough.

541
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:45,260
Her family. Growing up with a single parent...

542
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:49,210
All right, Mom. I've been working all day. My brain

543
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:51,270
is shutting down. Let's talk another day. Dad.

544
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,870
- Go have some rest.
- Bye, Mom.

545
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:55,520
- Yes, you just keep running away from a real conversation.
- Bye, Mom and Dad.

546
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,070
- If you don't listen...
- Good night.

547
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,720
...you will regret it.

548
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,140
You've met Mo Fei?

549
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,040
Yes, she was here.

550
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,510
A short, little girl.

551
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,340
She is nothing compared to Xueling.

552
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:09,390
Invite her over. I want to see her, too.

553
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,420
You will regret it.

554
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:14,200
I will like whoever our son likes.

555
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,360
So you are with him?

556
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,740
You haven't finished your flower arrangement.

557
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,960
Just get back to your book.

558
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,960
Cheers!

559
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,810
Eat while it's hot.

560
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:42,610
Haitian, I recruited

561
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:45,640
a lot of designers while I was in France.

562
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,990
All superstars outside China.

563
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:53,720
Haiyao will have a great changeover with them.

564
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,820
Once Haiyao makes a sensation with its new line of products,

565
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:01,100
those old men will have nothing to say.

566
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,970
I'm talking to you.

567
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,750
It's good. All good.

568
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,820
You don't look excited at all.

569
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:19,420
No, I'm happy. Go on.

570
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,810
There must be something you are not telling me.

571
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,560
Don't be ridiculous. How can there be anything?

572
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:29,340
Really? You have looked distracted

573
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,090
the moment I walked in here.

574
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:34,810
Tell me the truth. Did you do anything bad

575
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,940
that you don't want me to know while I was gone?

576
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,630
You are being crazy.

577
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,960
I'm not interested in anyone else. I have you.

578
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,360
- "Anything bad," nonsense.
- Then, what is it?

579
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:50,360
There is really nothing "bad."

580
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,240
But there is something...

581
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:57,280
- something big.
- Just say it.

582
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,910
Since you've made me, I'll just go ahead and say it.

583
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:04,600
I bought a company called Fangyuan.

584
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,510
Fangyuan? What do they do?

585
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:14,020
They are a gaming company;

586
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,080
very mature, with a big future.

587
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,320
Gaming, gaming. All you ever talk about is gaming.

588
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,810
I knew you'd be like this when I told you.

589
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:26,110
Let me finish. You know I...

590
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:29,230
Gaming is my passion. It's all I want to do.

591
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:32,990
- You don't play so you don't get it. There's a lot of money...
- What about Haiyao?

592
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:35,180
- What about Haiyao?
- Haiyao is fine.

593
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:38,700
Are you going to leave it in the hands of those old men?

594
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,370
Why didn't you say so?

595
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:43,670
Why did I have to go to France to get the designers?

596
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,730
Zhu Haitian, are you doing this to me on purpose?

597
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:48,780
- Calm down, Xiaoman. Let me finish.
- No.

598
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:53,260
I want to leave Haiyao... with you.

599
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,820
I'll still be the CEO

600
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:00,340
but you will be the general manager.

601
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,640
You'll run the company.

602
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,610
Well...

603
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,380
What is this reaction? You don't agree? It's fine.

604
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:10,990
- I was just thinking out loud. We can do better...
- No.

605
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:16,260
It's just so sudden... Are you serious?

606
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:19,190
I understand. I've been running the company all these years.

607
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:21,720
I know it's hard.

608
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,870
And those old men are going to give you a hard time. That's okay.

609
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:28,670
Don't be nervous. It's just an idea that I'm putting out there.

610
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,920
No, no, no.

611
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,300
I want to be the general manager. It's my dream.

612
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,220
No problem. But...

613
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:39,330
Haitian, are you drunk?

614
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,050
Drunk? I just had two sips.

615
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:42,860
So you are serious?

616
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,820
Of course.

617
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,220
Listen, Xiaoman.

618
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:52,350
I've been thinking of taking my hands off Haiyao for a long time.

619
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:56,660
I don't know what I'm doing because I don't even like it.

620
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:00,920
Luckily, no one is saying I'm nothing compared to my father.

621
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,750
I know I'm not as good as my father, of course.

622
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:06,030
That's because I don't like it! Of course, I can't do it well.

623
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:09,300
I've had enough. My dream,

624
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,620
my passion is gaming.

625
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:17,230
I want to pursue my dream. I want to build a big, successful gaming company.

626
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:20,840
Be the head of Haiyao

627
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,770
so I can fulfill my dream as a gamer,

628
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:27,960
so that I can be successful. Will you?

629
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:31,480
Yes, I will.

630
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:37,170
Haitian, thank you for having faith in me.

631
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:39,440
Of course, I do.

632
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:44,860
Haitian, I will do a great job

633
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,840
running Haiyao since you trust me so much.

634
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,420
- You trust me, right?
- I do.

635
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:51,250
You can count on me. I have confidence.

636
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,820
If the two of us put our strengths together,

637
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:57,380
we will make it onto the Forbes list within five years.

638
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:02,150
The Forbes list? Look who is dreaming now. You are not the general manager yet.

639
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,840
Forget Forbes.

640
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,430
I'll consider it a win if you don't lose money.

641
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:09,350
- I won't. I promise.
- Look at you.

642
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,610
♫ I say you're an April day ♫

643
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:26,590
♫ The sound of your laughter lights everything up ♫

644
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:30,290
♫ Even the spirit of a light breeze ♫

645
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:36,220
♫ In the midst of the brightness and beauty of spring,
shift as one would in a dance ♫

646
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:41,520
♫ You're the mist on a dry April day ♫

647
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,980
♫ The gentle breeze blown during dusk ♫

648
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:49,490
♫ The unintentional sparkle of the planetesimal ♫

649
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:55,380
♫ The fine rain that's sprinkled in front of the flower ♫

650
00:42:55,380 --> 00:43:00,240
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

651
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:05,130
♫ Like a shy water lotus that bows to a cool breeze ♫

652
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:09,720
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

653
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:14,800
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫

654
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,390
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

655
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:28,010
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫

656
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:39,180
♫ You're like the ivory field after snowflakes ♫

657
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:43,670
♫ You're the round moon every night ♫

658
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:46,350
♫ You're the naïve ♫

659
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:53,600
♫ white lotus that floats on the water ripples of your dream ♫

660
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:58,430
♫ You're the flower blossoms of tree after tree ♫

661
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:03,120
♫ The swallow twittering within the beams ♫

662
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:06,930
♫ You are love, hope, and warmth ♫

663
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:11,060
♫ You're an April day ♫

664
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:15,840
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

665
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:20,750
♫ The bittersweet parting words of "take care" ♫

666
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:25,540
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

667
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:34,120
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫
