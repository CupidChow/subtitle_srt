I just want to say that you don't know him at all.

12

I'm in the studio.

165
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,970
Is Mo Fei with you?

166
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:00,240
No. She said she needed to do research in the library.

167
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,630
What's up? Do you need her?

168
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,090
Got it. Nothing. Thanks.

169
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,460
Do your thing.

170
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,740
♫ I really want to see your smile ♫

171
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,200

172

179
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:44,550
I'm sorry, the subscriber you called is right next to you.

180
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,540
How did you know I was here?

181
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,710
I put a GPS in your body.

182
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,200
Okay.

183
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,090
What happened there?

184
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:03,170
It's... I wasn't careful and got hit by fabric. It's nothing.

185
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,330
Also, I've seen the doctor. The doctor said I'm fine.

186
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,200
Why were you so careless?

187
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,440
Don't nag me.

188
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,260
You've lost weight.

189
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:18,970
Because I've been eating a lot of skewers.

190
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,060
- Was it for curing your bad mood?
-Yup.

191
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,270
Are you still in a bad mood?

192
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,030
I feel a little better when I see you.

193
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,510
What about the rest of your mood?

194
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,280
It depends on you.

195
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,750
On me?

196
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,030
Let me cure you then.

197
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,790
Come with me.

198
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,880
So is this, "booking the whole place" as the legends describe it?

199
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,640
I don't book the whole place anymore.

200
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,780
It's probably because business is bad.

201
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,050
So the business is bad?

202
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,640
- About that day...
- I know.

203
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:38,490
You must've had an emergency, so you had to go. Right?

204
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:41,440
Which boyfriend would come in person to his girlfriend's place

205
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,850
and then stand her up?

206
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:49,380
All right. Today is the 202nd day since we've been together.

207
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:52,840
Happy anniversary?

208
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,600
Happy anniversary.

209
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,760
Why do I feel like there's something wrong with drinking this wine?

210
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:20,330
Is it because you feel like I stole your lines?

211
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:29,300
Did the happiness come too quickly like a tornado?

212
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:37,380
I just think that you forgave me too easily. Are you planning a big trick on me?

213
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,430
So you think I am that treacherous. Am I that treacherous?

214
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,660
Aren't you?

215
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,300
If my survival instincts weren't strong,

216
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,580
I would have been single a long time ago.

217
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,430
I feel like you are talking like young people.

218
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,490
I am young.

219
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,170
- Really?
- Yeah.

220
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:02,040
But ever since I have been with Designer Mo,

221
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,110
I feel a little old.

222
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,400
You are obviously getting younger.

223
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,940
That's why you need to thank me.

224
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,220
You need to beg to be with me forever,

225
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,700
so you can stay young forever.

226
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,200
Close your eyes.

227
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,640
Why?

228
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,950
Close your eyes.

229
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,470
Okay.

230
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,970

233
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,190
So these are the little string lights you got me from Paris?

234
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:58,150
Even though we don't have time to go back to Paris,

235
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:01,120
I have to let you know my love for you.

236
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,910
Just like the first time I confessed to you.

237
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:07,210
Also, there can only be more love.

238
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,640
Do you feel happy?

239
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,460
May I have a dance?

240
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,220
But I don't know how.

241
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,120
Nor do I.

242
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:40,720
I used to say that I don't believe in fairytales.

243
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:45,030
Fairytales never tell us

244
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,480
that the princess who lives in the castle

245
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,910
might not be happy.

246
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,230
They also won't tell you

247
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:57,230
that the knight couldn't beat the dragon

248
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,780
but got swallowed by the dark.

249
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,770
All these nostalgic stories from our youth

250
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,750
always fade with time

251
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,010
and become meaningless sighs

252
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:14,110
in the late nights.

253
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,270
But now, I discovered

254
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:27,120
that love might be the last fairytale the heavens gave to adults.

255
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,400
It lets you believe

256
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,080
that in this world,

257
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,730
there's always someone who will overcome all obstacles for you.

258
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:43,640
They will use their most sincere heart and their deepest love

259
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,990
to write the fairytales that are just for us.

260
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:54,570
A poet once said that people don't just have one life,

261
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:58,020
nor do they live years, months, and days,

262
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,730
but a few moments.

263
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,980
I need to thank you,

Isn't it comfortable?

273
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:03,630
If I were you, I would come out to do a facial

274
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,000
and have a makeover or something.

275
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,770
Of course, work is important,

276
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,410
but beauty is too.

277
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:14,050

so we can enjoy it.

279
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,310
That is true,

280
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,600
but we have to be able to afford it.

281
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,960
I know.

282
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,270
That's why I got you a card.

00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,670

Thank you, Xiaoman.

287
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,110
No need to thank me.

Jiaxi,

289
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:51,010
did you find the designer I asked you to find?

290
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,520
I asked for you.

291
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,110
Those amongst my classmates that were a little talented all left to study abroad.

292
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,170
They are not coming back anytime soon.

293
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:00,430
But one of them told me something.

294
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:03,940
He has a coworker designing for Director Fang at Cayman.

295
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,300
You can go to Cayman and see.

296
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,220
You think I didn't go?

297
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,990
It's strange. Director Fang is quite busy.

298
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,450
That makes sense.

299
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:20,060
He is probably spending most of his time on his sick sister.

300
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,650
Sister?

301
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,670
Fang Xiaoyu's real little sister?

302
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,120
Yes, his real little sister.

303
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,520
A few days ago, Director Xia even asked me to send her flowers.

304
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,260
It looked serious.

305
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,470
Do you have her address? Give me the address of his sister's hospital.

306
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,160
Okay.

307
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,260
Mr. Fang, we've been carefully studying the patient's condition.

308
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:49,050
To treat her with the conservative method would only delay her recovery.

309
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:52,770
The only working plan is to perform surgery as soon as possible.

310
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,370
Qian Qian, did you hear the doctor?

311
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,830
The surgery can't be delayed any further.

312
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:09,880
I know, Brother, but I'm still afraid.

313
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,030
Don't be afraid.

314
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,960
I'm always here for you.

315
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,430
Brother,

316
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:24,660
I know my condition.

317
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:29,430
I know how risky the surgery is going to be.

318
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:33,000
But I've been away from all of you for three years.

319
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,720
I really cherish the time I spend with you.

320
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,600
If the surgery fails and I can't make it,

321
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,090
I will lose... lose everything I have.

322
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,110
So I'm afraid.

323
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,640
Don't be.

324
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,600
Brother, I'm afraid if I don't wake up, I will lose you

325
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,450
and everything else I love.

326
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,060
Your brother is sorry.

327
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,840
I couldn't protect you and you were hurt.

328
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:11,370
As long as you promise to have the surgery,

329
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:16,200
I swear that everything you have right now,

330
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,700
will always be yours.

331
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:26,090
Also, Dr. Li is a specialist from abroad.

332
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:30,000
He has seen many patients who were in way worse conditions than you.

333
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,130
You have to believe that this surgery will be successful.

334
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,800
Okay?

335
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,960
Brother,

336
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:45,000
could you give me some time to think about it?

337
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,630
Mr. Fang,

338
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,500
may I have a word?

339
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,210
Wait for me.

340
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,960
Hello, may I ask if there is a

341
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,070
20-year-old or so girl named Fang here?

342
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:15,070
I'm sorry, I can't give out that information.

343
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:19,240
She is in serious condition. Just tell me, please? I need to see her.

344
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,130
I'm sorry, I really don't know.

345
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,900
I brought all these snacks. I won't be long.

346
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,170
I really can't tell you. I'm sorry.

347
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,530
Forget it. I will look for her myself.

348
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,010
Why did you come to the hospital?

349
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:58,450
I heard your sister was sick, so I wanted to visit.

350
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,910
- Do you know my sister?
- No, I don't.

351
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:05,360
- Then, why are you here?
- I know you.

352
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:08,550
Xiaoyu, don't misunderstand.

353
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,930
I'm just here to give her some fruits.

354
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:13,700
I won't be saying anything else.

355
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,100
So, you stopped bothering me, but are bothering my sister now.

356
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:21,000
Could you put your time and effort into something else?

357
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,570
I really just want to see her, because she is your sister.

358
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:27,370
I want to do something for her.

359
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:31,720
Not bothering her is the best you can do.

360
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,720
You don't answer my calls,

361
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,340
and I can't find you in the office. I heard you are in the hospital, so I...

362
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:44,690
Xiaoyu, I just want to see you.

363
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,900
You just want to talk to me about the collaboration you mentioned last time, right?

364
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,820
Okay, I'm giving you an opportunity today.

365
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,130
Let me see it.

366
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,570
What?

367
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:06,100
Don't you want to collaborate? You must have a plan.

368
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,470
- Where are the drafts?
- Wait.

369
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,390
So these are your designs.

370
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:28,610
I can't work with you guys

371
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:32,060
or I will be a joke.

372
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,040
Your designs can't compare with Mingyuan at all.

373
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,310
You've seen Mingyuan's designs?

374
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:45,340
You know that Cheng Yang is a popular designer in France.

375
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,600
I also know Mo Fei's abilities.

376
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,610
Yours can't compare with theirs.

377
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:56,100
We can pay more. No matter how much.

378
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,660
Isn't it funny to talk about money

379
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:03,540
with Cayman and Mingyuan?

380
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,510
Xiao Yang!

381
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:19,780
Alice, is there anything you need?

382
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:24,270
Have you seen my brother? How come he is not back yet?

383
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:27,820
I just saw him talking with a pretty girl downstairs.

384
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,400
- Him and a pretty girl?
- Yes.

385
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,700
But your brother didn't seem happy.

386
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,040
Mr. Fang.

387
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,880
Brother, the girl with you just then,

388
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,120
is she your love debt?

389
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,210
Whose heart am I breaking?

390
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:51,900
You know I hate those ones who are clingy.

391
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,690
All right, I will believe you once.

392
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,170
But you need to promise me.

393
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:02,080
If you have a girlfriend, you need to tell me first thing.

394
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,430
Okay.

395
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,630
I promise you.

396
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,180
Does the sleeve feel long?

397
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,900
A little.

398
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,530
About two inches.

399
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:44,130
- Okay.
- Over there.

400
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,860
Did someone order you around again?

401
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:02,670
What ordering around? It's just work.

402
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:05,120
You can't always run around by yourself.

403
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,750
- Even I feel bad for you.
- Nothing I can do.

404
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:11,620
But I can go to the restroom now. I was too busy before.

405
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,360
What about your team? Is it going well?

406
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,970
It's okay, but every piece has to be altered.

407
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:20,330
It's the endless fittings and alterations.

408
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:23,640
It's even hard to catch the rehearsal.

409
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,370
No time for rehearsal? That's not good.

410
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:31,050
Of course! Even the embroideries need to be fixed.

411
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:33,300
Could you hold these for me? I need to go to the restroom.

412
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,960
Okay.

413
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:52,200
This is a little too big. Find a belt for her.

414
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:57,590
- Director Xia!
- Shen Jiaxi, where have you been?

415
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:00,160
Don't you know how busy we are today?

416
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,790
I need to tell you something.

417
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:08,140
I heard Designer Cheng's side is having problems. They might not make it to the rehearsal.

418
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,710
I'm not interested in other people's work.

419
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:14,140
Go do your work. So many things waiting for you to do.

420
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:18,060
Let's change.

421
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,200
The alterations look fine.

422
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,980
The pants are a bit long.

423
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,300
Don't move or I will poke you.

424
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:38,950
Stop moving.

425
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,450
Are you and your sister a family?

426
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:43,670
Your sister can stay in the office for an entire day.

427
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:46,630
And you are like a little monkey.

428
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:50,250
If I had her steadiness, I wouldn't have played sports back then.

429
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,520
- Don't move. Let me do something here.
- Okay.

430
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:57,740
Let me tell you. I've gotten so many outfits for you to try on.

431
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,400
- Try them on later.
- Okay.

432
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:17,130
Alice, you haven't been sleeping lately.

433
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:20,420
Have a glass of warm milk. It can help you sleep.

434
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:24,430
Just put it on the table. I will drink it later.

435
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:34,160
Right, the podcast Mo Fei downloaded last time.

436
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,720
May I listen to it?

437
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,920
There's a new one.

438
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:48,490
Today, I will tell a story for everyone.

439
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:52,140
There is a magical fire in the bird's kingdom.

440
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,490
Legend says that if you jump into the flames,

441
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:59,360
you can become the prettiest bird in the world.

442
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:03,960
The crow just got close to the flames and was not able to stand the smoke.

443
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:08,250
Therefore, he lost his beautiful voice.

444
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:11,660
The quail also gave up

445
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,050
when facing the high heat.

446
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:18,490
His tail was burned.

447
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:22,900
The phoenix is short and ugly.

448
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:29,620
He even doesn't know how to fly, but only he jumps into the flames without hesitation.

449
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:34,000
The phoenix that was reborn after the fire got the prettiest feathers

450
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,440
and voice.

451
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,970
Also, he never dies.

452
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,930
Other birds ask

453
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:46,810
why does the phoenix have the courage to jump in?

454
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:49,210
The phoenix said,

455
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:53,420
"Before I jumped into the flames, I was at my worst.

456
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:58,470
If I have the opportunity to be reborn, why should I be afraid of death?"

457
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:03,900
All right, this is the story for today.

458
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:07,100
Have a good dream, everyone.

459
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:34,730
Hold this cup. I'm getting a blanket for you.

460
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,930
Guess who I am?

461
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,990
You are Mo Fei!

462
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:10,860
That's right. Why do you sound disappointed?

463
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,940
No, I'm not.

464
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,800
Mo Fei, how did you find the time to see me?

465
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,460
I'm on break today. Also, I miss you.

466
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,810
Let's go, I'm taking you for a walk.

467
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,160
Mo Fei, I've been listening to your podcast.

468
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,760
Every time I listen to your podcast, I always sleep incredibly well afterward.

469
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,530
You are not the first to say that.

470
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:37,950
It looks like I can cure insomnia.

471
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:42,250
Who else says that? Your... prince?

472
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:47,630
It looks like you've heard.

473
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:51,930
It's all over your podcast.

474
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:56,320
But no one knows who I am.

475
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,840
Mo Fei,

476
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,030
I am especially envious

477
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:07,040
the at-reach happiness you describe on the podcast.

478
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:15,500
So, what is he like?

479
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,920
He...

480
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,140
I actually think we belong to two worlds.

481
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,300
It wasn't possible for us to interact.

482
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,350
Also,

483
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:33,630
he is quite cold to everyone.

484
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,080
I used to dislike him.

485
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,980
What happened next?

486
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,550
And then, we realized we both like Chinese elements.

487
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:46,550
We both really love it, so we had the opportunity

488
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:51,330
to get closer bit by bit.

489
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:55,280
But you know, I'm not the only star that wants to get close to the sun,

490
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,270
there is the milky way and the moon laying between us.

491
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:05,850
Therefore, I didn't think we would be together at all.

492
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:12,480
Just when I was about to give up, he courageously took my hand

493
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,910
and made me see his resolution and bearing.

494
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:23,990
And then, we broke through all the obstacles, and...

495
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:27,380
we got together.

496
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:31,770
So, your sun

497
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:35,740
gave up the whole milky way and the moon for you

498
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:40,460
and chose you, the little star.

499
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:43,730
Mo Fei, you are so lucky.

500
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:48,810
In my opinion, you must be the brightest star.

501
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:52,960
This is too sweet!

502
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,250
All right, enough about me. Let's talk about you.

503
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,670
It was a...

504
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:12,640
one-sided love that went nowhere.

505
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:20,440
It's okay. We don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.

506
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,760
Actually,

507
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,680
it's been on my mind for a long time.

508
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,590
I never had the opportunity to talk about it.

509
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:33,490
His family and mine were close.

510
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:36,720
He is a bit older than I am.

511
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:41,980
He has been around ever since I was born.

512
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:48,810
We grew up together.

513
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:51,170
We were right for each other.

514
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,090
He was very nice to me.

515
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:00,270
Even nicer than my brother.

516
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:06,440
Every time I ran into trouble, he always took care of me.

517
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:12,050
Slowly, I grew up.

518
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:17,850
I realized that I didn't just love him like a brother.

519
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:21,220
I even imagined, one day, I would wear a wedding gown

520
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,510
and say vows with him.

521
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:27,760
His mother also liked me,

522
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,500
so she came to ask our family.

523
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,540
When everyone was looking forward

524
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:37,240
to us getting married,

525
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,580
only he rejected it.

526
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,380
Why?

527
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,910
If I measure it with love,

528
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:57,400
he didn't like me at all, only treated me as his sister.

529
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:07,030
I couldn't accept this reality.

530
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:11,590
I left home and went to Africa by myself.

531
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:14,630
I cut off all connections

532
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:18,360
and stayed there for three years.

533
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:22,410
Did he go looking for you?

534
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:27,140
He probably couldn't find me.

535
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:35,460
Do you still like him now?

536
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:40,500
My feelings for him... are really complicated.

537
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:45,800
It's not just love or friendship.

538
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:49,830
Actually, when I see it now,

539
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:53,360
I think he wasn't trying to run away.

540
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:56,850
He was trying to protect me.

541
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:02,810
He was afraid to hurt the very weak me.

542
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:08,570
If we had really gotten married, we probably wouldn't have been happy.

543
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:14,220
He is still good to me. He comes to see me all the time.

544
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:19,290
He brought me snacks and fun things. I'm satisfied.

545
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:27,450
Alice, you are so kind.

546
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:32,720
The person you love must be kind, too.

547
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,830
So are you.

548
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,160
Hello.

549
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,470
What? You are at the hospital? Where are you? I'm coming to you.

550
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:51,060
Okay. I'm on my way. Bye.

551
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,000
I'm sorry, I have to go.

552
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,580
It's okay. Go do your thing. We will catch up some other time.

553
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,920
- I'm going then. Take care of yourself.
- Okay.

554
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,720
Don't have your prince waiting for too long. Go.

555
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,660
I'm going then. Bye!

556
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:24,090
♫ I say you're an April day ♫

557
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:28,070
