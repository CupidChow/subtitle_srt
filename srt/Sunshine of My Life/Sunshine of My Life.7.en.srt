00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:37,750
Come on! Tell me. How's your catch? Did he take the bait?

4
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,520
What catch? What are you talking about?

5
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,960
I don't have a fish pond. What's there to catch?

6
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,300
Drop the act. Do you think I don't know?

7
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,980
Now, everyone in Mingyuan already knows

8
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,850
that President Tang took you to the design studio.

9
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,170
What? What is everyone saying?

10
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,950
They all say that President Tang

11
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,550
was so angry because of one beauty. With a few words from you,

12
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,060
half of the people in the design studio got fired. Is it true?

13
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,520
No, it's all a lie.

14
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,090
Then tell me, what is the truth?

15
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,530
I'm starving. I'm going to eat now.

16
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,950
No, Sis. I've been curious all morning. Just tell me.

17
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,670
You're saying they are lying, but I saw President Tang with my own eyes going

18
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,000
into the design studio carrying things for you.

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,250
That's not wrong, is it?

20
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,270
Say, why isn't there any vinegar with the fried dumplings you bought?

21
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,780
- How can there not be vinegar? I–
- Look.

22
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,430
No, wait. You're trying to change the subject, right?

23
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,020
I'm asking you a question. Why are you looking for vinegar?

24
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,530
I'll get going.

25
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,500
How is it? Are you used to it here? If you need anything, just tell me.

26
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,400
I'll have someone prepare it for you.

27
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,630
It's great. Thank you, Director Xia.

28
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,570
No need to thank me. I've heard from Mingxuan

29
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:04,280
that you have helped a great deal with the embroidery workshop matter. I should thank you instead.

30
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,970
You and President Tang are too kind.

31
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:11,780
I'm also very happy that the embroidery workshop can collaborate with Mingyuan.

32
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,230
We had a small misunderstanding before.

33
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,680
Mingxuan was worried about it.

34
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,480
I wasn't able to find a good opportunity to come and talk to you.

35
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,780
Before, I was also at fault.

36
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,920
I hope you can understand.

37
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,720
See? I've said you are a straightforward person.

38
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,230
Mingxuan didn't believe me.

39
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,750
I must have a talk with him. He doesn't understand women at all.

40
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:39,590
By the way, this is the makeup artist that Mingyuan has always been working with.

41
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:44,420
For the competition, you can contact her to have her do your model's hair and makeup.

42
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,370
Thank you, Director Xia. But this is...

43
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,080
against the competition's rules, right?

44
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,860
It's fine. It's no big deal.

45
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:56,190
As long as we can help you, Mingxuan and I will do our best.

46
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,630
If you need anything, just tell us directly. Since we see you as our friend,

47
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,650
don't be shy.

48
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,250
- I'll let you get back to what you were doing then.
- Thank you, Director Xia.

49
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,440
Are you guys especially here just to watch models walk the runway?

50
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,210
If you walk this way...

51
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,790
It's fine. Everyone can relax. Lately, you've all been working very hard.

52
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,090
I'm going to now announce the five people who scored the highest

53
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,290
and will participate in the Chinese Style Fashion Competition.

In addition is someone you all know, Bai Xiaoman.

She's the winner of this season's, "Rising Model."

I hope you can take this opportunity to learn from her.

- Congratulations, Mo Fan.

- I'm not surprised at the results at all.

65

I knew that you would be chosen.

66
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,730
Too bad I'm not able to go. Anyway, congratulations!

Why are you so nervous? Were you afraid I would take it hard?

Do I look that weak to you?

72
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,490
No. I'm just worried...

73
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,930
I'm a person who's very self-aware.

74
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,590
I knew that I wouldn't be chosen. I already prepared myself mentally.

75
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,730
You weren't chosen this time. There's always next time, right?

76
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,360
Next time?

77
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,120
My cousin was right.

78
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,960
Maybe I'm not cut out for this.

79
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,960
All right, there's still time. Take it slow.

80
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,790
How about I practice with you for a bit longer?

81
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,280
Don't you have to sing tonight?

82
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,080
I'm not going!

83
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,080
All right then. Help this goddess up then.

84
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,960

87
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:47,840
I'm being infuriated by those kids daily.

88
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,200
Being with the kids is fun. You'll get younger day after day.

89
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,190
Only someone young and vigorous like you would think that way. I don't want it, I'm on a diet.

At my age, after practicing with them all day,

91

I'm exhausted. I must admit I'm getting old.

The season of "Rising Model" has a new winner already.

93
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,110
By the way, who is the winner this season?

94
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,290
You know her, Bai Xiaoman.

95
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:23,090
I told you to pay attention to what's happening within the company. You just don't care much about it.

96
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,420
I've always wanted to ask you this.

97
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,260
Sister, why did you choose Bai Xiaoman?

98
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,590
What exactly don't you like about Bai Xiaoman?

99
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,220
Let's not talk about her personality,

100
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,870
but her stage presence and runway walk are currently Cayman's best.

101
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,590
Plus, her adaptability and performance

102
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:47,430
are particularly great. That's why she stood out in the competition.

103
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:54,100
But then again, didn’t you recommend Bai Xiaoman three years ago?

104
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,680
What exactly happened between the two of you?

105
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,730
I'm not done talking!

106
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:06,460
You need to clear this with me. Otherwise, I'll be worried.

from the charity event?

109

00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,170
Ms. Zhang Yuqiong, Teacher Zhang.

161
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,250
Ms. Xiong Ying, Teacher Xiong.

162
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,660
Mr. Li Wenshu, Teacher Li.

163
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,010
Mr. Fang Xiaoyu, Teacher Fang.

164
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:49,070
Today, all of our young designers

165
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,710
have already prepared their designs.

166
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:54,020
Please welcome them with a round of applause.

167
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,600
[Tang Mingxuan]

168
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,200
[You can do it! Mo Fan!]

169
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,480
Judges, viewers, and friends, hello. I'm contestant number 7, Mo Fei.

170
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,240
This time my theme is "Blue Skies After The Rain."

171
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,390
Jiangnan gives us the feeling that it's always spring time,

172
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,960
always refreshing;

173
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,090
and I think the cerulean blue color

174
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,240
will best represent spring.

175
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,780
Therefore, I chose cerulean blue as the main color for my design.

176
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,790
I have also used Suzhou embroidery for the hemline,

177
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,360
adorning it with flowers

178
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,530
that represent spring.

179
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:04,760
For the top layer of the dress, I used organza; a very glossy material.

180
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,860
It represents the light rain.

181
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,910
It expresses very well our theme, "Misty rain in Jiangnan." Thank you.

182
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,950
Good afternoon, everyone. I am contestant number 8.

183
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,350
I think Mo Fei's design is very refreshing.

184
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,960
It suits the theme of Chinese Style very well.

185
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,020
This kind of design must put a lot of pressure on a designer's skills.

186
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:33,310
I also think she handled the embroidery details very well.

187
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,440
You see, she has hidden the embroidery on the hemline.

188
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,770
It doesn't draw attention away from the focal point.

189
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:47,980
I agree with you, but I still think

190
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,450
that her design lacks maturity.

191
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,170
She just focuses on an ideal kind of aesthetic.

192
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,770
The design is very beautiful, but it lacks attitude.

193
00:15:55,770 --> 00:16:00,190
Just like a beautiful girl. Even though she is beautiful, she lacks a soul.

194
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:03,060
So it makes me think, has she figured out

195
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,890
what kind of designer she wants to be?

196
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:09,480
Let's once again welcome all of our designers and their designs again.

197
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:19,310
President Tang, hello. You are finally here.

198
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:25,250
- How is it going?
- They're about to score them. Didn't you go to a meeting?
- It ended.

199
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,650
Brother Xuan,

200
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,290
I have been keeping an eye on Mo Fei for you.

201
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:38,100
Judges, please score contestant number 6, Shen Jiaxi.

202
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,670
Teacher Zhang, 87 points.

203
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:44,630
Teacher Xiong, 80 points.

204
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,850
Director Fang, 85 points.

205
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,930
I'm going to take a call.

206
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,650
Thank you, judges.

207
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,230
All right. Thank you. Next, we have contestant number 7.

208
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,670
I admire your design very much, Mo Fei.

209
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:19,590
Very poised and elegant without losing lightness.

210
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:23,230
From the gradual color change to the infusion of techniques,

211
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:27,900
the overall design is very artistic and enchanting.

212
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,990
It resembles nature itself.

213
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:33,390
I could even imagine celebrities wearing your design

214
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,730
at red carpet events.

215
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,830
Wow, we could say that is quite high praise!

216
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:44,410
Teacher Xiong Ying and I seem to have different opinions.

217
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,270
Creation is a type of language.

218
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:51,540
The designer uses his designs as a language to communicate with the audience.

219
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,470
If there is no emotion in a designer's creation,

220
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:59,060
or sincerity, the audience will sense that.

221
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,900
I value that more than those flourished embroideries.

222
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:09,250
Therefore, I am sorry. Your design's emotions have not moved me.

223
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:15,420
Then, next, let's see what her final score is.

224
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,990
Teacher Zhang, 87 points.

225
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,250
Teacher Xiong,

226
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,600
80 points.

227
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,960
Teacher Liu Wenshu, 85 points.

228
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,900
Director Fang, 75 points.

229
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,930
No way, 75 points?

230
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,870
[I'll always love you, Mo Fan.]

231
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,710
- I will go ahead.
- Bye-bye!

232
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,520
Mo Fei!

233
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,050
Congratulations!

234
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:03,920
For pushing your way in, ranking last.

235
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,620
Yes, no matter what my rank is,

236
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,720
I still advance to the final, don't I?

237
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,820
You really have no sense of shame!

238
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,960
How can you say such words?

239
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,020
Director Fang, in the middle of a live TV broadcast,

240
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,180
criticized your work in front of everyone.

241
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:27,500
If I were you, I wouldn't be able to smile. I would probably

242
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,070
hide somewhere and cry.

243
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,450
I'm not done yet.

244
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,830
Didn't you have a great relationship with Director Fang?

245
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:43,020
Last time, you even begged him to take you to the charity banquet.

246
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:47,500
What happened? Didn't you beg him to take care of you this time?

247
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:52,280
Oh, I know. You must've begged,

248
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,990
but he refused you. Right?

249
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,690
Director Fang was able to criticize my work in a live broadcast

250
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,260
because I have work that he can criticize.

251
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,820
But what do you have?

252
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,580
Selfishness and a spiteful tongue?

253
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,120
What did you say?

254
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,980
Also, thanks for always worrying about me so much.

255
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,490
Let me tell you. I am very good. I'm heading out.

256
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,160
You can't. Mo Fei,

257
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,780
why are you being so arrogant?

258
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,670
Do you really see yourself as some kind of genius designer?

259
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,630
Don't think that just because you know two of the judges,

260
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,620
you'll be able to get a stand here.

261
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,650
Let me tell you. Fang Xiaoyu

262
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:33,150
is not someone you can seduce.

263
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,430
Director Fang.

264
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,130
Bai Xiaoman...

265
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:49,030
you're not so young anymore. Can't you be more mature?

266
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,330
Not everyone is like you, resorting to seduction.

267
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,060
Mo Fei!

268
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:59,760
You like to play with fire.

269
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:08,460
[TV Station]

270
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,900
Do you know that that was really dangerous?

271
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,860
- Are you still upset?
- I'm not upset.

272
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,230
You're not upset?

273
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,030
Then let's go. I'll give you a ride.

274
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,620
It's okay, there's no need. My home is pretty close anyway.

275
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,830
I can walk home.

276
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,760
So you are still upset.

277
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,960
Why should I be upset?

278
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,460
Objectively, your words are not

279
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,590
completely without reason.

280
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:42,070
So what I said made sense?

281
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,030
Most of it makes sense.

282
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,760
Then that's fine. I'll take you home.

283
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:54,290
If you like these things, just take them. I don’t need them anymore.

284
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,700
I'm leaving now.

285
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,110
Did you think I lied when I praised you before?

286
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:05,210
Did you think at the coffee shop when I said you should be my assistant,

287
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,540
that it was just casual talk?

288
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,120
The Mo Fei I hope to see

289
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,830
is someone who can design something with her heart.

290
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:27,070
Not to deliberately show off

291
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,120
for a competition.

292
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,750
You don’t want me to be like other judges,

293
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:36,020
racking their brains to praise you. Right?

294
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,800
If you really aren't upset,

295
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,760
then learn to be a mature person

296
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,720
and get in the car. Then, I'll tell you why I gave you 75 points.

297
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:55,290
Brother Xuan, why can't I find her anywhere?

298
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,590
Should we give her a call?

299
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,730
Brother Xuan, Director Fang has taken her away.

300
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,300
Did you understand everything I just said?

301
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:01,260
Your tailoring and stitching really didn't match the overall design this time.

302
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:05,610
Especially that organza's design, it ruins the aesthetic a bit.

303
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,800
So, the points I deducted were clear and reasonable.

304
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,490
If I were to use preferential treatment,

305
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:16,480
then I would give you 100 points. Would you accept that?

306
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,560
N-No. You are right. I didn't think it through. I just made assumptions.

307
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,740
If you still don't understand, how about we go upstairs and I can explain it to you?

308
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,280
There's no need.

309
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,320
Judges and contestants should still avoid sending the wrong message.

310
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,660
I'm going now.

311
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,260
I'll help you get your things.

312
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,730
Are you sure I can't go upstairs?

313
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:51,870
N-No-No need. Go home early. Bye-bye!

314
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,800
Bye-bye!

315
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:34,550
Sister, where did you go just now? Didn't we agree to come back together?

316
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,800
I didn't go anywhere.

317
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,450
You didn't go anywhere? I turned around and you were gone.

318
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:53,450
It's okay, I know everything. You're in a bad mood, right?

319
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,520
Here. I'll let you borrow my shoulder.

320
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:06,490
I'm okay. As a designer, it's my job to accept criticism from others.

321
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:09,420
I promise... For the next competition,

322
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,840
I will not be in last place.

323
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,610
Enough.

324
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:17,340
You don't have to pretend to be strong at home.

- Yes?

Every time this happens,

327
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:28,840
I feel a bit guilty towards you.

328
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,060
Guilty about what?

329
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:34,650
I shouldn't have bullied you when we were young.

330
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:37,960
It's fine. When you bullied me,

331
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,970
I would curse you out behind your back.

332
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:45,190
You dare curse at me! You little brat.

333
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,710
Move over so I can use your sholder.

334
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,140
That's better. What curses did you say about me?

335
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,580

President Tang, why are you here?

You don't look very...

365
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:50,490
Did something happen at the embroidery workshop?

366
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:53,300
That's not right. Master didn't call me.

367
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:59,090
I have something to tell you. Can I come inside?

368
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:03,100
Come in.

369
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,970
President Tang, have some tea.

370
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,460
- It's raining.
- Yeah.

371
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,670
Yeah, it's raining. It started suddenly.

372
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,170
This tea is very unique.

373
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,210
It's black buckwheat tea. My mom sent it over.

374
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:38,710
- Is something wrong with the workshop, or did I—
- Oh, right.

375
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:43,540
- Why didn't I see you after the competition yesterday?
- What?

376
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:47,380
I– I came home.

377
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:53,200
From now on, after the competition, wait at the venue. I'll have Yang Guang take you home.

378
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,160
That's not necessary. Yang Guang is quite busy.

379
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,290
So do you think I have a lot of free time so I came to see you for no reason?

380
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:06,900
How would I-I... Hold on, President Tang, you're acting kind of strange today.

381
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:15,730
I think I've made myself very clear already. Don't you understand?

382
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,960
That's what you think.

383
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,570
But actually, you haven't made anything clear. You haven't said anything yet.

384
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,990
Okay then.

385
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:37,760
I'll be straightforward. What's your relationship with Fang Xiaoyu?

386
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:43,800
You... Don't misunderstand.

387
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,600
You don't think I've bribed the judges, do you?

388
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,230
What?

389
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:52,570
It's not! It's not what you think! I really didn't bribe the judges!

390
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,890
If I did bribe Director Fang, t-then

391
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:57,980
why would he have given me the lowest score?

392
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:02,550
What? You're saying that Fang Xiaoyu gave you the lowest score at the competition?

393
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:06,220
Yes. He only gave me 75 points, the lowest score in the competition.

394
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,900
Think about it. If I really bribed him,

395
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,550
he wouldn't have given me a score like that. Right?

396
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,970
So, you've misunderstood.

397
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,890
Makes sense.

398
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:20,210
It looks like I have to work harder to better my designs

399
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:24,830
so Director Fang can see that I'm someone with real talent and ability.

400
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:27,920
Do you care that much about Fang Xiaoyu's opinion of you?

401
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,460
Of course. Of course, I care a lot.

402
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,540
His opinion of me is very important.

403
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:38,200
He's a judge. He decides whether I make it to the finals.

404
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,090
I can, too.

405
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,950
So, let me tell you. You better stay away from Fang Xiaoyu.

406
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,730
Getting too close to him is not good for you.

407
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,320
But... President Tang, what's with you today?

408
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:08,190
Don't forget what I told you today. I'll send someone to help you clean up.

409
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:20,960
Wait... What just happened?

410
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,660
So you're saying that President Tang showed up at your house to tell you to stay away from Director Fang?

411
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,040
- And he even said it's for your own good?
- That's right.

412
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,920
Don't you think it's strange?

413
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:35,290
Could it be that he was confused because he was still half asleep?

414
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:37,610
I don't think he was confused because he was still half asleep.

415
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:40,130
It's you who's pretending to be confused.

416
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:42,270
What?

417
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,620
Do you really not understand or are you really a fool?

418
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,590
It's so obvious. President Tang is jealous.

419
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:50,640
Only when a man feels threatened by another man

420
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,280
would he act so childishly.

421
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,750
Don't talk nonsense. We only have a working relationship.

422
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:00,110
Stop that. What working relationship?

423
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:03,540
Ask yourself and listen to your heart.

424
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:07,560
President Tang personally handled the contract, such a trivial matter.

425
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:11,320
However you put it, he's the boss at a major company.

426
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,820
Do you think he doesn't have any capable assistants?

427
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:17,380
It's clearly because he wanted to spend time with you.

428
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,970
You sure have a rich imagination.

429
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:23,840
In regards to the embroidery workshop,

430
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,630
if President Tang had not gone in person,

431
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:29,830
my master wouldn't have signed the contract.

432
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:32,860
You just keep stubbornly denying it.

433
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,110
But I'm starting to wonder

434
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:39,870
about Fang Xiaoyu. What are his motives?

435
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,650
I got it! Fang Xiaoyu must like you, too.

436
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:49,950
That's why he keeps trying to find opportunities to get close to you.

437
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:51,930
Say, Shen Jiaxi,

438
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:55,860
if you used your imagination for your designs,

439
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:59,160
you'd have already broken out of Asia and gone global.

440
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,790
Let's go.

441
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:06,360
By the way, did you decide on your design for the final round of the competition?

442
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,010
Don't mention it.

443
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:11,090
It's much harder than "Misty Rain in Jiangnan."

444
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,570
"Ancient Path of the West" is quite good.

445
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,200
How is that good?

446
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,940
Look. What we're doing is Chinese Style.

447
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,130
It follows an ancient practice.

448
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:23,010
Look at the ancient road again.

449
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:25,810
Westerly wind gusts and desolation.

450
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:32,030
Look at you. When it comes to serious matters, you just wilt.

451
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,550
Bring up the energy you showed when talking about gossip just now.

452
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,330
Carry that energy forward.

453
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:39,460
I am wilted, though.

454
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,910
My mind is really empty right now.

455
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:46,510
It's empty. Listen to it! It's all empty!

456
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:51,810
I've already thought about it. I'm doing something with the "Ancient Tea Horse Road."

457
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,610
No, Mo Fei! You're killing me!

458
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:57,960
How can you have inspiration so quickly?

459
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,710
What should I do? I'm so pitiful.

460
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:04,130
How about this then? Let me have Director Fang.

461
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:07,240
I'll ask him to let me in the backdoor.

462
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,590
Why don't I bundle up both Director Fang and President Tang up

463
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:14,130
and deliver them to you? You can pay for them once you receive them.

464
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,160
No need. One is enough. I can't digest both of them.

465
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,610
Enough. I don't want to joke with you anymore. Hey, you know how to do batik. Right?

466
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,060
What do you want to do?

467
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,190
I don't want to make something especially pompous.

468
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:29,450
I want to make something that goes back to the original simplicity of Chinese style.

469
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,380
Batik?

470
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:36,210
I want to make patterns that no one has seen before.

471
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:38,470
What do you want from me then?

472
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,860
I want to be a totem of the Miao nationality.
(The Miao is a group of linguistically-related minority peoples)

473
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:44,090
I know this isn't available for purchase in the marketplace.

474
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:46,150
So, I beg you.

475
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:49,720
Yes, I am from Guizhou, and I do know a little batik.

476
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,190
But a totem of the Miao nationality is too difficult. I can't do it. Find someone else.

477
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:56,560
Don't say no. The first time is new, the second time is old. If you don't try it, how do you know?

478
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,900
No, Sis. Aren't you a bit too daring?

479
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,640
It takes time to make batik.

480
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,760
I know that. I just want some basic elements. So what do you say?

481
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,550
Let me take you somewhere. Let's go.

482
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,340
Boss.

483
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,470
You're here.

484
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:17,090
It's like this. We are participating in a competition, so we would like to borrow your batik workshop.

485
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:19,210
Oh, yes, yes.

486
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:21,790
Here.

487
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:22,970
- Thank you, Boss.
- Thank you, Boss.

488
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,410
- Thank you. We're leaving then.
- All right.

489
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:27,090
- Bye-bye.
- Good bye.

490
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:29,710
[Batik Workshop]

491
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:42,600
Careful. Wait a minute. Okay.

492
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,380
- Is that okay?
- That's about it.

493
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:51,430
Let's prepare other materials then.

494
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:53,120
Let's go.

495
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,740
Listen, you must hold your breath.

496
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:00,170
Hold my breath? What is it?

497
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:09,410
It's dye. Persimmon red dye. I told you to hold your breath but you wouldn't listen.

498
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,960
It's too stinky! My goodness!

499
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,450
I told you this is made with green persimmons.

500
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:17,120
That was fermented for a year. It's very precious.

501
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,760
If they weren't Teacher Pan's friend, they wouldn't have sold it to us.

502
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,840
This is suffocating. It almost killed me.

503
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,920
You should've listened to me. All right, all right then.

504
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,430
Why don't you take it and let's go blend it in.

505
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,470
Go. Hurry up.

506
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:30,230
Me?

507
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,950
How is it?

508
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,890
Excellent.

509
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,970
This is the fabric that she is planning to use in the competition.

510
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:30,170
What is it, Brother Xuan?

511
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,470
- Just concentrate on driving.
- Okay.

512
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:40,520
Look straight ahead!

513
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,370
It's okay.

514
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:05,240
Please sit.

515
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,930
Director Fang, your chair is dirty. I'll wipe it for you.

516
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:11,590
It's not just dirty. It's quite warm.

517
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:14,030
Please sit. Please sit.

518
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,710
What's the matter? Say it!

519
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:28,370
That... Your father...

520
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:29,910
You two are in contact again?

521
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:32,930
No, no. Your father is the one who called

522
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,990
and asked you to go home.

523
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:36,230
Why does he want me back?

524
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:38,290
He didn't say.

525
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:44,750
I think maybe your father misses you and is concerned about you.

526
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:48,980
He's concerned about me? He only cares about that woman.

527
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:52,280
Director Fang, in any case, I've relayed the message. I'll go back to work now.

528
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,870
Stop right there.

529
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,390
Come with me to do something.

530
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,820
Come on.

531
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,860
What is it?

532
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,350
Come in.

533
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:19,650
Hello, Miss Mo.

534
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:21,610
Hello. You are...?

535
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:24,490
I am Fang Xiaoyu's assistant, Li Qi.

536
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,020
- Hello.
- Hello.

537
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,950
Do you need something?

538
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:32,080
I've been asked by Mr. Fang Xiaoyu to give you something today.

539
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,750
What is it?

540
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:35,820
Please come this way.

541
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,350
Oh, okay.
