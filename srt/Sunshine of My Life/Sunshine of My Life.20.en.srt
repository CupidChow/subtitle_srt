00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,330
No, I don't need help.

167
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:07,990
I have communicated with the higher levels of SLC.

168
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:11,130
She said a good amount of people on the board of directors

169
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,020
were moved by the conditions Cayman gave

170
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,860
but our Cayman has our own exclusive cotton field.

171
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,260
It is enough to guarantee high-quality clothing fabric,

172
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:24,970
so I believe there's really no need to acquire SLC.

173
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,320
Who suggested that?

174
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,240
I think it was Shanghai Cayman's

175
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,280
new chairman who suggested that.

176
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,420
Shanghai Cayman has changed to a new chairman?

177
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,300
Why didn't you tell me?

178
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,210
How would I know? I didn't know either.

179
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,910
How would I tell you?

180
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,530
My status is not high enough.

181
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:53,290
You've never asked me about the company.

182
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,140
Why do you suddenly have so many questions?

183
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,850
Haven't I been turning over a new leaf lately?

184
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:09,260
Let's go. Everyone's waiting to see your new design.

185
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,360
The main concept of this work is...

186
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,290
batik.

187
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:27,550
When we first saw it, we were stunned.

188
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,450
This type of batik seems

189
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:33,990
to be different from the one in traditional Indonesian clothing.

190
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:38,240
This is because I used Chinese tailoring.

191
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,150
This is a very interesting combination.

192
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:44,850
The same craft in different countries

193
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,340
create different results.

194
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,190
What if we use batik

195
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:55,660
as our main couture theme?

196
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,870
Good idea.

197
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,630
What do you think, Fang?

198
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,500
It is really interesting.

199
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,490
Here we have Chinese, American, Denmark,

200
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:08,390
Spanish, and Japanese people.

201
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:12,640
Different countries have their own way to make batik.

202
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:17,260
I believe the outcome will be very impressive.

203
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:22,930
Very well, we'll use batik for this haute couture show.

204
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,660
Congratulations Director Fang for returning to work.

205
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:53,860
Stop provoking me. Do you think I don't know what you mean?

206
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,520
What's wrong? I didn't say anything. Don't be angry.

207
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,570
Are you unhappy because Miss Mo is with Tang Mingxuan?

208
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:05,650
Can you stop meddling in my personal life from now on?

209
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:08,590
Don't worry, I won't meddle in your personal life.

210
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,630
I definitely won't bother you.

211
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:19,060
That Tang Mingxuan is too high profile, so everyone knows.

212
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,030
Keep making excuses.

213
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:24,200
I didn't. It's Tang Mingxuan... I didn't mean to follow him.

214
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,130
It is Uncle Zhong who asked me to follow him.

215
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,780
Are you out of your mind?

216
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,970
- No, no, really...
- Get out!

217
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,880
- Calm down, calm down.
- Get out!

218
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,240
Be careful with your hand.

219
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:51,190
Hurry up! You're so slow, we're going to miss the flight.

220
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,810
There are too many things

221
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,840
and we left very late.

222
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,470
Then, didn't you know to call me earlier?

223
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:01,060
I did. But you took three hours to get ready and take pictures.

224
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,950
So are you blaming me right now?

225
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,860
No, no, I didn't think everything through—

226
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,200
Enough, enough. Stop talking. Hurry up.

227
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,080
Don't delay the actual matter.

228
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,440
You're here.

229
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,450
Sister Xiaoman, I have already contacted that Cheng Yang.

230
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,620
Oh really? Have you set a time for our meeting?

231
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,310
He said he doesn't have free time lately so...

232
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:40,140
What? No free time?

233
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,310
Didn't you tell him we're from Haiyao Group?

234
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,250
I-I did.

235
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,410
Did you not tell him I'm Haiyao's President Zhu's wife?

236
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:58,130
If you don't tell him I'm President Zhu's wife, why would he believe in the conditions I offer him?

237
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,590
If he does not believe in my conditions and does not come to Haiyao,

238
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:03,420
how will I explain it to those old men?

239
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:09,670
Let me tell you! If President Zhu does not let me manage Haiyao,

240
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:12,740
then you can forget about that big "red envelope" (bonus).

241
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,580
Okay, Sister Xiaoman, I understand.

242
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,900
I'll go contact him again.

243
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,800
Go, go quickly.

244
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,540
- Mo Fei.
- Duoduo, why are you here?

245
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,050
I'm here to pick you up.

246
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:27,270
I've bought my ticket to go back.

247
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:31,260
So, no matter what homework you have today, you cannot go back first.

248
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,390
You have to have a meal with me.

249
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:38,120
Okay. Today, we'll eat whatever you want.

250
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,070
You can decide where we'll go but... I'm paying.

251
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:45,330
Well then, I'll have to pick a restaurant with more handsome guys.

252
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,200
To make your President Tang feel jealous.

253
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,630
Right, we should make him jealous.

254
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,930
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

255
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,610
Director Bai, because I really love my girlfriend,

256
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:09,290
so I...

257
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,940
Cheng Yang, I couldn't tell.

258
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,700
You have such a beautiful pair of "peach blossom" eyes,
 (Peach blossoms are associated with love and attracting the opposite gender)

259
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,770
yet you are so faithful.

260
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,120
For your girlfriend, you're considering returning to China.

261
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,020
Your girlfriend must feel really touched knowing that.

262
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,730
We have been together for over ten years. Our relationship is great,

263
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,650
so in regards to such important future matters,

264
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,720
I have to discuss this with her.

265
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,220
I understand.

266
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,560
But... no matter what,

267
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,350
our Haiyao Group's doors are always open for you.

268
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:43,760
We'll cover all your living expenses and salary in Shanghai.

269
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,340
As long as you are willing to come to Haiyao, you can make any requests.

270
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,580
Director Bai, you are too nice.

271
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:57,370
Actually, the salary you are offering is much more than what I wanted.

272
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,040
Then I will wait for your good news.

273
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:12,190
Mo Fei, with my leaving,

274
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:15,340
I really am a bit worried about you.

275
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,360
You are too kind.

276
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,630
Also, you're not precautious.

277
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,930
Say, how did you grow up this big?

278
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,720
Don't worry about me.

279
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,220
As for you, what plans do you have for when you return?

280
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:32,620
Also... do you really feel at ease leaving Cheng Yang here?

281
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,820
I want to have some peace.

282
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,270
As for what will happen later on, we'll see after I think it through.

283
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:42,100
I'm also not sure when it comes to relationships.

284
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,100
But...

285
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,620
What?

286
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:51,000
Can I continue to communicate with him?

287
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,200
Mo Fei!

288
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,700
Let me explain.

289
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,900
I feel like he really has talent and we'll only talk about work.

290
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,800
We won't communicate otherwise.

291
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,050
No.

292
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:06,090
Also, you're not allowed to secretly report to him about me.

293
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,050
I won't.

294
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:11,320
- Just work matters.
- Director Bai, your compact has fallen down. Don't move, I'll get it.

295
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:20,070
- Cheng Yang?
- You're welcome.

296
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:24,270
My saying that he has "his feet in two different boats" (in two relationships) is me underestimating him.

297
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,710
Bai Xiaoman?

298
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:29,230
Y-You know that girl?

299
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,240
No, I have to go see

300
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,580
- their faces.
- What are you doing?!

301
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,960
I'm going to flip that table over, don't bother with me.

302
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,610
Duoduo?

303
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,600
- Duoduo, what are you doing?
- What's wrong with you?

304
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,930
What are you doing?! Who are you?!

305
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,910
- What am I doing?! I hit you!
- Sorry! Sorry!

306
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,580
Sorry, Director Bai.

307
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,710
- Duoduo, what are you doing?
- No, what are you guys doing?

308
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:02,040
Mo Fei? I bet you started this, right?

309
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,590
Are you insane? Blaming everything on me?

310
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:07,310
Did I hit you?

311
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,830
Duoduo, you misunderstood.

312
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,600
This is Haiyao's Executive Assistant Bai. She came to offer me a contract to sign.

313
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,460
Signing a contract or holding hands?
 (Signing and holding, sound the same in Chinese)

314
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,820
I saw very clearly over there, you two were holding hands!

315
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,280
Let me tell you Cheng Yang, we are done.

316
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,260
We are completely done! Scram!

317
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,180
- Duoduo!
- Duoduo!

318
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,510
Cheng Yang, you're with them, aren't you?

319
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:29,170
Director Bai, I will explain to you later.

320
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,940
Duoduo!

321
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,920
Duoduo, calm down. What happened today was probably a misunderstanding.

322
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,230
Bai Xiaoman came to find him because of work.

323
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,650
Bai Xiaoman is your classmate, so I don't believe you.

324
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:45,160
- Do you remember what I told you before?
- Duoduo.

325
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,020
- I have grudges with only one classmate.
- Can you let me explain?

326
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:53,020
Bai Xiaoman is the type who "wishes for the whole world to be in chaos".
(T/N: idiom - likes to cause trouble)

327
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,210
Really?

328
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,470
Yes! That's why I didn't know she would come to France.

329
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:59,120
- And, even more so, I didn't know she knows Cheng Yang.
- That's not hard.

330
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,180
He won some kind of newcomer award.

331
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,950
Duoduo, she pulled my hand to get on my good side.

332
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,080
This is the first time I've met her.

333
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,160
You seemed to enjoy holding her hand earlier.

334
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,740
But you saw it!

335
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,600
I avoided her the moment she touched me.

336
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:18,630
Duoduo, Director Bai came here to offer me a contract.

337
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,770
She gave me a very promising opportunity.

338
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:25,450
But since you don't like it, then no matter how good the opportunity is, I won't go.

339
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:29,080
Duoduo, since we were young,

340
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,090
over all these years, I swear

341
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:34,170
I've never thought of being with someone else.

342
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,820
Mo Fei, I'm leaving for Shanghai in a few days.

343
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,480
I'm going to go back to my room to pack.

344
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,970
Duoduo, you're going back to China?

345
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:50,480
I'll go back with you!

346
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,920
Give her some time.

347
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,530
In a few days, she won't be angry anymore.

348
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:04,050
Really?

349
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,630
Thank you, Mo Fei.

350
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,540
I feel like, not choosing Haiyao

351
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,260
is a good decision.

352
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,440
But if you insist on making Chinoiserie designs,

353
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,490
I suggest you choose Mingyuan.

354
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:24,160
Mingyuan has a brand called Songtang.

355
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,970
They're a veteran brand in Chinoiserie clothing.

356
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,200
Plus, their sales are pretty stable.

357
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,740
Most importantly, they want to go global.

358
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,820
From what I understand, they're currently

359
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,720
in contact with SLC.

360
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,980
Mingyuan Group's President Tang has contacted me before.

361
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,500
What I'm hesitant about is that Songtang

362
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,360
hasn't changed its style in the last few decades.

363
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,450
So if I go there, I don't know

364
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,280
- if I can give them any new developments—
- Is that the reason why?

365
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,790
I especially want you to join Mingyuan

366
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,280
to change the current situation.

367
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,940
Don't worry.

368
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,210
I'll give you enough space

369
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:07,530
to lead in designs and give you the best team.

370
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:10,300
As well as include the production line you've mentioned.

371
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,920
You don't have to answer right now.

372
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,920
You can go home, research it, and consider it some more.

373
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:21,280
President Tang, I will consider it carefully.

374
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,360
Let's meet again in Shanghai.

375
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,170
I hope so.

376
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,580
What are you doing here this late at night?

377
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,970
I just got a call. I need to rush back to have a shareholder meeting.

378
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,110
- I have to leave right away.
- In such a rush?

379
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,600
So I came to see you.

380
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:50,520
Don't leave.

381
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:55,100
I'll be back soon, okay?

382
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,630
What are you trying to do?

383
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,970
I can't bear to see you leave.

384
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,920
Let's go take a stroll. All right?

385
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,570
Stand here. Don't move.

386
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,580
I'll buy you ice cream.

387
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,520
After I leave, take good care of yourself.

388
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,720
Don't forget to eat because of work. Okay?

389
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:29,440
Okay, I know. You've said it many times already.

390
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:33,540
I'm leaving soon and I'm worried about you.

391
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,000
That ice cream was so delicious.

392
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,130
I think of my brother when I eat ice cream.

393
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:43,450
My brother loves ice cream.

394
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:45,780
What a good sister.

395
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,480
You're always thinking about your little brother.

396
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:52,930
I'm always thinking about you, too.

397
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,720
Do you treat your little brother very well?

398
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:03,080
Do I not treat you well?

399
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:07,670
Well. Especially well.

400
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,450
What is it?

401
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,530
I can't bear to leave you.

402
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,460
I can't bear to see you leave either.

403
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,580
Don't go then.

404
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,830
I have to go back to work.

405
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,700
I'll miss you.

406
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,580
What? You want to go to Mingyuan Group?

407
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,280
Yes.

408
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,880
Why? Was what I offered not good enough?

409
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,760
No, no, Director Bai,

410
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,570
this has nothing to do with money.

411
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,440
Actually, Mingyuan has long been in contact with me.

412
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,250
It's just that I hadn't made my decision yet.

413
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:06,310
You're just now telling me? That's a bit insincere.

414
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,920
I've been talking to you for over a month now.

415
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,160
- I've never heard of Mingyuan being in contact with you.
- Director Bai,

416
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,720
Haiyao and Mingyuan are competitors.

417
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,240
I'm afraid it wasn't appropriate for me to bring it up.

418
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,760
I really admire your talent.

419
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,610
So I hope you can tell me the truth.

420
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,440
You going to Mingyuan Group,

421
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,280
does it have anything to do with Mo Fei?

422
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,080
It really is because of her?

423
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,210
What is she trying to do?

424
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:44,080
When we were in school, she was against me in every way.

425
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,930
Now she's stealing my talents.

426
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,610
Director Bai, I don't think your saying "stealing my talents" is appropriate.

427
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:53,360
I've never worked for Haiyao.

428
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,440
Okay.

429
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,990
Then I'll tell you honestly.

430
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,370
It was President Tang who personally came to talk to me

431
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,560
which is why I decided to go there.

432
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:13,250
I'm sorry, Director Bai, I still have other arrangements.

433
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,330
I won't keep you company then.

434
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,450
- Again, sorry.
- All right, Cheng Yang.

435
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:21,940
Don't think your future will be bright just because you're going to Mingyuan Group.

436
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:24,360
Shanghai is a very small place.

437
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,570
We will easily bump into each other.

438
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,760
You do your best.
(T/N: Idiom for good luck to you)

439
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:37,280
It's Mo Fei again.

440
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,670
I'm not done with you.

441
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,840
- Where are you?
- I'm at the hotel.

442
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,450
Do you know where Mo Fei works?

443
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:58,640
- Do you want to know now?
- Yes, I want to know now!

444
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,350
Hello.

445
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:22,390
Is there anything you need help with?

446
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,660
Of course.

447
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,450
I want to try on that dress.

448
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:35,860
Okay. I'll go get your size. You may wait over there for me.

449
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,370
The smallest size. Thank you.

450
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,730
Salesperson Mo,

451
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,860
the zipper of my dress is in the back.

452
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,850
I can't seem to pull it up myself.

453
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:14,470
Can I bother you to pull it up for me?

454
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,500
Okay. I'm coming.

455
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,840
What do you think?

456
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,740
Can you help me get my shoes? Just now,

457
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,100
I left them in the fitting room.

458
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,220
Okay.

459
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,600
I'm sorry I wasn't clear.

460
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,850
Not this pair. The two new ones I just bought.

461
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,910
Thank you.

462
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:14,050
Please help me open them.

463
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:19,330
Not this pair.

464
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,480
That pair.

465
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:39,480
Why is this dress so long? It's too long. This won't do.

466
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,600
I will have to bother you, Salesperson Mo, to help me with it again.

467
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,510
Say, don't cross the line, Bai Xiaoman.

468
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,740
How did I cross the line?

469
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:49,010
Haven't I been asking you for help?

470
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:52,960
Isn't it your job to help customers try on clothes?

471
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,500
What? Do Paris salespeople only know

472
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,540
how to date and steal other people's things?

473
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:08,150
You didn't buy these pairs of shoes at our store. I'm not obligated to help you put them on.

474
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,960
- Are you done? Goodbye.
- Hey!

475
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,930
This shoe...

476
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:18,040
Why did you scratch it?

477
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,880
Take a look.

478
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,090
I just bought this. I really like it.

479
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:27,320
You have to compensate me at its original price.

480
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,940
Mo Fei! What's the matter?

481
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,360
Is this woman causing you trouble again?

482
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,840
This lady said I damaged her shoes.

483
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,850
Do you have evidence?

484
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,150
What kind of attitude is that? Where is your manager?

485
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:43,300
I want to complain about you.

486
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,780
I'm warning you. Don't point your finger at others when you are talking.

487
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,470
That's very rude.

488
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:51,190
How is my attitude bad?

489
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:54,420
You don't have any proof, right?

490
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:58,420
It's okay. I have evidence.

491
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,800
This surveillance camera. When I brought your shoes out, it was under that camera.

492
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,880
Whether I damaged your shoes or someone else did something beforehand,

493
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,480
we can find out at the police station. Let's go.

494
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,360
That's right. Let's go to the police station.

495
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,250
Who is afraid of who? Let's go.

496
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,910
- Salesperson Mo, I'm in your store.
- What?

497
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,720
Don't act rashly.

498
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,840
What's happened?

499
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:23,490
Do you think I'm stupid? I won't go to the police station with you.

500
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:25,680
I don't know French. If I go,

501
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,910
you'll say nonsensical things.

502
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,760
This one, this one, and this one.

503
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,820
Wrap them up for me.

504
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,200
I'll pay by card. I don't care about spending this little money.

505
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:43,260
Aren't your feet cold?

506
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,390
Mingxuan.

507
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:55,010
You're back. I'll take it.

508
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,280
No need. Yang Guang will take it.

509
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:01,090
I heard you successfully met with Miya.

510
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:04,720
Uncle Tang is very happy. He said he wants to drink with you tonight.

511
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,510
Let's have a drink together.

512
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,120
All right.

513
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,950
- Here. Have some.
- Mingxuan,

514
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:17,190
it really wasn't easy for you to meet Miya in Paris this time.

515
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:20,150
- I must congratulate you.
- Here, Dad.

516
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:22,390
Eat some more.

517
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,580
I'd like to share something with everyone.

518
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,290
- Go on.
- This time in Paris...

519
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:33,380
Mingxuan, don't keep talking idly, the dishes will get cold.

520
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,020
These are all your favorites.

521
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:40,110
Mom, what I want to say is serious. It's not idle talk.

522
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:43,320
Let's do this... Mingxuan, we'll talk about it a bit later.

523
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,820
Xueling just came back from Milan.

524
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,980
She's also been busy with the company.

525
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:51,350
I heard that she met quite a few excellent designers. Isn't that right?

526
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:54,950
Yes. The Chinese designers I've contacted this time

527
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:58,980
are very pleased with Mingyuan's environment and resources.

528
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:02,920
In addition, Fashion Daily's overseas edition

529
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:07,390
has a hot fashion website that already has sales among the top-10 ranking.

530
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:11,390
So these designers really want to come to China to further their careers.

531
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,700
That's good.

532
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:18,760
Xueling is so capable. Mingxuan, hurry and thank Xueling.

533
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,440
Thank you for your hard work.

534
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:28,070
Also, other than seeing these outstanding designers, there is another pleasant surprise.

535
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:30,270
- What else is there?
- Tell us.

536
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:35,210
JK Design Studio in Milan wants to collaborate with us to jointly release

537
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:40,330
a design with Chinoiserie elements to be the grand finale piece in next season's Milan Fashion Week.

538
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:43,150
Excellent, you even made contact with JK.

539
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,210
It's not easy.

540
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:47,790
Speaking of that, it was quite an accidental accord after discord.

541
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:51,280
I was competing with JK's HR for the same designer.

542
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,170
After a few rounds of going back and forth, they actually got interested in our new line of clothes.

543
00:36:56,170 --> 00:37:02,010
They said that Mingyuan's clothes can shine in the international fashion week.

544
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,380
So they came to us.

545
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:06,400
This is a good beginning.

546
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,980
In my opinion, you should just quit contacting that French company.

547
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,800
Going again and again takes too much effort and has no result.

548
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,110
This company that Xueling found is quite good. We're not short of big companies to partner with Mingyuan.

549
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,650
Dan Dan, you don't understand the company's affairs.

550
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:24,450
For Mingyuan to expand, it must enter the international market.

551
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,400
Okay, okay! I won't say anymore.

552
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,550
Yes.

553
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,640
Nevertheless, this is a good thing.

554
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:35,570
Mingxuan, you should make a toast to Xueling.

555
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:38,520
Hurry and eat. Eat more.

556
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,090
Come on, come on.

557
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,690
- Let's all toast.
- Let's drink.

558
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:42,690
Cheers.

559
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:45,210
Thank you, Xueling.

560
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:47,160
You've worked hard, Xueling.

561
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,580
You don't need to give me a ride back, Mingxuan.

562
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,800
You just came back from France. You must be tired.

563
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:11,160
I'm probably jet-legged.

564
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,670
You should rest early then.

565
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:16,520
If you are tired, just take a few more days off.

566
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,050
Xueling.

567
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:21,080
I'm a bit tired so I'll head home now.

568
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,560
This kid.

569
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,730
He took a trip to Paris and was led astray by that girl.

570
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:42,080
Don't be anxious.

571
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,390
How can I not be anxious?

572
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:44,770
You have to trust your son.

573
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:47,660
He isn't that easily led astray.

574
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,520
Didn't you notice at the dining table?

575
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,880
If I hadn't suppressed it

576
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,510
and immediately interrupted, he was going to talk about it in front of Xueling.

577
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,610
You understand Mingxuan's personality.

578
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:59,460
It's his mouth. If he wants to talk, we can't stop him.

579
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,440
But we both must suppress it.

580
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,060
If he says it in front of Xueling, then there's no room to go back.

581
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:09,930
But I really don't think there is necessarily anything between him and Xueling.

582
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:13,640
That's why we have to help and get them together.

583
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,620
How can we help?

584
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:19,690
Isn't this j-just forcing them to be together?

585
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,130
"The melon that you forcibly take isn't sweet."

586
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:26,630
He is young and doesn't understand, but we must be clear about it.

587
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,430
This kid is really something.

588
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:30,870
Except for Xueling, I won't acknowledge anyone.

589
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,760
Is that so?

590
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:41,770
You've come at the right time. I want to talk about Xueling with you. Come, sit.

591
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,320
I wanted to chat earlier, but you ignored me.

592
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,560
Now you want to chat.

593
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:56,550
Your marriage and dating life is a serious matter. You really can't make a mess.

594
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:59,830
You should listen to your parents' opinions. We are only considering what's good for you.

595
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,900
Mom, I'm in such a difficult spot.

596
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:06,080
I'm already grown, yet I can't decide on my dating life?

597
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,400
You can decide, but you should still listen to your parents' opinions.

598
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,320
Both of us just hope you'll be happy.

599
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:17,690
That's right. Three years ago, for the company's benefit,

600
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:20,090
you wanted me to marry someone I didn't like.

601
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:23,790
What was the result? Was I happy?

602
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,650
I admit that I bear the responsibility for that matter. I'm sorry.

603
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:31,900
I didn't think it through

604
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:35,410
and forced you two to be together, leading to the current consequence.

605
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:39,600
But Xueling and Qian Qian aren't the same person, and it's a different situation.

606
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,620
Xueling has contributed all these years for your sake. We all know that.

607
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:46,370
For this family, this company, and you,

608
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:48,250
she has devoted herself wholeheartedly.

609
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:51,670
- If—
- Mom, if you continue like this, history will just repeat itself.

610
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:55,060
Yes, Xueling has contributed a lot to the company, but it's her duty.

611
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,940
I also know that she has treated me very well personally.

612
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:01,260
But say, if a girl is nice to me, do I have to be with her?

613
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:06,420
Then, won't I have to be together with many girls at the same time?

614
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,730
But you two are different. You are childhood sweethearts.

615
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:10,910
You grew up together and know each other well.

616
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:13,300
Sure, then I'll marry two women. Is that all right?

617
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:18,210
Who talks to their mom like this? Marry two women?

618
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,800
Everything that I've done is for your sake.

619
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:23,900
What's wrong with Xueling?

620
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,960
Do you have to marry that Mo Fei? You are being ungrateful, don't you understand?

621
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,980
Okay, okay.

622
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:34,520
Dad, you take care of her. Your wife is hitting people.

623
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:39,700
Mingxuan.

624
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:42,680
Look.

625
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,720
Talk and talk, and it goes nowhere.

626
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,610
It's always the same words. Turn it around and roll it over—

627
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:51,410
That's right. I'm so annoyed, really annoyed. I didn't want to say those words either.

628
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:53,320
Why do you have to interfere in his affairs?

629
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,280
Why can't I interfere? He is my son and I'm his mother.

630
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,400
I want him to be happy.

631
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,030
The more you interfere, the more unhappy he is. Isn't it obvious?

632
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:05,420
"Freedom of love" has been said for a hundred years. Why doesn't that happen in our family?

633
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:08,280
It's because he is young, and he doesn't see things clearly.

634
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,360
♫ I say you're an April day ♫

635
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:29,410
♫ The sound of your laughter lights everything up ♫

636
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:32,930
♫ Even the spirit of a light breeze ♫

637
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:38,950
♫ In the midst of the brightness and beauty of spring,
shift as one would in a dance ♫

638
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:44,220
♫ You're the mist on a dry April day ♫

639
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:48,570
♫ The gentle breeze blown during dusk ♫

640
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:52,190
♫ The unintentional sparkle of the planetesimal ♫

641
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:58,220
♫ The fine rain that's sprinkled in front of the flower ♫

642
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:02,990
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

643
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:07,800
♫ Like a shy water lotus that bows to a cool breeze ♫

644
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:12,490
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

645
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:17,430
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫

646
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:22,110
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

647
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:28,270
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫

648
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:41,870
♫ You're like the ivory field after snowflakes ♫

649
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:46,230
♫ You're the round moon every night ♫

650
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:49,060
♫ You're the naïve ♫

651
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:56,310
♫ white lotus that floats on the water ripples of your dream ♫

652
00:43:56,310 --> 00:44:01,490
♫ You're the flower blossoms of tree after tree ♫

653
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:05,920
♫ The swallow twittering within the beams ♫

654
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,560
♫ You are love, hope, and warmth ♫

655
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:13,900
♫ You're an April day ♫

656
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:18,610
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

657
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:23,460
♫ The bittersweet parting words of "take care" ♫

658
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:28,200
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

659
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:34,890
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫
