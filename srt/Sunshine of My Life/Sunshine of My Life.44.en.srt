[First Township of the Chinese She People]

5
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,650
I've really learned a lot from the She people this time.

6
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,700
I'm planning to use these color elements

7
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,850
to improve the outfits for my fashion show.

8
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,020
Do you know? I really like what Eric said.

9
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,810
"Do not seek timelessness, but keep people longing for more."

10
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,040
Perhaps it's because we are both artists.

11
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,200
So, in this respect, I feel exactly the same way as him.

12
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,100
I don't expect my works

13
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,840
to be timeless.

14
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,310
But I hope to find

15
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,360
those who understand

16
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,900
what I'm trying to express at the moment.

17
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,300
I suddenly have a feeling.

18
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,200
Your show will become a classic one.

19
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,960
- Really?
- I'm just messing with you.

20
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,550
Of course, it's true.

21
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,250
- You're messing with me again.
- Come here.

22
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,700
- What?
- I liked this when I first saw it.

23
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,090
Let me see you sit inside.

24
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,150
I can't go in.

25
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,130
The ugly lady is getting married.

26
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,590
You're the ugly one.

27
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,020
- Why are you mad?
- What?

28
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,820
I'm not mad.

29
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,110
Lu Zhu, would I not be able to tell whether you're mad?

30
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,270
I just didn't expect the director to be a female, and she's quite beautiful too.

31
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,930
The point is she kept touching you.

32
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,760
What does her gender have to do with me?

33
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,650
Besides, I came here to work. Acting like this just means you don't trust me.

34
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,290
I do trust you.

35
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,490
I don't trust her.

36
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,370
Well, your attitude is a bit unprofessional.

37
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,100
Lu Zhu, if you are against it, I didn't have to come to this audition.

38
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:53,280
But if you don't trust me, I'd really feel quite hurt.

39
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,790
Mo Fan, don't be upset.

40
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,890
This time... it was indeed quite sudden.

41
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,300
I really didn't know that it was a female director.

42
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,180
I don't know what was with me at that moment.

43
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,820
I just didn't...

44
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,330
I didn't want her to be so close to you.

45
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,200
Do you think I'm upset because of that?

46
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,230
Aren't you?

47
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:20,760
I'm upset because

48
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,890
by not trusting me, you're doubting yourself.

49
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:27,440
Look. You are so cute and pretty.

50
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,230
You're even career-oriented.

51
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,930
Where would I find such a good girlfriend like you?

52
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,510
So you must know

53
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:39,300
that no matter how others treat me, I won't fall for them.

54
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,540
My friend who's full of himself is getting worse now.

55
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,230
You can even open a class to teach others how to give compliments now.

56
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,620
Why would I compliment others?

57
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,560
I'll only compliment my little goddess.

58
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,010
Then, can you forgive your little goddess?

59
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,320
I was wrong this time. I'm sorry.

60
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,400
I won't doubt you again.

61
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,410
No, I mean I won't doubt myself anymore.

62
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,630
Let's go.

63
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,680
It's so beautiful here at night.

64
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,540
There're so many stars.

65
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,890
Are you cold?

66
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,680
Oh, right.

67
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,960
A gift for you.

68
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,140
What is it?

69
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,930
Take a look.

70
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,950
How come you brought this? Why do you still have it?

71
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,590
Take a closer look.

72
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,650

Boss's Lady?

75
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,930
I don't want to be the boss's lady. I want to be the boss.

76
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:01,330
Little girl, you're quite ambitious.

77
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,780
I'm the boss and you're my wife.

78
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,530
Aren't you the boss's lady then?

79
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:09,820
You're the boss? Says who? Do you have any proof? Show me then.

Have a look.

82
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,690
I'm going to look carefully.

83

85
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:30,080
Before we were married, how did I not notice that you had such a childish side?

86
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,100
There's so much you haven't noticed yet.

87
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,690
You can take your time exploring me.

88

I'm your treasured husband.

89
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,140
Earlier, you didn't know what the path to one's heart was. Right?

90
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,500
It's right here.

91
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,080
This is the place that the GPS cannot reach.

92
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,160
Only you know the way to it.

93
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,290
As your wife,

94
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:10,330
right now, I'm going to... kiss you!

95

Don't bother me.

101
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,160
Wake up.

102
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,070
Get up. Come on. Let's have breakfast.

103
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,790
I'm up.

104
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,790
How are you up?

105
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,480
I'm up.

106
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,460
How are you up?

107
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,060
I'm up.

108
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,770
- Get up. Come on.
- I'm up.

109
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:22,700
Don't we have a lot to do today?

110
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,780
- Come over.
- Get up.

111
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,480
- Come here.
- Stop messing around.

112
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,800
Just a bit longer.

113
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,990
We still need to check out the Chinese silk tapestry craft.

114
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,140
Mingxuan, I'll take a look over there.

115
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,090
Go on.

116
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,680
Miss Mo, this way.

117
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,270
- Thank you.
- No worries.

118
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,710
Let me introduce this person to you. She's a veteran craftswoman of silk tapestry.

119
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,150
She's been doing this for 26 years.

120
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:08,310
The warp and weft of the silk tapestry seem to be a bit different from the ones we usually use.

121
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,700
You're right.

122
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,850
The longitudinal warp are these thin and lengthwise ones.

123
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,420
It uses thinner raw silk threads.

124
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,670
As for the horizontal ones, we use boiled silk threads instead.

125
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,800
We can see that for the colored parts in these patterns,

126
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,680
we all use these transverse wefts,

127
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,470
which are colored, boiled silk threads.

128
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,770
No wonder the weft needs to be inserted over and under the warp in silk tapestry.

129
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:35,050
These frames seem just like those pixels we use.

130
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,880
It's really not easy to create a picture.

131
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,890
How long would it take to complete this?

132
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:45,020
In general, finishing a piece takes many months or even over a year.

133
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,900
For this one, she's been working on it for a year now.

134
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,760
Look! Your blood pressure is high again.

135
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,950
This won't do. Let's go to the hospital, all right?

136
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,380
This is nothing new.

137
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,850
It's not necessary. I know my own body.

138
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,850
Let's not go to the hospital.

139
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,370
There's still so much for me to take care of at the company.

140
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,910
What can be more important than your health?

141
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,310
Just look at you.

142
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,960
Put aside work for now.

143
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,990
Let's go to the hospital first, all right?

144
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,010
No, there's really no need.

145
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,220
I know my own body.

146
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,230
Help me get a glass of water.

147
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,400
Bring me the medicine as well.

[Zhuang Yuerong]

150
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,130
- Is something going on?
- Yes.

151
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,710
It's your dad.

152

His blood pressure has been high these days.

153
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,560
I told him to go to the hospital but he won't listen to me.

154
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,610
Could you come back

155
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,680
and help convince him?

156
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:38,090
Okay, I'll go home when I have time.

157

Well... Xiaoyu.

158

something might happen to your dad.

160

This is celery juice.

166
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,850
It can help lower blood pressure.

167
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,140
It's coming back again. I feel dizzy when I lower my head.

168
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,640
Look at you. You're so dizzy.

169
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,330
Let's go to the hospital for a checkup, all right?

170
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,960
No need.

171
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,430
I just need a bit of rest.

172
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,300
Xiaoyu, you're here.

173
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,490
Your dad has been very dizzy these past few days.

174
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,620
I told him to go to the hospital but he won't listen.

175
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,630
Go talk to him.

176
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,790
Wait, w-why did you call him to come here?

177
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,970
Why won't you go to the hospital?

178
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,980
You want us all to be worried, don't you?

179
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,010
It's not a big deal.

180
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,800
I just need to lie down and rest a little.

181
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,420
Let's go. We're going to the hospital.

182
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,990
No, no, no.

183
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,080
Do you want Qian Qian to come and convince you instead?

184
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,660
I'm not that fragile.

185
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,770
Besides, Qian Qian's health is not better than mine.

186
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,540
Why would you make her worry?

187
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,620
Then, am I not worried?

188
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,200
Okay, I'll go.

189
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,530
Let's go.

190
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,340
It's that serious?

191
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,020
Yet, you can still be stubborn, refusing to go to the hospital.

192
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,610
Come on. I'll carry you.

193
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,720
Come on.

194
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,950
[Miss Xia Xueling]

195
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:44,550
Xueling, the gallery is cooperating with Star Art Studio

196
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,780
to hold an outdoor sketching activity

197
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,710
on Wednesday at 3:30 p.m.

198
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:51,970
I would like to invite you. Thank you.

199
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,080
Yan Xu,

200
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,040
I know that it's you.

201
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,290
Stop wasting your time on me.

202
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,910
I don't want you to become like me,

203
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,290
giving everything you have for the person you love

204
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:53,020
and getting no results in the end.

205
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,490
More than that, I don't want to accept your kindness

206
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,960
while I still have someone else in my heart.

207
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,510
Making you my "spare tire" without feeling guilty.

208
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,170
I like you.

209
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,090
That's my own issue.

210
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,210
I don't need your permission.

211
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,810
I believe that time can heal everything

212
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,120
and also witness everything.

213
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,390
Besides, I don't mind being your "spare tire,"

214
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:24,170
because it's not impossible for a "spare tire."

215
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,060
I can give you time.

216
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,960
I'm certain,

217
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,940
that one day,

218
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:36,400
I will finally hear you say you're willing to be with me.

219
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,620
You're back.

220
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,330
You've cleaned up so well.

221
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,950
I just casually cleaned up a little bit.

222
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,520
Come, let's eat.

223
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,850
Just let me do these things.

224
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:37,860
I've ordered your favorite.

225
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,720
What's the matter? Is it not good?

226
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,200
No, it tastes good.

227
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,970
Are you feeling unwell?

228
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,500
I...

229
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,690
I've found a job.

230
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:18,340
Really? That's great, Manman.

231
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,810
Shall we go out and celebrate?

232
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,770
There's no need.

233
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,080
I've rented a place and I probably will move out in a few days.

234
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,800
Why did you rent a place?

235
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,200
Haven't you been living here quite well?

236
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,250
Why waste money on that?

237
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,000
I feel quite bad for making you sleep on the couch for the past half-year.

238
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,220
I keep bothering you, so...

239
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,450
I'm fine.

240
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,180
I just come back to sleep at night. I'm busy during the day.

241
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:51,320
Mainly because my workplace is quite far from here.

242
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,650
It's quite troublesome to commute

243
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,880
so I've decided to move out.

244
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,770
Try this.

245
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,130
It feels quite nice here.

246
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,160
- Hello.
- Hi.

247
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,350
The uncle next door told me that

248
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:24,530
the wild gardenias on the hills have borne fruits and we can go pick them.

249
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,170
The wild gardenia is the fruit from the gardenia flower?

250
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,800
It can be made into a dye.

251
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,620
You're quite...

252
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,280
knowledgeable.

253
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,330
Do you know what color it is?

254
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,410
What color?

255
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:45,720
Then, do you know what the color of the yarn clothes excavated from Mawangdui ruins is?

256
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,360
- Yellow.
- Yes, it's yellow indeed.
- Hello.

257
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,540
Do you know that the gardenia fruit

258
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,300
in the past was used as a dye and was given as an offering to

259
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,200
the imperial family for making their clothes.

260
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,990
After pounding it into powder

261
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,460
and soaking in water,

262
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,390
you can extract the pigment, and then dye cloth with it.

263
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,290
That's incredible.

264
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,930
♫ You're a sweet and sour piece of candy ♫

265
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,860
The two of us being here

266
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,080
feels like living in seclusion.

267
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,500
♫ Many people come and go ♫

268
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,070
♫ I want to be your last visitor ♫

269
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:31,750
♫ So please don't be afraid anymore ♫

270
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,420
Why did you tie this thing to the basket for? What is this?

271
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:40,200
This has an auspicious meaning to the She people.

272
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,260
Legend says, as long as you give it to your loved one,

273
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:46,060
you can grow old together.

274
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,120
So I'm giving you this one that I made myself,

275
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,170
hoping that we can grow old together.

276
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,500
I love you.

277
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,540
I love you too.

278
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,960
♫ I want… ♫

279
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,780
You're awake.

280
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,730
I've boxed your medicine. The top row is for one day.

281
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,730
Morning, noon, and evening.

282
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:33,370
This is for the next day. Take them on time.

283
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:41,170
You and Auntie Zhuang keep repeating yourselves. Aren't you tired?

284
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,430
Aren't we just afraid that you'll forget?

285
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,300
Well, I'll get going now.

286
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,410
Xiaoyu.

287
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,300
Is there anything else?

288
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,230
Let's talk.

289
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,650
Sit.

290
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,730
Sit down.

291
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,910
Two things.

292
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:23,660
After you became the vice president at Cayman,

293
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,350
I'd seen your progress.

294
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,720
The company's executives

295
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,050
also recognize you.

296
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:36,170
So I think now is the right time. I've decided...

297
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:39,930
to have you attend the shareholders' meeting at Mingyuan on my behalf.

298
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:45,830
- For such an important matter, you should go yourself.
- No.

299
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,360
I'm old now. My energy and stamina

300
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,940
are not like before.

301
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:57,650
But Cayman is young and so are you.

302
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,600
I'm afraid that some of my thoughts

303
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,320
won't be able to keep up with you youngsters.

304
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,380
In addition,

305
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,170
I want to use this opportunity to retire from the frontline.

306
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,510
With your Aunt Zhuang, I want

307
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:16,230
to live our life of retirement.

308
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:23,070
The other thing is...

309
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,940
the grudge between us.

310
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:34,430
I know that you've always hated and resented me.

311
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:37,600
You think that I've wronged your mother.

312
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,360
So many years have passed.

313
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,170
Let's not talk about it anymore.

314
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,850
No, we have to.

315
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:49,200
Some things, when you avoid talking about them

316
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,090
and bury them deep in the heart, they will turn into misunderstandings.

317
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:56,670
Xiaoyu, do you know?

318
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,250
All these years,

319
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:02,620
whether it's in life or business,

320
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,950
I've never owed anyone anything.

321
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,250
Let alone your mother.

322
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,600
She gave birth to such an outstanding son and daughter pair for me.

323
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,040
She also educated you so well.

324
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,460
I'm really grateful to her.

325
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:27,140
Furthermore, she was with me when I started my business.

326
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,730
Well...

327
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:37,490
I know that back then,

328
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,500
you blamed me

329
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:44,650
for getting together with Auntie Zhuang so quickly.

330
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:51,270
You thought that, by doing that, I'd betrayed your mother's love.

331
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,360
Xiaoyu.

332
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,940
Dad.

333
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,060
I understand you.

334
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:05,640
You were so busy with your job back then. You indeed needed someone

335
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,390
to share your pain and loneliness.

336
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,660
Remember to take your medication on time. I'll be off now.

337
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:41,900
I'll attend the Mingyuan shareholders' meeting.

338
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,740
Bye.

339
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,760
- Xueling.
- Mingxuan.

340
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,210
Why did you change your hairstyle?

341
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,420
- Does it look bad?
- It looks nice.

342
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,940
- How have you been lately?
- I'm good.

343
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,460
Xiaoyu?

344
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,580
Why didn't you tell me that you were back?

345
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,420
Didn't I come to see you now?

346
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,200
Why are you here today?

347
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,690
You two are here, so why can't I?

348
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:10,290
Your dads are shareholders but mine is not?

349
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,530
Have a seat.

350
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,640
I didn't think you would be interested in management.

351
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,900
Can't really say I'm interested

352
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,840
but I am a part of Fang family, right?

353
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,730
I have no choice. Aren't I the same as you two?

354
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,760
You are not the same as the two of us.

355
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,180
We have no choice and have a mission.

356
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,920
Is that so?

357
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,160
Look at you two. You're at it again.

358
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:41,280
I heard you got married to Mo Fei.

359
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,500
- Yes.
- Congratulations.

360
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,320
Thank you.

361
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,270
What about you? Have you found a boyfriend yet?

362
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:50,080
What about me? Why are you worried about me? Who is like you?

363
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,010
What... What's wrong with me?

364
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,530
- President Tang.
- President Zhu.

365
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:59,460
- Long time no see.
- You are in great shape.

366
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:03,470
Look at you! You have been working so hard for the company. You've gotten skinnier. You should nourish yourself.

367
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,600
Aren't I doing so to make more money for you?

368
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,410
- Right, right.
- Let's sit down.

369
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:09,130
President Fang.

370
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,350
Come on.

371
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,560
[Summary of Songtang's Seasonal Performance]

372
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,320
Everyone looks well.

373
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:27,930
Before starting the meeting, let me say a few things.

374
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,850
Today... I am sitting here once again.

375
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:38,520
To be honest, I have quite a mix of feelings.

376
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,590
I still remember, that three years ago,

377
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:44,930
I also sat here, during our shareholders' meeting.

378
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:49,360
Back then, only my father and I held onto our views.

379
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,570
The other shareholders had already decided

380
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:55,870
to dissolve Songtang.

381
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,000
Back then, perhaps because

382
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,470
I wanted to fulfill one of my father's wishes to protect Songtang,

383
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:07,260
I made a wild statement.

384
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,770
I said I would make Songtang

385
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:13,320
a profitable brand and create a win-win context.

386
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,280
Today, after three years,

387
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,220
I achieved it.

388
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,890
But I am not the only one whose hard work

389
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:30,270
made us reap the amazing results of Songtang.

390
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:34,990
Every shareholder who is sitting here right now has contributed.

391
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,720
I'm grateful to everyone.

392
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,730
I hope that from today on, Mingyuan

393
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:43,230
will have an even more glorious future

394
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:46,530
under our leadership.

395
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:49,050
Sorry, let me interrupt for a bit.

396
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:55,080
I think that Mingyuan achieving such amazing results,

397
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:59,920
is related to President Tang, Tang Mingxuan's

398
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,750
leadership.

399
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,410
A round of applause.

400
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,560
That's the style I like. You have worked hard.

401
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,040
I am telling you, Mo Fei,

402
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,820
I thought that acting as a purchasing agent...

403
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,580
is not something humans can do.

404
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,360
Now I know that

405
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,360
construction is, even more, something not humanly possible.

406
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,330
Okay, okay. I will treat you to something delicious when I'm back. Okay?

407
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:31,000
Go to the left a bit. Let me take another look.

408
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,910
I have already walked around four times for you.

409
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,860
How long do you want to look at it? If you want to look, come back here to look at it yourself.

410
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:43,190
Aren't I just thinking about where the displays should go? Let me take another look. Yes, yes, to the left.

411
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,670
Wait a second.

412
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:50,800
We should place a coat hanger there for customers' custom-made clothes.

413
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,470
Go to the right a little. That's right.

414
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:55,230
We could place two fitting rooms there.

415
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:58,090
Move forward a bit.

416
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:01,610
Stop right there. There we can place a counter,

417
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,030
so I can help the customers make adjustments at any time. What do you think?

418
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,500
Let me tell you.

419
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,020
I already thought about the work counter you are talking about.

420
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,970
I've already put them on the second floor.

421
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,950
Then, I also saw a small tea table,

422
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:17,370
and I bought it together with a two-seat sofa.

423
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:20,330
I thought that if the customers wanted to rest,

424
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,930
they could use that area.

425
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:27,140
If there are no customers, we could sit there and have a drink. What do you think about it?

426
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,940
You're so amazing.

427
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:34,100
I look forward to our little store opening so much.

428
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,300
I am also looking forward to it very much. Therefore,

429
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,010
let's work hard!

430
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,850
Draw a bit more here.

431
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,610
Two hours went by quite quickly.

432
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:45,420
Yes. I really didn't think that one day I would pick up a brush again.

433
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,320
How do you feel?

434
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:52,010
I can't say. But the moment I picked up the brush,

435
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:54,560
I felt that my heart calmed down a lot.

436
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:58,430
I haven't drawn in so long that my hand felt out of practice.

437
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:01,470
The moment I saw you pick up the brush and sit in front of the easel,

438
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:05,470
I felt that that wasthe world that you truly belong to.

439
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:12,060
Xueling, pick up the brush again.

440
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:16,420
Don't waste the four years you spent at Milan's Brera Academy of Fine Arts.

441
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,220
Xiao Lin, hurry up and rush the sketch.

442
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,700
Yes, we need it within these 2 days.

443
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,730
Shen Jiaxi?

444
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,980
Teacher Pan.

445
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,560
Why are you here?

446
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,610
Teacher Pan, I am here to ask you for a favor.

447
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,370
Ask me for a favor?

448
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:11,630
Jiaxi, you are my student.

449
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:14,020
I hope that you can stay

450
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,790
but... How about this?

451
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:19,150
Look for a job in another profession for now.

452
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:23,980
After two years, when everyone has forgotten about this matter, come back to try again.

453
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:39,830
Hello, Dad. Why are you calling so early?

454
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:42,790
Aren't you supposed to be buying groceries with Mom?

455
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:46,450
Jiaxi, in our hometown, your mother and I

456
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:49,470
heard some things about you.

457
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:52,490
Dad, are you listening to gossip?

458
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:54,390
I am fine.

459
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:00,270
Jiaxi, I don't have the intention of blaming you.

460
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,640
Your mother and I are just worried about you

461
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,640
not living well out there.

462
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,880
Dad, I'm fine. Really.

463
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,130
Child, just now, your mother

464
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:17,150
transferred ¥2,000 to your card.

465
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:20,160
Check to see if it has reached your account, all right?

466
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:25,190
Dad, I have money. Really, I have money.

467
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:29,150
No need to say that to your dad.

468
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:33,090
If it's difficult out there,

469
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,640
then come home.

470
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,340
Jiaxi. Jiaxi?

471
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:42,150
Why aren't you talking? What's the matter?

472
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,380
Dad.

473
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:47,600
Child, don't cry. It's all right.

474
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,110
Hello.

475
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,760
Hello, Mingxuan, did you see it?

476
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,390
I have finished designing my last outfit! How is it?

477
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:26,130
Since you have finished designing your last outfit, does that mean you are coming back soon?

478
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:29,330
I plan to go back tomorrow.

479
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,190
Today's weather is not bad so why tomorrow?

480
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,790
How about I go pick you up today?

481
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,920
Today? I can't make it today.

482
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,940
I still have a lot of things I haven't packed, so tomorrow.

483
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:43,490
Tomorrow I have a very important meeting, so I can't go.

484
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:48,950
Then... I can only ask Yang Guang to pick you up. Okay?

485
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:53,040
Sure, go be busy with your work.

486
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,630
Mo Fei.

487
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:58,190
You are finally coming back.

488
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:25,250
Mingxuan, after a long period of resting and adjusting,

489
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:28,340
I made an important decision.

490
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:32,640
Today, I officially ask to resign.

491
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,090
I wish everything goes smoothly for you in the future.

492
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:41,200
I believe, I will also have my own direction.

493
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,700
[Okay, good luck.]

494
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,840
Xiaoyu, you haven't eaten, right?

495
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,950
Is there no more bread and milk?

496
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:39,190
I haven't been able to buy them yet.

497
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:43,510
That... after I finish making celery juice, I will take it to your father.

498
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:46,330
Is it all right if I make you noodles later?

499
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:48,510
Is the auntie (he means the housekeeper) not here?

500
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:51,820
Something happened at home, so she asked for time off.

501
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:52,830
Then I will cook myself.

502
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:55,000
No need, no need. I will do it.

503
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,430
That... I am really good at making tomato and egg noodles.

504
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:04,290
Your dad once said that you really like to eat it.

505
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:09,200
Wait for a moment. Have a seat in the living room, all right? I will be done soon.

506
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,620
Thank you.

507
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:24,190
For the care you have given to my father during this period, you have worked hard.

508
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:58,490
♫ The sun points to the direction ♫

509
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:07,070
♫ Where you're at will instantly become sunny♫

510
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:13,940
♫ That day, you said some words ♫

511
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:23,260
♫ Her smile is like the glow in the sky during sunset ♫

512
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:30,610
♫ Heavens, the person you spoke about is me ♫

513
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:37,140
♫ Light a starlight so you'll stay ♫

514
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:44,540
♫ My heart, just this one is for you ♫

515
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:56,090
♫ I say you're an April day ♫

516
00:41:56,090 --> 00:42:00,260
♫ The sound of your laughter lights everything up ♫

517
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:03,700
♫ Even the spirit of a light breeze ♫

518
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:09,790
♫ In the midst of the brightness and beauty of spring,
shift as one would in a dance ♫

519
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:15,020
♫ You're the mist on a dry April day ♫

520
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:19,330
♫ The gentle breeze blown during dusk ♫

521
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:22,970
♫ The unintentional sparkle of the planetesimal ♫

522
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:28,980
♫ The fine rain that's sprinkled in front of the flower ♫

523
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:33,830
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

524
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:38,570
♫ Like a shy water lotus that bows to a cool breeze ♫

525
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:43,350
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

526
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:48,240
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫

527
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,930
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

528
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:58,820
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫

529
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:12,780
♫ You're like the ivory field after snowflakes ♫

530
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:17,100
♫ You're the round moon every night ♫

531
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,890
♫ You're the naïve ♫

532
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:27,120
♫ white lotus that floats on the water ripples of your dream ♫

533
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:32,350
♫ You're the flower blossoms of tree after tree ♫

534
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:36,700
♫ The swallow twittering within the beams ♫

535
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:40,310
♫ You are love, hope, and warmth ♫

536
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:44,660
♫ You're an April day ♫

537
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:49,500
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

538
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:54,200
♫ The bittersweet parting words of "take care" ♫

539
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:59,040
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

540
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:05,490
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫
