[Episode 43]

3
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,300
Thus, Brother,

4
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,200
couples fighting is nothing to be afraid of.

5
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,360
Long distances between couples are what should be feared.

6
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,720
Don't be afraid of long distances, be afraid of long distances with different time zones.

7
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,940
You asked the right person.

8
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,930
Duoduo and I have been a couple in different countries for so many years

9
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,370
so I have the right to comment. Dear President Tang,

10
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,930
prepare to fight a long battle.

11
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,330
To be honest, I never felt

12
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,370
that this was an issue.

13
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:11,200
In the beginning, I didn't feel like it was an issue, either.

14
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,360
If two people can't be in a long-distance relationship,

15
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,120
would it work out even if they see each other every day?

16
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,800
Then I realized, what is a long-distance relationship like?

17
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,640
It's like having a pet

18
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,520
on your phone.

19
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,070
In the beginning, when you are passionate, it's fine.

20
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,900
Later on, when you are busy with work, you're left with

21
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,890
saying, "What are you doing right now," "Have you eaten yet,"

22
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,990
and "Good night, I love you" before bed.

23
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,370
It has become a routine.

24
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,600
As time goes, it's like clocking in at work.

25
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,510
When you no longer like clocking in,

26
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:48,540
then you are not far from saying "Sayonara". (farewell)

27
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,920
- Have you thought about getting married?
- Of course.

28
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,040
Because I wanted to get married,

29
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,490
when Duoduo said she wanted to come back, I followed.

30
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,240
But let me advise you, President Tang,

31
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,390
end this long battle as soon as you can.

32
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,850
Seeing each other every day,

33
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,920
even if you start getting annoyed with each other

34
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,520
or start fighting every day,

35
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,640
isn't it better than not seeing each other?

36
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,560
Cheers.

37
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,250
I miss you so much.

38
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,650
What are you doing?

39
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,180
Bro! Bro!

40
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,020
You called me.

41
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,410
Why are you missing me for?

42
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,850
Brother Xuan, are you awake?

43
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,380
Why did you drink so much? Easy. Easy.

44
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,090
- Bro!
- Yes.

45
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,420
- I mean...
- Your head, your head...

46
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,850
- Come drink some more with me.
- Don't drink anymore.

47
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,610
Gosh.

48
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,010
- Come! Come drink some more!
- Enough, enough. Don't drink anymore.

49
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,730
- Last night, did you...
- Last night...

50
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:21,100
Last night, I checked your work email. There was an email.

51
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,920
What email?

52
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,690
Well... SLC invited you

53
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,800
to France to discuss the acquisition again.

54
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,660
Didn't I call you last night?

55
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,240
Come here.

56
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,330
Hello, Director Xia.

57
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,850
Director Xia.

58
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,730
Yang Guang, the design department is having a meeting tomorrow.

59
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,130
We will be discussing ideas for next season.

60
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,470
We want to invite President Tang to join.

61
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,690
Tomorrow won't work. President Tang is going to France.

62
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,000
- To France?
- Yes.

63
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,510
I'll get back to work now.

64
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,240
No thanks.

65
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,160
[A loving hug provided for you.]

66
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,060
Today, I'm going to introduce to everyone an ethnic minority

67
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,060
that is principally centered in China's Fujian

68
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,000
and Zhejian provinces.

69
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,090
The population of

70
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:16,600
the She people have always had their own national costumes.

71
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,560
Most of the artisans

72
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,600
are indigenous women.

73
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,840
They can design and create the clothes

74
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,760
as they wish.

75
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,900
In terms of technique,

76
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,780
apart from the cross-stitch or the combination of weaving

77
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,680
and embroidery,

78
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,380
the technique can also be based on real life

79
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,840
and have distinctive features

80
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,400
from national art.

81
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,790
When creating the pattern,

82
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:00,640
the She people's craft is generally based

83
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,450
on stitches of different lengths, lines

84
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,160
of different lengths,

85
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,950
surfaces of various sizes,

86
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,700
and the clear or blurred form.

87
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,840
The changes can be combined harmoniously,

88
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,580
combined in a single pattern.

89
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,440
In 2008, the She costumes

90
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,160
were included in the list of intangible cultural

91
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,870
heritage of China.

92
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:36,330
Zhu Zhu, hurry with your shower and come out to have some fruit.

93
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,680
I'm putting it on the table for you, all right?

94
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,470
Okay!

95
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,520
Zhu Zhu.

96

Who is this?

98
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,420
Isn't he Mo Fei's younger brother?

99
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:18,000
Even you are involved with her family.

100
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,260
You have gotten bolder!

♫ Some things are very hard to experience ♫

104
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,650
Lu Zhu,

105
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,060
why did you drink so much?

106
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,610
What's wrong?

107
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,480
It's none of your business.

108
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,170
Give me another one!

109
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,430
Hey! Stop drinking.

110
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,560
Why are you drinking so much all of a sudden?

111
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,690
W-Why are you crying? W-What's wrong?

112
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:05,040
- Tell me what's happened.
- I don't want to talk to you anymore.

113
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,160
Lu Zhu!

114
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,240
Lu Zhu, what's wrong? Did you drink too much?

115
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,830
- Don't bother with me. I want to cut ties with you.
- Wait.

116
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,220
Lu Zhu, what is going on?

117
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,910
Why are you cutting ties with me?

118
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:27,760
Do you still think that you didn't do anything wrong?

119
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,130
I was wrong, I was wrong. Can you not cut ties with me?

120
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,040
Fine. Then tell me how you were wrong.

121
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,180
How about you tell me and I'll change immediately?

122
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,520
I knew you men were all players!

123
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,010
Jerk! You are such a jerk!

124
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,540
Lu Zhu, stop crying.

125
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,660
My heart aches seeing you like this, Lu Zhu.

126
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,720
Just tell me what's wrong, okay?

127
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:59,200
After all this time, what is our relationship?

128
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,490
What do you think our relationship is?

129
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,860
I'm asking you! You have to tell me today.

130
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,380
Before today, we've been good friends.

131
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,550
Okay.

132
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:29,310
Then let's cut ties. Let's not be friends from today onward.

133
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,090
Okay.

134
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,870
What did you say?

135
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,060
I said I don't want to be your friend anymore! I like you and I want to be with you!

136
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,270
You like me too, right?

137
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,310
Lu Zhu, do you like me?

138
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,830
Are you confessing right now?

139
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,720
That's right! So...

140
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,060

141
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,230

[A loving hug provided for you.]

143
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,470
I didn't know you would be so interested in the costumes of the She people.

144
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,050
The national costumes of the She people have a very long history.

145
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:15,230
It goes all the way back to Tang and Song dynasties.

146
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,270
I think the most unique thing about them

147
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:23,260
is that they were made by ordinary working-class women.

148
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,730
Those costumes really showcase

149
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,960
their ideas and creativity.

150
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,930
They used wooden looms to make rough fabric.

151
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,950
They use one needle, multiple threads, and a small knife,

152
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:39,180
ordinary tools and materials.

153
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:43,450
They've added exquisite works to the overall collection of human art.

154
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,990
That's what's worth us cherishing forever.

155
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:50,280
Their costumes must include their love for their home and lives.

156
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,170
That's why I appreciate them even more.

157
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:55,140
This is also what attracts me the most.

158
00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:00,550
Other than traditional costumes, there are also a lot of unexpected surprises.

159
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,800
If I have a chance, I really want to go there to look around.

160
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,320
Okay. I'll help you find the place.

161
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,940
Thanks.

00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,530

- I'm still looking.

00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:29,650
If you get A+, I will treat you to hotpot.

167
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:35,410
If I have Bs, it's all normal. If it's A, it means my prayers were answered.

168
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:39,720
[Grades: A, A+, A, A]

169
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,600
That's an A+!

170
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,050
Then let's have hotpot.

171
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,690
Extra spicy and numbing.

172
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,050
What are you doing?

173
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,780
I need to call Mingxuan. I'm able to get an A+ all thanks to him.

174
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,270
He personally found the ramie for me.

175
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:02,630
He is such a good boyfriend and a girl's best partner.

176
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:10,830
The person you called is currently not available. Please call again later. Sorry...

177
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:14,980
He's probably busy. Let's go eat hotpot first.

178
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,960
Okay. Let's go.

179
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,990
Brother Xuan.

180
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,840
You're here.

181
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,360
What are you looking at?

182
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,090
You are so handsome.

183
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,160
You are very handsome as well.

184
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,190
The hotpot was so delicious tonight.

185
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,750
I'm so full.

186
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,370
I need to go to the market. How about you go home first?

187
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,920
I'll go with you. Let's go.

188
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,020
It's okay. I will be back very soon.

189
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,720
Okay then. Be careful.

190
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,720
- Bye.
- Bye.

191
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,410
Gosh.

192
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,560
Why are you here?

193
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,450
Did you just have hotpot? Why do you smell like it?

194
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,570
What? Are you disgusted?

195
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,940
You smell good.

196
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,970
You smell so fragrant.

197
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:47,350
Why are you here? Why didn't you tell me? You also didn't answer my calls.

198
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:51,340
I came for work and wanted to surprise you.

199
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,060
I thought you...

200
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,550
What did you think?

201
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,550
What?

202
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,850
What were you thinking? Did you miss me?

203
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,580
I missed you.

204
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,460
If you miss me, why are you in such a rush to go home?

205
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,400
Don't you need to work?

206
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,680
Of course I do, but I still have serious matters to tend to.

207
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,850
What serious matters?

208
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:19,660
I'm only staying for two or three days. Should I spend some quality time with you?

209
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,510
Depends on your performance.

210
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:25,320
Depends on my performance?

211
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,670
Just think about it.

212
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,130
I will think carefully about it.

213
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,400
Come to my place and take your time thinking.

214
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,950
Come on.

215
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,900
SLC

216
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,120
Mr. Tang, representing the President of SLC,

217
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,740
I congratulate you on your great success with Symphony of Clouds and Mists.

218
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,950
After much consideration by the chairman, he thinks that

219
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:00,380
Mingyuan is very influential in the Chinese fashion market,

220
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,510
which is what we appreciate.

221
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,950
Thank you and the president's recognition.

222
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:12,360
Since it is clear that both sides would like to work together,

223
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,700
we can sign the contract from last time.

224
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,640
We can complete the acquisition today.

225
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,460
Miya,

226
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:23,160
I would like to discuss the acquisition price again.

227
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,700
You are saying...

228
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:30,730
I hope to lower the original price in the contract by 30%.

229
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,100
30%?

230
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,980
That's impossible.

231
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,000
If you want to lower the price by 30%,

232
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,800
I have to talk to the president in person.

233
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,710
That's fine.

234
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,120
- Thanks.
- What are you looking at?

235
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,570
It's such a hot day.

236
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,830
Life is hard.

237
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,250
Do you know him?

238
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,150
The president agreed to the price you offered.

239
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,360
Starting from the day we sign the contract,

240
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,220
SLC will officially belong to Mingyuan.

241
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,350
Thank you for your help this whole time.

242
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,830
You are too polite.

243
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,640
I would like to say that as an employee of SLC,

244
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,250
being able to be acquired by Mingyuan Group, we all feel very at ease.

245
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,970
Don't worry.

246
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:53,130
We will do our best.

247
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,580
Let me tell you some good news.

248
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,250
SLC has been successfully acquired.

249
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,160
Also, the price is 30% lower than that of before.

250
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:07,180
But before...

251
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,860
Wait, what exactly happened?

252
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:13,970
Didn't Fang Weiguo offer a high price before competing with us in acquiring them?

253
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,820
However, I think the price was too high.

254
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,840
Then, our designs

255
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,650
were suddenly leaked.

256
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:24,020
The press conference was canceled.

257
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,970
Then SLC backed out of the contract with us.

258
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,640
I think it was a good thing back then.

259
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,940
I just went with the flow of things.

260
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:34,030
So that's what happened.

261
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:36,190
At such a high price,

262
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,910
Fang Weiguo would never acquire them.

263
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:42,670
So did you know Miya would come to you?

264
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,970
That's right.

265
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,760
That's right?

266
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,650
Even though you've heard all kinds of praises,

267
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,120
I still can't help but say,

268
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,630
you are impressive.

269
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,250
Can you be more sincere?

270
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:01,110
I am sincere. I'm so sincere. Is that not enough?

271
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,130
Do it again.

272
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:06,870
You are so impressive!

273
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,260
Is that all right?

274
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,200
Don't you think Paris is such a romantic city?

275
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,750
The romance people picture in their head

276
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,640
is all here.

277
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,310
Do you like Paris?

278
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,670
I do, but also don't.

279
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,800
When do you like it?

280
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,180
Just like what Hemingway said,

281
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,660
"If you're fortunate enough to stay in Paris when you are young,

282
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,420
then for the rest of your life,

283
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,650
no matter where you go,

284
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,560
it will always be with you,

285
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,360
because it is a moveable feast."

286
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,640
When do you not like it?

287
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,570
When you are not by my side.

288
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,930
What's wrong?

289
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,320
Every time I see...

290
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,240
those beautiful buildings, I want to tell you.

291
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,150
When I see young girls reading

292
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,190
their love letters in the subway,

293
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,210
I also want to tell you.

294
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:27,940
Everything that happens around me,

295
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,010
I want to tell you no matter when and where I am.

296
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:36,360
Do you think I'm too immature?

297
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,030
I'm actually just like you.

298
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,880
Mo Fei...

299
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,780
What?

300
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,690
Never mind.

301
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:06,580
I will come and pick you up after class tomorrow.

302
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,660
Let's...

303
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,400
go on a date.

304
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,850
Aren't we on a date right now?

305
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:15,190
Right now is not the same.

306
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,420
Tomorrow is more meaningful.

307
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,290
Do you have coins?

308
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:35,740
Why do you want coins?

309
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,940
I want to make a wish.

310
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,880
What did you wish for?

311
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:14,600
The wish I made is for this rain to quickly end.

312
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,050
Otherwise, it would be so unromantic today.

313
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,360
- Hey, wait, my balloon!
- Hey, I don't know, either.

314
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,210
It flew away.

315
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,140
Oh, but what are we going to do?

316
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,340
- But what have you done?
- Why did you do this?

317
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,030
What about you? What did you wish for?

318
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,200
I can't say it, or it won't come true.

319
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,180
Why did you trick me into saying it then?

320
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,430
You wanted to say it.

321
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,930
Fortunately, I said a fake one.

322
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:47,240
- What was the real one?
- Let's go.

323
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,610
Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to

324
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,130
do my best in everything I did.

325
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:54,580
I pursue perfection.

326
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:59,230
However, I realized there's something I haven't been doing well enough.

327
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,350
What is it?

328
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,990
In regards to loving you,

329
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,760
I feel I can do better.

330
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,610
I once read in a book

331
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,830
something called the garage theory.

332
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,770
When you work hard for a whole day and get back home,

333
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:28,320
you will feel very happy to see the other person's

334
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,760
car parked in the garage...

335
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,630
and want to spend the rest of your life with them.

336
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,500
So I want to ask you,

337
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:44,520
if you work hard for a whole day and see my car parked in the garage when you get home,

338
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,760
will you feel happy...

339
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,360
and want to spend the rest of your life with me?

340
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:12,820
Looks like the wish I made came true. The rain stopped.

341
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,530
Heaven has really given me some face.

342
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,670
So?

343
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,940
I want to love you...

344
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,150
a bit more every day.

345
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:43,060
Miss Mo Fei,

346
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,760
will you marry me?

347
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,960
Hey, kneeling like this hurts a lot.

348
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:00,200
Kneel for a little longer.

349
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:05,420
As long as you will marry me, I can kneel for a whole day.

350
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:40,220
Should I call you

351
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,250
my wife from now on?

352
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,930
Do you know...

353
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,310
what wish I made just now?

354
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:57,070
Didn't you say it won't come true if you say it out loud?

355
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,060
Because it came true.

356
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,490
The wish I made was...

357
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,980
I wished you would love me

358
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:19,190
like how deeply I love you.

359
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:27,940
So, will you

360
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:32,120
fall asleep with me

361
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,290

[Certificate Holder: Tang Mingxuan]

[Certificate Holder: Mo Fei]

We have our certificates now.

400
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,980
I'm thinking,

401
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:50,510
before... I lived alone

402
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,420
and slept alone.

403
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,760
From now on, we live together,

404
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,260
sleep in the same bed, and I will hold you every day.

405
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,980
What will that feel like?

406
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,310
I look forward to it.

407
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,320
What do you look forward to?

408
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,990
Have you thought about where we should go on vacation?

409
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:18,210
Pick a place you like.

410
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:27,250
Let me tell you something. Don't be angry, all right?

411
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:33,190
Since you put it this way, it's hard not to.

412
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,110
Don't be angry.

413
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,310
Tell me first.

414
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:43,030
I just got a call to go study the She people.

415
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,210
For how long?

416
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:45,390

419

We just got married and I have to be alone

420
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,190
in this house for half a year.

421
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:47,490
It's quite a challenge.

422

Don't be mad, okay?

423
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:53,680
I don't want that, either.

424

- This one is mine.

H-How could you...

430
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:11,920
Do you think that I wouldn't want you to work after we get married?

431
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,840
That's wishful thinking.

432

After marrying into our Tang family,

433
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,980
you need to work harder to achieve your dream.

434

You have to be my most outstanding wife.

435

00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:33,930
Really? What kind of surprise?

448
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,680
Are you curious?

449

Forget it. If you don't want to tell me, forget it then.

450
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,320
- Yes, yes.
- This one looks nice.

451

This one as well. These.

452
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:04,890

Yes.

454

What does your husband do?

456
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,290
Is he handsome?

459
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:21,520
- Show us a picture of him!
 - That's right. Show us his picture.

460
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,830
He doesn't really like to take photos. Let me look.

461
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:28,770
Hurry.

462
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,530
Exactly.

463
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,740
May I ask, who are you looking for?

464
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:41,730
I'm here to see Mo Fei.

465
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:45,050
I don't have to look. He's here.

466
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:47,680
Mo Fei, your husband is so handsome.

467
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,700
Why were you so embarassed?

468
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,920
- How is he so handsome?
- Exactly.

469
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,790
We'll get going then.

470
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:56,050
Let's go.

471
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,610
Hello.

472
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,030
What?

473
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:10,510
Others have bear hugs. Why is it like this when it comes to me?

474
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:12,020
You are so heavy. How can I do a bear hug?

475
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,160
How am I heavy? I'm very light.

476
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,850
Come on, come on. Let's do a bear hug.

477
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:18,120
- No!
- Let's do it again.

478
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,600
Again.

479
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,520
- Come. One, two—
- Hold me.

480
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,980
- You didn't make it.
- I did.

481
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:31,390
What are you doing here? Did you miss me?

482
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,490
What? Why are you shaking your head?

483
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,230
I'm here to ask for directions.

484
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:40,490
Ask for directions? Don't you know how to use the GPS?

485
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:41,610
If you miss me, just say it.

486
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:44,640
GPS can't find the place I'm looking for.

487
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,640
It's the road to your heart.

488
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,990
Where did you learn that?

489
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:53,690
I missed you.

490
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,790
I missed you, too.

491
00:39:55,790 --> 00:40:00,520
What are you doing? Let me sleep in for a bit more.

492
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,790
We went to bed so late last night.

493
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:06,180
I know, I was there.

494
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:10,340
I'm so tired.

495
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:16,120
What are you doing?

496
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,580
Are you awake now?

497
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,960
Don't mess with me.

498
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,190
Your career is on the rise right now.

499
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:27,260
As your manager, of course, I have to push you to progress. Here, drink up.

500
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:30,450
Be good.

501
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:40,300
Isn't my work for today scheduled for tonight? Why did you wake me up so early?

502
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,030
I met someone behind the stage.

503
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:45,490
He is a producer. He's produced quite a few works.

504
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:49,430
He thought you were not bad, so he asked me to take you to the audition.

505
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,020
Can't I rest for a day?

506
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,790
Hurry and drink up. Then, go change.

507
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:57,190
We're running late. Hurry up.

508
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,310
Hurry.

509
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:05,760
It's here.

[Runway Love - Film Crew]

511
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,920
Hello, we are here for the audition.

512
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,200
Hello. Please sit.

513
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,930
This is his information.

514
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,490
What company is he in?

515
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:31,360
We don't have one.

516
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,560
Have you acted in any shows before?

517
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,930
He is a model. He has never acted before.

518
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:38,760
Did you guys find us yourselves?

519
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,770
No, no.

520
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:45,270
This President Chen told us to come.

521
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,660
Director, President Chen told an actor to come.

522
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,290
He didn't tell us about it before.

523
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:56,950
He told me.

524
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,800
You are Mo Fan, right?

525
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,720
Come, let me take a look.

526
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:03,830
Turn around.

527
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:07,690
We do have a character who's a model, but he has lines.

528
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:09,390
You look good in all aspects.

529
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:12,760
Find a scene for him and get ready.
