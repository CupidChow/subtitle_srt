[Episode 18]

3
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,310
Hello, Dad.

4
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,600
Mingxuan, have you met with Miya yet?

5
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,600
Not yet, but I'll think of a way to.

6
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:57,350
I just received news that SLC has an interview on TV.

7
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,180
Miya will be there. Do you want to go there to try to see her?

8
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,880
Understood.

9
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,090
Welcome.

10
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,550
Excuse me, sir. Please show your letter of invitation.

11
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,900
Hello, I want to go inside to find a friend.

12
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,690
Very sorry, but I can't let you in without a letter of invitation.

13
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,550
This is the president of Mingyuan Group. Why can't he go in?

14
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,670
Yang Guan, don't make it difficult for him.

15
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,760
Well then, please help me give my business card to Miya.

16
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,340
Tell her I'm waiting for her in the hotel lobby.

17
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,590
- Sure.
- Thanks.

18
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,210
You're welcome.

19
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,270
I'm here.

20
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:45,070
I've brought the books you wanted. Where should I put them?

21
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:55,130
That day when you left with Tang Mingxuan, did you two fight?

22
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,100
Who said that? We just saw each other.

23
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,100
Just saw each other?

24
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,310
Then, why don't you look happy at all?

25
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,550
How am I unhappy?

26
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,870
It's just... there's a lot of homework lately.

27
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,010
So I won't be able to visit you often in the future.

28
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,690
It's Tang Mingxuan who's not letting you come to see me, right?

29
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,560
That's not it.

30
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,690
With that petty personality of his,

31
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,310
would he let you come take care of me?

32
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,420
It really isn't him. Don't think of him in that way.

33
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,010
If you don't want to tell me, then forget it.

34
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,590
Peel an apple for me.

35
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,070
Peel an apple?

36
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,090
I'll have to trouble you.

37
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,490
How about I wash an apple for you?

38
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,760
I'm not very good at peeling. Besides,

39
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,260
it's more nutritious to eat the skin too.

40
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,120
I don't like eating the skin.

41
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,980
It's good for your body.

42
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,030
What are you thinking about in your head?

43
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,090
Tell me about it.

44
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,620
I'm not thinking about anything.

45
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,720
You're still saying you two didn't fight?

46
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,170
You've been absentminded since you showed up.

47
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,490
Just look at your drawings.

48
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,660
Your mood is strange. How can I keep looking?

49
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,130
Eat an apple then.

50
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,840
I keep thinking something is not right. Help me take a look.

51
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,060
Help me take a look.

52
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,060
I promise that I won't ever say

53
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,060
anything bad about Tang Mingxuan to you again, okay?

54
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,250
Fine. I'll help you look, but from now on,

55
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,480
you cannot talk bad about him.

56
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:34,620
Once this outfit is worn, it will most definitely be accessorized with some jewelry.

57
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,810
It'll be perfect with some jewelry.

58
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:41,710
If you add something to it now, it'll become too complicated.

59
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:45,530
It will lose the outfit's original beauty.

60
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,690
Okay, I'll listen to you.

61
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,350
I'm just casually making comments.

62
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,200
I'll just listen to you.

63
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,380
Brother Xuan,

64
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:12,210
that wait staff said Miya has already left. She still won't see us.

65
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:22,110
Brother Xuan, should we go see Mo Fei?

66
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,270
Earlier, when you went inside, you immediately talked about work.

67
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:29,060
After discussing work, you left. She must be unhappy.

68
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,220
Let's go.

69
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,650
Can I help you with anything?

70
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:57,050
Mr. Tang, are you here to look for Madame Miya again?

71
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,510
I came to see Mo Fei.

72
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,560
Mo Fei is already off work.

73
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,290
Thanks.

74
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,090
Mo Fei isn't there?

75
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,860
How about you go to her home to look for her?

76
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,180
No need, it's getting late.

77
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,230
Let's go back to the hotel.

78
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,250
[Hospital]

79
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,230
Hello, Miss Mo.

80
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,440
Hello, come in.

81
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,760
You've worked hard these past few days. Thank you for taking care of Director Fang.

82
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,290
It's fine. Come in.

83
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,720
Why are you here? Don't you have work in Shanghai?

84
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,000
- I...
- Give it to me.

85
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,510
Thanks.

86
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,030
Director Fang, I wanted to give you a surprise.

87
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,610
Your feat in saving a damsel in distress has gone across the ocean to China.

88
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,840
Ansel called President Hu immediately, and President Hu was concerned that no one was taking care of you.

89
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,260
That's why he immediately sent me here.

90
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,540
Making a mountain out of a molehill.

91
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:13,180
It really is. I thought you were injured very seriously and couldn't move, so you'd be bedridden.

92
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,050
But this isn't really serious.

93
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,640
Ansel really makes a fuss.

94
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,320
He didn't make a fuss.

95
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,110
Director Fang's hand cannot do any meticulous work right now.

96
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,370
He also needs to do physical therapy.

97
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,030
What? Can he still draw then? Will this affect your work?

98
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,940
Enough, enough! Stop nagging.

99
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,540
- Here.
- What for?
- Gently, gently.
- Slowly, slowly.

100
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,680
Since you have time,

101
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,170
help me get discharged from the hospital.

102
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,640
Discharge?

103
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,220
You can't? Then you can go back.

104
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,730
No, why are you getting discharged?

105
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,970
The doctor said it will take another week. Also, your right hand

106
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,510
hasn't fully recovered yet.

107
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,790
I'm not a Jia Baoyu.
 (T/N: Lead character in the famous novel Dreams of the Red Chambers. Baoyu literally means Precious Jade)

108
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,010
I can do physical therapy at home.

109
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,230
Are you sure?

110
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,550
Of course.

111
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,420
Otherwise, you'll have to go between the school, the restaurant, and the hospital. How tiring is that?

112
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,770
I'm concerned about you. When we're home, you can still take care of me in the same way.

113
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,120
You won't neglect me after we're home, right?

114
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:13,740
Director Fang, your (plural) home?

115
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,950
You two are living together?

116
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,400
No! We are just neighbors.

117
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,790
Why are you still standing there? Hurry and take care of the discharge procedure.

118
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,630
Okay, okay.

119
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,460
Hey, are you sure about getting discharged? Aren't you being too willful?

120
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:32,780
Are you that concerned about me? You're just worried that Tang Mingxuan will get upset, right?

121
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,660
You said that you won't say anything bad about him.

122
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,940
I won't say anything anymore then.

123
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,390
Xiao Luo, pack my things!

124
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,570
Don't you have anything to say to me?

125
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,830
What should I say?

126
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,160
Did you just come back from picking up Fang Xiaoyu?

127
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,280
I've discovered that you never like to listen to me.

128
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,600
Then have you ever listened to me?

129
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,250
I'm going back soon

130
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,210
yet you're arguing with me over such a trivial matter.

131
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,480
Why are you going back in such a hurry?

132
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,180
Are you reluctant to see me go?

133
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,050
No, I'm just asking.

134
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,170
So... are you here to apologize?

135
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,410
Why should I apologize?

136
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,930
Why are you here then?

137
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,420
Okay then, since there's nothing,

138
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,240
I'll leave first.

139
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,840
How can there be such a person? Will it kill him to apologize?

140
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,420
If you open your mouth to ask me to stay, then I can stay.

141
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,180
How are there women who like him?

142
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,100
Miss Mo.

143
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,220
Are you done chatting with Brother Xuan?

144
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,730
To tell you the truth, Brother Xuan has been

145
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,980
troubled over business discussions with SLC's Miya.

146
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,650
Say, if you two can reconcile sooner,

147
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,280
then he'll have less to worry about. Isn't that right?

148
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,780
He hasn't slept for days now.

149
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,460
He... still doesn't sleep well?

150
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,850
It's not that he can't sleep well. It's just that there are too many things to do.

151
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,840
There is a ton of things to do domestically and abroad.

152
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,430
By the way, aren't you at SLC?

153
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,080
How about you speak to Miya?

154
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,880
I'm just a lowly store clerk. How could I have met the CEO?

155
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,710
Okay.

156
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:01,200
I don't know what this Miya is thinking.

157
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,980
Brother Xuan has looked for her several times, but she just won't see him.

158
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,690
He even went to your store to look for you last time,

159
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,190
but the store manager said you weren't there.

160
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,170
He went to the store to see me?

161
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,930
That's right. Didn't your store manager tell you?

162
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,680
Maybe... Maybe she forgot.

163
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,810
What did you chat about?

164
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,640
Nothing much. You upset her, didn't you?

165
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:06,000
- Hello, Professor.
- Louis.

166
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,810
Explain to me the concept behind your work.

167
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:14,230
Yes, sir, sure. I've studied fabric transformation for three years now.

168
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,980
I believe that fashion

169
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,810
is simply creating breakthroughs

170
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:22,600
and innovations in the fabric.

171
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,930
Therefore, the innovation and development of

172
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:30,970
the fabric has become more and more important.

173
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,890
What you say makes sense.

174
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:37,260
Nowadays, researching

175
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,370
new materials is a trend.

176
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,110
- Good.
- Thank you, sir.

177
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,380
Let's see.

178
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,410
What is this material?

179
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,640
It feels very special.

180
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,230
It is a satin unique to China.

181
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,440
It's called Zhang satin. The weaving process

182
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,220
is an intangible cultural heritage of China.

183
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:06,000
The fabrication process is

184
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,490
extremely complicated.

185
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:15,250
From selecting, rinsing,

186
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,060
polishing, dyeing, and even trimming.

187
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,040
That's why the texture is

188
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,290
so soft and shiny.

189
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,600
I really like this outfit.

190
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,520
Explain to me the design concept.

191
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,410
This is a traditional Chinese outfit.

192
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:40,930
For me, fashion design is a profession that is both restoring traditions and creating new.

193
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,900
You must achieve a breakthrough in traditions.

194
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,800
But at the same time, tradition is indispensable.

195
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,800
I hope to convey the meaning of time with this outfit.

196
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,330
I think that this outfit

197
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:58,460
will stand the test of time.

198
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,330
This is a very Chinese point of view.

199
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,130
Isn't it?

200
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,760
In China, there are countless traditional crafts,

201
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,890
where some are passed down

202
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:15,650
and some are being lost.

203
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,650
In the face of such a situation,

204
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,250
what do you plan to do?

205
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,160
I want to present a style

206
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,930
that's both innovative and traditional

207
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:29,520
in my works.

208
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,680
You know, Mo Fei,

209
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,610
many people don't know the direction of their designs.

210
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:42,270
But you already have a very clear goal.

211
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:45,930
I want to say, you are someone who is

212
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:48,170
perhaps, a visionary?

213
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:51,850
You are blessed. Congratulations.

214
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,960
Mo Fei, I think you spoke really well today.

215
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,560
You have no idea how many times I practiced at home.

216
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,680
But you spoke very fluently and smoothly today.

217
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,340
I came here half a year earlier than you.

218
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,900
I still have to spend time studying at a language school.

219
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,960
Based on my experience, you must first understand what is said.

220
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:20,470
As for speaking, you can only practice getting familiar.

221
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:25,380
I think the outfit you designed today is truly amazing.

222
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,980
The inspiration for my design this time

223
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,650
came from a photo of my mother wearing a cheongsam on the runway.

224
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,400
The runway?

225
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,820
- My mom used to be a model.
- Wow.

226
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:40,450
The most important thing I learned from my mom is confidence. She demands herself

227
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:44,480
to attract all the gazes from the moment she steps onto the stage.

228
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,000
Just like us, we want our work to stand out from the crowd.

229
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,770
Besides, it's because of my mom that I've come to know about Chinoiserie,

230
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,480
and discovered the Chinese craftsmanship and presentation.

231
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,120
The more I study it, the more interesting it is.

232
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,780
Mo Fei, what you just said has really inspired me.

233
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,420
You also know that I've been troubled by not being able to find my own position.

234
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,800
I like a different thing every day.

235
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,630
Now, I have decided to really think about

236
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:15,490
- what path to take going forward.
- You will find it!

237
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,600
Do you not understand Chinese? I want you to leave.

238
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,420
Duoduo, as long as you can dissipate your anger,

239
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,690
you can scold me however you like and make whatever ruckus.

240
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,250
Do you know how regretful I am in my heart?

241
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,320
In your heart?

242
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,550
Why are you so shameless?

243
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:34,020
I only see your heart being chewed on by a dog.

244
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,580
- Duoduo! Duoduo!
- Mo Fei, you came just in time.

245
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,330
Chase this bastard away for me.

246
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,530
Let go!

247
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,270
I've said whatever I could and tried to persuade her as much as I could.

248
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:51,370
I don't know what to do now.

249
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,400
Thank you, Mo Fei.

250
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,520
What is there to thank me for? I didn't do anything.

251
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,120
You two aren't reconciled either.

252
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,360
Don't say that. You've already done a lot.

253
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,000
What do you plan to do next?

254
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,610
How about going back to China to further your career?

255
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:28,760
Duoduo came here because of you.

256
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,320
She doesn't have many friends here.

257
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,040
She must want to go back very much.

258
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,360
I also believe that time...

259
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,430
can solve all problems.

260
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,480
I originally wanted to stay a few more years here,

261
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,560
get more experience before returning.

262
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,880
You know, once you

263
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,850
officially enter the workplace,

264
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,300
it will be very difficult to study again.

265
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:58,560
That's true. But China is developing very quickly now.

266
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,250
Quick development means more opportunities.

267
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,620
You can continue to learn.

268
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,920
What you say makes sense.

269
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,310
I'll think about it.

270
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,140
- Julia, have you seen Miya?
- No.

271
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,700
She is coming here tomorrow afternoon.

272
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,650
- Really?
- Yes.

273
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,600
Come in.

274
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:09,590
We'll look for Miya again tomorrow.

275
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:14,480
Brother, you know, that Liu Bei

276
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,160
visited the hut three times to recruit Zhuge Liang.
 (A famous ancient story about Liu Bei looking for the military strategist Zhuge Liang)

277
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,360
How many times have we tried to see Miya now?

278
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,450
Why does she have such an iron heart?

279
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,360
Have you not heard of the saying, "absolute sincerity

280
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,930
will move a heart of stone"?

281
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,280
She is really too difficult to see. I'm so troubled.

282
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,900
Brother, should we go visit Miss Mo?

283
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,500
It's none of your business.

284
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,390
Well, look, you've been working every day. Right?

285
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,610
Just go occasionally.

286
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:04,290
Turn around. Don't look at my phone secretly.

287
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:11,540
[Mo Fei: Wow, I'm so excited! I will be able to meet Ms. Miya, SLC's CEO, tomorrow.]

288
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,330
Hey, where are you going?

289
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,320
To see Mo Fei.

290
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,780
Why are you following me?

291
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,120
I'm changing.

292
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,840
Miss Mo.

293
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:42,920
Go on up. Brother Xuan is waiting for you upstairs.

294
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,740
I'll push your bike for you.

295
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,740
- Thanks.
- Go ahead. Bye-bye.

296
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:04,350
Why are you here?

297
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:07,290
I missed you, so I came to see you.

298
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,830
I saw your post in the WeChat Moments.

299
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,820
What WeChat moment?

300
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,430
Besides, it's because I'm so happy.

301
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,650
It has nothing to do with you.

302
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,930
Thank you for Miya.

303
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,560
What is there to thank me for? Just a simple gesture.

304
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,780
To you it's a simple gesture on a trivial matter, but to me,

305
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,950
it's something huge.

306
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,860
My girlfriend is so great.

307
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,640
She keeps helping me and thinking about my work. Is that right?

308
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,480
I have to admit to a mistake today.

309
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,020
Perhaps, in regards to some matters,

310
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,320
I'm too emotional;

311
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,400
making you upset.

312
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,690
But it's because I care about you.

313
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:12,650
I'm sorry. Please don't be angry anymore, okay?

314
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,200
Actually, I didn't blame you.

315
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,440
It's true that, sometimes, Fang Xiaoyu's jokes cross the line.

316
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,360
I promise that I will keep a distance from him, and not let you misunderstand again.

317
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,080
After my business meeting, I'll have to go back.

318
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,790
But once I am free, I'll come to see you.

319
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,390
You are so busy at work yet you still come to see me.

320
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,050
Isn't that too exhausting?

321
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:48,420
How is it exhausting to see you?

322
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,860
♫ How could that be? ♫

♫ Thinking of you makes my heart thump ♫

324

♫ What should I do? ♫

325
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,360

326

334
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,240
Good day.

335
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,780
Hello, Mo Fei! What would you like?

336
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,450
I want the ham over there.

337
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,200
This one?

338
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,680
Are you familiar with this shopkeeper?

339
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,740
I come here often.

340
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,400
Also, 500 grams of pork, please.

341
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,410
- This one?
- Yeah.

342
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,650
Thank you.

343
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,470
He looks quite cute.

344
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,570
- Is he nice to you?
- He is super nice.

345
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,700
- Really?
- Sometimes he gives me

346
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,060
free stuff.

347
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,520
- Here.
- Thank you.

348
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,510
Thank you.

349
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,030
Thank you. Wait, I've something for you.

350
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,590
For you.

351
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,450
Isn't he nice?

352
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,620
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Bye.

353
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,320
- Bye.
- Bye.

354
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,490
Coming.

355
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:31,040
Uncle Zhong, why are you here?

356
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,660
I was wondering why you came.

357
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:58,070
If you don't come to me, then I can only come to you.

358
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,910
Look at yourself. Look.

359
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:11,720
Why do you make yourself so embarrassing?

360
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,200
- Let me.
- Don't help me.
- Sit down with your dad and have a good chat.

361
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,570
That girl's name is Mo Fei, right?

362
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,030
Are you keeping tabs on me?

363
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:33,210
You are my son. Why can't I keep tabs on you?

364
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:38,730
- Don't help me.
- Embarrassing. So embarrassing.

365
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:41,330
You don't do any serious work all day.

366
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:43,720
And you even learned to fight groups?

367
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,430
What? Can I not lecture him a bit?

368
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:49,970
If no one lectures him, the next time you see him, it'll be in jail.

369
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:52,280
Even if I'm in jail, I don't need you to care.

370
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,860
I don't want to care about you either.

371
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,680
But I don't like getting embarrassed.

372
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,460
Ever since my mom died,

373
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,480
I have no more relationship with you. What's there being so embarrassed about?

374
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,650
Even if I get beaten to death outside,

375
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:05,900
it's still none of your business.

376
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,180
You rascal, why do you have to talk back to me like this?

377
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:18,200
Haven't you grown up after all these years?

378
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,000
Look at Tang Mingxuan.

379
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,460
He can already manage on his own. What about you?

380
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,060
What do you have, compared to him?

381
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,210
Can you stop mentioning Tang Mingxuan in front of me?

382
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:49,130
I know you'll be upset when I mention Tang Mingxuan.

383
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,500
But have you ever thought

384
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,840
that, in terms of qualifications,

385
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,120
the two of you are similar. You would not lose to him.

386
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,300
But he works diligently to move up every day.

387
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,880
You, on the other hand, just eat and drink every day,

388
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,050
and do nothing serious.

389
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:07,240
The little fame you previously gained from your wits,

390
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,120
is almost all wasted by you now.

391
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,330
Let me tell you. If you continue like this, you are just asking to fail.

392
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:16,090
You'll be doomed.

393
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:19,390
Can you wake up, please?

394
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,810
Consider this as me begging you.

395
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,520
Please wake up. If you can wake up on time,

396
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,900
I can still help you to find the path that you used to take.

397
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,160
Okay?

398
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:39,540
Do you think you're helping me?

399
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,740
Coming here, you're just showing off that you're a compassionate father.

400
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:47,610
You want to educate your son? Go home and have her give birth to one!

401
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:50,100
- Don't come to me!
- Xiaoyu.

402
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,700
Even I can't stand hearing what you're saying now.

403
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,680
Your father truly cares about you.

404
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,250
Uncle Zhong, stop speaking for him.

405
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,810
Ever since he has been with that Zhuang Yuerong, has my home ever been peaceful?

406
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,560
- It's not like you do not know—
- So impolite!

407
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,780
No matter what, you should call her "mom."

408
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,650
She is not my mom!

409
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,510
How can she be my mom?

410
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,720
My mom was forced to death by you and Zhuang Yuerong!

411
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,330
- How many times have I told you already? Why don't you believe me?
- You two are the killers.

412
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,740
Killers! Do you understand?

413
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,080
- Your head—
- Killer! Leave! I don't want to see you all! Leave!

414
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,080
All of you, leave!

415
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,780
Xiaoyu... Xiao— Xiaoyu!

416
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,390
Can't you calm down

417
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:29,010
and sit down to chat with Chairman Fang?

418
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:32,550
Xiaoyu! Xiaoyu!

419
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,800
Chairman Fang.

420
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,630
Chairman Fang.

421
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,190
- Actually—
- Chairman Fang.

422
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:51,520
Uncle Zhong, why are you two suddenly here?

423
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,540
Didn't you say Xiaoyu got hurt?

424
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,780
I came to see him.

425
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,440
Then... are you leaving now?

426
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,900
Yes.

427
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,770
Please help take care of Xiaoyu for me.

428
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:07,380
Don't let him mess around too much.

429
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,920
I can't help sometimes, but I'll do my best.

430
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,520
Okay.

431
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:18,960
If something happens, immediately tell me. Okay?

432
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,110
Okay, Uncle Zhong.

433
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,870
Wait! Whose side are you on?

434
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:37,040
- Of course, on your side.
- On my side?

435
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,520
I've been here for a while and no one knew I was here.

436
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,500
Once you came, they know everything.

437
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,790
Mo Fei, my hospitalization, the incident, and my address.

438
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,970
Who told them?

439
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:48,300
No, Director Fang. You can't blame me.

440
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,390
If I didn't tell him, others would.

441
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:53,470
Others would? I don't want to see you now. Leave.

442
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:58,040
Director Fang, if you need anything, call me at any time.

443
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,340
Would I still dare to call you?

444
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,330
I'll get going then.

445
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,820
We've been walking for so long and you just remember now that you forgot to get it.

446
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,950
Why are you being so fussy?

447
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:16,450
Why aren't you letting me speak?

448
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,250
What are you making here?

449
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,840
You'll know when I'm done.

450
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,110
Sichuan shredded pork with garlic sauce?

451
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,050
Pretty much.

452
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,750
Let me help you.

453
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:06,460
It's fine. I'll make it myself. You go rest.

454
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,060
- Go, go.
- Okay.

455
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,520
Why are you here again?

456
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,820
I'm here to deliver you some food.

457
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,890
I won't eat it. I already said I'm not hungry.

458
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,950
What did you bring?

459
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,910
You're a patient. You should have more porridge.

460
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:25,630
I said I'm not eating. Someone is going to bring me food later.

461
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,350
Who?

462
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:32,660
I know. Just now, Mo Fei came back with groceries.

463
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,410
Leave now.

464
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,860
Okay. Don't drink so much. You're still not fully recovered.

465
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,870
I'm leaving then.

466
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:45,470
Don't drink so much.

467
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:51,180
Mingxuan, time to eat!

468
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,230
Are you still not coming?

469
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:58,030
Mingxuan...

470
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:25,510
I was sleeping. Why did you wake me up?

471
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,390
It's time to eat.

472
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:31,830
It's done?

473
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:35,890
Come on, let's eat.

474
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:39,580
Didn't we say we'll eat together?

475
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:43,660
Maybe I'm still jet-lagged.

476
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:46,460
You can go back to sleep after eating.

477
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,710
Hurry and give it a try. I made this pork liver.

478
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:53,260
Try it, try it. Pork liver will improve eyesight.

479
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,410
What?

480
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,760
This is the first time you have cooked for me.

481
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,060
Don't you want to try it?

482
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,920
How is it?

483
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,640
I'll tell you the next time you cook for me.

484
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,700
Well, you should say how it is this time. Right?

485
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,410
There's room for improvement.

486
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:16,860
This is the first time you're trying

487
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:19,240
my cooking and that's your evaluation?

488
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,400
Then I won't want to cook from now on.

489
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,070
I didn't get any compliments.

490
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,750
Eat.

491
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:49,610
Sleeping on such a small bed, are you used to it?

492
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:52,320
It's not small. It's pretty big.

493
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,050
Look at how skinny I am. Right?

494
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:01,610
♫ Watch until we're old with white hair ♫

495
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:05,240
Do you want me to find you a bigger place?

496
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,240
It's okay. Living here is quite nice.

497
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,890
Plus, I have Duoduo here with me as my companion.

498
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,400
But is she used to living with you?

499
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,840
Why wouldn't she be used to it?

500
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,370
What happens when her boyfriend comes to see her?

501
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:27,090
He doesn't come often. Besides, when he does,

502
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:29,020
I close the door and put on my headphones.

503
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,470
Isn't it embarrassing?

504
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:39,090
Okay, I'll stop teasing you.

505
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,020
It's fine as long as you like living here.

506
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,330
What happens if I come?

507
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:48,710
What are you doing?

508
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,750
You're teasing me again.

509
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,120
Since Duoduo hasn't come back yet,

510
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,150
do we want to...

511
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,650
Take a nap with me.

512
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,880
- What were you thinking about just now?
- Nothing, nothing.

513
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,690
Then, why did you want to run away?

514
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:24,080
♫ I want to take you to outer space ♫

515
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:29,150
♫ until our breathing stops ♫

516
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:32,160
♫ Yet our hearts are still beating ♫

517
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,360
Why is it just you? Where is everyone else?

518
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,140
They all went to lunch.

519
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:43,590
I wanted to finish my work before eating.

520
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,500
Work will never be done.

521
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,960
You must learn to have a work-life balance.

522
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,430
Rest for a bit. Come have a drink with me.

523
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:05,540
- Director Xia.
- Thank you.

524
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,130
Sit.

525
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,530
I heard from Liu Pei that you are the first one to be at work

526
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:20,570
and the last one to leave every day.

527
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:22,460
It seems you're very hard working.

528
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,570
Because I got the opportunity to work at Mingyuan Fashion;

529
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:27,070
of course, I must treasure it.

530
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:29,730
There's not a lot of young people like you nowadays.

531
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:33,850
Most people want to come and go as they please.

532
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:36,910
So it's been more and more difficult to find suitable people.

533
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:39,270
I've always been a disciplined person since I was young.

534
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:42,790
Once I set my mind on a goal, I will surely complete it well.

535
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:44,550
I know that I'm not smart enough

536
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:47,680
so I must work harder than others.

537
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,980
Let's do this then.

538
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:53,300
Starting tomorrow, I'll transfer you to Liu Pei's team as her assistant.

539
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,130
Being by her side, you can learn

540
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,960
the production process of ready-made clothing more quickly.

541
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,840
Me, Director Xia?

542
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,220
Are you sure I'm qualified?

543
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,230
Since I'm transferring you over there,

544
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,280
of course, it means that you have the capability.

545
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,030
What? Are you not willing?

546
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:10,240
No, no! I'm willing. I am.

547
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:23,850
♫ I say you're an April day ♫

548
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:27,830
♫ The sound of your laughter lights everything up ♫

549
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:31,320
♫ Even the spirit of a light breeze ♫

550
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:37,350
♫ In the midst of the brightness and beauty of spring,
shift as one would in a dance ♫

551
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:42,710
♫ You're the mist on a dry April day ♫

552
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:47,030
♫ The gentle breeze blown during dusk ♫

553
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:50,660
♫ The unintentional sparkle of the planetesimal ♫

554
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:56,660
♫ The fine rain that's sprinkled in front of the flower ♫

555
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:01,500
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

556
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:06,310
♫ Like a shy water lotus that bows to a cool breeze ♫

557
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:10,900
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

558
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:15,900
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫

559
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:20,430
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

560
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:27,620
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫

561
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:40,370
♫ You're like the ivory field after snowflakes ♫

562
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:44,700
♫ You're the round moon every night ♫

563
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,530
♫ You're the naïve ♫

564
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:54,770
♫ white lotus that floats on the water ripples of your dream ♫

565
00:43:54,770 --> 00:44:00,010
♫ You're the flower blossoms of tree after tree ♫

566
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:04,370
♫ The swallow twittering within the beams ♫

567
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:07,970
♫ You are love, hope, and warmth ♫

568
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:12,380
♫ You're an April day ♫

569
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:17,060
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

570
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:22,120
♫ The bittersweet parting words of "take care" ♫

571
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:26,680
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

572
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:33,200
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫
