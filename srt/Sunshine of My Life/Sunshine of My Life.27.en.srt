[Episode 27]

3
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,000
Haitian,

4
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,800
what nonsense are you doing? Instead of working on serious business,

5
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,400
you are going to play games?

6
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,200
You haven't succeeded in fashion yet,

7
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,400
but you are changing to another industry, to a gaming industry?

8
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,800
Isn't this a foolish dream and fanciful indulgence?

9
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,000
Exactly!

10
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,100
If your dad knew that you would get Haiyao into this state,

11
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,100
he would be turning in his grave!

12
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,690
- That's right.
- I oppose going into gaming.

13
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,200
The company cannot allow this nonsense!

14
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,600
I'm against gaming, too.

15
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,000
We are against it, too.

16
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,800
You don't focus on fashion, but want to do gaming?

17
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,200
That's right!

18
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,800
Enough!

19
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,040
Whoever says one more word,

20
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,700
there won't be a single cent of year-end dividend for you.

21
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,800
All the uncles, aunties, and elders,

22
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,500
I know that you are concerned for me,

23
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,200
and I am also grateful for all the affection and help that you've given me.

24
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,000
But I came today

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,800
not to negotiate with you,

26
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,800
but to officially notify you.

27
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,200
First of all, I'm definitely going into gaming.

28
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,200
Fangyuan Gaming Company will officially become part of Haiyao Group.

29
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,400
I have appointed myself as the CEO.

30
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,600
If anyone disagrees, please talk through your stock shares.

31
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,400
Secondly, for Haiyao Fashion, I'm appointing

32
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,700
Miss Bai Xiaoman as General Manager.

33
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,480
Starting today, what she says is what I want.

34
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,700
So young!

35
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,800
If anyone disagrees,

36
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,200
please talk through your stock shares.

37
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,600
The last thing is...

38
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,400
Miss Bai and I will be married soon.

39
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,800
At that time, we welcome you coming to give us best wishes.

40
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,700
Of course, if anyone still disagrees,

41
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,800
you don't have to come.

42
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,400
Let's go.

43
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,460
What is going on?

44
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,000
How can he do this!

45
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Haitian, you were so dashing. I'm very touched.

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,200
- So many rewards.
- Yes.

47
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,800
Director Fang.

48
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,400
He has returned to China?

49
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,200
Yes. Let's say hi to him.

50
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,200
Hey, you, going to lunch?

51
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes, we're going to lunch. Want to come with us?

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,600
Thank you for your invitation.

53
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,800
I'm busy today. I still have work to handle.

54
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,300
Then, how about after you get through your work?

55
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,200
Why are you pulling my clothes?

56
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,600
Next time. Sorry.

57
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,800
Have a good afternoon.

58
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,800
What's wrong with Director Fang?

59
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,200
His serious attitude really resembles that of President Tang.

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,400
Did something happen between you two?

61
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,000
What could have happened to us? We just talk business.

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,400
Okay, let's go then.

63
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
What are we going to eat?

64
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Director Xia.

65
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Xiaoyu, you're back from France?

66
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,000
Just got back a couple of days ago.

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,300
Why didn't you call me before you came?

68
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,200
I didn't call anyone.

69
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,600
I came here today to take care of official business.

70
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,400
Perfect! Let's have dinner together.

71
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,600
I have an appointment today, so I can't go.

72
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,200
You will see me more often from now on.

73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Are you here to find Mo Fei?

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,320
What's the matter? In my position here,

75
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,200
you would just let an assistant greet me?

76
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,000
Hurry and say it. Why are you here?

77
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,200
It's a secret. I'll tell you later.

78
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,800
What's the hurry?

79
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,000
Didn't Mingyuan release a new design?

80
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,400
You've invited Cayman's models, so I'm here to discuss this matter.

81
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,100
Okay, okay! You go do your thing.

82
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,500
You didn't believe me.

83
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,300
Hello, how are you?

84
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,800
Sister Xueling, it's me.

85
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,600
Qian Qian.

86
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,200
Sister Xueling.

87
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,800
When did you come back?

88
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,000
I just got back not long ago. Hurry and sit.

89
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,200
Wait! Let me take a good look at you. Anything changed?

90
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,400
Why are you so skinny, but still so pretty?

91
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,600
I want this.

92
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,600
Where did you go these years? Your older brother kept looking for you without success.

93
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,800
I've been overseas these years, and I'm living well.

94
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm sorry, Sister Xueling,

95
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,200
that you've been worried.

96
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,400
Oh, yes! Does your brother know that you're back?

97
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,400
Of course he does.

98
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,130
Fang Xiaoyu is really no good.

99
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,000
He didn't tell me such big news.

100
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,400
I always asked him about your news every time I saw him.

101
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,800
I have really been worried about you.

102
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,100
Thank you, Sister Xueling.

103
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,600
I heard my brother say that you are really capable now.

104
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,600
You are a strong woman now.

105
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Also, you are working in Brother Mingxuan's company?

106
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,600
Your brother's description of "strong woman"

107
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,400
is not a compliment.

108
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,200
He was really saying it

109
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,000
with a serious attitude.

110
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,200
Brother Mingxuan...

111
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,300
Is he well?

112
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,600
He is doing all right.

113
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
He has been out of town on business these days.

114
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,200
I was originally going to go with him to have some fun for a few days along the way.

115
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,800
But I'm really too busy with the company's affairs, so I can't get away.

116
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,600
Let's wait for him to come back, and we'll get together.

117
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,940
We'll see.

118
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,400
Look at how skinny you are.

119
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,800
It's good that you're back now. You can get replenished.

120
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,800
Sister Xueling, I need to do something and will leave first.

121
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,800
Oh, yes! My brother is taking me out to dinner. Do you want to come, too?

122
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
You are the person he is meeting?

123
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,200
He was so secretive that I thought he had a new girlfriend.

124
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,200
I won't go with you then, as I'm busy with company affairs.

125
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,400
Call me when you have time in the next few days.

126
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,900
Okay.

127
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,400
- Remember to call me.
- Okay.

128
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,400
Stay in touch.

129
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,400
- I'm leaving, Sister Xueling. Bye-bye.
- Bye.

131
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,600
Xueling,

132
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,800
you're looking for me?

133
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,400
Mingxuan,

134
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,600
I was looking for you for something.

135
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,800
But it's nothing serious. Are you going out?

136
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,800
Yes, to the finance department. Whatever it is, just tell me.

137
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,400
I'll go with you then.

138
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,200
That's fine.

139
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,400
Fang Xiaoyu came to Mingyuan. You know about that?

140
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:26,200
Yes, I do. Didn't I invite Cayman's models for our show?

141
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,800
Yes. I heard the progress was going well.

142
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,200
I don't know if Fang Xiaoyu will play any games.

143
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,000
Just ignore him.

144
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,800
He can do what he wants.

145
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,000
That's right. That has been his personality ever since childhood.

146
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:52,080
This time that he came, did he tell you anything?

147
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,600
What else can we say?

148
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Right.

149
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,100
We're here.

150
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,600
I am really full today. The restaurant is really good.

151
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,320
I don't know if Director Fang left yet.

152
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,500
If we went together, it would've been good.

153
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Right, Mo Fei.

154
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,200
Do you feel that Director Fang is a bit weird?

155
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,400
Although he came today for business, he didn't have this attitude towards you before.

156
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,000
When you took part in the competition, he took great care of you.

157
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,600
To court you, he got into an argument with President Tang.

158
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,400
Is there something going on between you two?

159
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,300
What can we have going on?

160
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,200
But he does seem a bit different.

161
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,400
Right, right! You think so, too!

162
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
How about you talk about it?

163
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,400
I am not really familiar with his personal life.

164
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,300
Did you accidentally offend him?

165
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,600
Perhaps.

166
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,000
Say it, say it! I am so curious!

167
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,600
The elevator is here.

168
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,800
Why aren't you moving?

169
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,600
Hurry up and go.

170
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,200
Qian Qian, you went to look for Xia Xueling today?

171
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,400
Yeah, I saw an old friend.

172
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,700
What did you guys talk about? Her change is pretty big, right?

173
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,400
You are completely right.

174
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,470
Sister Xueling's change is so great!

175
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,000
Right now, she looks like a superwoman.

176
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,300
Your change is also pretty big now.

177
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,600
I remember when you were little, you liked to compete with Xia Xueling with everything.

178
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,800
Everyone wants to win. No one is willing to lose.

179
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,800
Now you guys can talk with ease.

180
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,400
I really cannot believe it.

181
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,800
People will change.

182
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,300
It is only you who didn't change.

183
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,800
I didn't change? Didn't I get more handsome?

184
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,300
In my heart, you are always the most handsome, Brother!

185
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,800
Qian Qian, stop thinking to look for Tang Mingxuan. All right?

186
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,000
Brother, you misunderstand.

187
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,000
I wasn't thinking about him.

188
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,000
Then, why did you go look for Xia Xueling?

189
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,800
Didn't you want to know some news of Tang Mingxuan from Xia Xueling?

190
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,700
What you should know, I've already told you, no?

191
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I saw Sister Xueling b–

192
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,400
because I wanted to see old friends.

193
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,400
Qian Qian,

194
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,600
so many years abroad...

195
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,800
You busied yourself to death every day.

196
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,800
Wasn't it to forget him?

197
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,200
It is so hard for you to start a new life.

198
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,800
Why–

199
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Qian Qian,

200
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
for you to be able to come back, I am really happy.

201
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,600
But I am not willing for you to be sad for him anymore.

202
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,100
Brother, it's not what you think.

203
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,180
I just... don't want to avoid the problem.

204
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,000
After all, he was a part of my life.

205
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,400
Stop. You have a great future ahead of you.

206
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,400
Why don't you cherish your current life? You keep looking back!

207
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,600
My future?

208
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,300
Yes.

209
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,100
Brother, I'm going to go to the restroom.

210
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:13,000
Cheng Yang, the theme of splash ink landscape painting you're using,

211
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,800
the idea is good.

212
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,000
But this idea is only a concept. It cannot be used.

213
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
First off, for the fabric to handle it is a big problem.

214
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,600
Director Xia, did we overcomplicate things?

215
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,200
How ink painting is drawn, that is how we'll create the fabric. Is this very hard?

216
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,600
It is you who is oversimplifying.

217
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,200
Not only is the fashion designer an artist, but they are also the product's manufacturer.

218
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,200
It is impossible that we don't think about the manufacturing process.

219
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,200
Unless you want to print and dye every single piece of clothing yourself?

220
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,000
Songtang wants to create new things.

221
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,400
First of all, they have to have an in-depth bond with traditional Chinese culture.

222
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,600
For thousands of years, the Chinese used ink and brush to paint their world.

223
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,000
Why when it has come to our generation, is it not possible?

224
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,600
Ink painting is the most unique design that represents China.

225
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,400
As long as it appears, everyone in the world knows this is a Chinese design.

226
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,100
Splash ink is the most dynamic in ink painting.

227
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,000
By having it on clothing,

228
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,500
I believe everyone can feel

229
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,200
the quiet beauty of Chinese culture.

230
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,800
They can also see Chinese culture's

231
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,400
moving sentiments.

232
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,500
Then, how about the production cost?

233
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,400
We've just acquired Master Li's embroidery workshop.

234
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,600
We have also invested a great amount of money into it.

235
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,400
The press conference for the new product is the best chance to earn back the invested money.

236
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,000
So I think that using Suzhou Embroidery is the most correct choice.

237
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,800
Also, we can strengthen the advertising of the embroidery workshop.

238
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,850
Last season, the product

239
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,800
we used the most was Suzhou Embroidery's elements.

240
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,800
Songtang can't use it again.

241
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,200
So this season, I want to use a new element.

242
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,600
Embroidery is China's most traditional fashion design,

243
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,300
the most frequently used skill.

244
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,400
Will using it again be considered a repeat?

245
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,800
Besides, our company already has workshops we can work with.

246
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,400
Using Suzhou Embroidery as the theme can also lessen the cost.

247
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,500
Director Xia, I don't want to cause problems.

248
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,700
I just want to... focus on the designs and choose the presentation method.

249
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,000
Are you questioning me right now?

250
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,000
Cheng Yang, all of the stress of manufacturing is not on you.

251
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,400
Instead it is on me.

252
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,600
From designing to the cost, then to actual production,

253
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,000
all of this has to go through me.

254
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,900
Director Xia, I feel you can look at the design first.

255
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:57,600
In our design this time, we used one-piece tailoring for all of it.

256
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,700
And the way to show the splash ink,

257
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,000
it's mainly to show some back-to-basics way of life.

258
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,500
Also, personally, I think since it is a new product,

259
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,900
then creating something new should be the top priority

260
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,000
and not thinking about the cost.

261
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,500
If it's like this, then wouldn't Songtang be stuck to the old form of doing?

262
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,400
Mingyuan is a Fashion Group.

263
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,840
It needs every department to cooperate.

264
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,800
In order to create a profit in the end.

265
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,200
If you only want to be creative,

266
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,600
then go out and create your own office!

267
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
Do whatever you want to.

268
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,290
No need to consider other factors.

269
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,800
You also don't need to bear any results or responsibility.

270
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,900
Of course, what you need to be concerned about

271
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,400
is your input and output ratio.

272
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,000
Can it afford your rent and utility bills?

273
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,260
What is so funny?

274
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,600
Cheng Yang, the opinion I gave

275
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,000
is not rejecting you.

276
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
President Tang has also given the order to give you room for creativity. Of course, I have to abide.

277
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,800
I am saying all of this to hope that you can thoroughly think about it.

278
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,100
About how long will the sample clothing take to make?

279
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,200
Two days.

280
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,700
Okay, then after your sample clothing is created, we will make a decision.

281
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,970
Today's meeting is to here. Meeting adjourned.

282
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Mo Fei, you stay.

283
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,400
Mo Fe, do you think with President Tang's support,

284
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,400
you don't need to respect me?

285
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,600
Director Xia, you have spoken too far. When have I not respected you?

286
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,800
What tone was that?

287
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,900
A normal tone and attitude.

288
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,800
As a temporary assistant, what right do you have to give an opinion?

289
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,600
I think as long as you are a worker at Mingyuan, it is okay to give opinions that are beneficial.

290
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,500
Of course, you don't have to use them.

291
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,000
Do I need you to teach me how to work?

292
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I don't dare.

293
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,400
You don't dare?

294
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,400
From what I see, you are almost going to replace me.

295
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,200
What? Have you really thought of yourself as the boss lady?

296
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,000
Director Xia, what we are talking about right now is work.

297
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,600
Don't always drag private matters into it. I think you're very unprofessional.

298
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,800
Don't be out of line.

299
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,600
I'm out of line?

300
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm the one you are aiming at, right?

301
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,400
Yes, I just want to aim at you.

302
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,760
Hurry up and pack your things. Go get your pay at the finance department.

303
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,000
Leave immediately!

304
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,000
It is like this. I am an assistant that Cheng Yang hired.

305
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,600
If you want to fire me,

306
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,600
please let him give me the notice.

307
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,800
Fine.

308
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,400
She's too scary.

309
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,800
Then I will go take care of it now.

310
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,820
President Tang, I want to fire Mo Fei.

311
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,400
What exactly happened?

312
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,600
I suspect Mo Fei is a corporate spy.

313
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,200
She was neighbors with Fang Xiaoyu in Paris, right?

314
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,000
From what I know, they were not normal neighbors. Their relationship is really close.

315
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,800
Mingxuan, Mo Fei is your girlfriend. Right?

316
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,400
If she has a close relationship with men other than you,

317
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,800
if she's not cheating on you, then let me ask you.

318
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,200
Why do they have such a close relationship?

319
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,000
Isn't it logical that I suspect she is a corporate spy?

320
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,400
Also, you did not see her attitude just now.

321
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
She is not as simple as you think.

322
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,200
And only you think of her as an innocent and naïve girl.

323
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,700
Xueling, right now are you discussing with me personal relationships or work?

324
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,400
- Mingxuan—
- I believe that I have my own judgment towards Mo Fei's character.

325
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,290
- Calm down, sit down and talk slowly—
- I just want to ask you one question.

326
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,860
As Mingyuan's Design Director,

327
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:10,110
do I have the authority to fire a temporary assistant?

328
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,610
I'll tell you. It's not that you don't have the authority. I don't have it, either.

329
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:17,810
She was hired by Cheng Yang as the assistant. The company has agreed that

330
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,300
he has the right to choose assistants.

331
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,320
If you insist on firing Mo Fei,

332
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,950
then within our entire company,

333
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,990
I'm afraid he is the only one with that authority.

334
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:30,410
Okay. I'm going to find Cheng Yang now.

335
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:43,960
Fire Mo Fei? Why?

336
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,670
In my opinion, Mo Fei's qualification and experience

337
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,620
aren't sufficient for her to be your assistant.

338
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:52,250
Also, she has a special relationship with President Tang.

339
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,450
Furthermore, she and Cayman's designer Fang Xiaoyu

340
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,650
have frequent and close contact. Therefore,

341
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:01,400
I don't think she should stay in the design department.

342
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:10,220
Director Xia, I respect your opinion very much.

343
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,120
Can you also listen to my thoughts?

344
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,280
I hired Mo Fei as my assistant.

345
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,030
Her position in the company is merely a designer's assistant.

346
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,180
At her level of position,

347
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,160
she shouldn't cause any effect on the company. Right?

348
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,400
As to what you said

349
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,250
about the special relationship, frequent and close contacts...

350
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,870
These should be her personal affairs.

351
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,970
Is it necessary to report personal affairs to the boss?

352
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:42,420
Designer Cheng, have you forgotten who your boss is?

353
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:46,060
Director Xia, I'm sorry that

354
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,320
I cannot accept your suggestion.

355
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,990
What if I insist on firing her?

356
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:56,660
If you insist on firing her,

357
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,860
I will leave with her.

358
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,470
Hey.

359
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,040
Xueling, act appropriately.

360
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,590
First of all, I won't interfere in this matter.

361
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,730
However, I hope that you both will handle it fairly.

362
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,630
Fine, you are all on the same side.

363
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,890
I'll leave then. Is this good enough?

364
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,110
Childish temper tantrum.

365
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,060
You heard it all?

366
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,490
Thank you for believing in me.

367
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:51,540
Okay, let's go eat then.

368
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,610
In the future, we should avoid personal talk in the company

369
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:58,120
so others won't have anything to say about us.

370
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:11,050
Then... I'll go by myself

371
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,250
to eat?

372
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,400
Director Xia, I'm here to apologize for Mo Fei.

373
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,450
Mo Fei was really out of line this time.

374
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,660
No matter what, you are a director in Mingyuan.

375
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,720
She is just a temporary assistant. How is she qualified to go against you?

376
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,000
What exactly has she done to Mingxuan?

377
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,160
Why is he so crazy about her?

378
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,370
I don't know, either.

379
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,780
Are you Mo Fei's good friend?

380
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,970
Has she mentioned Mingxuan to you?

381
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:25,860
She doesn't like to talk about her affairs.

382
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,330
Actually, I sometimes wonder whether she thinks of me as a good friend.

383
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:32,560
Especially this time after her return, I feel that she has changed a lot.

384
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,120
How has she changed?

385
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,450
She likes to lie now.

386
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,560
Such as?

387
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,820
Such as, she said that President Tang didn't know that she was coming to work in Mingyuan.

388
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,710
How is that possible?

389
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,420
It's really not a big deal.

390
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,280
Even if she came in through connections, so what?

391
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:54,120
I just don't understand why she wouldn't admit it.

392
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:00,720
Shen Jiaxi, I really didn't notice this.

393
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,260
Even though you and Mo Fei are good friends,

394
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,100
but you two are totally different.

395
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,000
What are you hiding?

396
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,970
Nothing.

Were you looking at the old childhood album?

398

I just wanted to see those childhood photos.

399

How much can I persuade you that you will listen to me?

402
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,910
You still can't let him go.

403

408
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:03,890
Dr. Xiao, why did my sister suddenly faint when she was just fine?

409
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,770
What exactly is her situation?

410
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:09,580
The preliminary images show that there should be an anomalous growth in her brain.

411
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:14,810
As to what degree, we need to do more detailed tests to determine.

412
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,840
This is impossible.

413
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:20,280
Based on your experience,

414
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,440
what do you think these symptoms are?

415
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,820
She looks to be chronically malnourished.

416
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,950
Both the indexes for white blood cells and red blood cells are not normal.

417
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:33,260
- There is also—
- Just tell me what the illness is.

418
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:38,470
I'm suspecting that

419
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:42,400
there is a malignant tumor in the brain, and it shows signs of spreading.

420
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,680
But we can't be sure until we get the biopsy results.

421
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,120
Can you arrange surgery as soon as possible?

422
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,830
I've already told you just now. We can't be sure until we get the biopsy result—

423
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,730
How long do we have to wait?

424
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,920
You can't rush the test results.

425
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,680
Lab tests take time.

426
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,460
You rush me like this, but I can't help you.

427
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:26,080
As long as my sister can recover,

428
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,720
I will be willing to pay anything.

429
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,800
Mr. Fang, we doctors feel the same as you.

430
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,120
We all wish the patients will recover as soon as possible.

[Fly to this Little Corner]

433
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:04,220
Actually, when I first agreed to Cheng Yang to be the assistant,

434
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,790
I really thought it would be a new experience.

435
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,190
I originally thought

436
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:13,030
it wouldn't be anything difficult to be an assistant.

437
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:16,760
Doing design every day next to the designer

438
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,100
sounded like fun.

439
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,710
But the things that have been occurring in recent days

440
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:26,470
have made me suddenly realize

441
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,290
that nothing seems to be

442
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:33,830
simple and easy.

443
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:41,760
Maybe Jiaxi is right.

444
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:47,190
The workplace really isn't as simple as I think.

445
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:50,610
You can't only do design in the workplace.

446
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:54,390
You also have to deal with all kinds of people.

447
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,540
Perhaps...

448
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,830
I made a mistake.

Other than my own feelings,

00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:13,400

Today's meeting is mainly to discuss

00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,260
the design for the Symphony of Clouds and Mist Show.

461

The company views this show with high regard.

462
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:15,310
So we hope everyone will devote everything to this show.

463
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:18,200
Right now, we have two designs in Cheng Yang's Water Colors

464
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,130
and Liu Pei's Sunset Glow.

465
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:22,840
Let's first ask Teacher Liu Pei to introduce

466
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,480
your design in the Sunset Glow series.

467
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:27,790
After discussions, our team decided

468
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,900
to use Danxia landform as the concept (various landscapes found in southeast, southwest, and northwest China that consist of a red bed characterized by steep cliffs)

469
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,260
which we will use for our design theme.

470
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,100
Please look, everyone.

471
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:38,260
Danxia landform has towering mountain peaks and deep precipitous canyons.

472
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,830
It is well-known for its red cliffs with rich color gradation.

473
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,830
Therefore, in designing the color palette,

474
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,360
we took inspiration from the Danxia landform.

475
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,290
The overall style of the clothing is western tailoring,

476
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:54,160
using architectural style to showcase

477
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,430
the mighty appearance of the mountains in Danxia landform.

478
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,860
We then splice together different red colors

479
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:01,640
to present the layering effect in the overall clothing

480
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,130
and to reflect the Sunset Glow spectacle of rich colors.

481
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,880
With this premise, we also use Su Embroidery

482
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,970
to embroider the lakes and rivers

483
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:12,790
as beautiful embellishments.

484
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,850
Cheng Yang, what is the progress of your team?

00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:28,680
The theme of our team's design is called Water Colors.

486
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,150
I hope, when people see this name,

487
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:35,030
they will relate to the classical elements in China.

488
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:37,290
The core design theme of Water Colors

489
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:40,460
is a technique in Chinese brush painting: splash ink.

490
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,980
We will use multiple dip-dying and splash ink

491
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,910
to make our fabric just like we are painting.

492
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:50,240
I hope that the fabric we present will show the scenery of clouds and mist,

493
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,930
clouds and mist turning into wind and rain, carefree and mystifying.

494
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:58,920
What about the silhouette and tailoring? What are your thoughts?

495
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,650
For tailoring, we want to

496
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:05,350
reference classical Chinese "Shen clothing" as the source of our inspiration. (A kind of clothing intertwined with the upper and lower garments of ancient times)

497
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:08,240
Wouldn't "Shen clothing" be too thick and heavy?

498
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,530
We've considered that aspect. We will reserve some special characteristics of Shen clothing

499
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:16,320
while considering modern people's clothing habits.

500
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,560
It will have the classic elegance and also present modern women's

501
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,400
curvacious figure.

502
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,470
It will simultaneously achieve youthfulness and lightness.

503
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:37,020
Both teams have given us fantastic presentations today.

504
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:40,890
After this morning, I am more confident

505
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,980
with our Symphony of Clouds and Mist product launch.

506
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:47,520
Going forward, I hope everyone will work together

507
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,200
and elevate Minghuan Fashion to a better stage. Thank you.

508
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,220
Mingxuan.

509
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:05,180
You were quite fair this time and did not favor Mo Fei.

510
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:09,110
You should know that I'm always fair and just.

511
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:11,240
I will not favor anyone.

512
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,930
I admit that Cheng Yang's work is fascinating.

513
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:18,420
However, for the overall consideration, I still believe Liu Pei's work

514
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,090
- has more future in the market.
- Xueling,

515
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:25,590
Cheng Yang is a designer with a very strong personal style.

516
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:28,170
I hope you can give him sufficient space.

517
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:32,470
Do you mean that I haven't given him enough space?

518
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:36,210
I saw in him his capability and talent.

519
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:41,070
I hope that you can let go of your bias and really collaborate with him.

520
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:43,120
You underestimate me, Mingxuan.

521
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,080
It's not that I don't see Cheng Yang's talent,

522
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,410
nor that I don't acknowledge a newcomer's capability.

523
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:51,010
The suggestions I've raised have all been based on the company's standpoint.

524
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:54,750
I will do my duty well. You don't need to remind me.

525
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:52,050
- The biopsy result is out.
- What are the results?

526
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:55,210
The result confirms that your sister has a malignant tumor in the brain.

527
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:57,580
It's already spreading.

528
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:13,270
- No, no, I'm afraid.
- I'm here. I'm here.

529
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:16,810
I'm here, I'm here.

530
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,830
Older Brother,

531
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,540
I was dreaming. Did I scare you?

532
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,860
No.

533
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,820
No.

534
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:56,420
You dreamed of him again?

535
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:01,460
I dreamed when we were young.

536
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:04,650
I wonder how Dad is doing now.

537
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:07,040
Why don't you care about yourself?

538
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,570
He is eating and drinking well.

539
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,400
His health is very good now.

540
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:24,600
Older Brother, are you angry with me?

541
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:27,520
Don't be silly.

542
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,190
How could I be angry with you?

543
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,090
As long as you can be well,

544
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:39,340
get over your illness, that's all I hope for.

545
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:45,430
These years when I was in Africa,

546
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,790
whenever I couldn't stand it,

547
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:53,350
I would think of you.

548
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,000
There is one other person in this world

549
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,360
who truly cared about me

550
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:04,350
and missed me.

551
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,930
Let me open the curtains.

552
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:48,830
Hello, Xiaoyu.

553
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:51,080
It's so late. Is everything okay?

554
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,260
Tell Fang Weiyuan to call me back.

555
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,910
Your father just fell asleep.

556
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:57,030
He's been sleeping poorly the last few days.

557
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:00,120
If he hasn't died, tell him to answer my call now.

558
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:04,200
Xiaoyu, please be more understanding of your father.

559
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,950
If you wake him up at this hour,

560
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:08,480
he won't be able to fall asleep again tonight.

561
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,420
How about this? As soon as he wakes up tomorrow morning, I'll tell him to call you back.

562
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,230
Do you not understand what I'm saying?

563
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:24,590
