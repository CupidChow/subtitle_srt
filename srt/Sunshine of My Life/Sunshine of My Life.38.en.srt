[Episode 38]

3
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,660
I know this matter

4
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,960
has caused the company a huge loss.

5
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,280
What you did,

6
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,800
is just according to the company rules.

7
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,550
Actually, I understand it 100 percent.

8
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:56,460
But as my boyfriend,

9
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,790
can you also understand me,

10
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,180
even if it's only 10 percent?

11
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,060
Don't blame me.

12
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,700
This matter really caused the company a huge loss.

13
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,350
In addition, I'm under a lot of pressure.

14
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,920
Thank you.

15
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,730
Wait a moment. Your ID, please.

16
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,550
ID number.

17
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,570
6530448

18
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,420
Okay, please go ahead.

19
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,220
If there's nothing else, I'll get going.

20
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,530
Did I say that you can go?

21
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,080
The designs being leaked is such a serious matter.

22
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,080
Is the matter over just because you wrote a reflection report?

23
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,020
Do you think that the word count isn't enough, or my attitude isn't sincere enough?

24
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,620
Regardless of how much you've written,

25
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,730
you can't make up for Mingyuan's loss, understand?

26
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,830
However, this matter hasn't been thoroughly investigated yet.

27
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,410
Besides, what do you mean by that?

28
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,750
Do you want me to compensate for the loss?

29
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,920
You think too highly of yourself.

30
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,130
Although you do not know the specific amount of loss,

31
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,970
you should have an estimate, right?

32
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,570
A child from an ordinary family like you

33
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:24,120
can't pay that amount even if you give everything you have.

34
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,310
Since you know I cannot pay that amount, what are you trying to say then?

35
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,030
I'm trying to say, you should think about

36
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,730
why the designs leaked were not from our team

37
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,530
but your and Cheng Yang's team.

38
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,230
More importantly, you should consider

39
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:41,260
whether you have the capabilities to stay and continue to work here.

40
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,580
Director Xia, why are you always targeting me?

41
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,680
I'm not targeting anyone.

42
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,130
The answer is very obvious already. Mingxuan just doesn't want to face it.

43
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,120
The company's computer system has always been acting normally.

44
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,580
Unless it was an inside job, how else can it leak out?

45
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,240
All right. Since you said that, then I must ask you this.

46
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,220
Why would I do that? What benefit do I get by doing that?

47
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,820
From my understanding, Bai Xiaoman from Haiyao

48
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,160
was your classmate in college. Right?

49
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,170
Yes.

50
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,600
Does Mingxuan know that?

51
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,400
He does.

52
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:29,480
If someone intentionally sells the design sketches to a rival company,

53
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,340
she makes more money, more quickly than working hard at the company

54
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,470
as a designer, right?

55
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,600
Mingxuan believes others too easily.

56
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,070
How can he allow a temporary assistant to access the company's accounts so casually?

57
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:49,030
So you're implying that it was I who gave the designs to Bai Xiaoman

58
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,380
just to get a little bit of money from her, right?

59
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,730
Fine. Since you have said that, bring out the evidence.

60
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:01,970
Because I also hope to get to the bottom of this matter soon.

61
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,990
Mo Fei, I'm just giving you a friendly reminder.

62
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,760
It's not too late to resign from Mingyuan now.

63
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,260
If we find out that you were involved in this,

64
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,170
not only will you land yourself in serious trouble,

65
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,950
but Mingxuan will be totally humiliated too.

66
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,320
Director Xia, keep your good intentions.

67
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,310
I don't need them.

68
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,360
President Tang, I've already talked to the PR department.

69
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,960
We've retracted all previous news about the product release.

70
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,390
At the same time, we have composed the article for the product release's postponement.

71
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,200
We already sent it to printed and internet media.

72
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,450
What about the security footage?

73
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:49,750
Jiaxi and I have looked at all the security footage from the start of the project until yesterday.

74
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,580
Aside from company employees, no outsiders came to our design studios.

75
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,260
What about our network system?

76
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,810
We checked that. There are no signs of being hacked.

77
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:04,010
We also checked the computers. There is no Trojan horse malware.

78
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,800
However, when checking Mo Fei and Teacher Cheng's design accounts,

79
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,400
we found something.

80
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,890
What was found?

81
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:20,610
We found an account was logged into, at past 2:00 a.m. that day.

82
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,320
Past 2:00 a.m.? Whose account was it?

83
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,330
It was Teacher Cheng's.

84
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,310
How is that possible?

85
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,340
It wasn't me.

86
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,700
Could there be a bug in the system, so there seems to be a problem?

87
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,150
That was what I thought at first too. But...

88
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,550
Chen Dongdong, can you finish what you want to say all at once? Stop talking as if you're squeezing the last bit of toothpaste out.

89
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,630
But we checked all the browsing records.

90
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,500
We found that the browsing records and the photos leaked that day

91
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,510
were the same.

92
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,400
President Tang.

93
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,780
Is whatever I say meaningless now?

94
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,130
I want to hear you say the truth.

95
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,320
The truth is, I didn't do it.

96
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,390
I didn't do anything to harm you or the company.

97
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,390
Then, what about the browsing records?

98
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,110
I do not know.

99
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:29,960
I really don't know. We already finished the design sketches two weeks ago.

100
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,550
My focus has been on production.

101
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,420
I haven't looked at them for a long time now.

102
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:39,120
Even if I do look at them, it's impossible I would look at them at 2:00 a.m.

103
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,230
Tell me the truth.

104
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,910
Aside from you, who else knows about your account information?

105
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,590
I've kept it a secret from everyone,

106
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,890
including my girlfriend.

107
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:10,330
You know that in regards to this matter, as the person in charge of the company,

108
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:14,130
I must provide an explanation to everyone.

109
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,450
I understand, President Tang.

110
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,910
In that case, I can only prove my innocence by resigning.

111
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,540
What's the use of resigning?

112
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,350
If you resign now, everyone will think that you are feeling guilty.

113
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,660
Even more so, you cannot prove anything.

114
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,260
But I really have no way

115
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:38,620
to prove that these browsing records have nothing to do with me.

116
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,950
I understand.

117
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,620
Cheng Yang, let me tell you my stance.

118
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,160
Even though this issue caused a huge loss for the company,

119
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,810
I will not easily find someone to take the blame.

120
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,200
Go home and rest for a few days.

121
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,080
Think carefully about how you will proceed with work.

122
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,990
After all, you must produce great works in order

123
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,610
to make up for the loss.

124
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,370
I understand.

125
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,100
Thank you, President Tang.

126
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,770
Say, what do you think is going on?

127
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,280
Are you all right?

128
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,520
Did you explain it to him?

129
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,510
Mo Fei, do you believe in me?

130
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,610
I wouldn't betray the company.

131
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:52,190
Of course, I believe in you. I definitely believe you wouldn't do such a thing.

132
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,890
Not just me, everyone believes in you.

133
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,750
Right, Dongdong?

134
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,020
Teacher Cheng, I also want to believe that you didn't do it.

135
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,620
But we checked everyone in the company.

136
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,070
Only your account had an issue.

137
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,430
Even if there's some kind of misunderstanding,

138
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,040
how can you explain the leaked photos being

139
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,530
the exact same as those in Haiyao's product launch?

140
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,570
Dongdong, say, we've been working together for so long now.

141
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,720
Why don't you have the most fundamental trust in him?

142
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,890
Do you believe that Teacher Cheng—

143
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,080
I can only say I believe in evidence.

144
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,180
It's fine. I just wanted to tell you

145
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,300
that I won't be here tomorrow.

146
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:38,160
What? Is he firing you?

147
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,510
Let's have a talk.

148
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,800
Come and sit down.

149
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,900
What's the matter?

150
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,970
We don't know exactly what happened yet.

151
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,980
We cannot determine that Cheng Yang did it, just because the photos browsed in his account

152
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,860
are the same as those leaked.

153
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,390
If you suspend him now, it's the same as telling everyone in the company

154
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,510
that he's the culprit.

155
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,950
Did you just say

156
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:27,030
that we don't know what happened yet?

157
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,260
Actually, I'm just like you.

158
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,410
I also don't believe that Cheng Yang would do something like this.

159
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:37,330
But in the process of evaluation, we can't be too subjective.

160
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:41,620
I must provide an explanation to everyone involved in the company.

161
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,470
All right. Let me ask you this then.

162
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,720
Everyone saw Cheng Yang's efforts towards the splash-ink.

163
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,000
Why would he shoot himself in the foot?

164
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,510
Mo Fei,

165
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,900
don't you think you are overstepping a bit now?

166
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,990
Okay.

♫ You'll surely be sad ♫

168

186
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,600
I didn't expect your team would disband so quickly.

187
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,530
President Tang is the one who will decide whether the team disbands.

188
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:36,460
That's right. You originally came as an intern.

189
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:40,840
If I remember correctly, you will start school soon. Right?

190
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:45,670
I'll wait till we get to the bottom of this before I leave.

191
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,900
In order not to delay your studies,

192
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,770
it looks like we must invite the relevant department here to handle this.

193
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,620
- What do you mean?
- Exactly what I said.

194
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,260
You want to call the police?

195
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:07,220
Mingxuan has time to humor you, but the shareholders do not.

196
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,360
Everyone's time is very precious.

197
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,340
You should let the professionals take care of these things.

198
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,950
After all, our company is not the court, isn't that right?

199
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,850
What do you want?

200
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,940
Give me five days' time, I'll prove Cheng Yang's innocence.

201
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,540
Who gave you the right to request that of me?

202
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,890
Haven't you been hoping that I leave Mingyuan?

203
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:38,890
If I'm unable to prove Cheng Yang's innocence in five days,

204
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,210
I will pack my things and leave.

205
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,600
What? You don't want me to leave?

206
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:50,300
All right. At most, two days.

207
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,290
- Three days.
- Don't go overboard.

208
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:57,050
Otherwise, I'll continue to stay at Mingyuan forever.

209
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:13,240
When the time comes, I'll ask security to pack up all your stuff.

210
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:46,520
Because of the product launch, the company's stock prices keep dropping.

211
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,800
I'm sorry, Dad.

212
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,520
Towards the SLC acquisition,

213
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,970
we spent so much time and money.

214
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:03,390
What happened with the SLC acquisition is a big blow to our company.

215
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:07,060
If something like this happens again,

216
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,530
the consequences will be beyond imaginable.

217
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,240
Dad.

218
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,110
I have let down your trust in me.

219
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:19,190
But I hope you can believe in me.

220
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,960
I can take care of the subsequent consequences.

221
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,420
Have you gone to Uncle Xia's house lately?

222
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,200
No.

223
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,130
Go visit often.

224
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,560
The company is in a chaotic time now.

225
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,590
Getting the Xia family's support is very important.

226
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:41,720
I am capable of handling this matter myself.

227
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:48,570
Mingxuan, after all these years, you should know very well

228
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:51,610
that I don't want to interfere in things.

229
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,240
However, since it involves the survival of the company,

230
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,270
I must interfere. This is my nature.

231
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:03,670
You must know that you're not only responsible for one person

232
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:07,050
but the survival and future of an entire enterprise.

233
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:11,220
It's the livelihood of all of Mingyuan's employees.

234
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,690
You are my son,

235
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:19,160
the second-generation heir of the company. You can't change your fate.

236
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,470
It's your end result.

237
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,800
You must know that one day, your Uncle Xia, Fang Weiguo, and I

238
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,450
will retire.

239
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:35,430
So you must be mature and prudent.

240
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:39,430
Make yourself strong and powerful in order to shoulder an enterprise.

241
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,260
Do you understand?

242
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,340
I understand.

243
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:57,350
[Document browsed at 2:22 a.m. by Cheng Yang]

244
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,750
Why did it happen that day?

245
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,050
That day...

246
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,920
What's so special about that day?

247
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,020
What are you mumbling about?

248
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,580
Are you possessed?

249
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,260
Scared me to death. Go get me a Coke.

250
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,390
You're still drinking Coke? It's very fattening.

251
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,820
I have a boyfriend now. Hurry up.

252
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,410
From what I see, you just want to order me around a bit.

253
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,160
Cheng Yang.

254
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,800
It's your phone ringing, right?

255
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,900
Why are you not answering it?

256
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,790
Hello, Cheng Yang. Think very carefully

257
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,200
about what happened that day. Who were you with?

258
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,990
Why did you log in around 2:00 a.m.?

259
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,640
Who are you?

260
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,700
- Cheng Yang?
- Mo Fei?

261
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,390
Come over and drink.

262
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,530
If you don't drink, I won't talk to you.

263
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,490
Mo Fei.

264
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,110
I've been meaning to call you.

265
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:17,020
He's drinking a lot at home. What exactly happened?

266
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:21,600
Is it because of the design sketches? They haven't found out what happened yet?

267
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,190
Why isn't he even going to work now?

268
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:27,430
If we were in ancient times, isn't this treating human life as if it were mere grass?
 (T/N: totally disregard for human livelihood)

269
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:30,060
Duoduo, don't be so uncultured.

270
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,040
How was a human life disregarded?

271
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,960
Grass? What grass?

272
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,220
You shut up.

273
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Who exactly is investigating this matter?

274
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,220
Is it your President Tang?

275
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,690
This won't do. I'll go to the office personally tomorrow and reason with him.

276
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:49,730
Duoduo, don't be so agitated yet.

277
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,500
This is a little complicated.

278
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,560
It's not complicated. Let me tell you, Mo Fei. It's not complicated at all.

279
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,970
He's not that kind of person. Besides, he doesn't have the guts to do that at all.

280
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,880
Duoduo, now is not the time to act rashly.

281
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,440
I'm not doing that. I know my man very well.

282
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,970
He's not that kind of person at all.

283
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,320
Otherwise, he wouldn't want me long ago

284
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,160
and we wouldn't be together for so long,

285
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,560
Do you know, Mo Fei?

286
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,820
Let's do this. Cheng Yang is not in a good condition, so he definitely won't be able to work.

287
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,460
Take care of him and spend some time with him.

288
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,520
Just treat it as a long vacation, okay?

289
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:37,090
Okay, I have to go. it looks like he wants to vomit.

290
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:42,480
Sister, have you changed careers and become Sherlock Holmes now?

291
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:48,650
Did something happen at Brother-in-Law's company?

292
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:54,450
- How do you know?
- How do I not know? The show has been postponed.

293
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:57,330
It's such a serious matter. I'm not stupid.

294
00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:00,240
Are there rumors going around?

295
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,750
- Not really.
- That's good.

296
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:07,060
They're just saying... that Mingyuan's going to collapse or something.

297
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,130
W-What?

298
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,280
You're awake?

299
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,680
I made some porridge for you.

300
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,910
Have some.

301
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,170
I'm sorry, Duoduo.

302
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,470
What are you saying?

303
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:59,000
No matter what others say about you,

304
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,960
Only I believe you.

305
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,520
I'm always on your side.

306
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:10,660
- You're dead. Okay. Wait.
- I'm not playing anymore.

307
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,400
- Don't be like that.
- I'm done playing.

308
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,430
I haven't played enough yet.

309
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:17,220
Let's play one more round. One more.

310
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,440
- I'll let you win. I'll let you win.
- No, wait.

311
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,440
Your cousin's product launch has been postponed, yet you're in the mood to play games?

312
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,650
- Aren't you worried?
- What should I be worried about?

313
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:28,090
It's just postponed. It's not like it's canceled.

314
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:31,200
- They are saying Mingyuan will collapse.
- Collapse?

315
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,530
Let them say whatever they want.

316
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:38,410
They're just saying. It's not like it will really collapse because they said so.

317
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,380
Do you know what happened?

318
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:46,110
I think it's related to some design sketches.

319
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,250
No wonder my sister has been acting mysterious lately

320
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,200
like Sherlock Holmes.

321
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,320
Tell your sister to not worry. She can feel at ease.

322
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,370
My brother is incredible.

323
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:00,250
There is nothing he can't overcome. It's just...

324
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:04,550
He can take care of such a trivial matter. Tell your sister to stop worrying.

325
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:09,280
You're his cousin after all. You should have some concern for the company, right?

326
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,930
- I... I'm not interested.
- Then...

327
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,840
Then, what are you interested in?

328
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,640
I...

329
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,190
You're really annoying. I died. I won't play with you anymore.

330
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,410
Hey, don't leave.

331
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,000
I'll play a few more rounds with you.

332
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:45,080
Then I'll be kind and practice a few more rounds with you.

333
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,030
Are you playing or not?

334
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,650
[December 13, 2019: Production of new clothing complete.]

335
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,080
Who was the last person with Teacher Cheng yesterday?

336
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,120
Shen Jiaxi.

337
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:20,800
They went in at 2:14 a.m.

338
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,040
Duoduo, where are you? I discovered something important.

339
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,650
Do you remember when we checked the security footage that day,

340
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:41,590
you and Shen Jiaxi happened to go into the room at 2:14 a.m.?

341
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:46,230
And the design sketches were leaked that day.

342
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:50,550
It also coincides with the time you two went into the room.

343
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:53,030
Mo Fei, are you saying that

344
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,800
Shen Jiaxi is the one who stole the design sketches?

345
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,480
Excuse me. ID, please.

346
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,420
No, we have urgent matters.

347
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,800
I'm sorry. You must have an ID to go inside.

348
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,140
- Handsome Brother, it wasn't like this two days ago.
- I'm sorry.

349
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,820
Duoduo, it's like this. Ever since the design sketches were leaked, the company tightened its security.

350
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,290
How about I go in to talk to Shen Jiaxi, first?

351
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:26,040
After all, we've been friends for so many years.

352
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,200
I'm afraid your attitude might intensify the conflict.

353
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,520
We'll wait for you outside then.

354
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,170
What is this about? Tell me. I'm busy.

355
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,350
After the gathering ended that day, what time did you take Cheng Yang to the hotel?

356
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,120
You just won't stop, will you?

357
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,110
I don't have that much time to entertain you.

358
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:02,690
When he logged into the system, you happened to be with him.

359
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,810
Were we together just because you say so?

360
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,960
The hotel's security footage recorded it.

361
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,940
And then? What are you trying to say?

362
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:23,640
So it's you who gave Haiyao the design sketches, right?

363
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,930
Mo Fei, did you not take your medication?
 (saying she's insane)

364
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:30,130
What do the leaked design sketches have to do with me?

365
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:34,860
You're saying the security camera recorded the time Cheng Yang and I were together.

366
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,530
Did it record

367
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:40,040
what Cheng Yang and I did then? Did it?

368
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,700
If you take this evidence to court,

369
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:47,830
can it prove that I personally stole the design sketches

370
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:52,040
and then personally gave them to Haiyao?

371
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,360
At least that casts suspicion on you.

372
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,070
Right. Speaking of suspicion,

373
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,410
isn't Cheng Yang the most suspicious?

374
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,410
Oh, right!

375
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,210
It seems that you also have access.

376
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:11,740
There's no evidence against you now.

377
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:14,850
But can you be sure that you are clean?

378
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:17,880
Shen Jiaxi, what are you saying? We've known each other for so long.

379
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,610
Do you not know what kind of person I am?

380
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:21,850
So you also know that we've known each other for many years.

381
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:25,550
Before you came to ask me about this, did you consider that then?

382
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,450
Mo Fei, people

383
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:31,560
shouldn't live with double standards.

384
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,610
Since you got a hold of Tang Mingxuan, can you dare say you haven't changed?

385
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:38,640
What does this have to do with Tang Mingxuan?

386
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,510
This isn't the first time you came to find fault with me.

387
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:45,300
In order to help clear Cheng Yang's name, you're going to frame me like this?

388
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,270
Or could it be that both of you are involved

389
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,270
in leaking the design

390
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:57,160
and now you're anxiously looking for someone to be your scapegoat?

391
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:06,490
Shen Jiaxi.

392
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,920
You know exactly what you did very well.

393
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,430
I really don't know what I did.

394
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,640
But one thing I know is...

395
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,210
If you continue to bother me again,

396
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:22,160
I'll call the police.

397
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:35,870
So you went to confront Shen Jiaxi today and failed?

398
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:40,150
That's right. I said what I had to say already. But it was useless.

399
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,860
Didn't you tell her we have

400
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,620
the security footage of the hotel as evidence?

401
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,690
I did say that, but she just won't admit to it.

402
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:51,000
It looks like we can only think of another way.

403
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,770
From what I see, she's acting out, isn't she?

404
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,900
She's just bullying the weak and is afraid of those stronger. Let me tell you, Mo Fei.

405
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,920
Did she forget about how much the slap I gave her last time hurt?

406
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,230
Duoduo, stay calm. Being impulsive is like being the devil.

407
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:06,330
This won't do. You have to listen to me this time.

408
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:21,280
Hey. Noodles are here. The noodles are here.

409
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,830
Look.

410
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:26,080
They smell so good. You waited anxiously, right?

411
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,460
Enjoy.

412
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,680
What's the matter?

413
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,960
Are you still mad at me?

414
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:04,060
I admit that when I'm working, my attitude is not good.

415
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,330
I'll apologize to you.

416
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:09,280
But work is work and personal life is personal life.

417
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,320
You can't be mad at me in private, too.

418
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,240
Right now, it's not about work issues. It's that our ideologies

419
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,870
- are in conflict.
- Everyone's ideologies are different, to begin with.

420
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:24,030
Furthermore, at work, our positions are different, too.

421
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:27,390
But we're talking about Cheng Yang here.

422
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,720
He is the designer you personally hired.

423
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,010
Besides, this matter hasn't been investigated thoroughly yet

424
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:36,040
and y-you completely put the blame on him.

425
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,850
It's like this.

426
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,560
First, he is our mutual friend. We should trust him, right?

427
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:47,140
But in life, you, me, and he will make mistakes.

428
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,840
It's fine to make mistakes.

429
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,610
I just want to know exactly the reason

430
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:53,480
- behind it.
- See.

431
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,500
You're very subjective right now. You're assuming he's guilty.

432
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,500
Aren't you subjective?

433
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,720
If you can tell me something definite today

434
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,320
to prove Cheng Yang has nothing to do with this matter at all,

435
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,920
then I will personally apologize to both of you today.

436
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:20,060
We all believe that Cheng Yang wouldn't take the design sketches

437
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:23,330
and go to Haiyao to give them.

438
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:26,150
However, the reality of what happened

439
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:29,850
is that the leak was through him.

440
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:32,160
This we can't deny, right?

441
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:35,760
Actually...

442
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,410
Forget it. We'll get to

443
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,720
the bottom of this soon.

444
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,260
If we don't eat, the noodles will get cold.

445
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,440
Today, let's eat from one bowl. Okay?

446
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:59,460
- I'll eat the crab meat and noodles. You drink the soup.
- No.

447
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,970
- Then what?
- I'll eat the meat, you eat the noodles.

448
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:06,560
- Who drinks the soup?
- You drink the soup.

449
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,530
Come on, let's eat.

450
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,920
Shen Jiaxi!

451
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,880
You horrible person! What did Cheng Yang do to you?

452
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,430
- Why are you doing this to him?
- Are you crazy?

453
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:28,240
If you haven't, go home and take your medicine. Did you not hit me enough last time?

454
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,710
Let me tell you. We didn't want to embarrass you, but you don't want that.

455
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,720
Is it that hard to testify?

456
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,600
Listen. A wretched person like you deserves to be beaten to death.

457
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,660
I don't want to testify. What can you do? You, you.

458
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,630
Duoduo! Duoduo, calm down!

459
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,610
Cheng Yang.

460
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,580
What happened today is extremely ridiculous.

461
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,910
Because of the press conference,

462
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:03,090
there is already a lot of negative news about our company.

463
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:05,970
- Yet this happened.
- That's right.

464
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,380
Before, Mo Fei has kept causing trouble for me.

465
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,720
From what I see, Cheng Yang's girlfriend doesn't seem like an unreasonable person.

466
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,850
There must be someone instigating this.

467
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,850
- Shen Jiaxi, shut your mouth.
- Duoduo.

468
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,800
What do you mean? Do you want to hit me again?

469
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,000
Why are you putting on an act?

470
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,960
- Don't you believe that I'll hit you again?
- You've gotten used to hitting me, haven't you?

471
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,050
- Duoduo.
- Are you guys done fighting?

472
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,930
Is this your home?

473
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,540
President Tang. Director Xia.

474
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,600
I apologize on behalf of Duoduo.

475
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,800
I know what happened today

476
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,560
will have a very negative effect on the company.

477
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,560
I'm sorry.

478
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,680
Let's talk about how to handle this matter.

479
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:55,420
Cheng Yang, you are the most suspicious of leaking the design sketches.

480
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,510
You're currently suspended.

481
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,540
You're not reflecting at home

482
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:02,480
and you're bringing your girlfriend here to cause trouble for our team's Shen Jiaxi.

483
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,110
You even got physical in front of the company.

484
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:09,210
So I think it is very necessary to send you all to the police

485
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,770
for investigation. Also,

486
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:15,520
we'll send a lawyer's letter to hold you responsible for what happened.

487
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,640
- Wait! What do you mean by that?
- Fine.

488
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,980
Director Xia, there's still one day left based on our agreement.

489
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,070
What do you mean?

490
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:32,700
I've made an agreement with Director Xia that I would find the culprit in three days.

491
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,290
Otherwise,

492
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:37,160
I'll resign.

493
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,130
Did I agree to that?

494
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,690
I've already decided.

495
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:53,520
Mo Fei, one day is not enough time. Right?

496
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,620
As long as we have time, there's hope.

497
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,710
I want to try my luck.

498
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,760
If I were to say, in life,

499
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,420
there are many times when we need luck.

500
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,840
I feel like I'm very lucky to have been classmates with you, Xiaoman.

501
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,300
Thank you, my dear.

502
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,370
I almost forgot.

503
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:38,610
This is Van Cleef and Arpels' latest bracelet.

504
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,940
It looks very nice.

505
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,950
You're giving me gifts again? I feel embarrassed.

506
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:46,960
It's fine. I have lots of jewelry anyway.

507
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,640
Xiaoman, you treat me so well.

508
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,630
I don't even know how to repay you.

509
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:54,960
What do you mean repay? We have been old classmates for so many years now.

510
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,730
Don't say such courteous things.

511
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,890
It does look very nice.

512
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:03,290
Mo Fei is really stupid. Why did she offend you? She can't win against you.

513
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:06,280
Perhaps I have

514
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,110
a bit more luck than her.

515
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:12,370
You don't just have a bit more luck than her.

516
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:15,520
What you have more of, are your capabilities, IQ, and EQ.

517
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,820
Yesterday, Mo Fei was like a fool.

518
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:21,610
She questioned me and asked if I gave you and Haiyao the design sketches.

519
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:24,290
Say, she had no evidence

520
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:28,160
yet she came to see me. Isn't she just humiliating herself?

521
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,250
I know, right?

522
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:34,520
However, so what if she knows the truth?

523
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,240
Words alone are not evidence after all.

524
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:41,260
I think this time, even President Tang

525
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,640
won't believe her. Right?

526
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,330
Tomorrow is the deadline for her agreement with Xia Xueling.

527
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:50,040
I'm really looking forward to seeing her pack her things and leave.

528
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:56,800
But it's such a shame about Cheng Yang.

529
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,560
I think he's a very talented designer.

530
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,520
Why did he choose Mingyuan back then?

531
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,640
If he had come to work for me,

532
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,480
this wouldn't have happened.

533
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,690
Cheng Yang is a softy who is afraid of his wife.

534
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:13,920
He deserves to take the blame. In gatherings, everyone takes a sip when drinking.

535
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,550
He couldn't wait to go straight to the bottle.

536
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:19,030
However, if men don't get drunk,

537
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:21,450
how would women have opportunities?

538
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:27,120
Oh, right! That day when I took him to the hotel,

539
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,050
he was so drunk that he passed out.

540
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:34,690
Duoduo, don't touch me.

541
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,150
Teacher Cheng.

542
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,800
Duoduo, don't touch me.

543
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,400
Teacher Cheng? Teacher Cheng.
