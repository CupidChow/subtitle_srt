[Episode 41]

3
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,000
President Tang, you have great taste indeed.

4
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It is magnificent.

5
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,800
How many stories does this building have?

6
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,000
You didn't come here to look at the view, right?

7
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,330
It's like this.

8
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,800
I've received the lawyer's letter.

9
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,400
I came here today to specifically apologize to you.

10
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,200
I wasn't aware of this matter at all.

11
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,400
That Bai Xiaoman did this all behind my back.

12
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,900
If I had known, I would have stopped her.

13
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,800
Did you instigate it?

14
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,600
After all, didn't you do the same thing before?

15
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,200
I admit that back then when I first started managing the company,

16
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,400
I pulled some dirty tricks.

17
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,600
But my intention was to learn from the successful experiences of others.

18
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,200
I didn't cause any negative impact, right?

19
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,800
Please believe it when I say Bai Xiaoman and I are completely different.

20
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,400
I'm highly educated and I have a family inheritance.

21
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,200
I want to save face and I have professional ethics.

22
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,810
Let me say it like this.

23
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,800
When it comes to the fashion company, I have

24
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,000
no interest at all. I don't like it.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,400
Bai Xiaoman promised me that she would

26
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,800
manage the company well on my behalf.

27
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,000
Being easily swayed, I said you can go manage it then.

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,800
Who knew she would create such a mess?

29
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,600
I must even personally come to clean up her mess.

30
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,400
President Tang,

31
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,570
regardless of how big Haiyao has grown now,

32
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,500
it's something my father put in so much effort to build from the ground up.

33
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,600
I can't let it be ruined at the hand of a woman, right?

34
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,400
Both of our companies

35
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,800
are the biggest, most well-known brands in the country.

36
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,000
But times are difficult for everyone now.

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,600
We've been bullied by e-commerce to what state? You should know.

38
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,300
How many of our stores have closed down?

39
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,200
Under these circumstances, we should get through the difficulties together, right?

40
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,000
We can't tear each other down.

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Look, it seems like you know the situation very well, don't you?

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,300
You should know very clearly

43
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,200
how much money our company lost because of this.

44
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,200
I understand. I'm here today to be face to face with you, just the two of us,

45
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,800
have an open and honest discussion.

46
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,000
I obviously didn't come today to evade responsibility.

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,100
I came to resolve the problem. If there's a problem, we should discuss it civilly.

48
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,200
How do you want to resolve this then?

49
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,400
I do have an idea.

50
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,800
If...

51
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:24,000
If Mingyuan acquires Haiyao,

52
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,400
then we will be a family.

53
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,200
Since we are a family,

54
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,200
then the plagiarism issue shouldn't exist. Right?

55
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,020
You'll be leaving in six days.

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,800
What do you want to do in these six days?

57
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,000
I haven't finished my assignment yet.

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You still have to do an assignment?

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You only have six days left yet you're not even thinking about how you're going to spend it with me?

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,600
I want to spend time with you, but I haven't finished my assignment.

61
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,600
What kind of assignment?

62
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,000
This time, I want to take some handmade ramie back to France.

63
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,600
Why do you suddenly want to find ramie?

64
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,600
Even though handmade ramie isn't that exquisite,

65
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,800
but it's very practical.

66
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,600
Compared to embroidery,

67
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,400
it also has a very long history.

68
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,600
Using it to present traditional culture is very suitable. What do you think?

69
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,000
Of course, I know a place that produces ramie.

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,100
Really?

71
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,700
Well... can you...

72
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,000
If you behave then I'll take you there.

73
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Little Cutie.

74
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,000

No need. We drove here.

76
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,800
Thank you very much for the lively lesson on ramie this time.

77
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,000
President Tang, you're too polite. This is what we should do.

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,300
- Have a safe trip.
- Thank you.

The ramie factory we visited is amazing.

82
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,400
Say, those ancient workers were so wise.

83
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,300
4,700 years ago, they already knew how to use ramie to make clothes.

84
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,800
Cutie, you've learned a lot.

85
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,320
I think I'll definitely get a good grade

Yes. Where are we going now?

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,400
Say, can we rest for a while?

94
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,200
How long have we hiked? We've already rested three times.

95

I'm exhausted. How much longer do we need to keep climbing?

I also know very well that that there may not be any results for his efforts.

158
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:42,060

is Mingxuan's attitude.

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,470
Old Xia, since you have mentioned that,

164
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:00,060
I believe you have your own take on this matter.

165
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,030
Tell me about it.

166
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,610
In regards to this matter...

167
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,680
I'm all right.

168
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,920
It's already swollen and you're saying you're all right?

169
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,220
- It doesn't hurt.
- It doesn't hurt?

170
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,430
Stop rubbing! Stop rubbing!

171
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,660
What are you thinking about?

172
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,730
Before,

173
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,400
I frequently thought of a sentence in the book, "The Little Prince."

174
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,220
"I live alone just like this,

175
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,130
with no one whom I can truly talk to."

176
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,730
But ever since I met you,

177
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,080
I feel like I live every day very happily.

178
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,220
Life became colorful.

179
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,290
You are like my sleeping pill.

180
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,160
Every night you help me sleep.

181
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,050
Every day I can have a good dream.

182
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,110
Thank you.

183
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,920
What's wrong?

184
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,550
I am thinking,

185
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,410
should I stay and keep you company?

186
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,560
Absolutely.

187
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,200
Of course, you have to go back there to study well in school.

188
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,930
Don't you want to be an outstanding designer?

189
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,400
I am waiting to see your fashion show.

190
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,490
My future wife is the best.

191
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,330
- I'm back.
- Hey, Zhu Zhu!

192
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,450
- Have you eaten?
- I have.

193
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,980
Come here. Have some fruit.

194
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,100
The mango isn't bad.

195
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,680
It is really pretty. Where did you buy it from?

196
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,800
It is pretty, right? My friend gave it to me.

197
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,510
Very plump.

198
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:06,150
A friend? Boy or girl?

199
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,670
Why are you being so serious, Auntie?

200
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:12,730
You are a girl. Society is so messy. What would we do if you met a bad person?

201
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:15,200
If you were to meet, what is it called? A playboy?

202
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,880
Playboy? Auntie, do you even know about playboys?

203
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,560
I am keeping up with the times.

204
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,630
That's easy to solve. Have Zhu Zhu get a boyfriend to protect her.

205
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,710
If you really have a boyfriend, you have to bring him home for us to see.

206
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,000
It is not a boyfriend. It is just a normal friend.

207
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,330
Do you dare to have a boyfriend?

208
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,810
Normal friend.

209
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,560
Do you know where your brother went?

210
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,510
I have been calling him the whole day and can't get in touch with him.

211
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,640
It's probably because there's no signal in the mountains.

212
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,770
- Mountains?
- Why did he go to the mountains?

213
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,550
He went to look for Sister Mo Fei.

214
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,710
Don't you feel that ever since he met Sister Mo Fei,

215
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,640
he is much happier?

216
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,290
Even his life outside of work has become richer.

217
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,650
Of course, it's a good thing for youngsters

218
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:02,480
to use their free time to experience nature.

219
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,720
What time is it right now?

220
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,230
How anxious is everyone over the company right now?

221
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,850
Yet he's in the mood to go explore the mountains with her.

222
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:15,000
If Xia Zhendong and the other shareholders find out, what would they think?

223
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,590
Isn't there a saying?

224
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,350
"Only people who know how to play know how to work."

225
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,800
He should have his freedom.

226
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,370
He is the company's president.

227
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:27,280
His freedom and non-freedom are related to the company's interests.

228
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,920
If he wants freedom, fine.

229
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,560
The unemployed wanderers of the street are very free. Will he go become them?

230
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:37,610
I can't win against you. You are always right.

231
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,970
Oh my! Be careful, be careful.

232
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,200
- Mom.
- It's swollen!

233
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,030
I'm fine. I'm fine.

234
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,910
- It doesn't hurt at all!
- I'm sorry. I didn't take good care of her, Aunt.

235
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,180
How is it your fault? It's hers.

236
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:02,020
Always running around.

237
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,600
I'm not a child. I can take good care of myself.

238
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,830
Children are more sensible than you, all right?

239
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,700
You don't even think to tell us that you are going so far. If it weren't for Brother-in-Law, would you have been able to come back?

240
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,060
Let me warn you. Don't think that because my foot is twisted that I can't beat you!

241
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,730
Enough!

242
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,370
Forget the fact that you two argue when you're home alone. You two are still arguing with a guest here?

243
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,240
I'm already used to them being like this, Aunt.

244
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,790
Mingxuan, there's no time like the present.

245
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,740
I was just talking to Mo Fan about inviting you here for dinner.

246
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,300
- Since you have come today, stay for dinner.
- Okay.

247
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,790
Then have a seat for now. Keep the ice on.

248
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,360
- Mom, I'll help you.
- I'm fine.

249
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,490
- Thank you.
- You are still saying you're all right? You even cried in the car earlier.

250
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:44,600
Isn't it embarrassing? Who was crying

251
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,430
- saying "it hurts"?
- Stop talking about it.

252
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,990
Mingxuan, we called you here because of this.

253
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,580
Earlier your Uncle Xia came.

254
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:07,140
He came to discuss the shares between our two families.

255
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,320
It is like this. The Xia family will continue to support us as always.

256
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,890
Currently, the Xia family's shares are in Xueling's control.

257
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:18,040
He suggested that we act in concert.

258
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,480
If that's the case, with our families' strength,

259
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,390
as well as those of some small shareholders who support us,

260
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:27,390
then Fang Weiguo's side won't be a threat at all. Isn't that right?

261
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,830
Yes.

262
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,560
From my understanding of Uncle Xia,

263
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,520
- there should be more, right?
- Yes.

264
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:42,540
How should I say this? Uncle Xia's suggestion is

265
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,380
since the two families' shares are combined

266
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,690
towards Xueling,

267
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,680
we should give her some...

268
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,210
Reassurance... a simple reassurance. Reassurance.

269
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,660
What reassurance?

270
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,740
Why are you making it sound like a deal?

271
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,450
You say it then.

272
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,800
Son, it is like this.

273
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,290
We have watched Xueling grow up so we know her extremely well.

274
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,420
You two have also been childhood sweethearts for so many years,

275
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,000
so there should be feelings.

276
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,200
The Xia family also isn't willing to contribute for nothing.

277
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,300
The shares were originally Xia Zhendong's wedding dowry for Xueling.

278
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,120
I feel that makes perfect sense.

279
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,190
So... that is the current situation.

280
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:34,370
We also cannot tie up a white wolf with our bare hands, right?

281
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:39,020
Actually, you guys don't need to say this much nor need to beat around the bush.

282
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,470
For the company's interest, you two are prepared to sell your son again.

283
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,340
- Is that right?
- No.

284
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,390
Let me tell you two this. Impossible.

285
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:52,160
- Mingxuan!
- It is not my idea!

286
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,950
I knew we wouldn't be able to persuade him.

287
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,990
B-But we have to solve this matter. Do you have another plan?

288
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,970
I don't have another plan but

289
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,320
Old Xia is really something. Why would he mention this?

290
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,680
Why is this child like this?

291
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,940
Is he not a part of this family?

292
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,930
Is he not the person who benefits most from the company?

293
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,290
Right now, the family and the company are in a crisis,

294
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:16,650
- so what if he makes some sacrifices?
- It is not the same.

295
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,050
- How is it not the same?
- You and Old Xia are talking about interest,

296
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,520
but he is talking about his feelings.

297
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,220
Right? We should respect his wishes.

298
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,190
He can't just enjoy the benefits of the company

299
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,760
and not be willing to make any sacrifices, right?

300
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,980
The company is so big. Who hasn't made any sacrifices?

301
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,660
Let's think of something else.

302
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:50,760
What? Why do you keep on moving around in bed?

303
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,400
- What's wrong?
- Today, when Mingxuan

304
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,650
was talking to me with that attitude, why didn't you say a single thing?

305
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,690
What do you want me to say?

306
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:06,520
I cannot force him to marry a certain woman.

307
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,170
You also cannot.

308
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:12,400
Besides, should we have learned our lesson from our experience with Fang Qian?

309
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,380
If you keep on pushing him

310
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,800
and one day your son decides to be a bachelor for the rest of his life because you pushed him too far, let's see what you'll do.

311
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,080
You will regret it for life.

312
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,890
Let me ask you.

313
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:29,480
When we were young, I wished that you would spend more time with me.

314
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,130
Remember my birthday, remember our anniversary date.

315
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,880
Did you remember them?

316
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,050
- Those aren't important.
- They are. You don't even remember them now.

317
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,340
When Mingxuan was 7,

318
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,040
he had a high fever and pneumonia.

You were at the factory rushing to produce the products with the workers.

I took him to the hospital alone.

That year, I also had kidney stone removal surgery.

323
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,010
I signed the papers alone and got the surgery alone.

324
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:59,330
Where were you? You were on a business trip overseas.

325
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,800
Yes. Wasn't I busy?

326
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,020
That's right. Who hasn't made sacrifices for this company

Your position dictates what you should be saying.

Today, he only cares about those trivial romantic feelings.

How can he achieve great deeds?

331

Ever since ancient times, even emperors had to make decisions.

332
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,820
Why can't he make sacrifices for the company's interests?

333

Unless he can take care of both things,

335
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,240
then I will shut up forever.

336

Don't pretend you can't hear me.

337
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,440
You just indulge him.

338
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,900
You've spoiled him, causing him to be like this.

Do you have that much free time?

342
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,920
Do you think I want to do this? Your man gave me this task.

343
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,030
He said that when he's not around, I have to take good care of you.

344
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,090
I realized, in his eyes, you

345
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,790
can't take care of yourself at all.

346

We've met somewhere before, right?

I also think you look very familiar, too.

Why do you look so familiar?

Oh my heavens. It was so long ago and you still remember?

Oh my heavens. Let me give you a hug.

How come you haven't changed a bit?

- You're still so beautiful.
- Oh, no. No, no.

- Do you live here?
- Yes.

Look at us, just chatting. Come up to my home to sit.

371
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,820
- What a coincidence.
- Let's go. Let's go.

372
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,020
How did I run into you here?

373
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,300
What a coincidence.

374
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,930
It has been years since we last met each other.

375

I never expected us to run into each other in the hallway.

376
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,730
Yes. This is probably fate.

377
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,760
You don't say. You are getting more and more elegant over the years.

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,770
No, no. I'm old now. You're the one who hasn't changed.

379
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:09,490
I remember when you worked with us.

380
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,280
You were the best model on the team.

381
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,810
Have you switched careers now?

382
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:16,260
Switched careers? No.

383
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,680
I noticed there is a lot of tailor-related stuff here.

384

They belong to my daughter.

Oh right, I remember now.

- You have a son and a daughter.
- That's right.

387
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,850
Is your daughter married yet?

Her? She is still a student.

- Where is she going to university?
- In France.

390
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,990
France? What does she study?

391
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,010
Fashion design.

392
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:37,590
Look, she is inheriting your business. That's so great.

393
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,480
Even so, she worries me.

394
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,320
What about you? I heard that you have an excellent son.

395
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,350
Of course. Like his father, when it comes to work,

396
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,300
he's a workaholic and never home.

397
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,210
However, his love life makes me so worried.

398
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,700
Why?

My husband and I think this one girl suits him.

Her family background matches ours.

401
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:00,930
They also grew up together and are childhood sweethearts.

402
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,500
They've known each other for almost 30 years.

403
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,600
That sounds good.

404
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,380
And they have always gotten along.

405
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,480
That girl is talented and beautiful.

406
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,660
If my son marries her, then it's a blessing for our family.

407
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,930
We don't know how but a temptress has appeared lately

408
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:18,290
and caused my son to be delirious.

409
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:21,460
We really don't have a say in our children's love lives these days.

If I comment on it, he'll say he has a headache and leave.

412
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:29,070
There is nothing I can do. I'm so worried.

- Who are you calling a temptress?
- Your daughter.

423
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,110
Doesn't ruining others' relationships make her a temptress?

How can the dignified wife of Chairman Tang speak...

425

- Is our mom fighting with someone?
- ...so rudely?

426
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,240
- She must be watching TV.
- I'm rude?

427
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,630
You are classy yet the daughter you raised

I understand now.

If I had known Tang Mingxuan's mom was so rude,

431

I would be against them being together.

You are against it?

433
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,900
I should be the one who's against it!

434
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,590
- What's wrong?
- I have never met...

Please do not come to bother them.

We can talk elsewhere. You can decide when and where.

Don't you want to know why I went there?

Don't you go there often?

What are your thoughts?

459
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:04,980
Haven't I told you before? We were not meant to be.

460
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,750
Then aren't all your efforts and persistence in the past for nothing?

461
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:22,570
Sometimes, the success and happiness we pursue

462
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,440
seem very far away,

463

but in fact, are just a tiny step away from us.

You will get them with just this little bit more persistence.

They are willing to try to convince Mingxuan. What do you think?

468
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,530
I used to think marrying him

469
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:59,770
would be the happiest thing in my life.

470
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,130
I tried so hard and put in so much effort

471
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:06,440
because I believed

one day, he would notice how good I was to him.

473

I would then wear a wedding gown and stand by his side.

Insisting on this matter, do I want to give my daughter happiness

480
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:53,620
or would I just be pushing her into a fire pit? I really had no idea.

481
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,560
I really had no idea.

482
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:05,210
Dad, do you think I will be happy with him?

483
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,850
I laid it all out to your Uncle Tang.

484
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:18,070
I only have one daughter.

485
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:21,560
I hope you will be happy.

486
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,750
If you two can be together, then great.

487
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:27,450
But if you can't,

488
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:33,020
I can't help the Tang family this time.

489
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,640
Go to bed.

490
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,060
Can you stop following me like a spirit?

491
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,080
I'm just worried about you. What if something bad happens?

492
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,440
What can happen? What is there for you to be worried about?

493
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,130
No, I must escort you here.

494
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:11,720
Fine, I'm here now. You can leave.

495
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,840
No, let me walk you in.

496
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:20,640
Hello, Auntie.

497
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:26,020
What is this? Both sister and brother have come.

498
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,230
Is this a show of force?

499
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,360
What are you doing?

500
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,860
All right. Don't get angry with her in a bit. Have a good chat, you hear me?

501
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,410
Whose side are you on?

502
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:42,920
Get lost!

503
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:59,830
Miss Mo, our last meeting was very unpleasant.

504
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,970
I can't guarantee this time

505
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:04,290
will be a pleasant one, either.

506
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:07,020
So I'll be straightforward.

507
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:10,410
You and Mingxuan are from two different worlds.

508
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:14,780
Even if you two are together now, you can't make it in the long run.

509
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:18,340
You know what Mingxuan has.

510
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,250
Even if he wastes several years on you,

511
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,530
he can afford it.

512
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:27,750
But you're not the same. You're a girl.

513
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,350
You need to get married in the coming several years.

514
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:33,440
If you miss the window, your value will decrease.

515
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,690
Then it will be hard for you

516
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:37,820
to find a good man for yourself.

517
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:40,060
Although what I've said is hard to hear,

518
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,540
that's the reality of things.

519
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,160
Since you're so smart,

520
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,720
you should understand my meaning.

521
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:53,180
Auntie, is this all you wanted to say?

522
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:57,090
Of course, if you can promise me one thing,

523
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:59,110
that would be great.

524
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,750
Promise that you will not pester him ever again.

525
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:05,000
Tell me your conditions.

526
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,960
I will try my best to make them happen.

527
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,500
If you insist on marrying a man from a wealthy family,

528
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,100
I can introduce you to other resources.

529
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:18,280
I know so many wealthy young men.

530
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,360
I admit that Mingxuan is outstanding.

531
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,260
I love him very much, too.

532
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:36,530
Plus, I admire him from the bottom of my heart.

533
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:40,950
I'm honored he would be with me.

534
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:43,930
But if one day he wants to leave me,

535
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:46,840
I won't make a scene, either.

536
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,090
I have a clear plan for my future.

537
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:55,320
Whether we continue together or separately,

538
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,630
I think that is our own business.

539
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,240
Besides, no one can predict the future.

540
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,080
Isn't that right?

541
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:13,140
Auntie, if you...

542
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:16,200
want me to promise you something today,

543
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:20,540
then I'm so sorry to have to disappoint you.

544
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:25,130
I'm not sure what the point of this promise is.

545
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,850
Firstly, it is not legally binding.

546
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:33,390
Secondly, I don't think it has any control over anything.

547
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:36,370
Besides, on what grounds would this promise be built on?

548
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:39,730
Why should I make a promise to you rather than you to me?

549
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:44,440
I'll admit you are my elder so I should respect you.

550
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:49,730
But... since we are both human,

551
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:51,960
aren't we equal?

552
00:34:56,070 --> 00:35:00,890
Of course, I won't make your trip here a waste.

553
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,610
I can tell you very clearly

554
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:06,540
I'm still a student now

555
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,080
so I will leave Shanghai soon.

556
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:15,120
I'm not sure if the distance will become an obstacle in our relationship.

557
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,430
However, I can be sure

558
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,990
that it will lessen the times your son sees me.

559
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:25,650
I made this decision, not because of pressure from you,

560
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:28,490
but to be responsible for my own future.

561
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:37,360
No one can force me to be with anybody.

562
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,390
So I won't separate from Mingxuan

563
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,860
because of someone's pressure.

564
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,830
Dad.

565
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:59,740
Do you know that our stock price keeps rising?

566
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,960
Fang Weiguo has made an announcement.

567
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,730
He now has 10% of our shares.

568
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:07,280
As long as our stock price continues to rise,

569
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,680
he won't be able to acquire more.

570
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,180
If Xueling marries into our family,

571
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:16,220
things you are worrying about will be solved automatically.

572
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,920
Our Mingxuan is bewitched by that girl

573
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,320
so he rejected Xueling.

574
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,770
Mom.

575
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,710
Sit down.

576
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,390
- I haven't finished yet and you're leaving.
- My apologies.

577
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,560
In regards to this matter,

578
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,250
I want to say something fair.

579
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,660
He and Xueling have known each other for so many years.

580
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:57,920
If the children really had feelings for each other, would they have waited until now?

581
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:01,160
Also, if you have the child sacrifice his happiness and relationship

582
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:05,130
for the interests of the company, then, as his parents,

583
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:08,430
aren't we too selfish? That's not appropriate.

584
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,000
Do you have a faster or better solution for this matter then?

585
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,800
- Of course not.
- Exactly.

586
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,810
Then should we just watch Fang Weiguo take over our Mingyuan?

587
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:22,190
He is young so he can easily be affected by his emotions. What about you?

588
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:25,320
Love and career, aren't you aware of which is more important?

589
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:28,990
Okay, okay. I'll go upstairs to reflect on myself.

590
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:32,260
You sit down as well. I haven't finished talking yet.

591
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:41,360
I'm not afraid of you knowing. I went to see Mo Fei.

592
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,120
What?

593
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:51,020
Why did you go to her? This is our family's issue.

594
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:54,780
That girl told me clearly that her priority

595
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,480
is to go abroad to study.

596
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,320
No matter what, she won't stay in China.

597
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,210
She is young but ambitious.

598
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,080
She is not someone to settle down with.

599
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,590
Xueling is different though.

600
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,940
Over the years, she has been

601
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,020
the same towards you and our family.

602
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,820
She has wholeheartedly devoted herself to you.

603
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:19,550
You won't choose such a good girl. Instead, you insist on choosing that Mo Fei?

604
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:22,830
You are not young anymore. Being in charge of such a big company,

605
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,540
are you aware of

606
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,340
what is more important?

607
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:29,830
I will take care of work properly. However, when it comes to my personal relationships,

608
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:32,120
can you stop taking part in them?

609
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,840
I'm your mom, not your employee.

610
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,600
Mind your attitude when you speak.

611
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:41,640
Fine. If you think that I do not fulfill

612
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,540
my work duties well, then I'll resign.

613
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:47,900
I respect your suggestions for my love life. You can make your suggstions.

614
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,770
But I have the right to make my own decisions. Okay, Mom?

615
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:53,760
Stop going to see her. Why are you seeing her?

616
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,670
It's your son who pestered her and wants to be with her.

617
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:58,720
Whether she'll choose to be with me, in the end, is another matter.

618
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,020
Stop thinking you are above everyone.

619
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,960
That makes sense.

620
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:14,750
You just wait and regret it when Mingyuan is no longer ours.

621
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,800
I will go wash some grapes for my mom.

622
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,460
You should.

623
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,820
Thanks.

624
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,060
Mingxuan?

625
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,150
Hi, Xueling.

626
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,690
Are you at the company now?

627
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:16,030
Let's meet up and talk.

628
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,170
What are your thoughts?

629
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:48,960
This is the current situation.

630
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,240
If we don't get married,

631
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,430
my dad won't help.

632
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:02,740
All right. Getting married is not a problem.

633
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:05,700
I'm just worried after we get married,

634
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,830
you will cry yourself to sleep every night.

635
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:14,100
It's fine. Marrying you is my childhood dream anyway.

636
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:17,120
To wear a wedding gown and stand by your side,

637
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,820
I'm willing to even if it's only for a day.

638
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:23,660
Do you like to be provoked?

639
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,690
I'm fine with it.

640
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,730
Let's try it out then.

641
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:27,350
Okay.

642
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:34,760
Be honest. What are your thoughts right now?

643
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,130
You know me.

644
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:45,500
No matter what, I'm the decision-maker at the company right now.

645
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:50,670
So I will come up with a solution to this crisis myself.

646
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:54,660
But I won't sacrifice my marriage.

647
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:59,530
Enough. Do I not know what kind of person you are?

648
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,650
I know very clearly

649
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:05,200
how far we can get in our relationship.

650
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,710
What can I help you with?

651
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,490
You actually can.

652
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:24,020
[If You're Well, It's a Lovely Day by Jin Zhiwen]

653
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:29,010
♫ I say you're an April day ♫

654
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:33,090
♫ The sound of your laughter lights everything up ♫

655
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:36,690
♫ Even the spirit of a light breeze ♫

656
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:42,650
♫ In the midst of the brightness and beauty of spring,
shift as one would in a dance ♫

657
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:47,990
♫ You're the mist on a dry April day ♫

658
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:52,200
♫ The gentle breeze blown during dusk ♫

659
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,900
♫ The unintentional sparkle of the planetesimal ♫

660
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:01,930
♫ The fine rain that's sprinkled in front of the flower ♫

661
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:06,700
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

662
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:11,560
♫ Like a shy water lotus that bows to a cool breeze ♫

663
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:16,320
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

664
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:21,190
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫

665
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:25,820
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

666
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:33,360
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫

667
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:45,660
♫ You're like the ivory field after snowflakes ♫

668
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:49,930
♫ You're the round moon every night ♫

669
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:52,770
♫ You're the naïve ♫

670
00:43:52,770 --> 00:44:00,060
♫ white lotus that floats on the water ripples of your dream ♫

671
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:05,190
♫ You're the flower blossoms of tree after tree ♫

672
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:09,590
♫ The swallow twittering within the beams ♫

673
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:14,030
♫ You are love, hope, and warmth ♫

674
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:17,690
♫ You're an April day ♫

675
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:22,420
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

676
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:27,410
♫ The bittersweet parting words of "take care" ♫

677
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:31,950
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

678
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:40,620
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫
