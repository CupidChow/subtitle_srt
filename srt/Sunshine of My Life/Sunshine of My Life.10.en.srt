[Episode 10]

3
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,470
Mingxuan, here are the revised designs for the new product launch. Take a look.

4
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,360
This time our design has a lot more embroidered oriental elements.

5
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,130
This is not bad.

6
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,490
Then, you should make a trip to Suzhou with me.

7
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:06,540
With regards to the implementation of the process, I want to confirm it with Master Li personally.

8
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,030
Before, you were the one to personally talk to her.

9
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,270
I haven’t dealt with her at all, so I don’t really know her way of doing things.

10
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,860
You can go by yourself. I trust you.

11
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:22,670
You care so much about Songtang. Can't you spare even a bit of time?

12
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,010
That's fine. It just so happens that I'm not busy today.

13
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,260
I'll get ready.

14
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,100
See you later then.

15
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,770
See you later.

16
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,880
Have you finished?

17
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,090
Yes.

18
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,690
Say, your batik technique is really good.

19
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:04,120
You're... even more proficient at it than those masters.

20
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,780
Is that even worth mentioning?

21
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,920
I know a lot of things. You'll find out later on.

22
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,890
How did you learn batik?

23
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,210
Back then, when I first returned to China,

24
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:22,810
I was inadvertently fascinated by a batik dress, so I swore

25
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,530
I would learn this technique.

26
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,050
Then I went to the mountains of Guizhou and stayed for one whole year.

27
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,000
I learned batik from a lady of the Miao tribe.

28
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,440
I picked indigo grass daily to dye fabric blue.

29
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,450
It's all thanks to my hardship back then.

30
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,340
Otherwise, would I be so practiced in this technique?

31
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,780
You actually stayed on the mountain for a whole year?

32
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,800
I didn't expect that.

33
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,460
There are still many things that you wouldn't expect.

34
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,890
Is this the way to Suzhou?

35
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:15,500
Well, Brother Xuan wanted to go somewhere else first.

36
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,400
- Slowly, slowly, slowly. Wait a minute.
- Okay.

37
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,580
Do you know how batik was invented?

38
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,670
How was it invented?

39
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:47,960
Legend has it that a beautiful Miao lady lost her way when she went up the mountain to pick Persian shield plants.

40
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,270
Then she walked and walked and walked and walked right into a paradise.

41
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,180
She saw a beehive on a tree

42
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,220
and wanted to get the honey from it to eat.

43
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,430
Unexpectedly, the beeswax dripped onto her.

44
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,260
After she went back to the village, she washed her clothes in a bucket.

45
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,990
After she took them out, she discovered that at the spots on her clothes where the beeswax had fallen,

46
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,800
white patterns appeared.

47
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,790
After that, the ladies would use melted beeswax to draw on white fabric,

48
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,950
and then dye them.

49
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,600
That is how batik spread among the Miao tribe.

50
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,770
Did everyone find the paradise?

51
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,120
Paradise was not found, but the lady was found.

52
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,560
Really? Where?

53
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,480
She's "seemingly far away, but is actually right in front of my eyes."

54
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,970
Are you joking around again?

55
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,680
You're really silly.

56
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,170
Shouldn't we take these clothes out already?

57
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,330
Right, right. Hurry, hurry, basin, basin.

58
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,360
I just complimented you.

59
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,240
We're here.

60
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,530
Wait for me.

61

[Tang Mingxuan]

62
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,200
Where are we?

63
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,530
What is President Tang doing here?

64
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,560
This is the house of Mo Fei, Master Li's disciple.

65
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,190
Does President Tang come to see her often?

66
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:58,870
I don't know much about that.

67
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,820
Why did he come here then?

68
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,960
Does he want to take her to Suzhou with us?

69
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,330
Well... I don't really know either.

70
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,100
You're by President Tang's side every day. Why don't you know anything?

71
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:17,460
Director Xia, you know President Tang's temper well.

72
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,750
We are now on our way to confirm some matters with regards to the craftsmanship of the new product launch.

73
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,920
What does it have to do with her?

74
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:30,360
With regards to that... I think President Tang must have his plans.

75
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,350
Look. Mo Fei is Master Li's disciple, right?

76
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:37,270
Yes, that must be it.

77
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:52,090
[Tang Mingxuan: Where are you? Why aren't you answering your phone?]

78
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:56,600
[Tang Mingxuan: I'm going to Suzhou to meet Master Li right now. Do you want to go with me?]

79
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,900
Actually, using cotton fabric to make batik isn't that great.

80
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,340
Then, what kind of fabric is the best?

81
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,950
Indonesia has a type of cloth

82
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,950
that is made from real silk and the best quality cotton manufactured in France.

83
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:19,200
The fabric is as soft as the skin. It is also very textured.

84
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,190
Are you interested?

85
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,650
Of course.

86
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:25,060
That's the right attitude! That's how designers should be.

87
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,100
How about you come to Cayman?

88
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,170
You can get whatever you want at Cayman.

89
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,930
I can give you the best treatment there.

90
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,090
Thank you, but I'm not interested.

91
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:42,260
[I'm sorry. The person you are calling cannot answer the phone right now. Please try again later.]

92
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,360
Why isn't he back yet?

93
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,030
Maybe he's talking to Mo Fei about something.

94
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,880
Has President Tang ever been here alone and you were unaware of it?

95
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,820
Of course not!

96
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,120
Hey, President Tang is coming back.

97
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,280
Let's go to the embroidery workshop.

98
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,080
Okay, Boss.

99
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,140
- Okay!
- Wow...

100
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,700
- Looks nice, right?
- Yes.

101
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,590
The highlight of this dress is

102
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:06,010
the batik design.

103
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,150
So we have to preserve

104
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,020
the mysteriousness of batik as well as

105
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,870
the abstract feeling of modernism.

106
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,080
I have an idea.

107
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:20,210
We can actually be much bolder in tailoring this outfit.

108
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,630
What do you mean?

109
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,820
If you use Western tailoring methods on Eastern fabric

110
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,680
and patterns,

111
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,490
then the Eastern and Western elements would clash.

112
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,210
Wouldn't the result be even more surprising?

113
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:38,760
Actually, I thought about combining batik with Western style tailoring before,

114
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,570
but I was a little worried that they wouldn't perfectly mesh together.

115
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,910
So I gave up.

116
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,690
How about this?

117
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,640
Those changes indeed made it more Western.

118
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,620
But for the collar, can we use the Western stand-up collar?

119
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,030
This would be much more natural.

120
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,860
Is it like this?

121
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,580
You are indeed Cayman's chief designer.

122
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,990
You live up to your reputation.

123
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,320
What look is this?

124
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,170
I'm wrong to praise you and wrong to not praise you.

125
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,200
You are too hard to please.

126
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,440
No, I'm just feeling a lot of emotions right now.

127
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,870
It is not all because of you.

128
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,310
What's wrong?

129
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:54,840
I'll say it like this. I haven't created a design that I have been

130
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,610
satisfied with in a long time.

131
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:02,810
I can't believe a designer like you would encounter a bottleneck.

132
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,730
But just now, I suddenly realized that I

133
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,390
seem to have found a breakthrough.

134
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,280
You are probably hungry.

135
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,390
Since you have helped me so much, I'll treat you to dinner.

136
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,710
Just don't order takeout.

137
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,700
I'll help you open it.

138
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,200
- I can do it myself.
- I'll help you.

139
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,950
Thank you.

140
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,320
You said you were going to treat me to dinner,

141
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,590
yet I ended up ordering takeout.

142
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,020
Is this how you thank me?

143
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,400
My phone ran out of battery. When I came out, it was still at 80%.

144
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,290
The battery must be broken.

145
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,760
Thank you. But this is pretty tasty, right?

146
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,570
Tasty. Especially tasty.

147
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,030
Say, you're being so sarcastic.

148
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:57,290
I'm serious. It is really delicious. I've been busy all day so I didn't eat anything.

149
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,340
Anything I eat is delicious.

150
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:02,470
With that explanation, you might as well not explain. You make it seem as though I abused you.

151
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,600
But you really surprised me today.

152
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,290
Was I especially handsome when I was dyeing the fabric?

153
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,530
No.

154
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:17,450
I just didn't think you would know so much about traditional Chinese craftsmanship.

155
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,570
If a good designer does not understand the craftsmanship,

156
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:27,090
then it will be like an artist who does not know his colors.

157
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,630
Batik, silk, brocade,

158
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,530
different fabrics have different cultural backgrounds.

159
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:35,780
The different clothing style that each of them displays, is also different.

160
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,360
One must be thoroughly familiar with these things.

161
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,560
Then it will be easier to use each of these things later on.

162

You are indeed Cayman's Design Director.

00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,970
Are you seeing my talent only now?

164
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,770
Do you have a little bit of admiration for me or–

165
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:53,070
Are you full? Do you want to order anything else?

166
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:56,180
I am afraid you aren't full.

167
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,260
There is something I want to eat on your plate, give me some.

168
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,320
No.

169
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,810
How about we exchange?

170
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,890
I don't like your dish.

171
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,920
Does Tang Mingxuan have anything that you like to eat?
(T/N : asking if Tang Mingxuan is the type of man she likes)

172
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,950
What reaction is that of yours?

173
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:18,890
N-No, it's just that there is too much pepper.

174
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,490
Has he confessed to you yet?

175
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,550
Why are you so nosy?

176
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,380
Mo Fei, I'm just worried about you.

177
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,520
He may look very dignified and serious,

178
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,360
but he's actually very evil.

179
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,250
If he wants to play with your feelings, you will not be able to resist.

180
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,130
What do you mean "play with my feelings"?

181
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:54,720
Over time, you'll see him for who he is and know what I mean.

182
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:01,330
Say, do you two have grudges towards one another?

Ask him.

184
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:06,460
I am not someone who likes to talk behind people's backs.

Boring.

186

Mingxuan, you're tired. Right?

187
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,250
- Do you want to rest for a bit?
- Sure.

188
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,140

Did Fang Xiaoyu get a new girlfriend again?

193
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,400
He's a bit strange, he did not blacklist you.

194
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,390
Shouldn't he treat everyone besides me as an enemy?

195
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,690
You two have too deep a misunderstanding.

196
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:41,420
You two were friends who grew up together, so why do you guys have to make things so awkward between you?

I actually don't want this.

He's probably the only one who does.

In the end, Fang Xiaoyu is like this because of his younger sister.

Let me see what he posted.

They look good together, right?

Dyeing fabric together and designing together.

204
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,330
This isn't his girlfriend.

205
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,210
But they look really close.

206
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,950
Is there anyone who doesn't seem close to him?

207
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,020
Especially since he likes to flirt so much.

208
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,810
But this is the first time Fang Xiaoyu posted someone

209
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:21,430
so openly, right?

210
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,570
Why don't you go back and get some rest early? You're probably tired, too.

211

Then you also get some rest.

President Tang, I can't hear you.

Hello?

Why didn't you answer?

220
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:01,690
My phone ran out of battery, I just got home and am charging it.

221
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,280
Your phone ran out of battery?

222
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,800
Your phone ran out of battery, don't you know how to rent a portable charger?

223
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,450
Or borrow a charger from someone?!

224

Why can't you even do something so trivial?

225
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,270
Also, let me tell you, don't forget

226
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,420
that Master Li sent you to be in charge

227
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,060
of the collaboration with Mingyuan. You're the person in charge, do you understand?

228
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,650
That means that you must make sure

229
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,130
that your phone is accessible 24 hours a day.

Yes, you are right! I am the contact person between Mingyuan

234
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,870
and the embroidery workshop, but I have my own life. Right?

235
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:46,530
Even if you are Mingyuan's boss, you can't be working 24 hours a day. Right?

236
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:50,540
Let me ask you. What would you do if a sudden problem were to arise?

237
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,010
You should make sure your phone is charged.

What I did today is not related to the embroidery workshop or Mingyuan,

why should I tell you?

00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:34,700
or else I will be upset.

321
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,730
It's so heavy.

322
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,480
- Brother Xuan, are we going directly to the company?
- Yes.

323
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:49,040
Brother Xuan, I just thought of something.

324
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:54,030
When we went to Suzhou last time, we weren't able to take Mo Fei with us. Right?

325
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,550
So, when we got back,

326
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:01,640
I went to the Purchasing Department to look at the embroidery workshop's inventory.

327
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,810
Among the clients that the embroidery workshop normally deals with,

328
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:07,910
there's a Boss Feng who has a batik store here in Shanghai.

329
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,890
So I added him on WeChat. I asked him

330
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:13,890
if Mo Fei went to his batik store.

331
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:16,580
He told me that Mo Fei had been there.

332
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:20,660
Stop the car now and send him a WeChat message asking for the address.

333
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,530
I've already gotten the address for you.

334
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:26,530
Why did you beat around the bush then?

335
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:30,260
- Let's go there now.
- Okay.

336
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:37,310
Yang Guang, you can finally get a salary raise.

337
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,940
"Notice. Inform you."

338
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,920
"This is..."

339
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,750
This is...

340
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:14,050
You've been admitted.

341
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,130
You scared me to death!

342
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,860
Why are you here?

343
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,950
What did you say?

344
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:28,740
This email says that the School of Union Chamber of Parisian Couture has

345
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,410
admitted you.

346
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,860
This is great!

347
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,170
Do you know how many times I've tried? I'm finally admitted this time!

348
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:44,170
I am very happy, very happy!

349
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:52,550
Congratulations.

350
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,880
H-How did you find out that I was here?

351
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,260
- I–
- Yes.

352
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,370
I also want to know.

353
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,240
Who are you?

354
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,990
Why are you hugging my daughter?

355
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,030
Mo Fei.

356
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:19,170
Mom, didn't I tell you not to come here? Why did you come here again?

357
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:21,950
I'll be home soon.

358
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,080
Mo Fei.

359
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:44,010
You haven't introduced me to your friend yet.

360
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,350
There's no need to introduce you.

361
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,920
How can I just leave?

362
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,820
I don't know what this gentleman's name is yet.

363
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:55,330
He's a... He's...

364
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,830
Let me introduce myself. Hello, Auntie.

365
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:02,320
My name is Tang Mingxuan. We're friends.

366
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,470
Mo Fei.

367
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:12,010
I have something to tell you. Can you come out for a bit?

368
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:22,380
I'll just go out for a bit.

369
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,900
Why did you bring me here?

370
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,400
Have you been here before?

371
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,000
Of course.

372
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,400
When I was young, I often came here. When my mom was modeling for Mingyuan

373
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,000
and she didn't have time for me, I would play here alone.

374
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,200
When I was young, I often came here, too.

375
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,600
Really? Why were you here?

376
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,600
Were you a child model?

377
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,400
Is that funny?

378
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:20,450
- I want to ask you something.
- Okay.

379
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,600
Why do you like little foxes so much?

380
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,800
Have you heard of the story of "The Little Prince"?

381
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,600
This story is my enlightenment to love.

382
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,400
Do you believe it?

383
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,220
I originally didn't believe in it.

384
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:47,030
Now, I somewhat believe.

385
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,200
Did you ask me to come here to tell me that?

386
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,200
When I was young, I often came here. Isn't that the same for you?

387
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,000
Say...

388
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,200
Have we met before?

389
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,900
Have we met before?

390
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,400
I don't remember. I was just five years old then.

391
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,000
I only remember I once tried to catch a ladybug

392
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,200
and my mom wouldn't let me, so I got hit.

393
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,000
I don't remember anything else.

394
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,900
Have we met before?

395
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,200
Are you trying to interrupt me?

396
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,200
I don't want to hear you talk about some ladybug.

397
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,800
I really don't remember.

398
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,720
Have we met before?

399
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,200
Let's talk about it after you remember.

400
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,400
So strange. Crazy.

401
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,000
Let's go!

402
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
♫ Heavens, the person you spoke about is me ♫

403
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
♫ Light a starlight so you'd stay ♫

404
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:13,400
♫ My heart, just this one is for you ♫

405
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:20,000
♫ Protect me, hold me in the palm of your hand ♫

406
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,400
♫ Your smile ♫

407
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,700
♫ is branded on my heart ♫

408
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:36,600
♫ Make a wish that you'll love me a long time ♫

409
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,200
♫ I'll treasure all the light in your eyes ♫

410
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,400
Say, have we met before?

411
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,200
Have we met before?

412
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,400
Are you trying to interrupt me?

413
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,800
What exactly did he mean?

414
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,200
He spoke for so long yet he still didn't make it clear.

415
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,800
He even said we met when we were younger.

416
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,500
But why don't I have any impression of it at all?

417
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:12,400
- That's right. Who have you met when you were younger?
- Mom.

418
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:17,300
Speak. Where did that guy take you?

419
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:20,470
He didn't take me anywhere.

420
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,000
I'm suddenly very tired.

421
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,800
Mo Fei, here you go again. You have to tell me clearly today.

422
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:32,200
This boy is so bold. He dares to take you away in front of me.

423
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,800
He just talked to me about work, about the embroidery workshop.

424
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,200
Stop with the nonsense. You must give me an honest explanation.

425
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,800
Who is he?

426
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,200
Mom, let me tell you.

427
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,900
I got great news today. I received a notice from France.

428
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,400
I got admitted to that school! I can study abroad now!

429
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,000
Sister, you got admitted?

430
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,200
Congratulations! I told you that you could do it! You're amazing!

431
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,600
- Yay!
- Nice!
- Enough, you two.

432
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,800
Let me tell you. Since I got admitted, the airplane ticket is very important. I'm going to go look at tickets.

433
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,100
That's right. The earlier you buy, the cheaper it is. Sister, hurry and buy one.

434
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,900
Mo Fan!

435

Hi, everyone.

462
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,900
It's so late. To those friends who haven't slept yet, what are you doing?

463
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:57,000
Now, everyone's workload and stress levels are especially high.

464
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
We often have insomnia or a hard time falling asleep. So I'm planning

465
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,200
from today on

466
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,200
to read everyone a bedtime story every night.

467
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,200
Hopefully, it can help those friends who can't fall asleep

468
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,400
to peacefully enter into the dream world.

469
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,200
Then today, I'll tell a fairytale to you all.

470
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,200
It's called

471
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,400
"The Little Prince."

472
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,400
- Brother Xuan.
- Yes.

473
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,000
What's wrong?

474
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,200
Looks like you slept well yesterday.

00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,000
Indeed.

Oh right! Is President Wu here yet?

477
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
They're in the meeting room. Director Xia is there as well.

478
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,800
Let's go.

479
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,600
These are the eight designs that we decided to

480
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,300
launch online at our internal meeting. Take a look.

481
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:18,850
[Mu Qiu - First Place]
[Shen Jiaxi, Third Place]
[Mo Fei, Eighth Place]

482
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,000
Excuse me, President Wu. Is this a mistake?

483
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
This contestant did not complete the competition.

484
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,200
Are you talking about Mo Fei?

485
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,600
Unexpectedly, she was very popular in this competition.

486
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,800
She also has a lot of online fans who support her.

487
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,400
They specifically asked for her designs to be listed.

488
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,000
So we've decided to include her as well.

489
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,870
But our rules were very clear in the beginning.

490
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:46,000
Only contestants who were awarded could have the opportunity

491
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
to participate in the Fashion Daily launch.

492
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,700
Didn't she place in the competition?

493
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:53,800
President Wu, this doesn't go against the rules. Right?

494
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,000
That's right. She got eighth place. It shouldn't be against the rules.

495
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,200
If we give her a backdoor this way, how can we talk about principles in the future?

496
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,600
Director Xia, don't say it like that.

497
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,280
Mo Fei's designs

498
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,100
were unanimously approved of in our meeting.

499
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,400
I can't influence the company's decision because of personal relationships.

500
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,300
Isn't that right?

501
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:24,000
Director Xia, do you not trust my judgment?

502
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,200
Of course not.

503
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,000
- I think she's quite good.
- Let's continue looking through these.

504
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,800
- Yes, let's keep looking.
- Look at this design.

505
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,100
Brother Xuan, I asked about the summit in Nanjing.

506
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,200
All of the industry leaders will be there.

507
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,200
I'm afraid you'll have to personally attend.

508
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,000
Didn't I tell you already to have Director Xia attend?

509
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,800
I heard that Nanjing's cloud brocade is especially nice.

510
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,400
If I had to guess, Mo Fei would like it a lot.

511
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,000
I'm sure of it.

512
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,200
- Really?
- Yes.

513
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,300
Let me get ready.

514
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,300
Has Brother Xuan fallen that hard for her?

515
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,100
I can't believe mentioning Mo Fei would be so useful.

516
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,800
What's going on?

517
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:45,000
I heard that Bai Xiaoman is with Zhu Haitian from Haiyao Group.

518
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,600
Does he plan to just get whatever he can?

519
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,000
Let's go.

520
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,700
All right. Now that we've added each other's WeChat, I'll contact you later.

521
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,400
- Have a drink, Director Fang.
- Do you think the wine here is drinkable?
- Thank you.

522
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,100
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

523
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,200
What's going on?

524
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,400
Director Fang, long time no see.

525
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,400
What do they say again?

526
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,200
"Haven't seen in three days, another whole level of astonishment."
(T/N: Every dog has its day)

527
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,000
As Director Fang said, I've indeed been really well recently.

528
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,400
At least better than when I was at Cayman.

529
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,600
Congratulations to you on becoming a phoenix.
(T/N: Having a backer to change her life.)

530
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,700
Director Fang, there's one more thing.

531
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:41,600
It was already proven that I didn't ruin Mo Fei's design

532
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,400
last time.

533
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,200
Don't you think you should apologize to me?

534
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,700
I didn't say you ruined it.

535
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,200
I just told you to find evidence.

536
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,200
But Mo Fei already apologized to me.

537
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,400
Last time, you all were really bullies.

538
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,400
Why do I remember it being you who was aggressive?

539
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,600
You even hit someone.

540
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,700
Director Fang, I cleaned it.

541
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,800
