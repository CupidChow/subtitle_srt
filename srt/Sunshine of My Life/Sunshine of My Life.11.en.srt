[Episode 11]

3
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,660
Thank you.

4
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,690
- President Chen.
- Hey.

5
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:44,820
Long time no see.

6
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,010
Teacher Pan.

7
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,370
Hello. Hello.

8
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:51,270
Was Mrs. Chen satisfied with her customized gown last time?

9
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,850
My wife and I were extremely satisfied with it. When Teacher Xiong Ying personally works on a design,

10
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:58,260
the outcome is really extraordinary.

11
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,170
I would appreciate your feedback from now on.

12
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,900
You are too kind. My daughter's future wedding gown will require your hard work.

13
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,470
Not a problem.

14
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,720
Come on, cheers.

15
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,710
[Tang Mingxuan: What are you doing today?]

16
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,690
[Mo Fei: I am with Teacher Pan right now to see the world (gain some worldly experience).]

17
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:27,010
[Tang Mingxuan: I've gone to Nanjing. When I return to Shanghai, I'll go and see you.]

18
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,700
Just playing some golf.

19
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,410
[Mo Fei: Is it another embroidery workshop matter?]

20
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:38,820
[Tang Mingxuan: No, I have something to give you.]

21
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,670
[Mo Fei: What is it?]

22
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,240
I forgot to introduce you. Mo Fei.

23
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:54,190
President Zhu, you just took over Haiyao Group and already you are so familiar with the fashion industry in China.

24
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,560
You are really amazing.

25
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,970
Director Xia, you flatter me.

26
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:04,420
By the way, I have encountered a matter today that I must explain to you.

27
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,400
The matter regarding Master Li's embroidery workshop really has nothing to do with me.

28
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,960
I hope you don't misunderstand me.

29
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,210
I am well aware.

30
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,480
I am now in charge of dealing with the embroidery workshop.

31
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,560
Really?

32
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,780
That's great.

33
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,530
If there are any problems, let me know. I'll certainly help you.

34
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,400
Then thank you, President Zhu.

35
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,700
Director Xia has always been so polite.

36
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,450
I have always known that Director Xia is someone who looks at the big picture.

37
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:35,560
Today, I also want to chat with you freely.

38
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,950
Although Haiyao is the best at marketing management

39
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,150
in the domestic industry; truthfully,

40
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,000
I also have shortcomings.

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,300
Our design team is too weak.

42
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,930
In truth, we are lacking people with talent.

43
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,160
So I want to take the opportunity today to ask if

44
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,690
Director Xia can give me some advice and referrals.

45
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,900
President Zhu, the design team you talk about,

46
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,900
it so happens to be the most important part of our Mingyuan Group.

47
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,270
We have extensive collaborations

48
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,970
with the top dozen fashion colleges in the country.

49
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,910
Every year, they will refer the most talented students to us first.

50
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,020
Amazing, amazing.

51
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:21,010
Of course, we will also give these schools financial rewards.

52
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,700
Amazing.

53
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,180
Oh, look at that girl.

54
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,930
Her name is Mo Fei.

55
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,980
She just competed in Mingyuan Fashion's Chinese Style Fashion.

56
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,360
Although her rank is a bit low,

57
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,080
her online popularity is quite high.

58
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,390
The fashion industry looks fondly upon her.

59
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,000
Also, President Wu of Fashion Daily

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,760
especially broke the rules just for her by putting her competition work online for pre-sales.

61
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,310
She looks so quiet and gentle. I can't believe she is such an amazing designer.

62
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:59,700
I seem to be a bit interested in her now.

63
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,320
Then, I shall introduce you.

64
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,450
All right.

65
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,780
I still have some matters to attend to so please excuse me.

66
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,840
- Okay.
- Okay.

67
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,410
Teacher Pan. Mo Fei.

68
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,700
Let me introduce you. This is the President of Haiyao Group, Mr. Zhu Haitian.

69
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,440
Hello. Nice to meet you.

70
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,750
Mo Fei, you probably met President Zhu before.

71
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:36,910
I have met him once before, but we aren't people on the same path so there's no need to become familiar with each other.

72
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,060
I had a small misunderstanding with Miss Mo Fei,

73
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,580
but now that we know each other, we're friends.

74
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,830
I formally apologize to you and drink this as punishment.

75
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,270
Since you think it is a misunderstanding, why are you punishing yourself with a glass?

76
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,400
Miss Mo is indeed an artist.

77
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,850
You have a good temper and speak what's on your mind. You don't leave the other person with any face.

78
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,360
I don't dare.

79
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,030
Mo Fei, I understand that you guys had a small misunderstanding.

80
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,250
Since we're all here today,

81
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,620
there is a saying, "Enemies should resolve their issues instead of continuing the animosity."

82
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,800
Just forget what happened in the past.

83
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,950
Besides, President Zhu looks very fondly upon you.

84
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:24,520
He hopes that you sign with Haiyao to become their designer.

85
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,040
Thank you, Director Xia, but I am just a small designer.

86
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,320
I don't dare aspire as high as Haiyao.

87
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:38,000
Miss Mo, I sincerely want to invite you to join Haiyao.

88
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,450
Let's do this. In regards to the conditions of the contract,

89
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,440
you can ask for anything.

90
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,870
Then I will tell you sincerely, I will not join Haiyao.

91
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:53,220
Sorry, President Zhu, actually Mo Fei is about to head to France to further her studies in fashion design.

92
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,000
Of course, when she comes back,

93
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,860
you two may still have the opportunity to work together.

94
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,890
Really? That's amazing.

95
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,020
Congratulations, Miss Mo.

96
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:06,320
Then after you finish your studies and return, Haiyao's doors will still be open for you.

97
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,130
I still won't go.

98
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:12,410
By the way, Mo Fei, Xiaoyu should be here now, let's go see.

99
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,960
All right.

100
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,380
Excuse us.

101
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,980
Excuse me as well, President Zhu.

102
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,260
Xiaoyu!

103
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,210
Teacher Pan.

104
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:35,390
Mo Fei, you were not a good friend last time.

105
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,480
We just finished making the outfit and packed our stuff, then you just left.

106
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,870
When I went back, you didn't leave anything behind for me.

107
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,080
What?

108
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,090
When did you two work together?

109
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:50,090
No, it is just that Director Fang taught me some batik techniques.

110
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,410
Don't glare at me. We met at Old Feng's shop last time.

111
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:58,960
You should know that I won't steal a friend's students.

112
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,780
Mo Fei, be careful.

113
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,090
There is a thin line between genius and madman.

114
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:07,960
Look at this world. It's getting harder to be a good person.

115
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,990
Where's Tang Mingxuan?

116
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,910
He went to Nanjing for business.

117
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,060
Why are you so weird today? Why do you care about Mingxuan suddenly?

118
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,560
You two are like conjoined twins, always together. Did you guys argue?

119
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,430
No, he'll be back a bit later.

120
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,890
Didn't some classmates get married a while back? I already have the red envelopes ready when it is your turn.

121
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,000
You should worry about yourself.

122
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,290
Don't always make fun of me and Mingxuan.

123
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:36,550
Me? Don't worry about me.

124
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,930
I don't care about him, but if you get married, I will go for sure.

125
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,900
Then I should thank you.

126
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,670
Since you give me so much face, then can I ask you

127
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,550
to not argue with Mingxuan the next time you see him?

128
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:51,660
You haven't even gotten married yet. You're already acting as his housekeeper wife?

129
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,830
Excuse me, I'm going to the bathroom.

130
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,720
President Jiang has arrived. You two continue. I'll go see him.

131
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,930
The scenery isn't bad. Take a look.

132
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,890
Are you all right?

133
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,110
How meddlesome.

134
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,930
I'm worried about you.

135
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,480
Worry about yourself.

136
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,120
Miss Mo! Miss Mo!

137
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,190
Wait, wait, wait.

138
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,600
Are you in that much of a hurry to leave?

139
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,230
How about I take you home?

140
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,030
Thank you, but I can go home by myself.

141
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,110
It's convenient. Also, it'll be safer in my car.

142
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:49,360
On the way, we can talk about working together.

143
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,020
I'm not interested in working with Haiyao at all. Please don't waste your time on me.

144
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,570
Miss Mo, you can't just keep people at a distance the moment you meet them.

145
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,160
Between two people, there must a process of coming to know each other.

146
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,050
How about this? Give me a chance.

147
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,330
Can you look at my sincerity?

148
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,980
- But I don't want to get to know you.
- Zhu Haitian!

149
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,340
Xiaoman?

150
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,280
- What are you doing?
- I'm talking about work with Miss Mo.

151
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,870
Mo Fei, what are you doing? He's my boyfriend.

152
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,450
Then please watch your boyfriend.

153
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,660
What are you saying, Xiaoman?

154
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,630
I'm not done talking, why are you in a hurry to leave?

155
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,050
Then go ahead. I'm listening.

156
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,630
Why are you everywhere? I just can't get rid of you, can I?

157
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:27,050
Xiaoman, stop messing around. Why are you talking about other things when we are talking about work?

158
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,060
Mo Fei, I'll give you a ride.

159
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,420
Miss Mo, see you later. Sorry!

160
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,240
What do you mean you'll see her later?

161
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,780
You're really something. Before, you said you would help me get revenge,

162
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,610
but now you're here talking about signing with her.

163
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,990
What are you thinking?

164
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,520
What do you know?

165
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,580
We're talking about signing a contract.

166
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,160
Why are you mad?

167
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,210
Think about it. If I get her to sign with Haiyao, won't she be Haiyao's employee?

168
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,990
At that time, you can bully her however you want to.

169
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:57,990
Is that really what you're thinking?

170
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,580
Of course.

171
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,600
How come it doesn't seem so to me?

172
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,010
The way you looked at her just now is clearly problematic!

173
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,360
Are you crazy? Why are you being crazy?

174
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,290
I'm being crazy? I think it is you who is guilty, Zhu Haitian.

175
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,740
Don't make a scene here in front of the hotel.

176
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,990
Director Xia, thank you.

177
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,040
It's nothing much.

178
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,890
You are a newbie designer,

179
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:29,040
so you're not considered a professional yet.

180
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,450
I'll give you some advice.

181
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,760
For the sake of your career,

182
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,350
I think you shouldn't offend too many business owners in this industry.

183
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,110
But I just can't stand him.

184
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,370
Do you know this?

185
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:49,360
Your work has been selected by Fashion Daily.

186
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,130
- Really?
- Yes.

187
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,580
But I thought I wasn't eligible

188
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,490
to be in Fashion Daily's selection?

189
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,200
Fashion Daily's President Wu

190
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,580
indeed mentioned this problem.

191
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,440
But Mingxuan insisted on using your work in Fashion Daily.

192
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,320
Because of this matter, President Wu is a bit upset.

193
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,840
But it's fine. I think you are very talented.

194
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,300
However, sometimes

195
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,440
it isn't enough to just have talent.

196
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,110
You still need luck.

197
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,960
I'm not a designer who depends on luck.

198
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,710
What's wrong with luck? A lot of people pray for it but don't have it.

199
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,780
Director Xia, where are we going?

200
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,900
Oh, right, I almost forgot.

201
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,730
Mingxuan asked me to help him take something to his home.

202
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,930
It's the next turn up ahead.

203
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,760
Then-Then you can just pull over. I can take a taxi home.

204
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,820
No way. I have to safely take you home so that I won't worry.

205
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,890
We'll be there soon.

206
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,820
We've arrived. Come inside with me.

207
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,450
It's fine. I'll just wait here.

208
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:40,480
That's fine, too. I won't be long.

209
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,290
- Xueling.
- Auntie Lu.

210
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,770
So good to see you. I've missed you.

211
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:53,190
Mingxuan asked me to bring something to you.

212
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,650
That child does have me in mind. He's so far yet still gives me a gift.

213
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,280
It's just that you're troubled with delivering it.

214
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,860
It's no big deal. Let me get it for you.

215
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,810
That is...

216
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,080
She is Mo Fei, a new designer at Mingyuan.

217
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,310
She just participated in Chinese Style Fashion.

218
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,050
Both Mingxuan and I regard her highly.

219
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:20,160
Mo Fei, this is Mingxuan's mother, Auntie Lu.

220
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,910
- Hello, Auntie.
- Such a pretty girl and so talented!

221
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,290
Let's go in and have some fruit.

222
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,440
It's fine. I'll just wait here.

223
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,380
No need. Since you are Mingxuan and Xueling's friend, you are my guest. Let's go.

224
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,630
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

225
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,830
It won't take up much time.

226
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,010
I went shopping today and saw that the fruits were especially fresh

227
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:43,120
so I bought some for your mother. They are all her favorites.

228
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,320
Thank you, Auntie.

229
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,080
I also have a gift to give you.

230
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,720
You two eat fruit first.

231
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:59,270
Mo Fei, don't be shy. Eat some fruit.

232
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,600
Today, at the silk store that I shop at often, I saw new merchandise.

233
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,800
So I bought pajamas for you and Mingxuan.

234
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,730
Do you like it?

235
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,430
Do you like the color?

236
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,800
This is my favorite color.

237
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,210
This one is for Mingxuan.

238
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,840
This suits him very well. He always likes this kind of solid color.

239
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,350
You understand him the most. If you say it's good, then it's good.

240
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,930
I just hope that when you get home after working all day,

241
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,890
you can relax and wear comfortable clothes.

242
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:36,130
At that time, I'll put it in your room.

243
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,420
No need to trouble you, Auntie.

244
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,090
Don't be so courteous. My guest room is always reserved for you.

245
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,160
If you work too late, then don't go back home.

246
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,600
Sooner or later we'll be family, so don't be restrained by such unnecessary etiquette.

247
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,760
Thank you, Auntie.

248
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,880
Eat some fruit.

249
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,130
Auntie, it's getting late now. I have to take Mo Fei back.

250
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:01,690
Why are you in such a hurry? You've only sat for two minutes. You haven't even eaten yet.

251
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:04,390
- I'll come and visit in a day or two again.
- Do you promise?
- Yes.

252
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,530
I won't keep you two then.

253
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,020
- Drive safely. Say hi to your mom for me.
- Okay.

254
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,890
Nanny Wu,

255
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,350
- take these fruits to the car.
- Okay.

256
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,720
- I'm leaving then, Auntie,
- Come see me often.
- I'll visit you another time.

257
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,050
Mo Fei, right? Next time,

258
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,050
come and visit, too.

259
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:34,900
What is it, Mo Fei? Why are you so quiet? Are you tired?

260
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:39,160
Sorry for staying so long at Mingxuan's home and delaying you.

261
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,840
It's fine.

262
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:48,080
By the way, I heard Teacher Pan say that you are going to France to study.

263
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,750
I'm leaving in a few days.

264
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,720
That's good. Going out to see the world

265
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,520
will definitely benefit you a lot.

266
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,600
You worked hard on the collaboration with Master Li's embroidery workshop.

267
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,200
I even talked to Mingxuan about preparing a small gift for you soon.

268
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,430
Director Xia, you are too courteous.

269
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:22,590
I only did a few things on behalf of my master.

270
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:27,530
We should. Mingxuan has had a bad temper ever since he was a child.

271
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:32,260
I even worried that you might suffer when you worked with him.

272
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,240
Director Xia, my home is up ahead. You can just stop here. Thanks.

273
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,080
We've arrived.

274
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,000
You are being more and more immature nowadays. Really.

275
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,370
- You're basically causing a mess!
- I'm causing a mess?

276
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,570
Zhu Haitian, if you're truly considerate of me,

277
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,650
you should have humiliated Mo Fei in front of everyone.

278
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:42,550
Also, there are so many designers. Why must you sign with her?

279
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,580
Her little talent is just crap!

280
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,950
Do you like her?

281
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,480
I like her?

282
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,040
Is your brain going bad because you've been wearing high heels walking the runway every day?

283
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,330
I'm also telling you... Mo Fei is talented, not crap at all.

284
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,820
Do you know how popular Chinoiserie is now?

285
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:04,100
Before long, Chinoiserie will dominate the entire market.

286
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:08,160
Do you know how difficult it is to find a designer who truly understands Chinoiserie?

287
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,210
Even Director Xia regards Mo Fei highly!

288
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,600
Why wouldn't I sign her?

289
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,000
Otherwise, why would a big boss like me care about a newbie?

290
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,830
Zhu Haitian, let me tell you.

291
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,280
You don't need to tell me anything, let me tell you!

292
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,220
Mo Fei is Master Li's disciple.

293
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,850
This Master Li will not respond to me at all.

294
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:29,320
If my Haiyao Group wants to develop Chinoiserie designs,

295
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,570
- I must sign with Mo Fei.
- But I have a grudge against her!

296
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,210
She was the one who got me expelled from school.

297
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,760
She was also the one who got me fired from Cayman.

298
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,890
When you tell me that you want to sign someone like her,

299
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:46,100
do you have me in your heart at all?

300
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,200
Xiaoman, can you be a little mature?

301
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,850
Can you set aside personal grievances temporarily?

302
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,100
The company's growth is the most important. It's business.

303
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,850
- Don't you understand?
- I don't care!

304
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,430
You simply don't care about my feelings!

305
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,600
Do you care about me then?

306
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,610
Do you think about the company's growth?

307
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:06,360
If the company has no growth, can you still buy bags?

308
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,120
Can you buy clothes or travel? You'll be drinking northeastern winds, that's what! (Suffer from the cold and hunger)

309
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,570
I'm tired from working all day. I don't want to argue with you anymore.

310
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:21,010
In short, I'm definitely signing Mo Fei.

311
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,840
You better come to terms with this matter.

312
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,030
If you can't...

313
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,790
then do as you wish.

314
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:28,780
Man Man, where are you? I can't find you.

315
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:42,280
Man Man, you blocked me. I had no choice

316
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,910
but to buy a new phone number.

317
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,120
Please don't ignore me, okay?

318
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,600
Did you drink?

319
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,200
I really miss you.

320
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,800
Aside from drinking,

321
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,000
can you do anything else?

322
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:14,200
Can't you earn more money?

323
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:21,010
If I became rich, would you come back to me?

324
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,700
You should earn money first.

325
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,400
Mo Fei.

326
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,000
Mo Fei, it's time to eat.

327
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,400
I'm coming.

328
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,890
The spareribs are not bad today.

329
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,000
What's wrong?

330
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,400
You have some nerve.

331
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,100
You dare go be a model behind my back?

332
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,000
Mom...

333
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,100
Well I... I couldn't waste your genes. Right?

334
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,000
Keep acting.

335
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,300
It's because I was a model before

336
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,200
so I know how hard this industry is. Where are you looking?

337
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,000
Besides, this profession is only for when you're young.

338
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,800
Have you thought about what you'll do once you're old?

339
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,300
Do you really think that everyone can be lucky like me?

340
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,760
There's also you.

341
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,590
You must be involved in Mo Fan's matters.

342
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,880
Mom, didn't you say that the spareribs are good?

343
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,200
Have some more.

344
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,900
Oh, right. I saw a few of your designs yesterday.

345
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,800
Are you going for Chinoiserie?

346
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
I'm really proud of you.

347
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,200
Mom, before I leave,

348
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,600
can you stay in Shanghai?

349
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,400
But I have to leave tonight.

350
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,000
What's wrong?

351
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,400
Nothing.

352
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,540
Just help me watch over your brother.

353
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,600
Pouting? Eat some more meat.

354
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:35,800
You two are like conjoined twins, always together. Are you two arguing?

355
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,800
My guest room is always reserved for you.

356
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,000
If you work too late, then don't go back home.

357
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,600
Sooner or later we'll be family, so don't be restrained by such unnecessary etiquette.

358
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,200
You worked hard on the collaboration with Master Li's embroidery workshop.

359
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,800
I even talked to Mingxuan about preparing a small gift for you soon.

360
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,680
What is their relationship?

361
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,430
You've been admitted.

362
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,200
Mo Fei, what are you thinking?

363
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,000
He only thinks of you as a friend.

364
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,900
Stop thinking so much.

365
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,200

What about Mo Fei?

393
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,400
You made an exception for her designs to be on Fashion Daily.

394
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,200
Strictly speaking, this does not align with the rules of the collaboration.

395
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,200
Also, it isn't fair to the competitors who weren't chosen.

396
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,800
Our competition is public and transparent.

397
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,600
Someone is bound to criticize this exception you've made.

398
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,200
So, I hope that you can reconsider.

399
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:31,000
So do you think that I manipulated things behind the scenes to get Mo Fei chosen?

400
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Isn't that true?

401
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,800
It's not the first day we've met.

402

Don't you know me?

403

But she is a contestant who didn't finish the competition.

404
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,800
The decision was made by President Wu's team.

405
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,400
They recognized her work.

406

He also told you himself, didn't he?

407

Why are you thinking so much?

Of course not.

It's a gift for you.

424

This is too expensive. I can't accept it.

425

Just consider it a reward from me

426

for all the hard work you have been doing.

427

But that is my duty.

428
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,200

Am I? I shouldn't be.

433
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,840
It's probably because I'm going to France soon so I have a lot of things to deal with.

434
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,800
By the way, in regards to the communication between Mingyuan and the embroidery workshop,

you can contact Embroiderer Wu. I have already spoken with her.

You're saying that you will go to France soon,

437
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,100
so it's better if we limit our contact, is that right?

438
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,940
No.

Do you know that Mo Fei is going to France?

482
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,040
I know.

483
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,880
Then, why are you here?

484
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,450
I just got off work so I came home. Why are you making a fuss over nothing?

485
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:05,520
No, she is going to France. She's flying out very soon. Her flight is today.

486
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,340
Mo Fan already took her to the airport.

Miss, your luggage is over the weight limit.

501
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,910
What?

502
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,510
How is that possible?

503
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,710
Before I left, I weighed it at home.

504
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:31,820
It's the exact weight. This isn't possible. Did you weigh it incorrectly?

505
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:35,050
No, we already weighed it.

506
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:37,360
No, beautiful lady. Well...

507
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,540
Can you weigh it again?

508
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,110
I really weighed it at home.

509
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:45,610
There's no way it's overweight.

510
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:49,130
You can take a look at the display yourself.

511
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,030
Is something wrong with your scale?

512
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,780
The scale at my home is very accurate.

513
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,830
I'm sorry.

514
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:03,320
Hello, are you also going to Paris?

515
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:08,170
Can you help me with something?

516
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,990
- Hello.
- Brother Xuan.

517
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,870
- Have you arrived?
- What's wrong?

Director Xia said—

519
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,380
Hey. You can't go this way anymore.

520
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:20,680
Thank you so much.

521
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,630
Without you, I wouldn't have known what to do.

522
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:25,520
I remember that I weighed it every single day.

523
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,190
It wasn't overweight on the scale at home. Why is it overweight here?

524
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:32,230
Anyway, I'm very grateful. When we get to Paris, I must treat you to a meal.

525
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,860
- It's all right.
- I'm Mi Duoduo.

526
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,810
What's your name?

527
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:37,120
- I'm Mo Fei.
- Mo Fei.

00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,850
Are you by yourself?

Mo Fei!

531
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:50,140
I told you to run slowly. Look, you're sweating.

532
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,940
Take care of yourself.

533
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,210
Remember to take care of the house.

534
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:56,660
Also, don't forget my fish.

535
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,990
I know. Hurry and go. Is everything taken care of?

536
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:01,660
Let's go.
