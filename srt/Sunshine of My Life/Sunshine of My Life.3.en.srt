[Episode 3]

3
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,390
What are you doing here?

4
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,430
I'm looking for my secretary. Why can't I find him?

5
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,620
You even lost your secretary?

6
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,240
The Su embroidery workshop is such a small space,

7
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,760
yet you two lost each other.

8
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,410
Should I get you a GPS?

9
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,960
Are you mocking me?

10
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,470
I was just being honest.

11
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,880
Are you an embroiderer here?

12
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,310
Are you the unscrupulous businessman here to acquire

13
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,860
about the embroidery workshop?

14
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,510
Who told you that?

15
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,400
If not, who are you?

16
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,210
I was just kidding.

17
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:52,580
I've been here a long time. I know this place very well.

18
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,230
Also, everything here is very well-made.

19
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,580
You could say they are all rare.

20
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,130
It's just that despite its brilliance, it remains unknown.

21
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,930
The embroiderers here also need to support their families

22
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,870
and give their children an extra chicken leg to eat.

23
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,600
Since you're so familiar with this place,

24
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,540
then give me a tour,

25
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:21,640
so that the embroiderer's child will get to eat a chicken leg.

26
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,870
All right!

27
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,250
Why... Why did you hit me?

28
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,590
What are you laughing at? Lead the way.

29
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,240
This way.

30
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,460
What is it? Master didn't agree to the purchase?

31
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,160
News travels fast in this little workshop.

32
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,800
It's not that news travels fast.

33
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,500
It's just... you're not the first to be chased away from here.

34
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,420
But right now, an acquisition

35
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,210
is the only way to resolve the workshop's difficulties.

36
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:55,420
Do you know how many students in total our master has taught?

37
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,430
Over 60.

38
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,080
But only about a dozen have stayed.

39
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,340
There are actually a lot of companies that come here every year.

40
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,480
They say that they want to pass down the craft of Su embroidery.

41
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,190
But in the end,

42
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,290
they all want my master to industrialize things.

43
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,700
There are even people who use my master's name to deceive and swindle the public

44
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,270
by creating poor-quality things.

45
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,720
- That's why she's not interested.
- In other words, you guys think I'm that kind of person, too.

46
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,730
It's that you didn't put your heart into it.

47
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,870
I know my master very well.

48
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,780
She spent more than half her life

49
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,380
to master various embroidery techniques.

50
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,710
Every piece made here

51
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,280
is embroidered with a lot of time and

52
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,150
sentiment.

53
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,030
She does everything she can to pass the art of Su embroidery down,

54
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:46,370
so more than anyone else, she wants this workshop to prosper.

55
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,660
She doesn't need you guys to come here to discuss a contract.

56
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,310
She needs sincerity.

57
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,520
Genuine and sincere comprehension.

58
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,100
Genuine and sincere understanding.

59
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,850
You don't look...

60
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:04,230
dumb. You should understand.

61
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,360
You dare to associate the word "dumb" with me?

62
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,540
Should I show you how clear and active the networks in my brain are?

63
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:24,400
I... You... Are you going to go inside for a look or not?

65
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,560
Hello! Good evening, everyone.

66
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,070
I'm your Little Fei Fei.

67
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,490
[Didn't you say you weren't going online today?]

68
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,680
I wasn't planning on going online,

69
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,880
but I finished everything at the embroidery workshop early

70
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,370
so I came online to check things out.

71
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,200
[How was your training at the embroidery workshop today?]

72
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,360
It went pretty smoothly.

73
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,530
[You don't sound very certain.]

74
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,190
That's not it.

75
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:44,250
Something happened at the embroidery workshop today

76
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,930
that left me rather emotional.

77
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,200
[What happened?]

78
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,900
I'm thinking

79
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,330
how Su embroidery still exists today

80
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:58,110
because people continuously passed on the art for 2,000 years,

81
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,970
from its glory days to its bleak times.

82
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,530
However, what can our generation

83
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:09,390
do for Su embroidery nowadays?

84
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,970
A lot of people use the pretense of innovation

85
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,360
to ruin cultural traditions.

86
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,670
They think that Su embroidery is unsophisticated,

87
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:23,550
and they want to create a fusion between East and West. But in the end, they have neither something indigenous nor Western.

88
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,000
[So what do you want to do then?]

89
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,130
What do I want to do? Does it matter? I'm just a little rookie designer. Frankly...

90
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,240
To put it bluntly...

91
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,240
I'm just... a seamstress.

92
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,560
Even if I have ideas, I wouldn't be able to actualize them.

93
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,750
But, why are you always online?

94
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,190
Could it be that you're always waiting for me?

95
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,160
[That's some wishful thinking you have...]

96
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,230
Your tone is really similar to...

97
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,510
You dare associate the word "dumb" with me?

98
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,250
[Who?]

99
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,520
Nobody. Someone I don't really like.

100

[Goodbye.]

101
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,050
No, why are you suddenly saying goodbye?

102
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,400
Why are you angry? I wasn't even talking about you.

103
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,060
Say, why are you so petty?

104
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,990
Tonight's live broadcast is over.

105
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,480
Good night.

106
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,000
Was that really necessary? I wasn't even talking about you.

107
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,610
Tsk, tsk. "Goodbye."

108
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,280
Bye!

109
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:53,250
Today is Cayman's model trainee selection.

110
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:58,030
We will be selecting suitable candidates among you

111
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:02,280
to participate in three months of professional training.

112
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,830
The company will hold a monthly comprehensive evaluation.

113
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:09,960
Those failing to receive an average score will be automatically let go.

114
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,330
Of course, there's no limit to how many trainees can be selected.

115
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,990
If all of you are good, we'll keep all of you.

116
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,000
If none of you pass, you'll all be let go.

117
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,170
My name is Linda.

118
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,580
I will be your trainer for the next 3 months.

119
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,940
I have only one request from you. Study diligently and train hard.

120
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,660
If there is anyone among you who thinks she can't bear the strenuous work,

121
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,330
or who can only see the superficial prestige of being a model,

122
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:42,600
the door is over there. You can leave right now.

123
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,670
All right then. In 20 minutes,

124
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,760
we'll start the first selection.

125
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,410
I will divide you into three groups: A, B, C.

126
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,340
Those who get into group A, will have the chance

127
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,510
to become backup models for the company

128
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,010
and participate in some small shows arranged by the company.

129
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,440
All right. If there are no questions,

130
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,720
everyone go get ready.

131
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:19,190
The audition is so strict so I guess it will get even tougher in the later stages.

132
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,800
I already want to drop out.

133
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,800
Lu Zhu, how come you don't seem nervous at all?
[Female Model Changing Room]

134
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,230
I have walked a few shows abroad. It doesn't feel that difficult.

135
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,070
Hi!

136
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,630
The pervert.

137
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,620
Who's a pervert?

138
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,110
What are you looking at?

139
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:49,310
Watching that now is already useless. It'll only make you more nervous.

140
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,200
I'm fine. I'm not nervous.

141
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,180
You are telling me you are not nervous, yet look at your mismatched socks.

142
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:00,260
I– Why did Mo Fei organize my socks like this?

143
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,360
It's fine. Fortunately, I have experience in shows.

144
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,630
Walk behind me and observe my brilliant stage presence.

145
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,640
I will cheer for you off stage.

146
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,480
Let's go!

147
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:25,600
Where did this boy come from? How come I have no impression of him?

148
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,360
Mo Fan, he's a boy who doesn't usually like to talk much.

149
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,880
He is very shy.

150
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,340
I'm starting to suspect if he's paranoid or not.

151

- You two get back to work first.
- All right.

Fang Xiaoyu, why are you still here?

00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,850
You really don't plan to return to the French headquarters?

156
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:59,900
Shanghai is so great. It has delicious food, places to hang out, and creativity.

157
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,320
Creativity? What creativity?

158
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,380
From what I can see, your work since coming back is no different than that of before.

159
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,980
Sister Linda, when did you learn to be so sarcastic like those youngsters?

160

Am I being sarcastic to you?

161

I am feeling bad for you, Xiaoyu.

162

She has quite a backbone,

No. How would I dare to ask you to go easy on her?

183
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,770
I was thinking that if she trains as well as studies with the other models

184

and has the chance to become a model trainee,

00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:15,390
No problem.

324
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,210
However,

325
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:21,060
since I brought you such good news, shouldn't you...

326
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,540
I'll treat you to a lavish meal!

327
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,910
Sweet!

[2019 Cayman Shanghai Fashion Charity Banquet]

329
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:39,500
Hello? There's a lot of people here.

330
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,690
They're really strict and the security's really tight. I don't know if I can get in.

331
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,350
But no matter what,

332
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:49,530
I have to get in to see my favorite designer. All right, I've got to go now.

333
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,060
Bye-bye.

334
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,420
Hello, Liu Shuang?

335
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,250
Do you have Director Fang's number?

336
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,400
Okay. I'll ask someone else.

337
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,640
Director Fang!

338
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,420
Are you here to attend the charity banquet?

339
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:23,500
If I had an invitation, then I would be.

340
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,600
You don't have an invitation?

341
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,170
Do you have one?

342
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:27,790
I'll tear half for you.

343
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,980
Can you still use it like that?

344
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,350
I was kidding.

345
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,400
Then, I'll accept your invitation then. Thank you.

346
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:45,150
Okay. Can you help me ask around?

347
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,910
Director Fang! Director Fang!

348
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,100
Invitation, please.

349
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,950
I came here with Director Fang! I was just on the phone.

350
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:55,000
I'm sorry, Miss. You can't enter without an invitation.

351
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,900
Director Fang!

352
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,830
Director Fang! Director Fang! What are you doing?!

353
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:03,030
Let me go! What are you doing?

354
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,720
What are you doing?! Miss, are you all right?

355
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,470
I'm fine.

356
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:11,240
Being so rough towards a girl! Be carefu or I might report you!

357
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,870
President Zhu, why haven't you gone in yet?

358
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:16,070
The event will start soon. We should go in.

359
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,770
Wow, I got Teacher Alexander's autograph.

360
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,750
Thank you so much for today.

361
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,530
Hey, I'm a famous designer, too.

362
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:30,010
Why don't you want my autograph?

363
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,940
Give me a second. Let me find a pen.

364
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,490
Yes, look for one.

365
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,280
I'm just kidding. Why are you so serious?

366
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:46,100
Director Fang, your grace and kindness to me is like a surging river.

367
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,450
I can't ever repay you.

368
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,370
Enough, enough. If you really want to thank me,

369
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,290
treat me to a coffee.

370
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:56,700
It's a bit late now. I'll treat you to a meal another day.

371
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,670
That works, too.

372
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,520
My car's up ahead. I'll give you a ride home.

373
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,140
It's okay. The subway's really convenient for me.

374
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,880
I'll get going then. Stay safe.

375
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,840
Bye-bye. Thank you!

376
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,530

- Hello, Mr. Fang.
- Thank you.

378
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,690
Do you need something?

379
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:33,020
Director Fang, you said you'd take me to the charity banquet. I've been looking for you this whole time.

380
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,900
Did I make that promise to you?

381
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,520
You said it yourself.

382
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,820
Look. I specifically ordered this gown for this banquet.

383
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,730
Isn't this outfit...

384
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:53,520
I'm sorry. I must have forgotten.

385
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,670
How much is this gown? I'll buy it from you.

386
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:59,380
I didn't come to ask you for money.

387
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,630
Is there something else I can help with then?

388
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,000
I saw you take Mo Fei inside.

389
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,280
And?

390
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,750
Why did you take her?

391
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:10,760
You clearly promised me first.

392
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,950
Did she badmouth me to you?

393
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:16,570
Or did she offer you some kind of benefit?

394
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:18,120
I'm sorry, Ms. Bai,

395
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,010
but are we close?

396
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:22,300
What gives you the right to interrogate me?

397
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:33,740
That's not it. Director Fang! I'm not finished talking! Can you let me finish?

398
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,390
Director Fang!

399
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:47,270
Why do all of you like her better?

400
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:50,210
In what way is she better than me?!

401
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:00,450
Are you all right, Miss?

402
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:02,400
Let me help you up.

403
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,640
I'm fine.

404
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,820
You seem to be in some kind of problem.

405
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,780
Tell me. Can I help you?

406
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,460
There's no need.

407
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,900
Your heel is broken, and you're here alone in the middle of the night.

408
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,000
Let me take you home.

409
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,100
Don't worry. I'm not a bad person.

410
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,300
I'm from Haiyao Group.

411

Here are your noodles. Eat up.

414
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,660
I don't want to.

415
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,550
What's wrong, Man Man?

416
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,750
Didn't you go to attend a charity banquet?

417
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:56,500
Why are you upset? Did you not get to attend?

418
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,220
Didn't you specifically custom-order a gown for it?

419
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,280
What happened? Tell me, Man Man.

420
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:07,840
I was originally able to go in.

421
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,170
But somehow Mo Fei suddenly appeared and stole my spot.

422
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,820
Why is it that girl again?

423
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,000
Why is she always making things difficult for you?

424
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,660
All right, all right. Don't be mad anymore.

425
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:26,310
If it wasn't for her, would I have been expelled from school back then?

426
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:30,210
If it weren't for her, would I have been so humiliated today?

427
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:33,230
If it weren't for her, Director Fang...

428
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:37,870
She's just jealous of me. She doesn't want to see me do better than her.

429
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:45,110
That's enough. Don't cry anymore.

430
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,620
I just don't understand.

431
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,960
She's not prettier than I am.

432
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,680
Her figure is not better than mine. So, then why...

433
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:56,610
You're right!

434
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,040
She's nothing compared to you.

435
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,220
Why do you bother with her? Right?

436
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,780
Come on. Here, have some noodles. Okay?

437
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,750
I don't want to.

438
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:16,040
Today, I especially bought you a present.

439
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,050
Have a look.

440
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:30,370
I guarantee it'll make everything better. Hurry and take a look.

441
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,310
What is it?

442
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,710
It's fake!

443
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:46,350
What Director Fang said to me was fake and, now, even the bag you bought for me is fake!

444
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,950
No, Man Man, how can this be fake?

445
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,500
Forget about before. This one is authentic.

446
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,320
I saved for two months. Do you think I can't tell?

447
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,930
Do I only deserve a fake bag?

448
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,400
No, Man Man. Take a good look.

449
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,720
I don't want to! I've had enough!

450
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,130
Man Man!

451
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,850
I was at fault last time.

452
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:22,390
I didn't have a deeper understanding of the embroidery workshop's situation.

453
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:26,600
So after I got back, I drafted a new proposal.

454
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,990
I hope you can take a look.

455
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:34,590
President Tang, I didn't expect

456
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:38,410
you to be so determined.

457
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:42,260
We are not just interested in the intangible heritage of Li's Embroidery Workshop.

458
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:46,920
We are more concerned about the inheritance and future of the embroidery workshop.

459
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,580
I believe once you've reviewed this new proposal,

460
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:53,020
you will be able to feel our sincerity.

461
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,360
Excuse me. Sorry.

462
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:15,550
I haven't seen you in a few days, yet your manners have improved quite a bit.

463
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:19,840
- I'm going to get going first.
- Wait.

464
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,170
Take this.

465
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:29,280
Hey, what are you doing? I can carry it myself!

466
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,940
When someone is helping you, just say "thank you."

467
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,710
That would be enough.

468
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:36,290
But I can clearly carry it myself. I don't need you to carry it for me.

469
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:37,640
Why would I say "thank you" to you?

470
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,030
Well, I also don't expect you to thank me.

471
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,330
But...

472
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,910
Thank you.

473
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:49,220
- Did you come see my master to give her a new proposal?
- Yes.

474
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,900
What did she say?

475
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,200
She said she needs to think about it.

476
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,020
That's good.

477
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,980
A few days ago, the words you said to me

478
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:02,280
inspired me a lot.

479
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,220
So now I must sincerely thank you.

480
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,550
You're welcome. Let's go.

481
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:31,870
- Mo Fei.
- Yes?
- Come.

482
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:37,070
There is so much fabric yet you didn't use a cart

483
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:39,650
and carried it here yourself. Don't you feel tired?

484
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:42,780
I'm okay. On the way here, I met President Tang.

485
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:46,060
He helped me carry them the whole way and even brought them to the door.

486
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,540
What do you think of

487
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:54,260
President Tang as a person?

488
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:57,460
Master, what are you trying to say?

489
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,730
President Tang brought a new proposal today.

490
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:03,440
To be honest, I'm quite interested.

491
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,790
This time, his suggestions have changed quite drastically.

492
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:10,850
He has even considered retirement benefits for the embroiderers.

493
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:14,790
Is that so? Then what do you think, Master?

494
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:18,230
I think... I'll listen to you

495
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,700
and try to collaborate with Mingyuan.

496
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,510
Really?

497
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,630
That's great. That's great.

498
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,590
But I'm still a bit concerned.

499
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:33,010
Mingyuan is a large enterprise, after all.

500
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,110
I'm worried that we'll encounter the same problems as before.

501
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:40,040
So I want to ask you to handle this matter since you happen to be in Shanghai.

502
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,430
Help me check Mingyuan's sincerity.

503
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:46,380
At the same time, help me look over the contract.

504
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,140
- Me?
- Yes.

505
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:51,780
No, that won't do. Master, that is too large of a responsibility.

506
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,350
You're the person I trust the most.

507
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:58,340
I think that you're completely capable of making a judgment on my behalf.

508
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,930
But... I don't have much experience, Master.

509
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:04,960
Just do what you usually do.

510
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,620
I believe you can do it. Okay?

511
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:17,500
Blood pressure, 105/80. Dad,

512
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,780
you have to rest well.

513
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,550
At my age,

514
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:28,330
my capability level is low but my blood pressure is high.

515
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:32,180
What kind of joke is that? How are your capabilities low?

516
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,170
I looked at the workshop proposal you drafted for Master Li.

517
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:38,210
It's excellent and very detail-oriented, too.

518
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,940
Thank you for your compliment, Dad.

519
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:44,690
Did you gain anything from your trip to Suzhou?

520
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:47,010
I did gain quite a bit during this trip.

521
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:50,110
There, I saw scenery that caused me to be very touched.

522
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:54,330
I saw the embroiderer creating the embroideries one needle and one thread at a time.

523
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:56,750
At that moment, I didn't feel as if they were working.

524
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,550
They were putting their feelings into it.

525
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:06,210
Actually, if you seriously study it and put your feelings into it,

526
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:08,790
you'll gain even more.

527
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:11,520
The industrial revolution is so advanced in this era,

528
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,610
yet why are they still persisting?

529
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:18,320
What are the generations of embroiderers passing down?

530
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,360
I'm afraid it's not as simple as just a stitch or thread.

531
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,670
Do you understand what I'm saying?

532
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:31,660
In a bit, I'll have a good night of sleep. Tomorrow, when I wake up, I'll probably understand.

533
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,960
Then you better go to bed.

534
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,260
Dad, you go and rest, too.

535
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,770
All right.

536
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:39,470
Good night.

537
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:50,690
Would Master Li really agree?

538
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:55,120
From what you just said, why do I feel that she doesn't have the sincere intention of collaborating with Mingyuan?

539
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,150
Good things come with patience.

540
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,430
There is no need for us to rush.

541
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:02,680
Mingxuan, as you know,

542
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,060
there are many famous embroidery workshops in Suzhou.

543
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,600
We don't have to collaborate with Master Li.

544
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,050
But among the ones you recommended, Master Li's embroidery

545
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:13,290
is the most diligent.

546
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:22,960
[Mo Fei: President Tang, my master wants to understand Mingyuan's collaboration with our workshop. Can we meet to discuss the details?]

547
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,570
[Tang Mingxuan: All right. Where are you?]

548
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:31,650
- Something just came up. Help me cancel the rest of my scheduled events.
- All right.

549
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,700
- I'm leaving now.
- Okay.

550
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,780
Who is in such a rush to meet him?

551
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,520
I don't know.

552
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:58,510
♫ I say you're an April day ♫

553
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:02,640
♫ The sound of your laughter lights everything up ♫

554
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,170
♫ Even the spirit of a light breeze ♫

555
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:12,070
♫ In the midst of the brightness and beauty of spring, shift as one would in a dance ♫

556
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:17,450
♫ You're the mist on a dry April day ♫

557
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:21,860
♫ The gentle breeze blown during dusk ♫

558
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:25,440
♫ The unintentional sparkle of the planetesimal ♫

559
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,970
♫ The fine rain that's sprinkled in front of the flower ♫

560
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:36,270
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

561
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:40,980
♫ Like a shy water lotus that bows to a cool breeze ♫

562
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:45,640
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

563
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:50,630
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫

566
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:15,190
♫ You're like the ivory field after snowflakes ♫

567
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:19,610
♫ You're the round moon every night ♫

568
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:22,230
♫ You're the naïve ♫

569
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:28,660
♫ White lotus that floats on the water ripples of your dream ♫

570
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:34,730
♫ You're the flower blossoms of tree after tree ♫

571
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:39,140
♫ The swallow twittering within the beams ♫

572
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:43,240
♫ You are love, hope, and warmth ♫

573
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:47,170
♫ You're an April day ♫

574
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:51,920
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

575
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,630
♫ The bittersweet parting words of "take care" ♫

576
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:01,410
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

577
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:08,740
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫
