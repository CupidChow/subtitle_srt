3
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,280
Lu Zhu. Rhythm, rhythm.

4
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,650
Rhythm! Do you hear me?

5
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,410
I want you to pay attention to the rhythm, not to use your heels to chisel the floor.

6
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,330
Tell me. What are you learning?

7
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,800
Huh?

8
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,750
Lu Zhu.

9
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,740
What's the matter? Are you upset? Don't cry.

10
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,210
Today, the teacher was a bit harsh.

11
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,940
Let me make an announcement.

12
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,270
The Garment Association will be holding a Chinese-Style

13
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,890
Fashion Designer Competition.

14
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,610
I've already promised the organizer

15
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,100
that I will be providing the models for this competition.

16
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,070
I'm planning to give this opportunity as the reward for this session's test.

17
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,950
I'll be choosing the five best trainees to participate in this competition.

18
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,190
Thank you, Teacher Linda. We will surely work hard.

19
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,200
Thank you, Teacher.

20
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,860
All right. Everyone, go rest.

21
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,350
Goodbye, Teacher.

22
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:47,970
Let's go.

23
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,730
Mo Fan,

24
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:53,770
can you stay to practice with me for a bit?

25
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,970
I can't today. Tonight, I have to go sing.

26
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,300
Just for a little while. I'm doing so miserably.

27
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,520
I really can't. If I'm late, the boss will deduct my pay.

28
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,850
I'll pay you, is that okay?

29
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,760
Why would you pay me money?

30
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,050
Miss, I really can't today.

31
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,790
Just practice by yourself, all right? You can do it!

32
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,390
Stay with me.

33
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,540
The weather is really just adding to our miserable circumstances.

34
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,810
Say, what do we do if this doesn't work out?

35
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,460
We have to be patient.

36
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,630
I'm quite patient. I'm just afraid of that

37
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,590
opportunistic Lu Jun.

38
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,600
Say...

39
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,640
What do we do if that Zhu Haitian really

40
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,160
acquires the embroidery workshop?

41
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,920
Many things depend on fate.

42
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,760
Doing business is the same. Let nature takes its own course.

43
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,380
Aren't you worried then?

44
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,120
I'm asking you a question. Why are you not responding?

45
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,670
Wait! I remember that when I wanted to acquire the embroidery workshop,

46
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,060
you were against it. Were you not?

47
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,110
Me?

48
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,440
I don't think so.

49
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,520
Then, who said I was an evil businessman?

50
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,720
Do you know that you ruined my reputation?

51
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,270
I-I-I never said that. Right?

52
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:22,000
Do you think that I don't have evidence? I have a recording.

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,280
I've never said that about you, President Tang!

54
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,830
Out of everyone I've met, President Tang is t-the...

55
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,820
the kindest, most handsome, m-most responsible

56
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,240
boss. How can I possibly slander you, right?

57
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,830
Are you serious about what you said?

58
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,420
Very serious.

59
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,220
Okay.

60
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,100
You lied to me! How can you be like this?

61
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,380
What are you laughing at? How are you so easily amused?

62
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,400
It's not that I'm very easily amused, it's that I think you are really hilarious.

63
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,780
Look! You're quite handsome when you smile, aren't you?

64
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,360
Seeing your usually icy appearance—

65
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,260
No need to say the last part. Just the first part is enough.

66
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,720
Fine. I originally wanted to compliment you. Never mind then.

67
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,860
Continue then.

68
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,920
Continue what?

69
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,930
Continue to compliment me.

70
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,920
Actually... it's not really a compliment.

71
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,560
I just think you are different than others.

72
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,790
How so?

73
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,520
Other business people only want to make money.

74
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,570
But you... you sincerely

75
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,040
like traditional Chinese culture,

76
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,740
and are actually doing things for the embroidery workshop.

77
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,800
With regards to what you have done for my master,

78
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,780
I'm quite touched.

79
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:53,040
Do you think I'm a good person because I'm nice to your master

80
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,730
or do you think I'm a good person

81
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,960
because I'm inherently good?

82
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,790
I want to hear the truth.

83
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:09,380
Just like how I wouldn't say that Mo Fei is a girl who is

84
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,160
skilled at embroidery.

85

However, in my heart,

you're a very special girl.

He dreamed of this color

Didn't you go to your part-time job? Why are you back?

120
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,630
I came back to get something so I came to take a look since I was here.

Think about how to move. Can you change your pose at the fixed point?

You came specifically to practice with me, right?

Of course not! I came back to get my shoes.

Come on! At this time, even if that's not true, you should say it is!

I'm already so pitiful. Can't you comfort me a little?

134
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,730
All right. Teacher Linda is a bit harsh with her words

but she's doing it for our own good.

Being a model is what I've really wanted to do since I was young.

Oh.

I'm pouring my heart out here and all you have to say is "oh"?

140
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,830
Such a shame you have such good looks, because you don't know how to speak!

141
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:39,480
You are just like my unlucky cousin, determined to be alone for life.

Isn't President Tang all right?

143
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,980
How is he all right?

144
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,430
He is like a mannequin and is a control freak!

145
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:49,730
- He does not let me do this or that.
- You seem energetic. Why don't you walk a few more times?

146
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,970
Are you serious? You're scarier than my cousin!

149
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,850
you can frankly tell me about any of your worries.

150
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,680
I'm sorry, President Tang. I've wasted your day again.

151

This situation is really...

152
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,560
Never mind, let's not talk about it.

153
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,650
Lu Jun has already agreed to Zhu Haitian's terms.

154
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:48,770
In the future, the embroidery workshop may very well collaborate with Haiyao.

155
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,150
Master, don't blame yourself.

156
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,760
He's the one who crossed the line.

157
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,480
It's just... how could he possibly manage the embroidery workshop well?

158
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,350
I also didn't think Lu Jun would go so far with matters.

159
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,280
I'm already old

160
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,570
so it's fine if I have to work hard and experience hardships. My heart just aches for those

hardworking masters who rely on their craftmanship for a living.

162
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,110
But I really cannot do anything.

163
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:20,130
After all, this embroidery workshop is under Lu Jun's name. In the end,

164
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,570
this embroidery workshop is his.

165
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,250
What I'm worried about now is

166
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,510
that the business passed down by our ancestors

167
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,980
will be ruined by him.

168
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,450
Actually, I have an idea.

169
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,950
I don't know if you trust me or not.

170
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,350
Let me handle Lu Jun and Zhu Haitian.

171
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,930
I hope you and the embroiderers can properly embroider

172
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,430
and create your masterpieces.

173
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:49,090
In a bit, I want to take you somewhere.

174
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,040
I'll go get my car and wait for you two at the door.

Mo Fei, where is President Tang taking us?

176
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,190
Well, President Tang is someone who keeps his promises.

177
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,340
Since he has already asked the embroiderers to embroider in peace,

178
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,250
then I believe he has already figured out a way.

179
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,060
Whether it is Lu Jun or Zhu Haitian,

180
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,880
he will solve everything.

181
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,660
Are you sure?

182
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:24,440
Lu Jun, that child, is especially difficult to deal with.

183
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,030
But President Tang is not a character who's easily dealt with either.

184
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,520
Hearing you say that,

185
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,530
it seems like you know President Tang really well.

186
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,680
We just argued a few times,

187
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,510
so I guess I know him quite a bit.

188
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,130
I trust you and President Tang,

189
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:50,430
but the current situation is really...

190
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,590
Enough, Master. Don't think too much about it.

191
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,960

194
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,780
Master, I say, this place is

195
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,150
much bigger than our current embroidery workshop.

196
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,900
Yes, it is. It's so beautiful.

197
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,030
Also, look, the sunlight here is great.

198
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:08,320
It is convenient to air dry our embroidery and fabric.

199
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,470
When I chose this place, the most important reason

200
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,920
is that the sunlight is great here.

201
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,810
Also, President Tang told me before that

202
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,450
you can open the doors and windows really wide.

203
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,840
When you embroider, there won't be a color mishap

204
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,590
and it's better for the eyes.

205
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,860
President Tang, you are so thoughtful.

206
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,280
It's Mo Fei who told me about everything.

207
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,330
This place is indeed suitable for an embroidery workshop.

208
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:40,600
However, I'm afraid I can't afford

209
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,690
such a big area of land in a location like this.

210
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,340
You don't have to worry about that at all.

211
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,590
Because our company has already bought this place.

212
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,750
From now on, you and your embroiderers

213
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,760
can work happily here every day

214
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,390
and do not need to worry about making a living anymore.

215

How can I open a new embroidery workshop with "two empty hands?"
(No resources)

218
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,960
How can you say you have two empty hands?

219
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,440
Your hands are the resources.

220
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,620
If an embroidery workshop doesn't have you or your embroiderers,

221
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,090
then it's just an empty workshop with signage.

222
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,500
If Lu Jun wants to fool around,

223
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,910
then let him do so himself.

224
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,400
I hope I can continue to collaborate with you.

225

Please think it over.

to truly understand them?

So some companies use this kind of event as a gimmick

322
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,730
to generate interest.

323
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:38,350
I just didn’t expect that some companies would do something like this.

324
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,060
I must say a few words.

325
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,900
Currently, international brands

326
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,760
occupy more than half of our domestic fashion market.

327
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,250
Think about what our domestic brands

328
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:57,680
have become because they are not able to make a living.

329
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,150
Become manufacturers instead? Isn't that ridiculous?

330
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,920
If an event like this

331
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,120
can give our domestic brands

332
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,520
an opportunity to become popular,

333
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,370
then won't that have a positive effect?

334
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,630
Our Cayman's style has always been clear.

335
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,340
We keep a low profile and we have our own limit.

336
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,850
Our Cayman has tens of thousands of ways to be popular.

337
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:23,900
It doesn't have to be through these means which President Tang speaks about, right?

338
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,790
Director Fang, l-let me explain this.

339
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:29,720
Actually, the industry and media have come together for this competition

340
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,470
because our main goal is

341
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,280
that through Chinese Style Fashion, we can find—

342
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,290
President Wu.

343
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:38,160
You are being too serious.

344
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,910
Let me tell you. Director Fang likes to be humorous.

345
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,060
Say, if we all haven't come to an agreement,

346
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,630
then would we all be sitting here at the same table?

347
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,630
- You all must report this positively.
- That's right.

348
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:53,820
So, in any industry, there must be a company that can turn the tide.

349
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,850
That is the reason why I'm representing Cayman here.

350
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:59,740
- Let's give Cayman a round of applause.
- All right.

351
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,360
Hurry up and have a seat.

352
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,370
Director Fang, why did ask me to come here in such a hurry?

353
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,140
Don't be worried. What would you like to drink?

354
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,860
I'll just have water. Thank you.

355
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,740
Waiter, a glass of water, please.

356
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,520
The Chinese Style competition is going to start soon.

357
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,010
How is your design going?

358
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:29,690
Why are the judges in such a hurry to start giving scores?

359
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,190
Why are you so serious?

360
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,990
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

361
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:37,870
I am a judge, so, of course, I'm interested in the contestants' works.

362
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:41,250
Also, I do have selfish motives.

363
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,260
The winner of this competition can sign with our Cayman.

364
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:49,010
I want to train a capable assistant for myself.

365
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:57,270
So, is this you secretly opening the back door for me?

366
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,610
What? Do you not want to join Cayman?

367
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:04,190
That's not what I mean, I just think...

368
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,450
Since you are a judge, you should

369
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:10,590
be fair to each competitor.

370
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,340
Do you think that our Cayman

371
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,000
opens back doors for anyone randomly?

372
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,260
I am doing it

373
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,480
because I cherish and love talent.

374
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,300
Because I understand and admire your work,

375
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,940
as well as recognize your capabilites.

376
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,340
How can you reject me so fast?

377
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,980
I'm just being honest.

378
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,820
Don't take it to heart, but thank you!

379
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,740
For thinking of me when it comes to good opportunities.

380
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,770
Since you're so honest, I can't honestly be mad at you.

381
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:42,050
If there is nothing else, I am leaving. I still have things to do.

382
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,480
Not so fast. How about I give you a ride?

383
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,610
It's fine. It's related to the competition anyway.

384
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,770
I have already made plans to film with my friend.

385
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,820
So, I need to go.

386
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,550
What are you shooting? Tell me.

387
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:56,990
Just some preparation work for before the competition starts, like choosing fabric.

388
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,920
You are a designer.

389
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,190
Going there like this, wouldn't you be dressed too casually?

390
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,040
Have a seat first and wait a moment for me.

391
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,080
- But—
- Sit.

392
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,450
Waiter, can you bring me scissors? Thank you.

393
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:12,000
- I'm really in a hurry.
- It'll be really quick.

394
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:42,230
Let me borrow that pin of yours.

395
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,010
Wear it on your chest.

396
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,730
Thank you, Director Fang.

397
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:18,990
Perfect. A unique flower

398
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,910
for a unique designer.

399
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,160
I have high expectations from you. Don't disappoint me.

400
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,050
Thank you.

401
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,750
I'm already late. I really need to go. Thank you.

402
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,860
I will definitely do my best in the competition.

403
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,700
- I can do it!
- You can do it!

404
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,350
- Bye-bye!
- You can do it!

405
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,260
- I can do it!
- Yes!

406
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:49,380
Please look forward to my oceanic tung flower. Thank you.

407
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,440
- Was that all right?
- Yes.

408
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,100
When will the next person be here?

409
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,890
I'm sorry. Can you wait a bit longer?

410
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:59,000
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

411
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,590
My lord, you're finally here!

412
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:17,680
I'm sorry, so sorry. Did you finish filming?

413
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,940
I have finished a long time ago. If I didn't beg that director sister, they would have left long ago.

414
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,540
- T-Then I'll go apologize right away.
- Wait, Sis.

415
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,860
Are you doing your greeting on-screen like this?

416
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,400
This is your on-screen debut!

417
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,810
W-Wait.

418
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,760
H-Help me hold this.

419
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,890
D-Don't move!

420
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,330
Will this do? Okay. Let's go.

421
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,790
I'm sorry, so sorry.

422
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,570
Boss, please.

423
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:31,530
- All right, how do you want it cut?
- The usual way.

424
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,160
Okay. Cut!

425
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,990
Boss, thank you so much.

426
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,910
- I've troubled you.
- Not at all.

427
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,520
No trouble at all!

428
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,710
I can't believe an old geezer like me can actually be on TV.

429
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:55,920
Which channel is it? Tell me when it airs.

430
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,620
I am going to tell my son to watch it.

431
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:01,230
- Don't worry, when it airs I will definitely inform you.
- Okay.

432
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,680
Mo Fei. In a bit, look at the screen and explain why you chose the fabric.

433
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,070
Then we're done, all right?

434
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:18,260
When I received the theme of "misty rain in Jiangnan," I thought,

435
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:21,150
"What is a special characteristic of Jiangnan?"

436
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:24,430
I think it should be Jiangnan's water.

437
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:27,030
Jiangnan's water is the gentlest.

438
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:30,100
So for the fabric this time, I chose silk.

439
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,640
And what color should Jiangnan's water be?

440
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,290
I thought of a poem about Jiangnan.

441
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:38,910
"Spring water as blue as the sky. Laying in a beautifully decorated boat, falling asleep to the sound of the rain."

442
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:42,410
The color of a clear sky after rain in Jiangnan should be the most beautiful.

443
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:45,260
This is why the main color I chose for my design

444
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,090
is cerulean blue.

445
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,180
Okay. Cut! This is great.

446
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,200
That's it for today. We are done.

447
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,200
- Thank you so much.
- Mo Fei.

448
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,570
Since the fabric has been chosen, what is the next step for you contestants?

449
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:01,750
Next, we will go to Mingyuan's design studio to make the designs.

450
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,320
Mingyuan has provided us an especially professional space to work.

451
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,970
Then Director Sister, will you guys be coming with us to film?

452
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:11,330
No. To go into Mingyuan's design studio, you need to sign a confidentiality agreement.

453
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,880
Also, you need to keep confidential until the designs are finished and made.

454
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,360
Then that is great! We can finally breathe.

455
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,730
Thank you so much today.

456
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:24,960
Today was so exhausting! My back!

457
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:28,660
But, Mo Fei, you did so well!

458
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:31,200
When you hurried over, I was afraid you might make some mistake.

459
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,170
But I can't believe once you went on camera, you immediately spoke with confidence and fluency.

460
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:37,440
You didn't see, but that Director Sister immediately went from gloomy to sunny.

461
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,780
Let me tell you! I was so nervous that I was shaking.

462
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:44,560
I feel, that once this airs, you'll definitely become popular.

463
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,820
Once you are famous, how are you going to thank me?

464
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:52,340
I'll treat you to delicious food.

465
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,610
Like what?

466
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,440
Hotpot!

467
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,070
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

468
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,680
Let's go.

469
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,140
You're here again?

470
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,480
[Mingyuan Fashion Group, Mo Fei, Designer]

471
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,800
Please.

472
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,480
- Why are you—
- Why are you—

473
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:08,570
Why are you here?

474
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:12,610
I think I'm on the wrong floor. I need to go to the design studio.

475
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:15,820
This whole floor is my office yet you're looking for the design studio here?

476
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,820
- It's downstairs.
- Okay, I'll get going.
- No, wait.

477
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:22,060
I happen to need to talk to you. Let's go to my office.

478
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:22,990
Let me help you.

479
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:24,850
I can carry it myself.

480
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:29,040
You don't know yet, right? This company's boss particularly likes to

481
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,310
deduct the employees' bonuses.

482
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:34,890
Since we know each other so well, I can't get you in trouble. Right?

483
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:39,360
If we run into the boss, then your wallet would be wronged. Right?

484
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,270
Come on.

485
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,330
Is this for me?

486
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:51,850
Though Master Li's small courtyard is complete, I think it's still missing a lot of things.

487
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:54,540
I had the purchasing department make a list.

488
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:58,070
They don’t know much about embroidery, so please review it for me.

489
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:00,680
I think it's too much.

490
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:04,200
I plan to expand the garden a bit more.

491
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:09,350
Your company has too much money, doesn't it?

492
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,040
Oh, you have a guest?

493
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,470
Xueling, you've met before.

494
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:20,510
Master Li's disciple, Mo Fei.

495
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:24,590
- Hello, Miss Mo Fei. We meet again.
- Hello.

496
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,390
Are you all done here?

497
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:31,740
The new season's designs are almost ready.

498
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,560
Do you want to go look at them with me?

499
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,790
All right.

500
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:37,730
Since you're busy, I'll get going first.

501
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:40,020
Do you want to come with us?

502
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,900
Me? Can I?

503
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,650
If you are with me, of course you can.
- Okay.

504
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,960
Let's go.

505
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,500
Director Xia.

506
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,320
You! Stop, stop, stop.

507
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,820
Which department are you from?

508
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:07,200
The design studio is currently strictly confidential. Outsiders can't come in.

509
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,800
- I brought her here.
- Oh, okay.

510
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,230
Let's come in and take a look.

511
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,400
President Tang! President Tang!

512
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,290
President Tang!

513
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,330
What's the matter?

514
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,200
It's not appropriate for me to go in.

515
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,850
What's not appropriate about it?

516
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:22,820
I'm not—

517
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:26,390
Doesn't the badge you wear say that you're Mingyuan Group's designer?

518
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:28,620
That is what the badge says

519
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,960
but I'm just here to participate in the competition.

520
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,780
When we were visiting stores in Suzhou, didn't you do quite well?

521
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:37,340
In a bit, just say and do what you must. Be poised and confident.

522
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:40,450
Can that be the same? You have designers here. Won't I offend people in my industry?

523
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:44,030
Do well and I'll double the pay.

524
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,130
Mo Fei.

525
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,190
Tell me. What do you think?

526
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:26,390
I think it looks great, however I think it's lacking

527
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:29,880
a bit of the brand's personal cultural characteristics.

528
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,830
Miss Mo.

529
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,270
You are being vague.

530
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:37,880
What do you think is the actual problem?

531
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,130
Take this shirt as an example.

532
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:46,260
Professional style, concise, and capable. The texture is also great.

533
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:50,690
But it's too similar to the 2015 Armani's spring and summer collection.

534
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:53,490
Even the shape is the same.

535
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:04,420
And this other one.

536
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:09,280
It uses the Chinese design of an overlapping collar.

537
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,190
The collar and skirt also have Chinese elements.

538
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:17,430
It's just that it's very similar to Versace's design

539
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:21,480
released in 2019 in Milan.

540
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,980
Even the bowknot

541
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:26,870
is very similar.

542
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,420
Miss Mo, you are indeed impressive.

543
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:35,100
You even remember the designs of major brands from previous seasons.

544
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,320
I'm just making some random comments.

545
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,560
If I was wrong, please forgive me.

546
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,530
Liu Pei, you're responsible for this line of clothes.

547
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,420
Give us all an explanation.

548
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,970
Designers must cherish their reputations.

549
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:53,050
If you are labeled as a plagiarizer, you can't shake it off.

550
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,820
President Tang, well... this is just a coincidence.

551
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:00,860
What?

552
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,870
It's a coincidence.

553
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:09,290
As a professional designer,

554
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:12,280
you're using the word "coincidence" to explain this?

555
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,590
Let me ask you.

556
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:19,180
Do you know why our company has not had any contact or collaboration with Haiyao

557
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,950
for so many years?

558
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:24,050
That's because three years ago their designer plagiarized our designs.

559
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:27,520
The lawsuit alone lasted two and a half years.

560
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,990
Thankfully, we had Mo Fei today. If we had launched these as our new products,

561
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:34,760
your resignation alone wouldn't solve the problem.

562
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,730
You would have to pay a huge compensation fee and all of the company's losses.

563
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:43,070
Mingxuan, could there be a misunderstanding? Shouldn't we investigate this before drawing a conclusion?

564
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:45,310
What misunderstanding?

565
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:49,190
Here. Take a look.

566
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:52,490
This one. And this...

567
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,840
Both of you look into this matter today and

568
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,450
and write a review report for me.

569
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:04,440
No exception.

570
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,470
Don't you have a competition? Let's go.

571
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,910
[Design Studio 7]

572
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:47,130
Please come in.

573
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:54,080
Ta-da! Your little cutie is here with your lunch. Do you feel touched? Do you like it?

574
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,410
Say, quickly take a look to see if I need to make any changes.

575
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:59,170
Look at what? Eat lunch first.

576
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,520
Hey.

577
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,590
What are you—

578
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:06,050
The fabric will get dirty if I put it there.

579
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:08,260
All right. Look.

580
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,130
I'm not trying to criticize you

581
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:12,580
but you're at Mingyuan Group right now.

582
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:15,460
You are the envy of all designers.

583
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,600
Why don't you pay attention to your image?

584
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,850
I-Isn't this okay?

585
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,200
But you are dressed especially nice today.

586
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,940
Are you here to compete or are you here to fish for a rich husband?

587
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,450
I must compete

588
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:34,620
but I also need to find a good catch.

589
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:39,050
Come on! Tell me. How is your catch? Did he take the bait?

590
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:41,960
What catch? What are you talking about?

591
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,250
I don't have a fish pond. What's there to catch?

592
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,660
Drop the act. Do you think I don't know?

593
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,150
Now, everyone in Mingyuan knows

594
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:53,030
that President Tang took you to the design studio.

595
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:55,890
What? What is everyone saying?

596
