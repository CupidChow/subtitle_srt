3
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,490
People can leave,

4
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,530
but I always have a backup.

5
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,260
In the same way, you're also a company leader. What did you do?

6
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,870
Not only did you violate the company's rules,

7
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,950
your subordinates to leave their posts.

8
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,520
I am so disappointed in you.

9
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,230
Mingxuan, it's not like that.

10
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,160
All these years, I have been by your side.

11
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,760
Yet you keep ignoring my hard work and sacrifice.

12
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,800
Since Mo Fei appeared,

13
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,320
in your eyes and heart, there is only her.

14
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,640
No matter what I do, I am not as good as her.

15
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,920
What do I need to do for you to see me?

16
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:21,110
Like the first time we came here,

17
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,330
when you cared about me.

18
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,710
I never ignored you.

19
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,270
You should be very aware of how much I trust and rely on you.

20
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,280
But my trust is not a weapon for you to do what you want with at the company.

21
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,940
Don't you think what you did has ruined our friendship?

22
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,850
I know what I did was wrong.

23
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,950
But I don't want to leave the company.

24
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,180
I don't want to leave you.

25
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,620
I never thought of firing you.

26
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,510
You were the one who wanted to leave.

27
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,890
Think carefully

28
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,210
about whether you'll stay or leave.

29
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,830
You make the choice.

30
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,350
Oh, right.

31
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,990
Didn't you approve of Liu Pei's leave?

32
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:35,360
I recommend that you also rest during this time.

33
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,300
Calm down and think it through.

34
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,220
This... is all I'm going to say.

35
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,250
Xueling.

36
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,620
Where did you go? I was so worried.

37
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,200
Mom, I didn't go anywhere. I just went out to relax.

38
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,730
When you went out to relax, Tang Mingxuan came to the house looking for you.

39
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,880
He came here?

40
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,660
Yes. I wanted to scold him, but your father stopped me.

41
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,920
You two stop chirping out there.

42
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,160
Xueling, come here.

43
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,150
Let me ask you something.

44
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,460
Dad, what is it?

45
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,800
Sit.

46
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,890
Xueling,

47
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,810
I hope you'll...

48
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,090
be honest with me.

49
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,220
You and that...

50
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,480
that Tang Mingxuan,

51
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,400
what exactly...

52
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,840
what exactly is going on?

53
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,150
Dad, don't ask.

54
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,400
I want to solve my own problems.

55
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,640
If you can solve them yourself—

56
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,990
If she doesn't let you ask, then don't ask.

57
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,550
Fine, fine. I won't ask this. I'll change the topic, is that all right?

58
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,590
In the past you were doing well, studying oil painting,

59
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:56,100
but for Mingxuan you insisted on switching to fashion design.

60
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,580
After you graduated, you cried, saying you wanted to work at Mingyuan.

61
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,840
I didn't agree at that time but what did you say?

62
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,230
"I am willing to work at Mingyuan, no matter what difficulties I encounter in the future,

63
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,180
I definitely won't retreat."

64
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,060
Xia Xueling, is that what you said?

65
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,810
That is the promise you gave me then, right?

66
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,560
Yes. That is what I said.

67
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,170
Then, how are you going to explain now?

68
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:24,520
You encountered a little difficulty, and you took your suitcase with you as you left.

69
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,250
Are you trying to be a deserter?

70
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,670
Is that it? Tell me.

71
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,220
Our child has just come back, can't you say less?

72
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,670
Is she still a child now? She is an adult.

73
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,590
Right now, she is Mingyuan's Design Director.

74
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:41,180
It is not important as to whether or not she is my daughter.

75
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,860
She encountered a little difficulty and just ran.

76
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,800
Xia Xueling, do you think what you are doing is proper?

77
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,300
Xueling must have suffered injustice at Mingyuan,

78
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,120
so she did that.

79
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,680
She must have encountered a problem she could not solve, so she left.

80
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,730
It is all that Tang Mingxuan's fault. Our Xueling worked by his side for so many years—

81
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,060
Stop, stop!

82
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,950
Right now I am talking about work with Xueling.

83
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,420
If you want to listen, that's fine. If you want to say those things, then go upstairs.

84
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,900
- It is all one matter!
- How is it one matter?!

85
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,850
- It is one matter!
- How is it one matter?

86
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,520
If it weren't for Tang Mingxuan, would our Xueling go work at Mingyuan?!

87
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,290
Right now, I am asking her what her relationship with Tang Mingxuan is, yet she's not willing to answer.

88
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,340
You keep saying, "Don't ask! Don't ask," yet now

89
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,880
- you are mentioning Tang Mingxuan—
- Enough! Stop arguing!

90
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,140
It is all my fault, okay?!

91
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,880
I caused you two to worry!

92
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,210
Back then it was my decision to go work at Mingyuan.

93
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,990
Now also, I won't give up easily.

94
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,940
Xueling, if you are not happy working at Mingyuan,

95
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,270
then let's not go. I'll make the decision for you.

96
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,720
What decision are you making? You. Go upstairs right now.

97
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,580
- Why should I go upstairs?
-This—
- Enough, Mom.

98
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,640
Dad is not wrong. I am wrong in this matter.

99
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,120
As an adult, I should not have left without a word.

100
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,320
I will go to work tomorrow.

101
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,080
Look at you!

102
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,800
Look to what extent you have forced her!

103
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,290
What did I force her to do?!

104
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:16,120
All day it is "Mingyuan, Mingyuan, work, work!"

105
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,930
You also saw what attitude Tang Mingxuan had when he came!

106
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,870
Tang Mingxuan can not care about my daughter.

107
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,820
But Xueling is your daughter!

108
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,790
You also don't care about her?!

109
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,040
In this family, do you want to be in charge?!

110
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,740
- Do you want to be in charge?
- So unreasonable.

111
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,360
Then be in charge. Be in charge.

112
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,630
Solve everything!

113
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,030
It'll be great if only you can solve everything.

114
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,970
Hello, Director Xia.

115
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,980
Director Xia!

116
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,540
Director Xia, where have you been? Everyone's been asking.

117
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,680
That's right.

118
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,270
I was at the hospital for acute appendicitis and had a small surgery.

119
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:07,490
Then, why didn't you tell us? We should've visited.

120
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:13,700
It was very sudden. Besides, I don't like people seeing me weak at the hospital.

121
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,780
By the way, Liu Pei is still on leave.

122
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,010
You all split her work.

123
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,680
Okay.

124
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,360
Brother Xuan, do you know...

125
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,970
Do you know that Director Xia got acute appendicitis?

126
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,030
She didn't come a few days ago because she had surgery.

127
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:43,390
She is now at the design office. That's what all the colleagues said.

128
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,150
I know.

129
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,790
You know?

130
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,860
Director Xia must have told you beforehand.

131
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,260
I was thinking no wonder you're—

132
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,710
Why do you have so much to say?

133
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:00,140
I just wanted to tell you.

134
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,370
I'll leave now.

135
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,880
Appendicitis surgery.

136
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,280
Can't believe she would come up with that.

137
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,680
Are you Miss Mo?

138
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,740
You are?

139
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,460
People call me Uncle Zhong. You can call me that as well.

140
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,990
- How can I help you?
- I'm here to see Xiaoyu.

141
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:37,650
I've been looking for him the whole day and haven't seen him. Do you know where he is?

142
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:42,190
I don't know. But you can ask Li Qi. They're often together.

143
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,130
I've asked everyone I can think of.

144
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,450
I've also looked everywhere.

145
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,430
However, I haven't found him.

146
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,560
But I really have no idea where he is. I'm really sorry.

147
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,170
I'll be leaving now.

148
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:00,450
Just one minute, Miss Mo. It's like this.

149
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:04,460
It's Fang Xiaoyu's birthday today.

150
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,540
His relationship with his dad hasn't been very good.

151
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,990
Today his dad would like to celebrate his birthday with him,

152
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:17,260
so they can be together and repair their relationship.

153
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,990
Well, if I run into him,

154
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,930
I'll let him know. However, I have to go to school now.

155
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,390
All right. Thank you.

156
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,090
Bye-bye, Uncle Zhong.

This is none of my business.

00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,190
I shouldn't say anything.

00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:05,780
I've invited a special guest,

163
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,190
Fang Xiaoyu.

164
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:13,820
Everyone knows about the company he works at, Cayman.

165
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,600
You all probably

166
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,360
also know of Mr. Fang.

167
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,810
Among the outstanding designers

168
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:25,410
at Cayman Group,

169
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:28,450
he's the youngest.

170
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:32,790
He excels in Chinoiserie designs and produced a series of research work in that aspect.

171
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:36,080
It's a series of remarkable works.

172
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,230
All right then, I won't keep talking.

173
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,800
At this time, I present Mr. Fang Xiaoyu.

174
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,900
Mo Fei, you're not a true friend. How can you not tell me Fang Xiaoyu is the lecturer?

175
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,630
I didn't know either.

176
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:00,020
André mentioned Chinoiserie just now.

177
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:05,160
Therefore, today I will explain what Chinoiserie is.

178
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,130
What are the elements in the true Chinoiserie?

179
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:15,920
In recent years, Chinoiserie has become popular on the world stage.

[WIN AN IPAD PRO]

181
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,730
Are you waiting for me?

182
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,420
That was a very good lecture.

183
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,010
Then please give me good reviews. Thanks.

184
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,710
- There is actually something I want to tell you.
- Go ahead.

185
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:33,980
I met an Uncle Zhong on my way to school.

186
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,830
Is that what you want to tell me?

187
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,540
Let's change the topic.

188
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,480
Fang.

189
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,360
Your speech was very enlightening.

190
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,380
I would like to treat you and the students to dinner tonight.

191
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,590
Dinner tonight...

192
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,990
I will get going first.

193
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,260
Mo Fei, please wait a little.

194
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,390
There wasn't enough time. The students want to discuss with you more.

195
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:05,130
They asked me to let them have more time with you.

196
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:08,240
Please, don't disappoint them.

197
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,970
Mo Fei, join us.

198
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,410
- I go as well?
- Yes, we'll all go together.

199
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,400
Wow.

200
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,300
- Please sit.
- All right, I'll sit here then.

201
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,940
So, my dear Fang,

202
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,440
please choose what you want to eat.

203
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,190
Since you are the one treating us, you should choose.

204
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:55,260
Listen, I want to thank you for the lecture today.

205
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:59,470
So, it is my pleasure to treat you. You choose whatever you want to eat.

206
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,140
Why are you so generous today?

207
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,030
Guess.

208
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:19,030
My dear Fang, today is your birthday.

209
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:22,030
To you, a great designer,

210
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,960
I wish you unlimited creativity.

211
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,750
Even though you are not in China, but as your friend, I don't want you to feel lonely here.

212
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,530
All of us are here to celebrate your birthday.

213
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:36,160
Mr. Fang, you can make a wish and then blow out the candles.

214
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:42,060
- ♪ Happy Birthday to You! Happy Birthday to You! ♪
- Thank you, thank you.

215
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,720
♪ Happy Birthday to You... ♪

216
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,510
What's happened? Was I mistaken?

217
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,060
Isn't today his birthday?

218
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:16,590
You don't even know how awkward it was for André when you left.

219
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,000
I don't really appreciate what André did in there.

220
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,500
I don't want to celebrate my birthday at all.

221
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,650
So... is that why you don't answer Uncle Zhong's calls?

222
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,260
Yes.

223
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:44,450
When my mom was still here, she, me and my sister,

224
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:49,140
the three of us always celebrated our birthdays together. After my mom passed,

225
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,140
it has just been me and my sister.

226
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:56,590
For the past three years, even my younger sister has not been with me.

227
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,560
So I don't like to celebrate my birthday now.

228
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,190
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

229
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:09,660
Today, I was indeed in the wrong.

230
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,700
Tomorrow, I will apologize to André.

231
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:21,150
I heard that restaurant makes delicious fish.

232
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,700
Yes. You should've eaten it before leaving.

233
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:34,370
How about... I gift you a fish?

234
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,480
You know how to cook?

Your craftsmanship is not bad.

237
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,610
Compared to your drawings, I'm a bit lacking.

238
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,070
I wish you a long, healthy life

239
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,570
as well as an abundance of "fish" (wealth).

Thank you. I will definitely keep it safe.

241
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:30,590
Well... I'll head inside first. Happy birthday.

I know you are with Tang Mingxuan now.

00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:45,700
I just hope you won't be a stranger to me from now on,

245

avoiding me.

246
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:57,130
Since you brought it up, I want to have a good chat with you.

247

Yes, I'm with Mingxuan.

And I care about him.

Because I care about him,

I have been avoiding you.

253
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:17,220
I just don't want to cause any unnecessary trouble

254

Am I... that bad compared to him?

256
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,240
You are an outstanding designer

as well as a good friend.

258
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,820
You are just as good as him in every way.

259
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:42,330
However, the feelings cannot be compared to each other.

260

I admit that I admire your talent very much.

Xiaoyu, didn't I call you a few days ago to tell you to come home for dinner?

269
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:39,260
The chairman is still waiting for you at home.

270
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,130
When did I agree to do that? Why don't I remember agreeing to it?

271
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:48,120
This child. How many times have I come up these stairs today?

272
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,290
I came to pick you up early this morning

273
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,440
but you were nowhere to be found.

274
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,130
You also didn't answer my calls.

275

My old bones...

276
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:02,140
have suffered because of you.

Uncle Zhong, how are you old?

278
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,820
You are still strong.

279
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,490
When will you grow up?

280
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:16,150
Hurry and come home with me!

281
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:20,130
I haven't eaten all day. I also said I won't go back.

282
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:23,930
Xiaoyu, listen to me.

283
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:27,090
The chairman went home very early today just to have dinner with you.

284
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,400
If you don't go,

285
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,070
he'll be very upset.

286
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:37,880
Uncle Zhong, I respect you as an elder.

287
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:42,590
Can you not ask me to do things I can't accept, every time you see me?

288
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:46,120
Xiaoyu, don't be like this.

289
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,370
Your father has been hurting

290
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,020
all these years, too.

291
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,600
Hurting?

292
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,990
Why can't I see that?

293
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,390
He seems to be living quite happily with his wife.

294
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,410
Quite carefree.

295
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,880
Xiaoyu, when are you

296
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,500
ever going to let it go?

297
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,230
How many times have I already told you?

298
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:18,400
Your mother's death had nothing to do with the chairman.

299
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,930
Otherwise, your uncles

300
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:26,050
would never have let him off so easy. Isn't that right?

301
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,420
No one was more devastated than the chairman

302
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,710
when it happened.

303
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:36,320
You didn't see how heartbroken he was, holding your mom in his arms.

304
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,780
Is there any meaning to say all that now?

305
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,320
Mom is gone and he has someone new.

306
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,610
Tell him to live his life well. Why come and see me?

307
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,030
Go back and tell him

308
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,180
I won't go back to have dinner with him.

309
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,360
Tell him to take care.

310
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,920
After my mom passed, I haven't liked celebrating my birthday.

311
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:07,260
- But I've told you all...
- Uncle Zhong, I've told you, please return.

312
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,400
I've said all that I should.

313
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:03,200
- You are back.
- Yes. You're still up?

314
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,910
You still couldn't persuade him to come back?

315
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,680
He still isn't willing to come back.

316
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,330
I tried to persuade him tonight.

317
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:18,020
He still cannot unravel the knot in his heart.

318
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:22,880
I'm thinking... Should you find time,

319
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,570
sit down, and have a good chat with him?

320
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,040
Chat about what?

321
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,370
What is there to chat about?

322
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:39,290
He still thinks that I have wronged his mother.

323
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,070
I've been with you for so many years.

324
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,980
I completely understand how you are feeling.

325
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,800
But as they say,

326
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,390
"The one who tied the bell is the only one to untangle it."

327
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,450
The knot in his heart

328
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:54,360
needs you to unravel it.

329
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,290
What do you say?

330
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,600
We'll see.

331
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,470
Knowing he's fine puts me at ease.

332
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,860
I'll worry about the rest in the future.

333
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,290
- I'm going to bed.
- All right. Goodnight, Chairman.

334
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,960
Cousin, something happened!

335
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,360
- Look.
- In such a panic, what is it?

336
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,790
[Fang Xiaoyu: Finally, on my birthday, I can forget all the unhappiness and receive a handwoven gift from the person I like.]

337
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:33,680
Isn't a birthday gift very normal?

338
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,210
It's Fang Xiaoyu. Aren't you angry?

339
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:38,840
Your girlfriend is about to be stolen.

340
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,280
If you love someone, you must trust them.

341
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,160
Such a child!

342
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:49,760
Yang Guang.

343
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:53,760
Didn't I tell you to come pick me up at 7:00 a.m.? Where are you?

344
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:03,810
I'm sorry, Brother Xuan. I... came late.

345
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,850
It's just that before I left, I had diarrhea.

346
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,760
So...

347
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,360
Brother Xuan, how about y-you scold me?

348
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,060
You can also hit me. You being like this...

349
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,100
makes me uncomfortable.

350
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:24,410
You were 17 minutes late and have spouted nonsense for 3 minutes.

351
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,360
Yang Guang,

352
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,160
what do you think about us taking your salary and using it to pay

353
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,200
for a company retreat?

354
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,920
I was wrong.

355
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:58,470
[Mo Fei: Are you busy today? I miss you.]

If you were with me, that would be great.

368
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,770
Originally, I wanted to send a message to you.

369
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:02,760
But I was afraid you'd be busy. It's fine though!

370
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,140
I can say it to you here.

371
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,630
Today...

372
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,600
Mo Fei.

373
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,720
- I want to talk to you about what happened tonight.
- What happened?

374
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:19,400
Don't play dumb. About Fang Xiaoyu, of course.

375
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,600
Do you know why he left?

376
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,720
- How would I know?
- Don't give me that.

377
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,520
Tell me. I'm dying of curiosity.

378
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,990
André was being nice, trying to celebrate his birthday

379
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:34,280
so why did he leave?

380
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,050
I-It's like this.

381
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,970
Fang Xiaoyu came to our school to give a lecture today.

382
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:57,550
It happened to be his birthday.

383
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:00,100
Then André invited the students

384
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,450
to dinner to celebrate his birthday together.

385
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,720
Guess what happened in the end.

386
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,200
When he found out, he left.

387
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,250
Then it was especially awkward.

388
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:14,520
After dinner, on my way home, I ran into him on the stairs.

389
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,150
Thinking of how he saved us that day

390
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,090
and I didn't do much to repay him,

391
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,830
I just casually used Chinese knots to braid a fish

392
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,570
for him as a birthday gift.

393
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,970
I don't know if you would mind

394
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,890
that I gave Fang Xiaoyu a birthday gift.

395
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:35,080
If you mind, I won't do it again.

396
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,200
[Good girl.]

397
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:58,080
What is this?

398
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,700
You're so busy yet you still have time to be jealous.

399
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,560
So petty!

400
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,320
Petty, petty!

401
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,720
Lu Zhu! Slow down.

402
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,110
Who told you to follow me?

403
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,780
At least tell me why you are mad.

404
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,510
Could it be that you've gained weight?

405
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:31,930
Are you looking for death?

406
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,890
You're cursing me.

407
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:36,860
- Did I?
- You're cursing me to gain weight.

408
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,900
T-That was because I didn't know and took a wild guess.

409
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,400
Why don't you just tell me?

410
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:46,290
Did you have drinks with Kitty? And even sang with her.

411
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,560
Yes. Didn't I invite you, but you didn't want to go?

412
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,640
You... Are you dumb?

413
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,980
What exactly is wrong?

414
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:00,800
I don't like her. Stop playing with her from now on.

415
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,560
- That's it?
- Yes.

416
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,930
Of course, I can do that. No problem. I'll promise you that.

417
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:09,800
Your silent treatment these days has been killing me.

418
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,610
- Really?
- Yes.

419
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:14,790
All right, I promise you. So don't be angry, okay?

420
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,910
I guess you're sensible.

421
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:25,220
You are not mad anymore, are you? What do you want to eat later? I'll take you.

422
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:30,360
You! What now?

423
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,180
You are famous!

424
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,790
Look! You're famous!

425
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:38,840
Lower your voice. It's just a magazine.

426
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,420
"A prodigy of homegrown male models."

427
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,120
Wow, such high praise.

428
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,760
T-This reporter is exaggerating. So embarrassing.

429
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,780
You really participated in the right event.

430
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,490
Girls nowadays all like contrast cuteness.
 (T/N: contradictory characteristics)

431
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:52,610
What cuteness?

432
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,250
Just like you.

433
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,560
On the runway, you're an ascetic male god.

434
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,640
Off the runway, you're a naturally cute puppy.

435
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,790
What is that? I have no idea what you are saying.

436
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,580
Such a straight male.

437
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:09,810
I'll just look at the magazine. I find the boy on the cover more appealing.

438
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:13,630
Really? Other people say he is cuter in person though.

439
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:18,350
Oh, right! Didn't someone recommend you to be an actor?

440
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:21,330
With this popularity, you definitely can.

441
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,540
A-An actor?

442
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,310
I don't really want to be that.

443
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,270
Why not?

444
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,690
I don't want to act in kissing scenes.

445
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,640
What?

446
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,380
My first kiss is still out there.

447
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:42,010
Student Mo Fan, are you that much a young girl?

448
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:47,920
Seriously though, an actor

449
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,580
has to pretend to be different people

450
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,850
and say all kinds of things. As for me...

451
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,510
I just want to be me.

452
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:57,040
So I'll stick to modeling.

453
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:02,440
Then... have you decided on the contract with Cayman?

454
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,720
I haven't decided.

455
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,290
But... I may need to talk to my sister when she's free.

456
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:12,530
Do you want the magazine or not, Miss? You've been looking at it for half a day now.

457
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:16,600
Yes, yes, yes! These and these. I want all of them. Do you have more in there?

458
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,480
- I'll buy however many you have.
- Seriously?

459
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,120
- Seriously, I want them all.
- Okay, okay.

460
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,710
Why are you buying so many?

461
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:25,240
For a keepsake, and to gift to everyone.

462
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,340
You made your family proud.

463
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,560
Made my family proud?

464
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,440
Yes.

465
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,220
Mingxuan, you said Miya

466
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:41,570
agreed to talk to the board about a collaboration.

467
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,970
The way I hear it,

468
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:47,350
there are issues.

469
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:51,130
It's like this. Miya indeed cannot make the decision herself.

470
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:53,550
They also need time to discuss it.

471
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:58,220
But SLC is interested indeed.

472
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:02,160
However, with my years of experience,

473
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,150
my gut tells me it's a trap.

474
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,310
They lead you on at first,

475
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:09,040
right? As well as let some news out.

476
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,490
They keep us hooked and just drag it on like this.

477
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:16,300
Why are they dragging this out when they want to collaborate?

478
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,230
I think there can only be one reason.

479
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:21,800
They want to raise the price.

480
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,550
At this moment,

481
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:30,620
there are better offers than ours.

482
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:35,790
We have to give them time to make a decision.

483
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:38,950
They are indeed doing just that.

484
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:43,260
This is considered... raising the price maliciously.

485
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,890
Mingxuan, it's not that SLC isn't good.

486
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:49,990
It's just a bit chaotic. How about we switch to another company?

487
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:54,520
Uncle Xia,

488
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,600
a project that was passed by the board of directors

489
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,000
is not a game of house. We can't just call it off.

490
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,250
As for SLC,

491
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,290
I won't take no for an answer.

492
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:13,330
Mingxuan, you are young but you didn't go into business just yesterday.

493
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:16,150
With regards to these things, you cannot act based on emotions.

494
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,720
What do you mean you won't take no for an answer?

495
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:22,610
If you continue like this, I think you won't be left with anything but failure.

496
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:26,080
Don't be so impatient, Old Xia.

497
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,660
Mingxuan is not someone

498
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,050
who acts irrationally.

499
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:33,760
SLC is an old French brand.

500
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,530
The word is out, so why wouldn't there be competition?

501
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:40,050
It means that our judgment is right.

502
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:43,040
We are on the right track.

503
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,120
I didn't say it's a bad idea

504
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,410
to acquire SLC.

505
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:51,040
Before the budget was approved, right?

506
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,070
But in this situation,

507
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:56,850
what will we do if they raise the price? If they do, I have no extra money to give.

508
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,280
That's right.

509
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,330
Uncle Xia, don't get worked up.

510
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:05,290
Let me think of a way.

511
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:07,960
I'll figure it out. All right?

512
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:12,920
All right. I'm sorry I was a bit worked up.

513
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,510
All right. Let's end the meeting, then.

514
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,060
- Hello, Director Xia.
- Hello.

515
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,610
Dad, what are you doing here?

516
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:30,990
I just got out of a meeting, so I came to see you while I was here.

517
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,370
- You designed this?
- Yes.

518
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,530
You designed all of these?

519
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:34,730
Of course.

520
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,620
Not bad.

521
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:42,020
- You guys were confirming the SLC acquisition, right?
- Yes.

522
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,860
How was it?

523
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,580
You designed this as well?

524
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,680
I asked you a question.

525
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:53,830
What do you think is going to come of this kind of meeting?

526
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,880
It's all a joke.

527
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,960
So you don't plan on increasing the budget?

528
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:04,910
Well, I think...

529
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,920
you just do your job.

530
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,090
Don't worry about the rest. Your dad is here.

531
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:19,110
I just want to know about the company's situation.

532
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:22,840
If you really want to know,

533
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,280
then you need to keep your composure right now.

534
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,610
Don't let your heart melt

535
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:33,440
just because someone said something. Right?

536
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,010
Listen to you. I didn't do anything.

537
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:39,120
I'm just afraid you're in a difficult position.

538
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,540
You're just afraid Tang Mingxuan is in a difficult position, right?

539
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:46,070
You scared me to death!

540
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:49,130
You and your little thoughts.

541
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:52,100
- Don't touch it.
- I know how to do it.

542
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:55,310
You are messing it up.

543
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:59,270
I'm actually not making things difficult for that brat on purpose.

544
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:03,040
The company is everyone's, not just the Tang family's.

545
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,350
Our Xia family has a part in it, too.

546
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:08,300
When I see problems, I must mention them.

547
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,930
I must make a stand

548
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:13,310
and stand by my principles. Right?

549
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,230
You're not listening.

550
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:21,290
Fine, I won't say anymore. By the way,

551
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:24,770
when you get off work, don't go home. Your Uncle Tang invited us to dinner.

552
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:26,960
Uncle Tang?

553
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,390
It wasn't Auntie Lu who wants to see me?

554
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:34,790
All right. Whatever. I'll see you tonight.

555
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:37,330
I'll walk you out.

556
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:43,550
What is it, Old Tang? Are you not feeling well again?

557
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,860
Just some small ailments one is bound to have.

558
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:51,010
But if you think I can't beat you while I'm on medication, you are wrong.

559
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:53,940
Feel free to concede any time.

560
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:57,230
What are you talking about? Let me take another look.

561
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:07,150
You're not in good condition today.

562
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:14,000
I can still beat you.

563
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,110
There.

564
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:17,150
Are you sure?

565
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,620
No regrets.

566
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,830
You are as competitive as you were when you were young.

567
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:24,040
I have a young attitude.

568
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,940
Because of that,

569
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,500
my body is better than yours.

570
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,310
I'm not the one who's on medication every day.

571
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:33,890
It's okay to be on medication. We are at that age.

572
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:38,320
It's better than being muddle-headed. Being muddle-headed is not good.

573
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,230
That's not fair, Old Tang.

574
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:49,250
Why chitchat when we're playing chess?

575
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,640
This doesn't count.

576
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,530
You just said "no regrets."

577
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:56,200
Let's stop playing. It uses a lot of brain energy.

578
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,600
One more round.

579
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,300
We've played our whole lives.

580
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:04,490
It's beautiful out there. Let's go for a walk.

581
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:07,340
Let me take another look.

582
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:10,290
Forget it. Come this way.

583
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:22,910
♫ I say you're an April day ♫

584
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:26,880
