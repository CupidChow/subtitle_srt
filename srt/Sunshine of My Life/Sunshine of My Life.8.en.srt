Miss Mo.

4
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:56,200
Miss Mo, these are gifts from Director Fang. He thinks

5
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,190
that your designs will be even more perfect with these. You must—

6
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,480
Stop talking.

7
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,870
Miss Mo, is there a problem?

8
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:08,680
What are you doing? Do you have hidden cameras and are you trying to play a joke on me?

9
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,490
No, Miss Mo. Don't think like that.

10
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:14,840
Then what should I think? What you are doing now is simply unreasonable!

11
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,300
- These are all from Director Fang–
- What's so unreasonable?

12
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:24,590
I think this jewelry is especially suitable for your designs.

13
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,950
Just try them.

14
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,480
Director Fang, are you really try to help me or ruin me?

15
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,380
H-How can you think like that? Of course, I am trying to help you.

16
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,640
You are trying to help me? So you brought all these here today to tell everyone

17
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,090
that you're opening a back door for me, right?

18
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,060
Director Fang, you have a very unique way of helping people.

19
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,480
That was really not what I meant.

20
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,340
- President Tang.
- President Tang.

21
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,040
Hello, President Tang.

22
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,780
What are you doing here?

23
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,340
Let me take a look.

24
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,760
Are you selling jewelry?

25
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,960
You brought a bouquet of flowers, too.

26
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,540
As a judge,

27
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,520
what are you here

28
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,230
to privately discuss with our designer?

29
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,500
Discuss her designs.

30
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,910
Also to visit my little Mo Fei.

31
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,750
Director Fang, don't talk nonsense.

32
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,070
Don't be shy. If you don't like these things,

33
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,700
I will choose better ones to deliver to your home.

34
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,790
Director Fang!

35
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,230
You're welcome.

36
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,300
I'm leaving now.

37
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,030
Wait.

38
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,030
Who did you say you were visiting?

39
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,600
Is there a problem?

40
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,830
I asked you, who did you say you were visiting?

41
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,530
My little Mo Fei.

42
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,000
You are a judge on a show I invested in.

43
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,530
She is a designer whom I selected.

44
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,290
The elevator that brought you up just now, and the 153,800 square meters of Mingyuan Building

45
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,630
that you are stepping on, all of these

46
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,210
belong to me, Tang Mingxuan.

47
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,980
Let me ask you, Fang Xiaoyu.

48
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,570
Here,

49
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,520
what single item belongs to you?

50
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,370
Do you know that you are only able to stand here because of my approval?

51
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,370
Let me tell you. If I don't approve,

52
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,930
you can't even step foot into this Mingyuan Building.

53
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,360
I have always thought that your education and talent

54
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,140
would not lead you to behave this way.

55
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,210
But it appears

56
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,300
that I can misjudge a person, too.

57
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,460
You're so serious.

58
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,920
Am I paying you all to watch a show?

59
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,190
Mo Fei, come with me.

60
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,350
What are you doing? President Tang!

61
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,610
What are you doing? Let me go!

62
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,110
- Get in.
- I won't.

63
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,070
Wait.

64
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,120
Psycho.

65
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,900
I told you to keep your distance from Fang Xiaoyu.

66
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,620
Why don't you listen to me?

67
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,260
When did I get close to him?

68
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,760
Also, he came to Mingyuan today on his own accord.

69
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,840
- I—
- You can refuse him.

70
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,830
Just because he is a judge, can he just fool around with you?

71
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,050
What do you mean fool around with me?

72
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,900
Didn't you see that I was rejecting him?

73
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,250
Do you think everyone is like you?

74
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,150
What's wrong with me?

75
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:47,540
You are so inconsiderate to others. Do you know how many people were there today?

76
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,610
Is there some misunderstanding between the two of you?

77
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:06,250
You two are never friendly when you see each other.

78
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,340
If there is any misunderstanding, you guys can talk it out—

79
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,870
You don't need to worry about what's between him and me.

80
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,800
What I want to discuss with you today is the problem between you and me.

81
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,230
Why are you so unreasonable?

82
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,090
I'm not reasonable?

83
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,840
Have you been attentively listening to what I'm saying?

84
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,350
I listen to what you say attentively day and night.

85
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,500
Can you pay some attention to my feelings?

86
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,980
When have you been listening to me attentively day and night?

87
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,650
Have I not?

it's not because I'm bothered by other men getting close to you and chasing you.

No, no! Why would I insult you?

Look over here. It didn't dye well. Here and here.

154
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,400
Big Sister, you were the one who insisted on using natural dye.

Being able to dye it to this degree is already a miracle.

156
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,600
From my perspective, you should use chemical dye. It'll dye faster.

When it comes to reasoning, I can't win over you.

163
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,600
But I am curious.

164
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,200
How are you aware of all that?

165
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,600
Before doing batik, I, of course, did my research.

166
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,600
Also, when I bought the dye, the teacher there told me.

167
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,800
My goodness.

168
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,400
In order to make this, how much work did you put in?

169
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,000
Since you're so devoted to Chinese art and design

170
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
you might as well forgo your studies in France. You can save some money that way, too.

171
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Those are two different matters. I'm going abroad to study.

172
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,400
Do you think foreigners can understand Chinese design?

173
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Think of it this way.

174
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,600
Gucci's latest season has many Chinese elements.

175
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,600
That's true.

176
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,800
Don't you think

177
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,600
that these traditional crafts are quite interesting?

178
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,800
It's indeed interesting, but it’s too much trouble.

179
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,200
Okay, Miss. You continue with your Ancient Tea Horse Road.

180
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,800
I'm going to work on my Tung Blossom at Sea.

181
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,000
Did you already think of a name?

182
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,800
Yes.

183
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,400
Tung Blossom at Sea. My design concept is

184
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,600
the Silk Road at sea. I'm going to use erythrina...

185
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,800
What is that expression of yours? I'm going to use erythrina's elements.

186
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,800
Isn't it great? Tung Blossom at Sea is appropriate and sounds nice.

187
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,400
Besides, our country

188
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,800
just so happens to be promoting the development of the Belt and Road initiative right now.

189
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,000
We should also contribute to our country.

190

Great!

191
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,100
But can you step away from me? You stink.

192
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,200
I don't stink.

193
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,800
Smell me!

194
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,800

Why are your dark circles so prominent? Did you get poor rest these past few days?

Oh, right, Brother Xuan. Today, you're scheduled to take a tour to see the participating designers.

Good work.

Teacher Liu Pei,

206
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,600
have you seen designer number seven, Mo Fei?

207
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,200
I haven't seen her since the last time she came.

Thank you, you've worked hard.

President Tang, are you here to see the designers again?

210
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,800
I know you guys work hard, so I came to see you all.

211

- Carry on.
- Okay.

What is it? Do you need something?

Does President Tang come to see the designers often?

217
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,400
President Tang comes by very often. He just left.

218
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,500
Let me tell you. President Tang is very concerned about this competition.

219
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,800
Did he say which contestants he likes more?

220
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,000
Let me think.

221
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,200
Numbers three, six,

Seven, well, it's Mo Fei.

- Drink some tea.
- Okay.

You must be tired after shopping all day.

How could I be tired with you, Auntie?

228
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,600
In the past, the elders would say having a son is best.

229
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,800
Now, from what I see, what's good about having a son?

230
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,200
A son isn't useful at all. Having a daughter like you is better.

- Auntie Lu, I'm your daughter, aren't I?
- Yes.

does he treat you well?

00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,310
There is one missing.

319
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,680
- Don't the judges know?
- Right.

320
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,290
Can you tell us what happened backstage just now?

321
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,490
Are there only four outfits?

322
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,680
To all the judges and audience, I'm very sorry.

323
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,980
There is a little flaw in my last outfit.

324
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,320
So, there are only four outfits being presented today.

325
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,560
The competition requires each designer to present five outfits.

326
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,040
But you have only presented four.

327
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,660
This is unfair to the other designers.

328
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,960
I'd rather lose the competition than

329
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,760
show a flawed work to everyone.

330
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,230
I really like the batik-dyed fabric that you used.

331
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,750
Batik-dyed fabric is a very well-known oriental element

332
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,400
of the Ancient Tea Horse Road,

333
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,330
But I think your batik craftsmanship isn't good enough.

334
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:00,740
In addition, the batik patterns can have more layers and details

335
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,000
that can make your batik patterns, clothing

336
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,480
as well as tailoring, more feminine and effective.

337
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,270
Thank you, judges. As for the fabric,

338
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:14,370
if I have time, I will do it better.

339
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:18,600
Can you show me the design drawing of your last outfit?

340
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,520
Yes.

341
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,430
- What a shame.
- This outfit is really not bad.

342
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:33,800
It is strongly influenced by not only fashion but also ethnicity.

343
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,400
- It's very good.
- The concept is good.

344
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,480
I really like this work of yours.

345
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,280
You have a unique concept.

346
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,920
But having a concept and carrying it out are two different matters.

347
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,360
I'll give you one more day. Can you complete it?

348
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,300
Could it be that the usually strict Director Fang

349
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,270
is changing the rules to keep a talent?

350
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,140
First of all, I would like to thank all the judges.

351
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,020
But one day isn't enough to restore it

352
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,520
or to make a new one.

353
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,440
Also, I don't think it would be fair to the other contestants.

354
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,350
To all the judges

355
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,850
and the audience here,

356
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:28,060
I would like to say sorry.

357
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,650
What happened?

358
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:16,840
How did the fifth one become flawed?

359
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,100
Where is the outfit?

360
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,800
The competition has already ended. I don't want to talk about it anymore.

361
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:39,120
Now is not the time to sulk and be difficult, do you understand?

362
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,160
As a judge, I have the right to know the truth.

363
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,390
I think you also want to know, right?

364
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:59,830
Today, there was someone vile enough to destroy a competitor's clothes.

365
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:03,330
As a judge, I'm very angry.

366
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,910
I hope everyone will help by recalling what happened today.

367
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:12,700
Today, was there anyone suspicious here backstage?

368
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:16,110
- Suspicious person?
- What suspicious person?

369
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,760
I think the suspect must still be here.

370
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,690
They must be here with us. Their motive is very simple.

371
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,590
They want to win.

372
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,390
With that motive in mind,

373
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,760
I think all of the designers here are suspicious.

374
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,890
- Impossible.
- How is that possible?

375
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,530
Where's Bai Xiaoman?

376
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:46,420
That's right! Have you seen Bai Xiaoman?

377
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:50,870
That Bai Xiaoman has been targeting Sister Mo Fei since the preliminary rounds.

378
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,770
It might just be her.

379
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:55,790
Also, she was the one who wore the outfit!

380
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:58,310
After destroying it, she ran away.

381
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:01,500
Lu Zhu, don't be making false accusations!

382
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:06,780
Director Fang, I think someone here wants to take the opportunity to frame me.

383
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:10,540
This person knows that Mo Fei and I don't have a good relationship.

384
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:14,920
They also knew I was supposed to wear this on stage.

385
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,210
So they are framing me.

386
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:22,010
- "A thief shouting, 'catch the thief.'"
- Watch what you say!

387
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,840
Who are you calling a "thief"?

388
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,800
Do you have evidence that I did this?

389
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,690
Do you have evidence that you didn't?

390
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,480

Fine! Show me your evidence!

394
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,600
I, Bai Xiaoman, will not just accept being falsely accused!

395
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,600
- Don't you keep—
- Lu Zhu!

396
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,870
Enough. We don't have evidence.

397
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,360
Stop pretending to be kind.

398
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,810
This matter must be investigated clearly; otherwise, it isn't over.

399

Enough, let me see what happened.

400
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,890
Today, from getting my hair done to putting makeup on,

401
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:04,770
I have been with everyone else.

402
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:08,720
You models from Team Seven saw that.

403

Where are the other models for Team Seven?

404

Say! Did you see Bai Xiaoman destroy the outfit?

405
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:22,920
Sister Xiaoman was indeed with us.

406
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:31,200
Think about it. Are you sure she was always with you?

407
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,790
Sister Xiaoman went to the changing room to change, so she wasn't with us then.

408
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:41,250
Everyone directly changed their clothes backstage.

409
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,220
Why did you go to the changing room?

410
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,890
Exactly. What else do you have to say?

411
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,390
Director Fang, it's really not me. It's really not me.

Can you believe me?

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,940
Bai Xiaoman, do you know what this outfit means to Mo Fei?

416
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:11,040
Do you know how much time and effort she spent on this piece for the competition?

417
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,560
Now, the outfit was destroyed before it even got on stage. How are you going to explain that?

418
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,550
- Bai Xiaoman, are you still not admitting to it?
- Shut up!

419
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:20,980
Mo Fei, from what I see, you purposely framed me. Right?

420
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,570
You've never liked me and you're always going against me!

How far do you want to push me until you're satisfied?

Bai Xiaoman, don't give us that bullshit!

431

Bai Xiaoman, there is indeed a conflict between us.

How could you hit someone?

What you need to do now is to not thank me, but to believe in me.

477
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:24,060
Believe that, as long as I'm by your side, I'll take care of everything for you.

478
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,820
Thank you. If there isn't anything else, I'll go back then.

479
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,650
Wait.

480
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,010
♫ You may miss me very much ♫

481
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:44,650
You had already left when I went to see you last night.

482
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:49,050
I packed up all the things you left behind. Take a look to see if everything is in here. If anything is missing,

483
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,580
I'll have them find it for you.

484

♫ Was given all to me ♫

485

486
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,920
Thanks.

487
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,920
I'm going then.

488
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,880

Sis, didn't you go for your morning run? Why did you bring so much stuff back?

499
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,680
Why are your eyes so red?

500
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,100
You didn't argue with President Tang downstairs, did you?

501
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,180
Did he bully you and make you cry?

502
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:31,520
How do you know it was President Tang? Did you see us just now?

503
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,520
I...

504
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,270
♫ Was given all to me ♫

505
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:37,690
Don't get upset when I tell you.

506
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:42,530
Actually... I saw him downstairs yesterday.

507
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,750
Yesterday?

508
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:48,940
♫ sincerely taken away? ♫

509
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:56,100

♫  I'll no longer bother ♫

511
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:05,080
I saw his car downstairs yesterday. President Tang didn't wait there all night for you, did he?

512
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,050
Did he come to see you about the incident at the competition?

513
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,840
Sister,

514
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:17,060
to be honest, President Tang really cares about you.

515
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:26,210
I'm going to work then. Get some rest.

516
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:28,070
Be safe.

517
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:34,210

519
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,260

525
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,240
Have you notified Bai Xiaoman not to come anymore?

526
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,820
I did notify her, but I don't know if she understood it.

527
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,710
- Forget about her for now.
- Sister Linda!

528
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:17,280
I'll go inside first.

529
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,440
Why are you here?

530
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,550
Sister Linda, I'd like to ask you about something.

531
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,860
Didn't Xiao Zhao explain it to you?

532
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,890
She did, b-but... there's no way I can accept her explanation.

533
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:30,600
There is no proof that I ruined Mo Fei's clothes, so why am I fired?

534
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,980
That's right. It's not clear right now.

535
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,590
But the problem is that, as a model,

536
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:39,900
you should know how deadly the accusation of destroying a designer's clothes is to a model's reputation.

537
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,690
Besides, the photo of you taking your clothes off is still up online.

538
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,490
How can I keep you?

539
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:49,810
No, Sister Linda, I'm innocent. I really was falsely accused.

540
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:54,490
Sister, you saw me progress little by little as a model. Please give me another chance.

541
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:56,010
Please plead for me, okay?

542
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,790
I really cannot help you.

543
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:59,780
- I really cant...
- It's useless to plead with Sister Linda.

544
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,250
I told her to fire you.

545
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:07,550
Sister Linda, you can go train those cuties of yours.

546
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,410
Let me take care of this problem.

547
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:11,150
Okay.

548
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,310
Come with me.

549
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,190
Fang Xiaoyu, let go of me.

550
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:28,420
Sure, then I'll get security to lead you out.

551
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,720
What must I say for you to believe me?

552
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,870
Mo Fei's ruined clothes really have nothing to do with me.

553
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:40,330
We've known each other for a while now. There's no one else here either.

554
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,230
Why not be honest with me?

555
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:44,560
You are not an idiot. Why don't you think about it?

556
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,730
What good does it do me if I destroyed the outfit?

557
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:49,410
You are not an idiot either.

558
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:53,050
Why don't you think about why I don't believe you?

559
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,430
It's probably because of Mo Fei.

560
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,420
She told you to treat me like this, right?

561
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,930
I came to Shanghai all on my own.

562
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:07,280
I have no prominent background or connections.

563
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,360
I relied only on myself. I worked so hard to get to where I am today.

564
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,490
Why are you all destroying me?

565
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:17,130
Why?

566
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,460
If I am fired by Cayman,

567
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,790
I really have nowhere to go.

568
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:30,680
You all have so much already.

569
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:34,850
Why do you want to destroy what someone else worked so hard to get?

570
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:39,170
Can you face your conscience by destroying me?

571
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,750
- Are you done?
- I haven't finished talking.

572
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:44,030
I really don't want to listen to you anymore.

573
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,850
You just want an answer, right?

574
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:52,020
Then let me tell you very clearly today.

575
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:56,120
We didn't destroy you. It's you who destroyed yourself.
