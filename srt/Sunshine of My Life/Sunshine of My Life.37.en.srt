00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,690
Dad, don't worry.

4
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,260
The exam results from today are in the drawer.

5
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,240
They all came back normal.

6
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,490
Go home soon and get some rest. Don't worry about anything.

7
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,910
Are you scared?

8
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,970
No.

9
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,040
I...

10
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,020
I feel that in the past,

11
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,390
I didn't take good care of you.

12
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,730
When you needed me the most,

13
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,360
I wasn't able to be by your side.

14
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,030
Dad, what are you saying?

15
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,910
How were you not by my side?

16
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,340
Do you remember the time when I went to a summer camp in third grade?

17
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,620
Back then, I told you that I missed you.

18
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,430
You rushed there overnight to see me.

19
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,440
Also, when I was going from elementary school to middle school,

20
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,630
I didn't do well on the exams, so I ran away from home.

21
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,190
It was you who found me right away.

22
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,610
During the college entrance exam, you were always by my side.

23
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,630
So you've always been a part of my life.

24
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:57,700
I was thinking, if back then...

25
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,560
I was able to persuade Tang Mingxuan into marrying you,

26
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,700
or if I had found you sooner,

27
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,770
you wouldn't be like this.

28
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,510
It's my fault.

29
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,220
I didn't fulfill my responsibility of protecting you and I've made you suffer so much.

30
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,210
I am sorry towards you.

31
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:23,290
Dad, how can all this be your fault?

32
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,870
Because you are my daughter.

33
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,440
I used to think that

34
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,690
it was Brother Mingxuan and Auntie Zhuang's fault,

35
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,680
as well as your fault.

36
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,670
But now, it seems to all be my fault.

37
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,610
I was unruly and immature back then.

38
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,830
At the time, I thought

39
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,070
everything I had was well-deserved.

40
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:55,360
Also, I couldn't accept the fact that Brother Mingxuan didn't love me.

41
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,750
Now that I look back on it,

42
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,300
I was so childish and laughable at that time.

43
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,650
Dad, if I were Brother Mingxuan,

44
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,520
I also wouldn't choose a girl like that.

45
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,240
You've grown up.

46
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,590
You've really grown up.

Give me a hug.

00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,010
You've really grown up now.

49
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,160
You even gave me a lecture.

50
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,000
I feel very happy.

51
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,510
Dad, if...

52
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,490
There's no if.

53
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,920
Dad, listen. In case...

54
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,020
There are no ifs in this case.

55
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,420
You will get better for sure. Okay?

56
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,630
Dad, can you hear me out?

57
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,250
I...

58
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,400
Okay, go ahead.

59

I'm just saying, in a scenario...

60
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,050
I still hope that...

61

you all can be well.

You, Brother,

63
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,650
and Auntie Zhuang can live well together.

Happily together.

65

Only then, I would know that I didn't come back in vain.

66
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,090
Can you promise me, Dad?

I promise you.

- I'll be okay tomorrow.

I'll get up tomorrow, get the surgery,

72

167
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,400
Wait.

168
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,060
Y-You're busy?

169
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,500
Have you seen enough?

170
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,500
No, then, continue to be busy.

171
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,800
I-I will be taking my leave.

172
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,560
Don't you feel very blissful like this?

173
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,900
What time is it?

174
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:41,030
When I just came, it was already 11:00.

175
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,540
Wait, how can Cheng Yang

176
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,300
make you work overtime with him this late?

177
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,800
I should be the one to ask you.

178
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,900
I have never forced my workers to work overtime.

179
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,400
Yes, you indeed have never forced them.

180
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,400
However, since the company's boss is here preparing for battle,

181
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,700
do you think that the workers dare to leave?

182
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,800
After this period of being busy,

183
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,100
I want to give the Design Department a big vacation.

184
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,200
For real?

185
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,400
I never make promises easily.

186
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,000
Then representing all of the workers in the Design Department,

187
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,200
thank you.

188
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,600
If you're on vacation, then where do you want to go?

189
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,000
There are a lot of places I want to go to.

190
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,800
For example?

191
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,400
But it is not with you.

192
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,600
If you don't go with me,

193
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,400
who do you want to go with?

194
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,000
It's not that. It is that the places I want to go to are very tough places.

195
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,400
You can't do it.

196
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,700
How do you know that I can't take hardships?

197
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,400
Okay, then let me ask you.

198
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,200
Can you sleep in a house with cockroaches?

199
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,000
No.

200
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,800
Then can you drink unfiltered water?

201
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,800
No.

202
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,500
Then can you...

203
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,600
not shower for 3 days?

204
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,800
Of course not.

205
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,800
That's why. How can we go together?

206
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,100
It's better if I go alone.

207
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,400
What are you doing?

208
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,400
Are you messing with me?

209
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,400
Tell me.

210
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,800
No.

211
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,000
Tell me. Where exactly do you want to go on vacation?

212
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,600
I really do want to go to many places,

213
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,300
but I really haven't decided.

214
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,700
Since you can't decide right now,

215
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,800
then let me first take you to a fun place for vacation.

216
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,800
Thank you for everyone's interest in our Mingyuan's

217
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,100
Symphony of Clouds and Mists fashion show.

218
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,000
I hope everyone will like it.

219
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Director Xia, may we take a few photos?

220
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,600
Sure.

221
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
You have worked hard, Director Xia.

222
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,000
Thank you.

223
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,600
Really. I apologize deeply for asking you to come here for the interview.

224
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,000
Because we have another interview later so...

225
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,600
It's all right, I can understand.

226
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,000
Thank you for your understanding.

227
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,800
I also thank you very much for accepting today's interview.

228
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,000
After we go back, we will write a good article.

229
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,900
You have worked hard.

230
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,200
Director Xia, you really are too polite.

231
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,800
Then... we'll meet at the show.

232
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,000
Okay, we'll meet then.

233
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,300
Xueling?

234
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,200
Yan Xu?

235
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,200
It really is you. Long time no see.

236
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,400
It really has been a long time since we have seen each other.

237
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
You are still so beautiful and charming.

238
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,000
You are not bad yourself. When did you come back?

239
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,800
I just came back.

240
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,600
Wait a moment for me.

241
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:50,670
Did you come to see the reporters, too?

242
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:52,940
Originally, I had an interview scheduled.

243
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,290
I just rescheduled it.

244
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,960
Then does that mean you stood the interviewer up?

245
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,840
I'll just let them have some free time.

246
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,380
We haven't seen each other for ages.

247
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:05,060
Shouldn't we sit down to chat for a bit?

248
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:08,670
Indeed, we haven't seen each other for a while. You've changed.

249
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,820
I've changed?

250
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,080
You're humorous now.

251
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,810
Actually, I've always had a sense of humor.

252
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:19,070
After all, we people from the northeast were born with a sense of humor. Right?

253
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:22,810
When we were in school, I was very nervous around you,

254
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,260
so I couldn't be humorous.

255
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,970
Why were you nervous? Did I look that scary?

256
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:32,410
- Didn't you know that I really liked you back then?
- What?

257
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,550
Did you really not know?

258
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,180
It's not surprising that you had no clue. At most, it was my one-sided crush.

259
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,880
You should've told me sooner.

260
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,860
Would anything be different?

261
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,180
Perhaps we could've taken things further.

262
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:53,800
Oh, no. If you say that, I will really start to regret it.

263
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:00,410
Are you married?

264
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,260
Do you have a boyfriend?

265
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,060
Not really.

266
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,210
That's good.

267
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:09,450
What's good about that?

268
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,180
I was saying this weather is very good.

269
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:16,190
When I left the house today, I was wondering why the sun was so dazzling today.

270
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:19,550
It turns out I'm supposed to bump into you today.

271
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:22,860
Not only have you become humorous, but you've also become a smooth talker.

272
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,270
I have not.

273
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,270
What are you planning to do being back in the country this time?

274
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,240
I've been invited to hold an art exhibition in Shanghai.

275
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,110
Really? Congratulations then.

276
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,370
I look forward to your attendance very much.

277
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,390
Okay, I'll go check it out.
 [Art Exhibition - Yan Xu]

278
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,570
I look forward to your evaluation.

279
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:50,230
When we were in school, you were known for your criticisms. The harsh ones.

280
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,320
Yet you still dare to hear them?

281
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,910
Good medicine tastes bitter.

282
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:57,000
When are you leaving then?

283
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:01,470
I was supposed to leave after the exhibition ends.

284
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:05,020
But my plans have changed now.

285
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,620
So when are you coming back?

286
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,520
I'm not sure yet.

287
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,750
Why haven't you bought the ticket yet? The price will go up.

288
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,100
I know, but I'm not sure about the time yet.

289
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,750
As for you, it's 3:00 a.m. where you're at so what's going on? Can you not sleep?

290
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,410
No. Isn't school starting soon?

291
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:36,820
I'm finishing my assignment. I don't dare sleep for even one minute.

292
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,350
The deadline is too tight.

293
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:42,210
By the way, how's your assignment going?

294
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,130
I haven't done it yet.

295
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,980
You still haven't done it?

296
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,220
School is starting in just a few days. Don't you want to graduate?

297
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:55,040
There're a lot of things going on at the company so I didn't have time to do it.

298
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,210
Please. This assignment will be recorded in our files.

299
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:01,770
What will you do if you can't graduate?

300
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:05,150
I know. After this show, I'll go back immediately,

301
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:08,220
and find the ramie to work on my assignment.

302
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,750
So, can I ask you to help me with something?

303
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:18,260
Stop. You don't want me to ask André for time off for you, right?

304
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:22,730
My beloved, how are you so smart?

305
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,450
So can you help me?

306
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:29,100
T-That... How do I ask our teacher that?

307
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,260
You are so smart. You'll have your ways for sure.

308
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,450
How about you tell him I'm sick?

309
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,550
All right? I beg you.

310
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:39,000
Fine, fine. I'll think of what to say to him.

311
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,890
But you have to come back as soon as possible.

312
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:43,440
Otherwise, I'll get another roommate.

313
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,850
You are the best. I have to go. I'm doing to be late for work. Bye-bye.

314
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:49,390
Once our new products enter the market,

315
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,360
we'll earn at least ¥100 million.

316
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,030
More than that. I think it'll be at least ¥200 to 300 million.

317
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:58,470
All right, let's make 100 million first.

318
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,350
I feel that our team can make it.

319
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,810
As for other teams, I'm not too sure.

320
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:05,820
Hey, who are you referring to?

321
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,920
I forgot you're not part of our team.

322
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,550
You are on Cheng Yang's team.

323
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:13,490
Let me tell you. Although Yu Xia went to Cheng Yang's team,

324
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:17,870
his heart is still with us. Right?

325
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,870
He's physically gone, but his heart has not moved.

326
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,990
Miss Bai, today's big show was very interesting.
[Press Conference for Product Launch]

327
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:27,400
Can you share more with us about your design concept?

328
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,170
- Sure.
- What's this?

329
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:33,520
Haiyao Group's theme of this season is "The one color of the water and sky (horizon at sea)."

330
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,960
We'll present low-key and elegant Chinese colors.

331
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:42,260
At the same time, we hope to showcase our Chinoiserie designs

332
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:46,920
that are as light as clouds and mist and not decorative as people may think

333
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,440
that is not suitable for wearing out.

334
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,000
What are your thoughts on Haiyao's future?

335
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,220
Today is just the beginning.

336
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,750
I believe that, in the future, our Haiyao

337
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,730
under my leadership,

338
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:06,230
will become bigger, stronger, and better. Thank you.

339
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:08,360
Thank you, Miss Bai.

340
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,900
I hope that everyone looks forward to better works from us.

341
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,440
Did they plagiarize part of it or everything?

342
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,930
Liu Pei already went to print it.

343
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,190
These are the photos my friend took at the launch. Take a look.

344
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,490
Cheng Yang.

345
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,330
Based on the photos,

346
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,990
they took everything.

347
00:27:55,990 --> 00:28:00,650
We've prepared so long for the big show yet it's all plagiarized out of nowhere.

348
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:03,220
It's also done so precisely.

349
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:07,840
Our company... has a mole.

350
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:12,040
The designs got leaked out from your team. Shouldn't you say something, Cheng Yang?

351
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,850
How many times have I said it? I don't know what happened.

352
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:17,880
I also want to know what happened.

353
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,360
What is that attitude of yours?

354
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,990
Who has access to these confidential files on your team?

355
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,120
Me.

356
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,620
And Mo Fei.

357
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,920
Then it must be you or Mo Fei who leaked it.

358
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,350
Otherwise, how could you explain this video?

359
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:39,150
The problem is I didn't do it!

360
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,460
Then it's Mo Fei.

361
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,650
Is saying that now helpful?

362
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:46,080
What's most important now is how we'll resolve this.

363
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,720
The priority now is to catch that mole.

364
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,480
If they can give the designs to others yesterday, then tomorrow, who knows what they can do—

365
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,030
As to who leaked our company's confidential information, I'll investigate it thoroughly.

366
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,890
I will treat everyone equally.

367
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,060
Notify the security department. From the start of the project until now,

368
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,890
get all the footage from all the cameras facing

369
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:11,980
Cheng Yang's studio. Liu Pei,

370
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,170
also notify the public relations department

371
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:17,920
to withdraw all the previous news article drafts. In addition, notify all big media

372
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:21,290
that our product launch will be postponed.

373
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:26,520
At the same time, have the network department check to see whether our computers have have been hacked.

374
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,910
Starting from now, get yourselves together.

375
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:31,110
Before the next product launch,

376
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,120
design all new products.

377
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,700
Okay, I'll handle it.

378
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:39,430
President Tang, about Cayman...

379
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:45,300
I'll go see Fang Xiaoyu and take care of the model situation.

380
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,390
What time does Miya's flight land in Shanghai tonight?

381
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:52,460
Tonight at 8:00 p.m.

382
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,980
Keep her itinerary the same.

383
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,930
But don't say a word about postponing the product launch.

384
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:04,720
I'll explain to her myself.

385
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,610
Does everyone understand what President Tang is saying?

386
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:13,510
Starting from now, do your job well

387
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:16,060
as well as cooperate with the company's investigation.

388
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,170
You may all go.

389
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:24,240
Cheng Yang and Mo Fei, stay.

390
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:40,120
The designs that were plagiarized,

391
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,990
were all from your team.

392
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,460
The product launch is tomorrow.

393
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,600
What does this mean?

394
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,300
The company will lose a lot of money.

395
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,390
Is this only about the money?

396
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,450
Aside from the money, there's also...

397
00:30:56,450 --> 00:31:00,690
As designers, your designs were plagiarized even before your works are publicized.

398
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:05,000
How is it different from going into battle tomorrow, and losing your weapons today?

399
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,050
President Tang, we wouldn't have casually shown our designs to others. Please believe us.

400
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:15,600
What happens after I believe in you? Can we have the press conference tomorrow as scheduled?

401
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:21,830
Before we find out what happened, Cheng Yang,

402
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:25,530
as the team leader, you take responsibility for it.

403
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:27,920
President Tang, I understand what you mean.

404
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:32,150
Regardless of whether the designs were leaked from me,

405
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:36,010
as the team leader, I can't evade the responsibility.

406
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:39,650
I am willing to accept any punishment the company gives me.

407
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,890
Write a reflection report and submit it to Director Xia tomorrow.

408
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,890
Okay.

409
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:51,190
You, too, Mo Fei.

410
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,890
You two didn't leak the design sketches.

411
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:06,910
Why should you two write the reflection reports?

412
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,400
Don't say childish things.

413
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,800
If we don't write it, who will? President Tang?

414
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,400
What do you mean by that?

415
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,000
I'm on your side.

416
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,200
There's you, too. Aren't you too nice to that President Tang?

417
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,030
You defend him in everything,

418
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,000
saying that whatever decisions he makes are correct.

419
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,600
You are his official girlfriend.

420
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,400
Not to mention that he didn't protect you.

421
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,600
He even made an example out of you.

422
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,400
Actually, I couldn't understand it at the beginning either.

423
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,600
But Cheng Yang convinced me otherwise.

424
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,000
The design leaks this time were all from our team

425
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
and only Cheng Yang and I have access.

426
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,700
So no matter what,

427
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,000
we are responsible.

428
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,400
Tang Mingxuan is so petty.

429
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,800
He could just have the press conference next time.

430
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,100
This is petty?

431
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,800
Do you know how much money the company will lose this time?

432
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,400
How much can it be? The venue fees, your salaries,

433
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,200
as well as those miscellaneous costs like model fees and stuff.

434
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,600
Duoduo, that's not how it's calculated.

435
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,000
The company is counting on this season's clothing to make a profit.

436
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,400
Also, there are other business matters.

437
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,800
For example, acquisitions. These are all affected.

438
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,400
If we have to come up with a specific number,

439
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,160
then it will be at least tens of millions.

440
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,100
Tens of millions?

441
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,800
And Tang Mingxuan didn't kill you two?

442
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,600
Oh my god.

443
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,500
Wait a minute.

444
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,600
Then, why do you have to submit your reflection report to Xia Xueling?

445
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,400
Doesn't he know about your relationship?

446
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,400
What is the meaning of that?

447
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,000
- Give me your cell phone.
- Hey, Duoduo.

448
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,100
- I'll ask him.
- Say what you should and don't say what you shouldn't.

449
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,000
Aren't you just trying to add fuel to the fire?

450
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
So you know there's a fire, right?

451
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,400
If there's no fire, how can I add fuel to it?

452
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,400
Let me tell you, Mo Fei. Don't write it.

453
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,400
Cheng Yang already wrote it, but you must not write it.

454
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,000
Actually, I don't care to whom I'll submit the reflection report.

455
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,150
You are too magnanimous.

456
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,800
I'll take responsibility for my mistakes.

457
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:32,740
That's enough. Cheers.

458
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,400
Mo Fei, I think that you continuing to make sacrifices

459
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:50,600
he won't appreciate it. You keep making sacrifices,

460
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,400
but he won't see them. If one day you stop,

461
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,600
he will even think that you're in the wrong. Don't be so silly.

462
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,000
Sis,

463
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,500
did you drink?

464
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,100
Did anyone look for me?

465
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,100
What?

466
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,800
Never mind.

467
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,900
Who would look for you so late at night?

468
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,800
Hey, can't you turn down the television?

469
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,400
I want to go to bed now. It's very loud.

470
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,800
"I have let down

471
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:51,200
the trust that the company had in me,

472
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:57,200
the expectations my superiors had for me, comma,

473
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:03,400
and the expectations my colleagues had for me, period."

474
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,800
Why am I like

475
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,700
an illiterate when writing a reflection report?

476
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,600
The report, the report. How do I write this report?

477
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,200
I can do this.

478
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Why was the scheduled product launch suddenly canceled?

479
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,400
What's the real reason?

480
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,000
You may have some misunderstandings.

481
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,360
We will not cancel the product launch. It's just postponed.

482
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,200
Regardless of the reason,

483
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,600
this shouldn't have happened, right?

484
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,100
I don't deny that.

485
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,200
Mr. Tang, even if I can understand your company's situation,

486
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,800
it is your company's problem

487
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,400
that has caused the press conference to be able to be held as scheduled.

488
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,300
Our previous framework agreement is useless now.

489
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,000
It's very regrettable that we cannot cooperate.

490
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,600
My assistant and I will return to France.

491
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,000
We must explain to our company

492
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,800
the reason for the termination of our cooperation.

493
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,800
First, as the person in charge of the company,

494
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,000
I must sincerely apologize to you.

495
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,300
However, there's a Chinese saying.

496
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,700
A misfortune might turn out to be a blessing in disguise.

497
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:57,200
I hope that when we hold our press conference again, we can invite you to come.

498
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,700
Then we can discuss the acquisition again.

499
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,400
Why are you here? Didn't you go to meet with Miya?

500
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,200
It'll be okay.

501
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,100
Everything will get better.

502
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:40,130
Don't worry.

503
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,390
Why are you here so late at night?

504
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,800
I didn't know how to write the reflection report.

505
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,200
So I came to walk around.

506
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,400
Do you not accept

507
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,900
the way I handled it?

508
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:15,150
If I say that I have no problem with it,

509
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,200
will you think I'm especially mature

510
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,400
and considerate?

511
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,900
No matter what you say,

512
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,100
you are an especially mature

513
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,600
and considerate woman.

514
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,600
I know this matter

515
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:45,200
has caused the company a huge loss.

516
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,800
What you did,

517
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,400
is just according to

518
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,400
the company rules.

519
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,000
Actually, I understand it 100 percent.

520
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:00,980
But as my boyfriend,

521
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,300
can you also understand me

522
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:07,840
even if only 10 percent?

523
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
♫ I say you're an April day ♫

524
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,200
♫ The sound of your laughter lights everything up ♫

525
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,600
♫ Even the spirit of a light breeze ♫

526
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:38,600
♫ In the midst of the brightness and beauty of spring,
shift as one would in a dance ♫

527
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:44,000
♫ You're the mist on a dry April day ♫

528
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,400
♫ The gentle breeze blown during dusk ♫

529
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,000
♫ The unintentional sparkle of the planetesimal ♫

530
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,800
♫ The fine rain that's sprinkled in front of the flower ♫

531
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,800
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

532
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,600
♫ Like a shy water lotus that bows to a cool breeze ♫

533
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:12,400
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

534
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,200
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫

535
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,800
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

536
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:29,000
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫

537
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,600
♫ You're like the ivory field after snowflakes ♫

538
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:46,000
♫ You're the round moon every night ♫

539
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,400
♫ You're the naïve ♫

540
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:55,000
♫ white lotus that floats on the water ripples of your dream ♫

541
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
♫ You're the flower blossoms of tree after tree ♫

542
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,600
♫ The swallow twittering within the beams ♫

543
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:09,800
♫ You are love, hope, and warmth ♫

544
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,800
♫ You're an April day ♫

545
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:18,400
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

546
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,200
♫ The bittersweet parting words of "take care" ♫

547
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:28,000
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

548
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:35,000
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫
