[Episode 30]

3
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,560
Uncle Fang.

4
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,120
Have a seat.

5
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:50,610
Yesterday... Yesterday, an American neurologist came to the hospital.

6
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,960
Did you ask him to come?

7
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,660
Yes.

8
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,800
On behalf of Qian Qian, I thank you for doing that.

9
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,100
But I will not be thankful.

10
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,680
I feel this is what you should do.

11
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,200
Uncle Fang, actually I did this only because I hope that Qian Qian gets better soon.

12
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,080
If you hope she gets better soon,

13
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,030
then you should accompany her to the hospital.

14
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,590
You are not willing, right?

15
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,110
No.

16
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,500
Right now, Qian Qian's mental state is really important. You have to know

17
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,720
her health is so poor, yet she traveled thousands of miles to come back to Shanghai

18
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,060
As to why, you should know.

19
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,700
All right, I won't say anymore, go and accompany Qian Qian.

20
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,860
[- See you at Cherry Blossom Noodles tonight.
- Okay.]

21
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,200
Mom, I'm heading out.

22
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,990
Wait.

23
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,270
Are you going on a date?

24
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,570
Come back earlier.

25
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,490
I'm leaving, bye-bye!

26
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,320
- For how many?
- Boss, for one.

27
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,520
Here, please come this way.

28
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,200
Here, have a seat. Please wait.

29
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,850
Miss, are you still not eating?

30
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,740
If you still don't eat, the noodles will become mush.

31
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,660
I'm going to wait a little longer.

32
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,620
- Waiting for your boyfriend?
- Yes.

33
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,850
Is he really busy lately?

34
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,240
He hasn't come here in a long time.

35
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,290
A while back, he did come once.

36
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,670
He ate a few bites in a rush and left.

37
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,860
If it wasn't because you came, I would've thought my skills weren't as good anymore.

38
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,990
No, no, the noodles are really delicious.

39
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,990
All right, then hurry up and eat. If you wait any longer, then it will not be good for your stomach.

40
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,100
Okay, thank you.

41
00:04:53,200 --> 00:05:00,400
[Tang Mingxuan: Mo Fei, I'm sorry, something came up so I can't make it today.]

42
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,970
He said he would come eat with me.

43
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,970
He stood me up again.

44
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,920
Miss, don't be angry at him.

45
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,840
It is not easy for young people these days.

46
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,180
They are busy at work, they have a lot of matters, their stress is high!

47
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,240
I am not angry at him, I know he is busy at work and has a lot of stress.

48
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,590
All right, good. Hurry and eat.

49
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,690
Qian Qian.

50
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,490
Brother Mingxuan, you're here.

51
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,100
How do you feel today?

52
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,780
Today, I feel much better.

53
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,410
I scared you that day, right?

54
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,840
Actually, it is not that serious.

55
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,920
Brother Mingxuan, hurry and sit.

56
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:12,890
Brother Mingxuan, have you been well these past few years?

57
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,360
I have been pretty good.

58
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,160
But you suddenly disappeared.

59
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,900
Why didn't you let us know where you went?

60
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,950
At first, it was on purpose.

61
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,560
I purposely didn't want you guys to find me.

62
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,280
But later on, I really was so busy I forgot.

63
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,470
After leaving this small world,

64
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,090
I realized there are so many things out there for me to care about,

65
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,270
for me to put effort in.

66
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,240
You probably don't know how worried we were about you.

67
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,590
Qian Qian.

68
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,030
Sister Xueling?

69
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,160
Mingxuan is also here?

70
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,870
Hurry and come.

71
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,200
How are you? Are you feeling a bit better today?

72
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,420
Much better.

73
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,120
What were you two chatting about, so happily?

74
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,790
Nothing much. We were just casually chatting.

75
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,950
Thank you for coming to see me today.

76
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,820
Of course.

77
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,620
Xueling,

78
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,750
when did you find out that Qian Qian came back?

79
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,300
I also found out not too long ago.

80
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,840
Then, she got admitted to the hospital.

81
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,310
Then, why didn't you tell me?

82
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,400
Now on, whenever I'm free, I'll come and see her.

83
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,660
When you are free from now on,

84
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,050
you should also come and see her often.

85
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,260
Actually, I can tell that you're still in Qian Qian's heart.

86
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,600
If you are not happy like this, she will also not be happy.

87
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:00,250
Also... Xiaoyu has a bad temper.

88
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,180
Right now, the Fang family must be really anxious.

89
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,040
If there is something I can help you with,

90
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,850
then tell me.

91
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,890
Why did you ask Tang Mingxuan to come over again?

92
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,000
What?

93
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,520
Why are you asking Tang Mingxuan to come over all the time?

94
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:03,250
Right now, I have already lost a son, I cannot lose my daughter.

95
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,950
Also, I only know,

96
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:13,040
right now, no matter in what aspect,

97
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,250
Tang Mingxuan can help Qian Qian.

98
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,980
Tang Mingxuan will only hurt Qian Qian.

99
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,920
Right now, Tang Mingxuan is still in Qian Qian's heart.

100
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,420
I won't allow anyone to hurt Qian Qian again.

101
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,960
Especially Tang Mingxuan.

102
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,430
You're here, Xiaoyu.

103
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,050
Uncle Zhong, look at my dad.

104
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,660
He always does things on his own accord.

105
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,780
Does he even think for Qian Qian?!

106
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,290
Are you talking about the matter that he looked for Tang Mingxuan?

107
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,590
Exactly!

108
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,860
I think...

109
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,570
Chairman also has good intentions.

110
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,020
You are all doing it for the good of Qian Qian, aren't you?

111
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,350
But he doesn't know what Qian Qian needs at all.

112
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:10,190
You're wrong. Chairman is the person who cares about you and Qian Qian the most.

113
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,680
When Qian Qian left home, Chairman got insomnia.

114
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,050
Right now, he has to take sleeping pills and headache pills in order to sleep every night.

115
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,700
Do you know that?

116
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,960
Let him continue his act.

117
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,530
What? Act? That is too much!

118
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,820
Xiaoyu! Xiaoyu!

119
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,190
Mo Fei, can you listen to what I have to say before leaving?

120
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,400
I am here to apologize.

121
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,380
Between us, there is nothing to say.

122
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,430
Don't come and bother me again. Thank you.

123
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,210
Sorry.

124
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,530
I know I was wrong that day.

125
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:57,220
It's because my younger sister was diagnosed with an incurable disease.

126
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,350
She doesn't have much time left.

127
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,340
So that day, when I came to know she was ill,

128
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,150
I felt bad and drank a lot of alcohol.

129
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,560
I said some things I shouldn't have.

130
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,160
So today, I sincerely want to apologize.

131
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,010
I'm sorry.

132
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,210
I also hope you can forgive me.

133
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,750
Is your sister the one you told me about in France?

134
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,780
Yes.

135
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:35,540
After my mother left me, my sister is my only relative.

136
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,980
For the past three years, she hasn't been by my side.

137
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,390
It wasn't easy for her to return.

138
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,520
I didn't think...

139
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,980
So, can you forgive me?

140
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:55,460
That day you were drunk so I didn't take it to heart.

141
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:59,530
I also hope that your sister will be well soon.

142
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,020
Thank you.

143
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,610
Thank you for being able to forgive me, Mo Fei.

144
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,580
Then, I-I'm going to go in now.

145
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,320
You can go back.

146
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,200
I will go to the hospital to continue to look after my sister, see you another day.

147
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,830
Bye-bye.

148
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,490
Right now, Haitian himself does not care about matters

149
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,030
and gave the company to a demon-like woman.

150
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,310
What should we do?

151
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:49,920
Right now, Zhu Haitian is completely

152
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,160
- a black sheep!
- Exactly.

153
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,220
Then, what should we do?

154
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,020
Sorry for making you elders wait.

155
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,770
Today, I invited all you elders here

156
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:12,620
to inform you about the work arrangement from now on.

157
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,080
We have worked here for a lifetime.

158
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,120
Now, we even need you to arrange.

159
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,220
Yes, right?

160
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,290
Uncle Qi, you misunderstood.

161
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,770
I am young so I don't know how to speak.

162
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:30,550
What I mean is, for future work,

163
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,960
I hope everyone can discuss

164
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,820
and help me.

165
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,490
- Director Bai, something happened.
- What happened?

166
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,880
It's all right! Everyone here is the company's elders, say it.

167
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,370
Our first order of fabric has been stolen by Mingyuan.

168
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:57,290
- How did this happen?
- I am also not too sure about the details.

169
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:02,020
That Mingyuan is such a bully. Do they think that there is no one here at Haiyao?

170
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,330
Exactly. We have to ask Haitian on this matter.

171
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,350
What exactly should we do?!

172
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:11,670
No need to ask Haitian. Obviously, we cannot allow others to bully us.

173
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:16,280
If Haiyao wants to vent their anger, only by snatching back a few types of fabric is not good enough.

174
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,670
Then... what you mean is...?

175
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:27,730
I believe Haiyao should host a new fashion conference openly

176
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,930
to dim Mingyuan's spotlight.

177
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,830
Director Bai, you just said you want to rely on the New Fashion Conference to dim Mingyuan's spotlight.

178
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:38,460
- Isn't that too risky?
- How is it risky? If I dare to say it, I naturally have my ways.

179
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,820
Director Bai, you did just take over, but you are not familiar with Haiyao.

180
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,060
What do you understand? Since I said it, I have my own plans.

181
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,120
Right! The thing I asked you to get news of, how is it?

182
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,530
Mingyuan's main controller is still Xia Xueling.

183
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,940
The other designers are still the same as before.

184
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,260
It is just that Songtang added Cheng Yang, who has Tang Mingxuan's support.

185
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,660
Also, Mo Fei, that Director Zhu wanted to sign.

186
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,180
Mo Fei? Isn't she in France?

187
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,590
Her again? Her spirit does not go away.

188
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:10,720
- Mo Fei.
- Yes?
- Thank you. It has been hard on you.

189
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,110
I've been exploited by you for so long, this thank you, I deserve it.

190
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,260
You're not modest at all, are you?

191
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,160
You don't even let me be a bit arrogant?

192
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,480
You can, I allow you to be a little arrogant today.

193
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,450
But to be honest,

194
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:29,980
without your help, I wouldn't have been able to finish the design this time so smoothly.

195
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,220
Our Water Colors...

196
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,260
is like the waves that captivate the eyes on a sunny day.

197
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:39,160
The beauty of design, it is incomparable.

198
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,160
But... objectively,

199
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,860
I feel that our work

200
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,370
is still a bit far from being the most beautiful in the world.

201
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,320
Where is it lacking?

202
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,980
It seems too perfect.

203
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,740
Isn't perfect good?

204
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,740
Do you like imperfect beauty?

205
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,350
What I mean is...

206
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,000
When designing clothing, we all hope that the clothing is perfect.

207
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,920
But in real art, there are actually imperfections.

208
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,690
For example, Venus de Milo's missing limbs.

209
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:13,610
Also, the original version of "Preface of the Poems Collection from the Orchid Pavilion."

210
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,470
That does make sense.

211
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,840
But fashion design is an art for people to wear.

212
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,870
Think about it, which consumer

213
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:24,510
does not wish that the clothing they wear is perfect?

214
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,540
What we are designing is an idea.

215
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,990
What we show is our attitude.

216
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,350
Consumers buying our clothing

217
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,840
are attracted to the life we envision.

218
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,380
All right, stop lecturing. Let's hurry and have a look inside.

219
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:45,870
I have an idea. I want to build a two-story stage here.

220
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,070
On the top level, it will be built

221
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,020
with the feel of a fairyland. There will be many window displays.

222
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,920
The models can stand at the display windows.

223
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,490
With a cloud ladder, it will feel

224
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:59,660
like the models are walking down from fairyland.

225
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,320
What do you think?

226
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,830
Mo Fei?

227
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,150
I feel like it is really dreamy.

228
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:12,590
But I feel it is better to use a musical form to present it.

229
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:15,410
With the imagery and context together,

230
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,680
it can express our Water Colors world more.

231
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,620
It is not a bad thought.

232
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,830
Have you thought of the theme?

233
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,210
Moonlight in the water.

234
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,280
Reality and your dream's reflection.

235
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,050
This time, don't we have four types of main clothes?

236
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,120
They will each represent spring, summer, autumn, and winter.

237
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,730
A rotation of the four seasons, and it can represent a person's life.

238
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,850
You are so awesome!

239
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,820
You scared me.

240
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,030
Why do you have so many good thoughts?

241
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,720
Can you two be more careful in a public place?

242
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,420
- Have you eaten?
- Cheng Yang.

243
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,180
Your plan is not bad.

244
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,090
It increases the meaning of the Water Colors concept.

245
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,390
But if it were to be presented, wouldn't the difficulty level be a little higher?

246
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,180
It really does seem like the difficulty is a bit more.

247
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,970
- Then...
- I'll help you in the future.

248
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,560
Work hard!

249
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:17,710
Xueling, come. Let's have a look at this side.

250
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,630
- All right, stop looking. We have to work.
- Okay.

251
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,080
Qian Qian, do you really want to give up on the surgery?

252
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,370
Your choice is too reckless!

253
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:58,420
Brother, don't be upset yet. Listen to me first.

254
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,160
Before I came back,

255
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,220
I already knew about my condition very well!

256
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,260
Before when I was at the Rescue Organization,

257
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,190
I saw this type of condition many times.

258
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,580
So, I know about my condition really well!

259
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,240
How big the risk of this surgery is,

260
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,280
how low the recovery rate is after surgery, I know!

261
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,470
Don't speak nonsense, okay?

262
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,680
I will find the best doctor in the world for you.

263
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,240
I will find the best medical team in the world!

264
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,790
So your anxiousness doesn't even exist.

265
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,650
The best doctor, although he can increase the length of my life,

266
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,480
but how about the quality of my life?

267
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,980
It will decrease in a straight line!

268
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,300
During surgery, even a very small mistake

269
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,010
can cause me to lose my hearing, eyesight, I can't see you,

270
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:44,850
- I can't hear you, I can't even feel you–
- I won't allow for that type of mistake to happen.

271
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,980
I also won't allow for that type of accident to occur.

272
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,280
Qian Qian.

273
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,980
You should believe in yourself.

274
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:00,680
For sure you can come off the surgery table.

275
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:05,060
Even if the surgery is a success,

276
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,430
there is still chemotherapy.

277
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,580
You know that I am afraid of pain the most.

278
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,890
I cannot endure the process, Brother.

279
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,380
Do you really want to give up?

280
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,410
I don't want to talk about these things.

281
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,880
The weather is not bad today.

282
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,180
Let's go out for a walk.

283
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:43,120
- Brother.
- Yes?
- Right now, I am already really happy.

284
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,070
Being like how I am right now,

285
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,780
I am really satisfied.

286
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,410
As for the rest, there are no other over-the-top requests.

287
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:54,530
What nonsense are you talking about? Whatever you want, I'll buy it for you.

288
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:58,110
You... You are worthy of everything in this world.

289
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,930
Anything you want is not considered over the top.

290
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:04,960
Brother, are you happy?

291
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:09,610
If you are happy, then I am happy.

292
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,920
This is not what I am talking about.

293
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,460
Is there someone that makes you happy?

294
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,570
Why do you suddenly ask this?

295
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,700
I am curious! Tell me.

296
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:31,470
I wish you live a long

297
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,730
and comfortable life.

298
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,260
No.

299
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,220
You are embarrassed. Looks like there is someone.

300
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,810
What does she do? Is she pretty?

301
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:46,300
This piece will need some jewelry.

302
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,520
That would make it perfect.

303
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,850
If you add anything else,

304
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:56,590
it would be too complicated and miss the point of the piece.

305
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,870
Do you think I'm that shallow?

306
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,630
Can't I like a talented girl

307
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,920
instead of a pretty girl?

308
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:09,310
So she is very talented.

309
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,580
Can't believe you tricked me. You are so bad.

310
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,890
Just tell me about her.

311
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:18,280
Look how bored I am in the hospital.

312
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,720
I'm bored to death.

313
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:24,090
You always think too much.

314
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,450
Didn't I just tell you?

315
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,580
Other than you,

316
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,490
no one else can bring me happiness.

317
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,270
That's why,

318
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:43,770
for my happiness, you need to take care of yourself.

319
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,960
You need to get better,

320
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,870
so you get to do more things

321
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:52,620
for yourself and me.

322
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:07,390
We are going to the hospital to see Fang Qian tomorrow. It's been decided.

323
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:15,250
I heard from Zhuang Yuerong that Fang Xiaoyu has been staying in the hospital.

324
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,620
He has such a bad tamper.

325
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,290
I think it's not good

326
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,350
for us to go.

327
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,810
We have to go even if it's bad.

328
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,910
We are the elders.

329
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:37,310
There's no need for us to visit the children.

330
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:40,760
You said you are an elder, so you need to look like one.

331
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,810
Don't you feel embarrassed?

332
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,770
I admit that I...

333
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,140
It has something to do with me,

334
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,560
but I've made up for my mistake.

335
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,610
I called the hospital and the specialists. We paid for all those.

336
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,860
I don't think we have to go.

337
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,600
- I know that you didn't mean it back then.
- That's right.

338
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,010
But you've done it anyway.

339
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,760
Right? Also, it was our fault.

340
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,510
No one has to go, but you have to.

341
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,260
Understand what I'm saying?

342
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,470
All right, it's been decided.

343
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,690
I will go then.

344
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:32,950
Models, look awake.

345
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:44,720
Mind your steps. Step on the same beat.

346
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,300
Light technician,

347
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,340
didn't I rehearse the lighting with you?

348
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:51,180
Why are the models' faces dark?

349
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,540
This is nice.

350
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,170
Lu Zhu, you were too fast.

351
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:00,590
Didn't I say no posing on that spot?

352
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:03,540
Is that Mo Fan's girlfriend?

353
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:07,050
They are in contact. I'm not sure either. Don't they look good together?

354
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:13,530
Kitty, didn't you eat? Didn't I give you time to eat?

355
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:18,580
That's my little brother. Isn't he handsome? Look at his long legs.

356
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,070
Mo Fan is handsome indeed.

357
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:24,120
He is so tall, then why are you...

358
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,500
What about me? My legs are long too.

359
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,110
Okay, all right.

360
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,930
Tell you what, we have nice DNA.

361
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,550
Both of us are excellent.

362
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,400
Come in.

363
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,590
Qian Qian.

364
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,600
- Uncle Tang! Auntie, you're here too.
- Hello.

365
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,310
I should've come a while ago.

366
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,740
How are you? Are you getting better?

367
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,970
I'm doing way better.

368
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,880
Auntie Lu.

369
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,990
Qian Qian, is the hospital taking good care of you?

370
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,450
They are.

371
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,700
That's good. We can feel at ease.

372
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,950
Qian Qian, Mingxuan told us

373
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:16,620
about your situation.

374
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,920
Don't feel burdened.

375
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,680
Medical science nowadays is very advanced now. You will be fine.

376
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,220
Uncle Tang, I'm not worried.

377
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,700
I think I'm fine right now.

378
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,160
Also, Brother Mingxuan comes to see me often.

379
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,210
He should be.

380
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,440
It's just that

381
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,240
we are sorry about what happened to you before.

382
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,730
Let bygones be bygones.

383
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,870
Good. Good.

384
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,830
If there's anything you need, you can tell me.

385
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,930
If you have any problems, I'll take care of them for you.

386
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,330
Thank you, Uncle Tang.

387
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,880
Thank you, Auntie Lu.

388
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,620
You are welcome.

389
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,450
Thank you, Brother Mingxuan.

390
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,300
- Be careful.
- All right.

391
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,590
Sister Mo Fei.

392
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,690
Why didn't you leave with them? You're still here?

393
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:18,400
I'm here to wait for Mo Fan. He is helping them carry things again.

394
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,160
- You worked so hard.
- Sister Mo Fei, is my cousin with you these days?

395
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,860
No, I haven't been able to find him lately.

396
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,600
That's strange. What's he up to?

397
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,530
He's always busy, isn't he?

398
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:32,680
But I can't find him at home either.

399
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:40,600
I get it. He must be working on something serious.

400
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,750
Once he's done, he will come to you.

401
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,880
Right, it must be it. That's right.

402
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,140
I didn't think of it as anything,

403
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,840
but hearing you trying to cover for him, it sounds like something is happening.

404
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,550
No, no, no. It's impossible.

405
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,610
Careful!

406
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,500
Oh my heavens!

407
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,320
You are bleeding! I'm so sorry! So sorry!

408
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,810
- It's okay.
- What do we do?

409
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:10,410
Let's go to the hospital. Let's go.

410
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,270
- It's done.
- Thank you, Doctor.

411
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,510
Sister Mo Fei, it must be painful.

412
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,800
I'm so sorry. It's all my fault.

413
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,350
All right, all right. It doesn't hurt at all.

414
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:29,650
Look. It's just a small wound.

415
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:33,020
Doctor, will there be a scar?

416
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,130
She can't have a scar there.

417
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,650
She will be fine. Also, in that spot,

418
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:40,180
even if there is a scar, you can have your bangs down.

419
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:43,010
But... she was hit hard.

420
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:46,660
Take her to get a CT scan and see if she has a concussion.

421
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,580
- All right. Thank you, Doctor.
-Thank you, Doctor.

422
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,730
- Let's go.
- Come on, let's go.

423
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,120
Excuse me. How much is this?

424
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,440
This is 6,000 yuan. The silk

425
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,590
is 2,000 and the jacket is 4,000.

426
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,580
Would you like to try them on?

427
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,410
I will look around. Thanks.

428
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,740
Why are they so expensive?

429
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,550
But it's pretty.

430
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,290
Shen Jiaxi?

431
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,570
Bai Xiaoman.

432
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:23,360
What a coincidence! I can't believe I ran into you here.

433
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,220
Forget about this one. Let's go next door and take a look at the customized pieces I ordered.

434
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,340
I'm here to look at

435
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:32,760
other designers' ideas.

436
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,620
I heard you are working at Mingyuan these days.

437
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,550
That's right.

438
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,510
That's so interesting.

439
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:44,530
You were such a good friend to Mo Fei.

440
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:47,400
She is about to marry your boss now.

441
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,710
Why are you so unlucky?

442
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:55,390
I'm teasing you. I was just kidding. Look how nervous you are.

443
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:58,710
I know you are kidding. I wasn't nervous.

444
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,620
Are you free later?

445
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,210
I want to look around more.

446
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,950
Stop checking this out. Come look at the customized pieces

447
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:12,190
and come to my place. You've never been to my place.

448
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:17,100
I still don't have someone to design my engagement dress.

449
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,100
Would you like to come and discuss it?

450
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,410
Might not be a good idea, Xiaoman.

451
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,060
What's wrong?

452
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,230
We've known each other for years.

453
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,530
Everyone knows that

454
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,310
other than Mo Fei, you are the most talented.

455
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,110
Don't push me away. Let's go.

456
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:34,800
Let's go.

457
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,240
Should I change my shoes?

458
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,370
No, it's okay.

459
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:47,180
I have a cleaning lady, so I won't be the one to clean it. Come in.

460
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,800
Auntie, get me two cups of tea.

461
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,460
And some fruit. I have a friend here.

462
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,800
Your place is so big.

463
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,340
The view is so nice.

464
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:08,790
From the look of the scan, there is no problem.

465
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:11,720
Do you feel dizzy?

466
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,410
It just feels a bit heavy.

467
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,550
I suggest you stay here for a few days.

468
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,080
Do I have to be hospitalized?

469
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,130
It would be safer for you to stay.

470
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,530
All right. Thank you, Doctor.

471
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,870
Good. I will go do the paper work.

472
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:28,150
Thank you, Doctor.

473
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,520
You need to get hospitalized? Is it that serious?

474
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:33,630
I have to tell my cousin and Mo Fan. They don't even know.

475
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,820
I forgot to tell them.

476
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,650
Lu Zhu, could you not tell them?

477
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:41,120
How can I not when it's this serious?

478
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,400
But... didn't you say that your cousin has been busy at work?

479
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,490
You are with Mo Fan all the time.

480
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:50,720
You know how hard he trains.

481
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,040
I don't want them to worry about me.

482
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:57,970
Also, the doctor said I'm fine. It's just a few days. Nothing serious.

483
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,980
All right?

484
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,880
Okay.

485
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,550
It's all my fault.

486
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,300
Stop it.

487
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,840
That's right. Haitian bought me these.

488
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,570
Thank you, Auntie.

489
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:16,890
I lost some weight recently.

490
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:20,040
Some of my clothes probably don't fit me anymore.

491
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,400
Do you like this one?

492
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,500
- This is the current season, right?
- Yes.

493
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,000
Try it.

494
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,400
- How do I look? Is it okay?
- Of course.

495
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,400
- It's yours.
- Thank you.

496
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,800
If you like,

497
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,100
this is also yours. It suits you.

498
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,400
Bai Xiaoman,

499
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,400
do you know what this piece means to Mo Fei?

500
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,400
Do you know how much time and effort she spent on this piece?

501
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,200
You messed it up before it hit the stage.

502
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,600
How do you want to explain it?

503
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,600
Xiaoman, you are so good to me.

504
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,600
I don't deserve it.

505
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,300
Forget it. Don't be like that.

506
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,600
But I am curious.

507
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,200
Are Mo Fei and you good friends?

508
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,800
Her boyfriend is second-generation rich.

509
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,800
Doesn't she take care of you?

510
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,600
She take care of me?

511
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,000
She doesn't even have nice things.

512
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,300
Is Tang Mingxuan that stingy?

513
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:34,200
I think she wants to have a poor girl image all the time.

514
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,600
She's adopting a long-term plan to secure something big.

515
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,400
But she won't be able to marry into the Tang family.

516
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,000
Why not?

517
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
She only has an empty title.

518
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,400
Xia Xueling is the actual one the family wants for a daughter-in-law.

519
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,800
Jiaxi, have you heard this saying?

520
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,800
A woman either needs to have lots of money,

521
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,000
or needs lots of love.

522
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,400
It's from Yi Shu, right?

523
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,200
It doesn't matter who said it.

524
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,100
The important thing is that there is an opportunity.

525
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,400
This opportunity can give you a lot of money.

526
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,800
But it depends on if you can catch it.

527
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,600
What opportunity?

528
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,990
Come out with me.

529
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,400
I don't care who called you here.

530
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,000
I hope you disappear from our family now.

531
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,200
Why?

532
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,800
She can only think of the pain you caused her when she sees you.

533
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,400
With her condition,

534
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,800
how can she take it?

535
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,000
All these years have passed.

536
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,400
Even she is fine now, why are you still not over it?

537
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,800
I admit that I wasn't mature enough when I rejected the marriage,

538
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,600
which hurt her heart.

539
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
But I do want to make it up to her.

540
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,600
Make it up to her? How?

541
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,800
How are you going to make up for the pain she has been through all these years?

542
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,400
The only thing I can do

543
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,600
is to care about her and keep her company.

544
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,000
Where were you before and why are you talking about it now?

545
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,600
This is the hospital. Let's not be too loud.

546
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,400
When you are thinking about the other woman,

547
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,800
have you thought about Mo Fei's feelings?

548
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,200
Does Mo Fei know anything about this?

549
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,100
Why do you always care about my relationship with Mo Fei?

550
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,400
If you really like Mo Fei, we can compete fairly.

551
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,200
You've hurt my sister.

552
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,800
I don't want you to hurt Mo Fei. Simple as that.

553
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,200
She is my girlfriend.

554
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,000
You never learn the boundaries.

555
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,200
I've said all I need to say. Do what's right for you.

556
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,800
When you are thinking about the other woman,

557
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,700
have you thought about Mo Fei's feelings?

558
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:15,100
You've hurt my sister. I don't want you to hurt Mo Fei.

559
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,300
Simple as that.

560
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,200
[Video call from Tang Mingxuan]
[Reject Call]

561
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,400
[This is urgent! Go to your cousin's room and stop him]

562
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,100
Hello?

563
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,350
Why did you hang up on me?

564
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,100
I'm in Suzhou right now. The reception was bad.

565
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,500
It was on and off.

566
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,600
Why are you in Suzhou all of a sudden?

567
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,500
Because...

568
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,800
Mo Fei.

569
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,900
I... I...

570
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:40,600
There is something I think I need to tell you right now.

571
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,400
Cousin, something is happening. It's urgent.

572
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,700
Look at you. You are nothing like a lady.

573
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,600
Don't you see I'm on the phone?

574
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,000
It's urgent!

575
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,300
You have to help me or I will be so worried!

576
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,200
Get out and close the door. I will come to you later.

577
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,800
Hello?

578
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,000
It was Lu Zhu.

579
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,200
I don't know what happened with her. It looks urgent.

580
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,000
How about I take a look at her and call you back later?

581
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,400
Of course. I'm tired and I want to go to bed.

582
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,600
We can talk another day. Don't worry about it.

583
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,200
Bye.

584
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,200
What a day.

585
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,200
Such a terrible day.

586
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,700
What do you need me for?

587
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,600
Actually, it was nothing.

588
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,930
I was just having a bet with Mo Fan

589
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:46,600
to see if I can get you out of the room.

590
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,200
Why are you being so random?

591
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,800
It's all his fault! It was his idea.

592
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,800
Yes, keep learning from him.

593
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,000
Sister Mo Fei, I got it.

594
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,400
If it wasn't for you, your cousin was going to scare me to death.

595
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,800
He has already scared me to death. You should have seen his face just now.

596
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,600
He looked like he was going to eat me.

597
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,900
Thank you, but I need your help with something else.

598
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,000
Of course. What is it?

599
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,800
I will give you my key and have you pick something up for me from my home.

600
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,000
Don't let Mo Fan find out though.

601
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,400
Got it. I got it.

602
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,200
I will get the key from you tomorrow.

603
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,600
Then I will go to your home. All right?
