[Episode 32]

3
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,300
Xiaoyu.

4
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,700
Why are you home so late?

5
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,400
Did you go drinking?

6
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,000
Your dad wants to sit down with you and chat.

7
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Uncle Zhong!

8
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,600
Forget it.

9
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,220
Okay.

10
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,990
Xiaoyu, Uncle will go upstairs with you.

11
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,200
Slow down!

12
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
You're light as a swallow.

13
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,400
You're sober now, right? You don't feel disgusted anymore?

14
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,800
Are you looking for a fight with me again?

15
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,200
You are not interested in the company's affairs,

16
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,100
yet you can be first place in getting drunk.

17
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,700
Why are you interfering so much?

18
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
How can I not interfere?

19
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,200
You're representing Cayman right now. You're representing the Fang family.

20
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,000
Don't you think it's embarrassing to do this?

21
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,400
Embarrassing again. Why is everything embarrassing?

22
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,600
Why do you... completely not think highly of me?

23
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,200
Whatever I do, you're not satisfied; you only care about your image.

24
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,200
I-I-I want to think highly of you.

25
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,300
However, think about it yourself. Look back.

26
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,400
In these past three years, did you do anything that made me think highly of you?

27
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,200
Give me a few examples.

28
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
- Come on.
- Yes.

29
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,700
I am not like you, working day and night at work.

30
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,600
But what I am capable of, everyone can see.

31
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,000
Ansel believes in me. Cayman believes in me.

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,700
Only you question me!

33
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,800
Why would they believe in you?! Not because you're my son?

34
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,600
- From your attitude,
- Isn't it that our Fang family

35
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,400
- who'll believe you?!
- should be unlucky except you?

36
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,800
- Who do you think you are?!
- Brother!

37
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,500
- Brother!
- What do they see you as?!

38
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,600
Stop arguing. How can you talk to Dad like this?

39
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Look at what he said.

40
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,000
You think of him as Dad, has he thought of you as his daughter?

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You are already this ill and you are asking me to work for him at the company to make money.

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
In his eyes, there is only work.

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,400
He doesn't even care about you.

44
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,000
Talking about yourself is enough! Why are you getting your sister involved?!

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,600
Who am I doing this for?!

46
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,700
Say less.

47
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,300
The kids have just come home.

48
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,600
It is so hard to come back for a meal, what are you doing?

49
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,200
Okay, don't be angry, don't be angry.

50
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,600
Don't be angry, don't be angry. I'm sorry.

51
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,490
Xiaoyu, breakfast is done. Can you guys go up to eat first?

52
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,900
- Go eat.
- I'm going to work.

53
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,000
I'll eat at the company.

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,500
Brother!

55
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,800
- Dad.
- I am full from anger. You guys go eat.

56
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,500
Come in.

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,600
I heard Yang Guang say you didn't eat lunch again.

58
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,500
You really are my savior, I was about to starve to death.

59
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,600
What?

60
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
I went to the hospital to see Qian Qian.

61
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,300
How is she?

62
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,000
Her mental state is all right.

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,800
But I persuaded her for half a day and she still isn't willing to undergo surgery.

64
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,020
Since she was young, she has been so stubborn.

65
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,230
We'll think of another way to persuade her.

66
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,400
But I persuaded her for half a day, she probably took in some of the things I said.

67
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,600
Life is at stake no matter what; we have to fight.

68
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,740
If you have the time, visit her more.

69
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,600
It is also not too good for me to go.

70
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,400
It is really coincidental. Every time I go, I see Xiaoyu.

71
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,400
Then every time I go, he says the same things to blame me.

72
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,800
Don't worry.

73
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,800
This type of small matter, I can still share the burden with you.

74
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,600
I'll go visit her frequently to persuade her to have surgery soon.

75
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Don't worry too much.

76
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,330
Does Mo Fei know that Qian Qian came back?

77
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,630
I will find a time...

78
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,750
to tell her.

79
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,100
After Qian Qian came back,

80
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,800
I can feel that, although she tries to be positive,

81
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,800
in her heart, she is still a little depressed.

82
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,600
I am afraid that if she knows about Mo Fei...

83
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,200
would it provoke her?

84
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,800
I don't have any other intention.

85
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,400
I am only suggesting it to you,

86
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,400
it is better to not let them know about one another for now.

87
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,800
Or else, I am afraid her health...

88
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,200
Eat first, I'm going to leave first.

89
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,200
I am really sorry.

90
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,400
I asked you to accompany me.

91
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,200
It's all right, I also coincidentally came out for a walk.

92
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,800
Because in China I really don't have many friends.

93
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,200
So, I wanted to ask you out.

94
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,400
It's all right, you can find me whenever you like.

95
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,900
Can I ask you, isn't your illness already cured?

96
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,300
Why are you still—

97
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,000
My brother, he is worried about me.

98
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,800
So I have to ask her to accompany me.

99
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,000
I think your brother really cares too much about you.

100
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You say you are already so big and he is so strict with you.

101
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,500
Yes, I especially envy you and your family’s free life.

102
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,200
Unlike me, who has been protected by my brother since I was young.

103
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,000
When I was young, I didn't even ride on a public bus.

104
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,400
Really?

105
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,800
Yes. So three years ago, I made a decision

106
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,500
to be a liaison officer in World Without Borders.

107
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,400
You are so cool. I envy you.

108
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,800
- The coolest are those doctors.
- Hello.

109
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Hello, Doctor Xiao. All right.

110
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,100
Alice, Doctor Xiao asked if you have decided on a time for the surgery.

111
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,600
Hello, Doctor Xiao.

112
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,200
Yes.

113
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,400
I have not decided yet.

114
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,900
I will tell my brother.

115
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,400
Thank you.

116
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:16,170
You still have to have surgery?

117
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,600
A small surgery.

118
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,200
Right now, the doctors and my family are persuading me.

119
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,200
But I really don't want to do it.

120
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,900
Why not?

121
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,500
My house is ahead, how about you come and visit?

122
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,700
- Sure, let's go.
- Let's go.

123
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,640
Your house is so cool!

124
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
It is so cute!

125
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,600
Mo Fei, did you make all of these fox dolls?

126
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,000
Yeah.

127
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,800
Here, have some water.

128
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
Do you like it? If you like it, I'll give you one.

129
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,200
Thank you.

130
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,000
If there is something you really like, I can specially customize one for you.

131
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,300
- Really?
- Yes.

132
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,200
Then, I like Princess Belle.

133
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,000
Princess Belle?

134
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,200
Then I will make you a small Princess Belle doll for you.

135
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,000
That is great!

136
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,400
It's all right.

137
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:26,000
Actually, I also like Princess Belle the most.

138
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,400
Why?

139
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,900
Because she is really courageous and fearless.

140
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,200
No matter how big of an obstacle there is up ahead,

141
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,200
she is very sure of her goal.

142
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,800
So you have to learn from her.

143
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,400
When you encounter any difficulties, don't be afraid.

144
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:47,100
You have to believe that after these difficulties, there'll be a blue sky.

145
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,800
- Let's go, have a seat.
- Okay.

146
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,100
Come here and have a seat together.

147
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,400
Be careful.

148
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,400
Fang Xiaoyu.

149
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,800
What time is it already? Why are you only coming to work now?

150
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,200
Do you know how worried I am about you?!

151
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Sister, it's not like you don't know.

152
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,200
Right now, I cannot be at ease to think of these things.

153
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,800
Okay.

154
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,400
I can understand your feelings.

155
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,200
But in logic, I hope for yourself

156
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,200
and Cayman, you think more for them.

157
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,800
Have you heard rumors that Shanghai Cayman is being acquired by another company?

158
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,000
That Manager Hu.

159
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,800
Every day he is trying to form relationships with the higher and lower levels.

160
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,400
I think during this time of changing the president, he wants to use this opportunity

161
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,600
to push you down.

162
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,200
Who's the president changing to?

163
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,800
Why don't I know?

164
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,000
Even you don't know?

165
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,400
How should I know? I am just giving you a reminder

166
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,300
to not take advantage of the chaos, then to be tripped into a hole, and not even realize it!

167
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:56,400
It's not like it's the first day he is causing trouble.

168
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,790
I also don't have time and energy to care about him too much.

169
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,870
At most... at most I'll resign.

170
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,910
Cayman's Chief Talented Designer, Fang Xiaoyu.

171
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,430
How would I be worried?

172
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,250
If it is not possible, I'll open a studio.

173
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,630
Those who are at ease will not suffer from this anger.

174
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,660
Fang Xiaoyu.

175
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,480
Are you trying to piss me off?

176
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:23,090
I am afraid that you get ruined because of the words proud and arrogant!

177
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,920
I know you are a genius.

178
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,320
All geniuses are proud and arrogant.

179
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,430
But being proud and arrogant, it hurts others and oneself.

180
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,020
Good thing the batik concept helped you win one round.

181
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,680
It can temporarily hold them back for a while.

182
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,150
I have been in this profession for many years!

183
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:42,170
I know my own capability well.

184
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,780
But Sister, I still have to thank you.

185
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:56,950
During the time I was the most down, you were the only one who did not give up on me.

186
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,810
You also pulled me back to Shanghai with force.

187
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,850
I won't disappoint you.

188
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:06,130
What are you doing? It is so cheesy.

189
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:09,030
If there is anything, just tell me.

190
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,500
Sure, let's have a drink tonight.

191
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,140
- You're treating?
- Of course.

192
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,750
Why is it you again?

193
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,750
Why can't it be me?

194
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,630
What place do you think Cayman is? For you to come in and out as you please?

195
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,180
How did you come in here this time?

196
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,010
From my position at Haiyao right now,

197
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,070
of course I was invited in here.

198
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,090
I looked for you to collaborate.

199
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,860
Why is it collaboration again? How many times have I told you?

200
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,380
The matter of collaborating is not up to me.

201
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,610
Walk straight ahead, turn left.

202
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:58,960
That is Manager Hu's office, you've seen him before, right? Just look for him.

203
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,240
No.

204
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,700
I am going to look for you.

205
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,380
Who asked you to bump into me earlier?

206
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,180
Do you see? Both CCTVs can capture it.

207
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,950
- You want to deny?
- I don't care.

208
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:19,440
Anyways if you don't care about me, I'm going to look for you everyday.

209
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,700
Let's go to the meeting room.

210
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:36,150
You really are amazing, I have to admit.

211
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,680
Last time in Paris when you talked about collaboration with me,

212
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,650
I didn't think you would have the status you have now.

213
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,460
I am the one who really is amazed.

214
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,470
Zhu Haitian's family, they all seem like they want to swallow me.

215
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,850
Everyday they are thinking of ways to get rid of me.

216
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,690
Who did I offend?

217
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,690
I'm being killed unjustly.

218
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,730
What does what you're saying have to do with me?

219
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:04,490
Of course it relates to you. If you collaborate with me,

220
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,290
then I can stand up to the Zhu Family.

221
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,690
Whether you stand or not, how does that relate to me?

222
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,220
I know Cayman wants to move their other businesses

223
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,920
from France to China.

224
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,500
But, this also involves design,

225
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,800
manufacture, as well as sales.

226
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,170
With Director Fang here, the design aspect

227
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,440
does not to be worried about for sure.

228
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,990
But from what I know,

229
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:38,580
up to this day, Cayman has not found a suitable collaboration partner in China.

230
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,630
The offline segments are not as strong.

231
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,430
And our Haiyao is relatively mature in

232
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,920
both production and sales.

233
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,210
Then we can collaborate and fight off everything.

234
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,100
Even Mingyuan.

235
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,900
Of course, I came to Cayman not only because of your resources.

236
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,030
Most importantly, I want to help you–

237
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,840
I have already repeated these words many times.

238
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,890
I have already told you, our Cayman will not collaborate with Haiyao.

239
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,760
I also don't have this power.

240
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,010
Do you still not understand?

241
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,710
Why don't you have this power?

242
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,890
I am just a designer.

243
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:24,620
I only am in charge of the aspect of designing, I don't have control over others.

244
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,600
Bai Xiaoman, have you forgotten what you once did?

245
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,590
If I collaborate with you, then is my brain broken?

246
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,150
Wasn't that all a misunderstanding?

247
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,570
It was all because of Mo Fei creating difficulties.

248
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,900
If it weren't for her, we might have already–

249
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,800
Why did you think I have to please Zhu Haitian?

250
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,580
Isn't it because of you?

251
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:50,820
I want to stand at the same height as you, that way I can be closer to you.

252
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,590
You don't need to do this again, okay?

253
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,520
Right now I am making time to listen to your unreliable words.

254
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,590
I am already really kind.

255
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,090
Okay, even if you don't look

256
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,890
at my feelings towards you for so many years,

257
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,360
as long as you agree to collaborate with Haiyao, I'll give you whatever you want.

258
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,460
Stocks, money, even the whole of Haiyao.

259
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,050
I don't mind giving you all of it.

260
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,120
Today, it really is a scholar who met a soldier.
(Idiom: it’s impossible to communicate with an ignorant person)

261
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,790
Bai Xiaoman, what words of mine do you not understand?

262
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:24,420
I don't have the right to make the final decision, understood?

263
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,670
Why don't you have the right?

264
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,790
Right now you are Cayman's Crown Prince.

265
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:32,020
Your dad has already acquired Cayman.

266
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,000
Can't you change your reason for rejecting me?

267
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,960
What did you say? What did my dad do?

268
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,200
I said, your dad has acquired Cayman.

269
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,660
Right now, the whole company is your family's.

270
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,250
Don't tell me you don't know.

271
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,220
Xiao, this time, you being the Design Director,

272
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,120
has been decided by all of the design department.

273
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,190
Even if your dad is the new chairman,

274
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,930
it cannot impact the design department's ultimate decision.

275
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,100
We are looking at the perspective

276
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,770
as professionals to see who will be the Design Director.

277
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,630
My friend, do you understand?

278
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,360
So you also knew about this?

279
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:17,230
Ansel, it looks like I

280
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,460
don't know you too well.

281
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,860
Before, I was thinking,

282
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:27,040
why would you ask a designer that has wasted three years to be the Design Director?

283
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:31,370
I thought that in our relationship there was a little friendship.

284
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:33,240
If it weren't for my dad's relationship,

285
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,650
you probably wouldn't try so hard to make the higher levels agree?

286
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,640
It looks like I am too naive.

287
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,540
I believed that you really liked my product!

288
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,520
Xiao, I-I-

289
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,730
I am really sorry, I really e–

290
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,950
I heard that you acquired Cayman?

291
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,570
What?

292
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,340
I am asking you, is it true?

293
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,720
It is true.

294
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,930
Why did you keep it a secret from me?

295
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,330
It isn't that I wanted to keep it from you, it is when did you ever care?

296
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:19,710
Besides, what company I am buying,

297
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,830
- I have to ask for your opinion first?
- All right.

298
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,590
Then you asked the department to make me the Design Director,

299
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,360
you have to ask me, right?

300
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,430
Why did you do this for?

301
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,120
Why did I do this?

302
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,760
Wasn't it for your good?

303
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,000
I don't hope that my son has nothing accomplished.

304
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:48,590
Do you know? These past years I have watched helplessly at Tang Mingxuan

305
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,720
getting better at this profession with time.

306
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,030
Have you looked at yourself?

307
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,760
You have wasted three years, and you have no accomplishment.

308
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,970
You even say that you want to fight with Tang Mingxuan.

309
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:02,320
What do you have to fight him with? Fight my ass.

310
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,390
You want me to be embarrassed right?

311
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,990
Then don't acknowledge me as your son!

312
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,670
I don't need you to pretend to be thinking about me,

313
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,640
then profit for yourself! I don't need that!

314
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,890
Why? Why? Why can't you understand my effort?

315
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:27,920
I am your dad! I am doing everything in consideration of you!

316
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,260
I acquired Cayman also for you!

317
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,860
So that your future road will be much better, more smooth!

318
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,930
- Then for me–
- Am I harming you?!

319
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,490
If you are doing it for me, then what did you do before?!

320
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:41,070
What did you do before?! You think I am a pain right?

321
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,330
All right, I'm leaving, okay?!

322
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,230
Stand there!

323
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:50,710
Useless thing, you only know how to run when you encounter things!

324
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,790
You still want to fight with Tang Mingxuan?!

325
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,460
What do you have to compete with him?!

326
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:59,060
- Why do you keep on mentioning him for?!
- What do you have to compete with him?!

327
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,970
I want you to be President!

328
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,220
Not for you to be a designer!

329
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,200
Can you not compare me with Tang Mingxuan?! Why do you keep comparing me with him?!

330
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,360
- I hate that the iron does not become steel!
- Can you not touch me?!

331
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,170
- What are you doing?!
- Can you stop touching me?!

332
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,210
- Why do you keep touching me for?!
- Qian Qian fainted!

333
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:16,290
Qian Qian fainted! Hurry!

334
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,270
Right now, the patient's blood pressure is really high.

335
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:22,190
Her intracranial pressure is also really high. If she has surgery now,

336
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,660
then there will be some risks for sure.

337
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,800
But the patient is still very young.

338
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,560
Her other functions are also very normal, and she is really strong and positive.

339
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,880
So we feel that this surgery is still worth taking the risk.

340
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,010
We have all seen her scans.

341
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:40,820
Her tumor's location is really not good.

342
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,320
There is a high chance she'll become blind.

343
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,670
Saving her life first is more important.

344
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,840
What am I talking about is not only becoming blind.

345
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,560
If this surgery is not a success, she may not be able to leave the surgery table.

346
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,760
I-It's not like I can see

347
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,690
her live every day with painkiller shots.

348
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:13,860
Mr. Fang, what the doctors are thinking is also right.

349
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,320
With Fang Qian's current condition, there really is danger in this surgery.

350
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,780
But we can control her blood pressure and intracranial pressure first.

351
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,530
So in this surgery, there is still some hope.

352
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,360
These conditions and risks,

353
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,260
I hope that you and your family can be prepared.

354
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,720
Is my trial next door over?

355
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,690
What are you talking about? What trial?

356
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,200
Your face is so pale!

357
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,140
Is it?

358
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,720
Have they sentenced me to the death penalty?

359
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,890
You shouldn't say nonsense, okay?

360
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,470
Then I will talk about other things, will you listen to me?

361
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,850
As long as you stop saying nonsense,

362
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,180
I will listen to anything you have to say.

363
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:50,820
Brother... please stop being mad at Dad.

364
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,700
Could you?

365
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,310
Dad didn't have any malicious intentions when he acquired Cayman.

366
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:12,010
You have misunderstood him.

367
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,930
The thing I am most concerned about right now is your condition.

368
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:20,080
I hope you can recover. I do not care about anything else besides that!

369
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,630
But I don't want to see how you give up your own life for my sake!

370
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:26,920
Besides that, I know what you did because of me during the last three years.

371
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:31,480
Do you know how sad and guilty I feel deep down inside?

372
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,300
Brother, we are siblings.

373
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,450
Siblings should care for each other,

374
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:39,190
not tie each other down. Am I wrong?

375
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,530
Brother, please let go of your grudge.

376
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:57,640
Stop arguing with Dad because of the past.

377
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,520
Okay?

378
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,670
I guarantee...

379
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:08,870
that I won't ever let you witness that again.

380
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:19,520
Don't worry. Your brother will not allow it to happen again.

381
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,810
I will accomplish things

382
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,490
and make you be proud of me.

383
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,200
Okay!

384
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,620
Director Xia, were you looking for me?

385
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,960
Jiaxi, I want you to help me order a bouquet.

386
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,460
Is it a gift for someone? For a man or for a woman? Does this person have any preference?

387
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,740
Why are you asking that for?

388
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,900
If it's a girl, I will get her lilies or crane flowers.

389
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,210
If it's for a guy, I will get him orchids or bamboo.

390
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:50,950
- If it's–
- Director Fang's sister.

391
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:53,680
Oh, by the way. Please help me to write a card as well.

392
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,140
What do you want to write in it?

393
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,590
Write... Wishing you a speedy recovery!

394
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:01,000
She got ill? What disease?

395
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,510
Is that a question you should ask?

396
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:06,450
I am sorry, I asked too much.

397
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:09,530
- Then I will be going.
- Get back to work.

398
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:38,810
Brother Mingxuan. Sister Xueling. Thank you for coming to see me.

399
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:41,830
You have brought me such a beautiful bouquet.

400
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:46,180
I am sure you will like it.

401
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:49,190
We bumped into each other at the bookstore and came together to see you.

402
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:52,040
We were even checking out this book at the same time.
 [The Shadow Thief]

403
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,220
But he was an early bird.

404
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,020
Just by looking at the title I already know it'll be a good read.

405
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,420
Thank you, Brother Mingxuan.

406
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,410
I am happy you like it.

407
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,220
But... ever since I got ill...

408
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,530
I have been in a bad condition.

409
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:15,270
I am always tired. Therefore, I don't know when I will be able to read this book.

410
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:25,840
Don't worry about it. When I have time, I will come and read it for you. Okay?

411
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,540
Okay, but I am afraid it will affect your work.

412
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,290
I can find some free time.

413
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:35,590
If he doesn't have time, I can come and read it for you.

414
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:39,330
But... you can't leave me disappointed!

415
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:45,500
How could I? Just that...

416
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,020
I don't want to distract you from work.

417
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:51,830
Don't think that way! If we are overwhelmed by our work affairs,

418
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:54,340
then you will be the savior of MIngyuan's employees.

419
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:57,470
Perhaps they will also present offerings to you!

420
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:02,560
I just remembered something from childhood.

421
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,100
Do you still remember? When we were little, my brother and Mingxuan

422
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,900
would play hide-and-seek with me. And once, while they were looking for me,

423
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,330
they got stung by bees and their eyes got so swollen!

424
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:16,340
I remember, because of this, they couldn't attend classes for a few days!

425
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,750
You are laughing about it, but you don't know that ever since then,

426
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,660
whenever I see bees,

427
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,650
I feel traumatized.

428
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,430
But...

429
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,260
when we were little,

430
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,160
all four of us would chat and laugh together.

431
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,320
But now... my brother is not joining us.

432
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:39,020
Qian Qian...

433
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:42,160
Your brother and he are both hot-headed.

434
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,400
Haven't they been like that ever since they were little? Often arguing and making up?

435
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,320
Now you just have to get well. Afterward, they will also make up.

436
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:54,390
Right. Let's travel abroad together after you get well.

437
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:57,630
We will also invite your brother.

438
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:00,160
For real? It sounds so good!

439
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,200
When has your brother Mingxuan ever lied to you?

440
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:22,790
I didn't think we would think about the same gift.

441
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,000
We have grown up together,

442
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,950
of course we know what she likes.

443
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,750
Right. No matter what happens,

444
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,630
she will forever be like a little sister in our hearts.

445
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:41,180
It is very difficult to let go of this kind of connection.

446
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:45,950
Have you noticed that after we grew up,

447
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:48,060
there are so many things that changed?

448
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,250
I really hope now,

449
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:00,170
that she will get well soon.

450
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:03,570
Yes, it's been a while since I acquired Cayman.

451
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:07,630
Yet, I haven't had the chance to meet all of you.

452
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:10,660
Mostly because, first of all...

453
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,980
I am sorry. I just got caught up in some issues.

454
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:17,320
Secondly, because the timing wasn't right, so

455
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,450
that's the reason we are having this meeting only today.

456
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,860
Anyway, I will take advantage of today's timing.

457
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,920
I can finally meet you formally.

458
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:29,490
All right. Next, I will ask Deputy General Manager Hu

459
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:32,050
to host the meeting.

460
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:39,720
Everyone, there are three main reasons the chairman planned this meeting.

461
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,000
The first reason is, you shouldn't have any misgivings.

462
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,810
As the Fang Group is busy proceeding with the legal formalities for purchasing Cayman,

463
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:49,060
stabilizing each department, and making the transition as smooth as possible.

464
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:54,260
The second reason is, the chairman wants to make an important announcement regarding job appointments. Please.

465
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:01,690
I organized today's meeting to make an announcement regarding job appointments.

466
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:04,720
From today on, Design Director Fang Xiaoyu

467
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:10,060
will also be the Deputy General Manager of Cayman China.

468
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,790
Xiaoyu, listen to me!

469
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:21,070
Your father promoting you to the position of Deputy General Manager of Cayman China is for your own good.

470
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,960
For my own good?

471
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,630
He has never taken me seriously before!

472
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:29,000
And now out of nowhere I am assigned to this position?

473
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,580
Who the hell thinks it's for my own good?

474
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,140
You think I could not find other outstanding candidates to take on this position?

475
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,250
I am telling you, there are so many of them out there.

476
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,250
I am assigning you to this position,

477
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,630
so you can get accustomed to the new business.

478
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:47,190
Only this way can you easily take my position in the future.

479
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:50,990
Look at Qian Qian's conditon. If you don't accomplish anything just like in the past,

480
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:53,840
whom will she be able to count on in the future?

481
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,930
Fine.

482
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,590
I will be the Deputy General Manager of Cayman China.

483
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:09,280
Let's give a warm round of applause and let the Deputy General Manager of Cayman China give us a speech.

484
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:16,330
Each of you sitting here right now is an old acquaintance of mine.

485
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:20,450
I won't waste time with small talk and polite banalities.

486
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:23,650
Since I have already taken on this position, in the future,

487
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,690
I will for sure be dedicated to it!

488
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:28,950
I also hope that I will be able to fully cooperate

489
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:33,120
with my seniors and colleagues, so that we make Cayman go far!

490
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:40,260
We have all been working together for many years and Mr. Fang's achievements are clear as daylight to us.

491
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:44,380
I believe that under the leadership of Mr. Fang, Cayman will go far for sure!

492
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:47,570
As the Deputy General Manager of Cayman China,

493
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:51,300
from today on, I want Cayman to be a leading force in China.

494
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:55,390
We will launch a high-end clothes brand that targets the Asian women's market.

495
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:58,930
High-end! For real! Wow!

496
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:01,860
Really amazing!

497
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:10,010
Not bad! As for today's meeting's

498
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,990
third reason...

499
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:15,270
I hope each of you will pool your wisdom and efforts together,

500
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,990
so Cayman will enter a new era!

501
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,690
All right!

502
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,820
You have also seen everyone's reaction.

503
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,830
If you want to convince them,

504
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,530
you must rely on yourself.

505
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:34,400
You must fully display

506
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,660
your talents and skills! Understood?

507
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,550
I really don't care what they are thinking.

508
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,220
I only care about Qian Qian.

509
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:48,070
You brat, I wasted so much money assigning you to this position.

510
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,100
I don't want you to give me attitude

511
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,400
and be willful!

512
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,640
You must know! In order to be the leader of a company, you can't only...

513
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,020
only... be able to make designs. Am I wrong?

514
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:04,040
You must also have leadership abilities, interpersonal skills,

515
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,190
and a bunch of other abilities!

516
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:09,510
If the company's executives don't approve you...

517
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,140
I am telling you...

518
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:15,630
you look impressive but you lack real worth. In their eyes you are nothing.

519
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,180
Do you want it that way?

520
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,760
Does it matter what I want?

521
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,790
Based on the meeting we just had,

522
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,460
who will even call into question what you say?

523
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,930
Even if my designs were nothing but trash,

524
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,170
they would still clap hands and say good work, isn't that so?

525
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,150
What are you saying?

526
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:43,550
What am I saying? Do you still need me here?

527
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:48,960
Can't I simply sit here and have a chat with you?

528
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,680
Ah, wait. I forgot. This is your seat, I must leave.

529
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,830
No, no. This is the company you have acquired.

530
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:58,030
You may sit here as much as you want. It is none of my business.

531
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,570
But how about you go visit Qian Qian,

532
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,710
since you have so much time?

533
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:06,490
I am telling you, I don't need you to give me directions!

534
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:16,580
I am going to see Qian Qian right now.

535
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:22,290
You should put more effort into work affairs.

536
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,550
It won't do you any harm!

537
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,610
It won't do you any harm! Do you hear me?

538
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:28,240
I get it!

539
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,680
Old Tang, I am telling you. If you can't solve the problem with Fang Weiguo,

540
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,050
I won't fund any expenses

541
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,430
involving SLC from now on.

542
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:53,690
Let me explain it to you.

543
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:57,360
Fang Weiguo had given up the acquisition of SLC from the very beginning.

544
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,180
This tells us that he is not determined to acquire SLC.

545
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,530
He only started to bid for it after Qian Qian got sick.

546
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:05,850
What does it tell us? That he is impetuous and that Mingyuan is not like that.

547
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,720
Then do you know that

548
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,400
in order to compete with Cayman for SLC,

549
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,510
Mingyuan's additional expenses exceeded the initial budget

550
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,750
by 35%? This is a gambling addiction!

551
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:18,850
Since we have already invested so much manpower and financial resources in it,

552
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,390
why should we stop here? What's the reason for it?

553
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:24,480
Only one reason: cut losses.

554
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,090
This isn't a loss! It's for Mingyuan's own good!

555
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:29,430
For its bright future!

556
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:32,000
Where do you see a bright future in it?

557
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,600
I am telling you Old Tang,

558
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,790
from now on, I won't support your acquisition of SLC!

559
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:38,820
Your so-called dreams,

560
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,590
your global strategy, your Chinese style.

561
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:44,830
In the entire company, only you...

562
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:50,310
Tang Qiren, in the entire company, are you the only one that cares

563
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:54,240
about the bright future prospects of Mingyuan? Only you?

564
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,650
Of course not, of course not.

565
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:59,430
A lot of people do, including you.

566
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:02,760
But I am the only one who makes strategic decisions.

567
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,010
Therefore, I have thought carefully about it.

568
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:07,230
As long as I am the chairman,

569
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:11,090
I will not stop until I acquire SLC. I won't.

570
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:32,180
Deputy General Manager Fang, you pour coffee by yourself?

571
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,930
Sister, don't poke fun at me!

572
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:37,280
How am I poking fun at you?

573
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,500
I have to give you a report later.

574
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,250
Do you also have to use the word report when talking to me?

575
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:48,230
I want to make it clear, let's draw a line between private lives and work.

576
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:52,850
After becoming Deputy General Manager, will you still be in charge of the Modeling Department?

577
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:54,460
Of course!

578
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,910
So how did the discussions with Mingyuan go?

579
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,820
So is it settled that they will let us walk for their show?

580
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,570
Sister, I think I get it now.

581
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:06,140
Are you trying to make me report my work progress to you? Then say it!

582
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,120
I will go write a report and give it to you.

583
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,450
- Is it okay?
- Stop it!

584
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:11,290
Shouldn't I ask you clearly about that?

585
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:14,310
What if the kids have wasted so much time, waking up early each morning, staying till late practicing,

586
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,500
and in the end, they don't walk for the show?

587
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,520
Hasn't the Legal Department sent you any notice?

588
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,860
The contract has already arrived, it is settled, it only needs our final signature.

589
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:25,620
I am relieved, then.

590
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:28,590
After confirming and signing it, we will send it back to them.

591
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:33,360
You should bring the models to try on their clothes, see if there are any adjustments to make.

592
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,950
You finally did something properly.

593
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:38,150
I don't care anymore about the trouble you caused before.

594
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:42,170
But if you are the deputy general manager, from now on you must work hard.

595
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:46,970
Why do I feel as if being the deputy general manager is not a good thing?

596
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,740
How could it not be?

597
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:52,220
I have only been the deputy general manager for two hours, but have already been lectured twice.

598
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,080
How are things going, President Tang?

599
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,020
How are the preparations for your Symphony of Clouds and Mists product launch going?

600
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,540
Pretty smoothly.

601
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,440
We're preparing according to our plans.

602
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,220
That's good!

603
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,780
As I was looking through the sales report that day,

604
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,920
I realized that old tea-horse road designs

605
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,320
of that designer Mo Fei,

606
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,830
who joined our Chinese Style Fashion,

607
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:24,180
had the best reviews and the highest sales amount.

608
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,010
I suddenly realized,

609
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:28,930
that a designer's popularity and reputation,

610
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:33,060
can't fully reflect the purchasing decision of customers.

611
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,080
I think it's the Chinese elements she used,

612
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:40,410
which made her designs sell so well. What do you think?

613
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:43,110
Our opinions happen to coincide.

614
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:46,330
Did you know? Our future developments and designs,

615
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,530
not only aim to expand the popularity of Chinese fashion,

616
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:51,610
our goal doesn't stop here.

617
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:54,780
Besides the Chinese market, we also want to go beyond the domestic borders.

618
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,690
And go international in the end.

619
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:01,830
You have nice views, I am happy to collaborate with you!

620
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:03,480
President Tang.

621
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,020
I went to each design studio to check.

622
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:09,620
They are making adjustments based on the product launch venue.

623
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:13,270
By the way, have you got in touch with Miya's assistant?

624
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,520
I have just contacted her.

625
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,940
How's the situation?

626
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,510
She hasn't replied to me yet.

627
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:22,200
Keep following up.

628
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:29,170
By the way, I have just met with President Wu from Fashion Daily.

629
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:32,140
He said that this time, on their platform,

630
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:36,310
our Chinese Style Fashion products sold the best.

631
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:39,840
These are the statistics of the sales report from their platform.

632
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,860
Take a look at them.

636
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,820
Jiaxi, you are here!

637
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,480
Jiaxi, what are you doing?

638
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,740
- I was browsing the internal webpage of the company.
- Internal webpage?

639
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,160
Is there any news?

640
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,510
Nothing.

641
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:16,140
Nothing? Let me have a look at it!

642
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:22,530
Mo Fei, your old tea-horse road designs are the best-selling items in Fashion Daily!

643
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:24,890
- For real?
- Yes, look!

644
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,240
You can keep chatting, I will go to work.

645
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,060
Don't walk away, Jiaxi!

646
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:31,270
This is such a happy event, Mo Fei should treat us!

647
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:35,220
Tell me. What should Mo Fei treat us to?

648
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,340
So what do you two want to eat? Order!

649
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,140
Tell me. What do you want to eat?

650
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,680
You order.

651
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,170
Then I will order something randomly.

652
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,690
Are these the design sketches you asked them to draw?

653
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,600
I worked so hard to get the sketches behind Mingyuan's concepts,

654
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,770
are you trying to fool me by using these?

655
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,530
Zheng Hang, are you not trying your best,

656
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:04,370
or does Haiyao really not have any talented designers?

657
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:08,060
Director Bai, don't get angry! It's been a while!

658
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:11,680
You also know the situation of our company's designers.

659
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,070
Most of them follow the norms.

660
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:17,270
Looking at these designs, we could say this is an innovation for them!

661
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:18,840
Are you talking on their behalf?

662
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,250
No, no, Director Bai, you really have misunderstood me!

663
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,990
- This is only the truth!
- Good for nothing! You are a good for nothing!

664
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:26,500
All right, I don't care what method you have to use,

665
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,450
but within a week, you have to submit a design sketch which will leave me satisfied!

666
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,670
Otherwise, you will fly away together with them!

667
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,410
Director Bai...

668
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:46,850
Hello, Xiaoman.

669
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:48,510
Jiaxi, are you sleeping yet?

670
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:51,130
Not yet, why are you looking for me at this hour?

671
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,170
I wanted to ask you whether you know a good designer

672
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:59,100
who could finish the concept sketch you gave me?

673
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:02,460
I got so angry with the designers in my company.

674
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,990
Turn back!

♫ You're the round moon every night ♫

691
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,690

♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

698
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:21,140
♫ The bittersweet parting words of "take care" ♫

699
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:25,920
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫
