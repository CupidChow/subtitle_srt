[Episode 17]

3
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,890
Mo Fei, let me tell you some good news.

4
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,050
I was hired by Mingyuan! Look!

5
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,170
Really! You are so awesome!

6
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,670
See, I told you you could do it. You're always unconfident.

7
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,740
Now that you were hired by Mingyuan,

8
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,030
do you believe me now?

9
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,270
To be frank, I still feel like I'm dreaming right now.

10
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,230
Also, I was personally hired by Director Xia herself.

11
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,410
Just now she called me to her office

12
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,290
and promised me a lot of things.

13
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,040
Was it Xia Xueling?

14
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,770
Yes, she is actually quite nice.

15
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,420
Furthermore, she kept complimenting me.

16
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,570
Mo Fei, what's wrong? Do you not like her?

17
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,840
That's not it. It's just... that I don't know her that well

18
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,670
so I can't say whether I like her or not. Don't think too much of it.

19
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,320
What meal are you eating right now?

20
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,380
I haven't been able to eat a normal meal since getting here.

21
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,790
You're that busy? What are you busy with?

22
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:39,600
I know! You must be busy with romantic encounters in France, right?

23
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,100
What encounters? Besides school, I'm home every day. I haven't even been to the Louvre yet.

24
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,460
That's it for now. I am still at the company. Talk to you later. Bye-bye.

25
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,620
Work. I cannot continue to cause trouble at Boss Huang's place.

26
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,540
I'll find another job.

27
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,500
Excuse me.

28
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,200
I saw the notice. Are you hiring a sales associate?

29
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,530
Yes, are you here to apply for it?

30
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,570
Yes, I am.

31
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,330
What is your name?

32
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,990
Mo Fei.

33
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,500
What is your major?

34
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,820
Fashion design.

35
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,250
Great.

36
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,880
We often have Chinese customers.

37
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,910
Can you show me what you would do?

38
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,510
Of course.

39
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:04,040
It's too unsophisticated. I don't like it.

40
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,290
Hello, can I help you with anything?

41
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,940
I rarely come to Paris on business trips

42
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,260
so I plan on buying a few Parisian outfits to take home.

43
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,600
Indeed Parisian fashion is every girl's dream.

44
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,840
It would be a pity if you didn’t bring a few pieces home.

45
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,540
I want to ask, what type of clothing do you normally like?

46
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,110
Usually, I wear professional attire more.

47
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,760
I don't have many days off.

48
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,010
- All right then. Let me help you pick a few.
- Okay.

49
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,230
These two will suit you very well.

50
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:47,430
Let me tell you about this one first. This is a dress with a fitted waistline.

51
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,240
It will make your slim waist

52
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,140
more curvy. There's also no excess design.

53
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,600
It is really simple and poised.

54
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,900
Even if you wear it to work, it won't be too flashy.

55
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,430
How's my waist slim? I'm a mother of two children.

56
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,380
Really? I can't tell at all.

57
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,800
If that's the case, then this one is even more suitable for you;

58
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,020
a dashing, hot, working mother.

59
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,380
You are such a sweet talker. Okay, I trust your taste.

60
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,050
Check my size. I will take both of them.

61
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,610
Thank you for trusting me so much. This way, please.

62
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,120
Excuse me. This lady would like both of these.

63
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,520
Do you want to pay with cash or card?

64
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,630
Card.

65
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,200
Very good.

66
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,800
Although I don't speak Chinese,

67
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,810
I can tell that you did very well.

68
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,780
What was your name again?

69
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,910
Mo Fei.

70
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,950
See you tomorrow, Mo Fei.

71
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,300
Thank you. Thank you very much.

72
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,690
Is there any news from SLC?

73
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,550
Not yet.

74
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,950
This SLC

75
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,420
has already canceled on us twice.

76
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,710
Looks like they don't really respect our Mingyuan Group.

77
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,910
I'm worried that more trouble will arise as time drags on.

78
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:45,550
Don't worry about this matter. Let me take care of it.

79
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,620
I think I need to make another trip to France.

80
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,810
May as well. It'll be difficult

81
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,870
but I believe in you.

82
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,860
I will try my best.

[Pudong, Shanghai to Paris, France]

84
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,030
I hope you'll have a lovely stay.

85
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,640
Thank you.

86
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,370
Brother Xuan.

87
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,710
- You're here.
- I went to SLC right after I got off the plane.

88
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,470
I went to test the water with the assistant.

89
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,990
I think she still doesn't want to see us.

90
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,660
Say, did we come too hastily this time?

91
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,470
I think it isn't our problem.

92
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,720
It must be Cayman... that did something.

93
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,020
Then, what should we do?

94
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,180
A topic fabric manufacturer like SLC

95
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,610
may not necessarily base their primary choice

96
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,020
on auction prices.

97
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,620
As long as I get to see them, I have a way to persuade them.

98
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,600
All right. Go and rest.

99
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,590
Okay, Brother Xuan, you get some rest, too.

100
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,820
Why are you here?

101
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,350
Asking what you already know.

102
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,450
What time is it? Let's go eat.

103
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:45,070
I won't go. I have a lot of homework today.

104
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,540
With me as a free tutor, you will be able to get twice the results with half the work.

105
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,030
I—

106
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:56,330
[Mo Fei, where are you? I'm in Paris. If it is convenient, let's have dinner.]

107
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,950
What's the good news that's making you so happy?

108
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,760
I... I still have something to do. I'm leaving now. Bye-bye.

109
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,390
Hey!

110
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,210
What's the good news?

111
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:14,340
♫ At five past ten, you suddenly appear ♫

112
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,310
Say, weren't you supposed to come in the next few days?

113
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,090
Why have you come today?

114
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,460
The matter I came to take care of has been moved up.

115
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:29,190
The main thing is... I wanted to come here sooner to see you.

116
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,330
Then, where are we going right now?

117
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,070
Where do you want to go?

118
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,320
Where do you want to take me?

119
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,860
Have you ever been to the Seine-et-Marne River?

120
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,910
Not yet.

121
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,510
I've booked a boat.

122
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,380
Let's go there to have dinner in the evening, okay?

123
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,790
Go there to eat dinner at night?

124
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,790
Do you not like it?

125
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,910
No.

126
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,680
It's just...

127
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,380
It's just that I wanted to go somewhere else with you.

128
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,930
I'll listen to you.

129
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:12,410
You didn't want to go eat with me on the boat

130
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,560
just to come here?

131
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:18,730
There is actually a reason for coming here.

132
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:21,340
Our teacher assigned me homework

133
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,330
to come here and enjoy the beautiful view.

134
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,770
The homework your teacher gave you?

135
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,460
Who? André?

136
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,340
How do you know?

137
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,950
I'm afraid, at your school, only Andre

138
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,310
would give you all such a meaningful topic.

139
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:45,170
Hey, do you know what the meaning of this is?

140
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,700
When he first assigned this, I didn’t understand it at all.

141
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:55,500
The entire urban area of Paris began from this place, Île de la Cité.

142
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,850
You know, the first group of people who came to live in Paris

143
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,640
moved at around the third century B.C.

144
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,780
But during the Middle Ages, Paris only expanded

145
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,900
to Seine's two banks.

146
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,940
But no matter how they expanded, this place

147
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,430
will always be the center of imperial power and church power.

148
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,730
So, coming to Paris...

149
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,880
Only by coming here

150
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,370
can you feel the spirit of Paris.

151
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:35,340
Don't you think your teacher has put a lot of thought into this?

152
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,630
After hearing what you said...

153
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,800
- Look! The sky is red.
- Is it the setting sun?

154
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,350
Yes. You know, in ancient China,

155
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:53,800
they call red crimson, the color of the setting sun.

156
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:02,400
So what color do you want to use for your design this time?

157
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,000
It's Chinoiserie so, of course, a color that most represents China.

158
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,500
I feel the colors that best represent China are crimson and vermilion.

159
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,820
They're not as glamorous as the three primary colors of the west.

160
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:19,350
Crimson and vermilion are like

161
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,450
the red wall of the Forbidden City.

162
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,930
Add a little earthy yellow...

163
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:26,320
The colors are very warm.

164
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,900
Rich and mellow.

165
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:33,210
I feel these are the colors that best represent China. Like us Chinese,

166
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,800
there is a lot of tolerance and warmth.

167
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,280
Then have you finished your homework?

168
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,740
In regards to choosing colors, I'm still

169
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,330
a bit troubled. I am not very sure.

170
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,040
Have you realized what your most serious problem is?

171
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,760
What?

172
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,810
You know a lot about all the traditional colors,

173
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,760
but you can't create Chinoiserie clothes. Why is that?

174
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,050
Because in your overall design, there are too many limits.

175
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,720
The so-called Chinoiserie

176
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,920
does not depend on shape or spirit.

177
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,300
All traditional elements and designs

178
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,380
are just a supporter.

179
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,920
You don't need to force it so much.

180
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,260
But without the elements

181
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,050
and artistry,

182
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:31,290
how does it show the Chinese motifs and techniques?

183
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,170
Come take a look.

184
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,370
What is this?

185
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,540
What is this?

186
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,210
Seeing this, what do you think of?

187
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,830
I think of... how magnificent the setting sun is.

188
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,010
It's just nearing dusk.

189
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,000
That's right.

190
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:05,440
China is already flowing within your blood.

191
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,160
It is carved in your soul.

192
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,480
So you don't need to emphasize it.

193
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,630
Right now, the only thing you need to do is break all your rules.

194
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:22,330
"The setting sun is like melted gold, the evening clouds gather, looking like a piece of jade,

195
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,210
Where is the person I think of?" ("Forever Happy" is a poem from the Song Dynasty by the female poet, Li Qingzhao)

196
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,680
Does this look like

197
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,800
a court dress in gradient color?

198
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,730
It looks like you already understand.

199
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,390
Good.

200
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,840
Thank you, President Tang.

201
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,490
The weather in Paris nowadays is quite cold.

202
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:08,060
Yes, I feel like I wore too little today.

203
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,280
What should we do?

204
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,000
Call the police first.

205
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,910
They are there.

206
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,610
Hurry and run!

207
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:30,190
Tang Mingxuan?

208
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,830
They are here to cause trouble again.

209
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,960
Hurry!

210
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,430
Don't come near.

211
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,410
- I will go help him.
- Hey!

212
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,210
[Hospital]

213
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,500
I have already turned in your homework for you.

214
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,120
Andre said that he will talk to you privately after you return to school.

215
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,390
Thank you. If it weren't for you, I probably wouldn't be able to finish my homework.

216
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:38,060
No need to thank me. We're classmates.

217
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,800
- Wait a moment.
- Okay.

218
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,490
He's awake.

219
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,880
How are you?

220
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,390
"After surviving a great disaster, one is bound to have good fortune later on."

221
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,980
Come here.

222
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,920
Does it hurt? Don't touch it with your hands.

223
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,410
Thank you.

224
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,040
Let's go.

225
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:42,800
Tang Mingxuan, I don't want to see you.

226
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,930
Do you think that because you are injured, you can do whatever you want?

227
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,960
I only want to talk to Mo Fei.

228
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,220
Please.

229
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,410
I will wait for you at the door.

230
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,260
I'll help you.

231
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,950
The person I don't like has finally left.

232
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:31,400
I'm sorry. I've caused you to get admitted into the hospital.

233
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,040
But thank you for saving us two.

234
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,930
Hold on. I didn't save you two.

235
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,560
I saved only you.

236
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,220
You look seriously injured.

237
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,120
This side of your face is also injured.

238
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,220
I'm done for. It's over. I'm disfigured.

239
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,130
You're not disfigured. The doctor said it's just superficial injuries.

240
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:01,150
It's just... your right hand is more seriously injured. You have to be careful.

241
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,800
It's a minor injury.

242
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,490
Is your face fine?

243
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,060
Girl's faces cannot have any scars.

244
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,350
This is just a minor injury. It is all right.

245
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:14,400
Really, if you get disfigured, then you can only survive off your skills.

246
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,940
Say, you're still in the mood to joke around right now?

247
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,750
Has the police caught them? What did they say?

248
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,030
No! When the police got to the scene, they were already gone.

249
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,680
They also can't go to Betty's house to arrest them.

250
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,500
- This matter has to be resolved as soon as possible.
- Yes.

251
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,650
Mingxuan also said that.

252
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,360
Can you not mention his name in front of me?

253
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,120
Okay, okay. You're the patient so whatever you say goes.

254
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,050
You probably were scared to death yesterday.

255
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:50,240
Good thing, yesterday, Mingxuan and I–

256
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,510
I already asked, can you not mention that name?

257
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,890
Okay. Sorry, sorry! I am really sorry.

258
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:00,760
Miss, is your apology what I need?

259
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,400
T-Then what is it?

260
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,360
What I need is for you to abandon him and move on to a new lover.

261
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,900
Okay.

262
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,610
It looks like you are fine, so I'll take my leave.

263
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:18,560
By the way, give me your keys and I'll go help you pack some things.

264
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:24,090
Look to see if the keys are in the drawer.

265
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:31,700
There are keys under the carpet in front of my place.

266
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,100
All right. I'm leaving then.

267
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,810
Bye-bye.

268
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,600
After you finish packing, quickly come see me.

269
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,870
Say, fortunately, Fang Xiaoyu was there yesterday.

270
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:49,150
Do you want to consider shaking hands with him and making up?

271
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,980
Why are you so concerned about what's happened between us?

272
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,320
Did he say something to you?

273
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,920
He didn't say anything. It's just that every time you two see each other, you two are unhappy.

274
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,740
I don't wish for you to be unhappy.

275
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,730
The matter between him and I, it won't be resolved with a few words.

276
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,280
Let's not talk about it for now, okay?

277
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:12,020
You haven't eaten. I'll go buy something. Wait for me upstairs.

278
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,400
Running away will never solve the problem.

279
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,160
What's wrong with your face?

280
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,180
Nothing. Are you here to see Duoduo?

281
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,710
She's not opening the door for me.

282
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,710
Help me.

283
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,970
I can only help you to here.

284
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:07,600
Go on in. I'm going to help Fang Xiaoyu pack some things.

285
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,320
What's happened to Senior?

286
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,000
Go ask Duoduo.

287
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,570
I already said I don't want to see you!

288
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,620
Why are you still coming to disgust me?

289
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,120
Duoduo, I really am aware that I was in the wrong.

290
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,050
You liar!

291
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,990
Tell me! How can I not see you?

292
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,710
I can't live a day without you.

293
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:45,020
Leave!

294
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,270
Duoduo, can you really let go of our years-long relationship?

295
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,640
I can't.

296
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,030
We clawed this doll from the arcade together.

297
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:08,480
You said you were going to make it our wedding's lucky item.

298
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,120
You're not leaving, right?

299
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,250
I'll leave.

300
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,860
Duoduo, where are you going?!

301
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,200
Wait! Wait for me

302
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,480
Auntie Lu.

303
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,250
Xueling? You've finally come! I was about to be bored to death today.

304
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:38,330
- Long time no see.
- Exactly. Why haven't you come to see me?

305
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,450
- Let's go sit over there.
- Sure.

306
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,060
Have you been really busy lately?

307
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,650
Yes, without Mingxuan at the company, there are a lot of things to take care of.

308
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,580
So I'm coming to see you only now.

309
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,960
Have a seat.

310
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,420
Look, I brought your favorite desert.

311
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,310
Only you are so considerate.

312
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,460
Have a smell. Does it smell nice?

313
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,770
It is so fragrant.

314
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,690
The osmanthus wine I make is especially delicious.

315
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,220
When it is finished, I will call you to come and have some.

316
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,920
Okay.

317
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,020
Here, have some tea.

318
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,700
Without Mingxuan at the company,

319
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,710
everything is counting on you.

320
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,720
It must be hard on you.

321
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,680
Thank you, Auntie.

322
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,950
Seeing you today, your complexion is not like usual.

323
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,580
Stay for dinner tonight.

324
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,570
I will have Nanny Wu make some nourishing soup for you.

325
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,910
Sure! Thank you, Aunt.

326
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:28,850
Actually, I'm fine with being a bit tired from work

327
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:32,630
but... right now Mingxuan is in France.

328
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,160
I am a bit worried.

329
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,960
It's fine. He's all grown up.

330
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,670
It's not his first time abroad. Besides, Yang Guang is by his side.

331
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:46,130
In the beginning, I hoped you were able to be by his side. That way, I would be more at ease.

332
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:48,590
I understand your good intentions.

333
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:55,210
I'm just afraid that, in the future, I won't be able to come here often to see you.

334
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:57,410
How could that be?

335
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:03,880
What's wrong, Xueling? Did something happen?

336
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:09,460
Auntie, Mingxuan was originally going to France to handle some company affairs

337
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:14,880
but I heard he actually went to see a girl.

338
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,970
Girl?

339
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,960
What girl?

340
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,160
There's no way.

341
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,520
You've met her.

342
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,600
The girl called Mo Fei who came here with me last time.

343
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:31,620
I recall. That small designer.

344
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:35,370
- The one you said you and Mingxuan look highly on.
- Yes.

345
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:39,190
She doesn't look like such a conniving girl.

346
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,550
Why doesn't she learn the good?

347
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:45,960
Instead, she learned to interfere in others' relationships and to steal others' boyfriends. Despicable.

348
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,250
Could it be that you're thinking too much and got it wrong?

349
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,640
I also don't know.

350
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,160
But... Mo Fei is indeed younger and prettier than me.

351
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:03,220
Who said that? In my eyes, no one is as good as you.

352
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,630
In my heart, you were my daughter-in-law long ago.

353
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,600
It's fine. Leave this to me.

354
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,360
Without my consent, Mingxuan doesn't dare to bring other girls home.

355
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,200
But will Mingxuan be unhappy?

356
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,950
Him unhappy? This family doesn't work unless I'm happy.

357
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,980
Don't worry, I know how to handle this.

358
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,090
Auntie, you're so great.

359
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,430
We're here.

360
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,370
Why are you here?

361
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,030
To visit the patient.

362
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,890
Visit the patient?

363
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,120
With empty hands?

364
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,450
Yes.

365
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:46,290
Your skin is quite thick, coming here uninvited.

366
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:49,220
I didn't invite you, go out.

367
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:52,130
I prepared some clothes for you to change into.

368
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:54,800
Do you think I'll use the things you've brought me?

369
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:09,640
Don't push your luck.

370
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,690
Can you two stop arguing? This is the hospital.

371
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:15,950
I packed the clothes, I packed everything.

372
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:21,160
Mo Fei, you stayed with me for the whole night yesterday,

373
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,310
you're probably exhausted. Your little face is yellow.

374
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,040
Did you not eat to stay with me?

375
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:33,140
You saved the two of us, so the two of us should take care of you.

376
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:36,910
Also, I wasn't the only one here last night. Mingxuan was also here.

377
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:40,010
So, in order to thank you, I especially hired a nurse for you.

378
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:44,170
I promise you that before you leave the hospital, you will be well taken care of.

379
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:47,000
Do I need you to hire a nurse for me? Can't I—

380
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,050
Aren't you unwell right now? Is it convenient for you?

381
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:53,960
Also, everything I'm doing is to thank you.

382
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,690
You have taken good care of Mo Fei.

383
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:58,420
No need for you to be troubled.

384
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,450
Taking care of Mo Fei is also my matter.

385
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:04,460
You still have work, right? Hurry and leave.

386
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,520
- I don't want to delay your work.
- It's fine. I'm not in a rush.

387
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,840
I want to keep you company for a bit longer.

388
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:18,320
Mo Fei.
- Yes?
- I want to drink some juice.

389
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,210
Then I will go buy it for you.

390
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:37,320
Let's get straight to the point.

391
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:45,390
Don't think that just because you're together with Mo Fei that you've succeeded.

392
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:49,160
I will continue to pursue her.

393
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:04,180
First of all, I want to let you know that the feelings I have for Mo Fei are very serious.

394
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:11,090
Also, I feel like you still have not grown up. What you are doing is really childish.

395
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,700
Whether I'm childish or not has nothing to do with you.

396
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,790
You are really serious about her? Then what can you give her?

397
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:21,810
To Fang Qian in the past and to Mo Fei in the present,

398
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,830
what can you give them?

399
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:29,370
The most suitable person for you is only Xia Xueling.

400
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:35,580
What? Are you scared?

401
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,430
It looks like the relationship between you two is not as secure as you say.

402
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:43,210
You don't need to worry about my relationships. All right?

403
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:46,530
Tang Mingxuan, do you understand Mo Fei?

404
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:49,270
I understand her.

405
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,230
I can laugh wholeheartedly with her when she is happy.

406
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:54,380
I can lend her a shoulder when she is having a hard time.

407
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,950
When she is in danger, I can protect her.

408
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:00,000
How about you? An overseas call?

409
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,170
Or comfort her through a video call?

410
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:05,970
Why are you so concerned about my love life?

411
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,740
What I am concerned about is my sister.

412
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,730
Do you not understand?

413
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,310
Since I was young, I treated Fang Qian as my younger sister.

414
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,590
We grew up together.

415
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:30,340
I cannot accept changing a relationship for the benefit

416
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,190
of the company and our families.

417
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:35,600
Is that how you deceived my sister?

418
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,330
Look.

419
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,440
Can we possibly communicate?

420
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,740
No.

421
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:45,900
I'm telling you today that I will continue to pursue Mo Fei.

422
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,680
Everything you are doing right now,

423
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,380
- isn't it all to get revenge on me?
- No.

424
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,280
I want you to lose.

425
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:07,160
You can get revenge on me, that's fine. But let me tell you!

426
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,690
If in all of this, Mo Fei is the entry point

427
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:12,460
and you hurt her at all,

428
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,560
I won't let you off easily.

429
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,990
Don't worry, I will make her really happy.

430
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,500
Juice.

431
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,830
Straw.

432
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:31,300
Then... I will go get it.

433
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,980
Come back.

434
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:37,990
He's unwell. He needs to rehabilitate.

435
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,730
Let's go. Let him rest.

436
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,970
- He's alone right now. We—
- The nurse will be here soon.

437
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,970
You are disturbing other people's work like this.

438
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:52,250
Tang Mingxuan are you a bandit? Dragging her away!

439
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,980
Don't you think that pulling me away like that was not very good?

440
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,230
What is not right about me pulling you away?

441
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,290
Didn't we find a nurse for him?

442
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:16,850
The nurse will definitely be more professional than us in taking care of him.

443
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:21,070
Yes, that's right. However, he did save us after all.

444
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:24,830
Even if we are not friends and are strangers, shouldn't we take care of him?

445
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:27,210
I think you're very correct.

446
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:31,120
But there's a certain limit to which one takes care of a friend.

447
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,470
Don't you think that the nonsense he just said

448
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:36,960
was too much?

449
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,980
Then, was I being too much?

450
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,020
I'm not blaming you.

451
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:52,440
I just think he has issues.

452
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,720
Shouldn't you stand in my shoes and think on my behalf?

453
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,880
I'm not here in France often.

454
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,550
If he is often by your side and proposes some unreasonable requests,

455
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:05,420
have you thought about whether or not I would feel good?

456
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:11,360
But for two people to be together, trust is most important. If you don't even have that trust—

457
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,910
It's not that I don't trust you. I'm telling you clearly right now

458
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,660
that it's his issues, not yours.

459
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,390
But I also cannot control his issues.

460
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:21,740
I've also tried my best to reject him every time. What do you want me to do?

461
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:25,250
- In order to save us, he got injured--
-Mo Fei, are you trying to argue with me because of him?

462
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,210
I am not arguing with you.

463
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:28,760
Then, what do you want to do? Go back to take care of him?

464
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,250
Are you unhappy and angry at me because I brought you away? Because of this?

465
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,780
- I'm not trying to argue with you—
- I really don't understand right now.

466
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,950
- I feel that you don't trust me right now.
- Really, Mo Fei.

467
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,540
Then if that's the case,

468
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,970
then I'm also unhappy that Xia Xueling is working alongside you.

469
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,520
But have I mentioned it before?

470
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,080
Because I trust you, I never mentioned it before.

471
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,490
Why can't you trust me?

472
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,790
I am colleagues with Xueling. Why are you bringing her into this?

473
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:54,400
Then I'm just friends with Fang Xiaoyu.

474
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:23,020
What are you doing? You scared me!

475
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,310
Sorry.

476
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:27,780
Hold on. What are you doing?

477
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:31,910
Cheng Yang, that big trotter (unfaithful person).

478
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:38,290
Look at you. I say, you're drunk.

479
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:39,830
You drink some.

480
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:42,980
I'll drink it. I'll drink it so you don't.

481
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,610
I want to destroy all the big trotters of the world.

482
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:50,840
Okay, destroy them, destroy them. Just eat. Don't drink anymore.

483
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,930
Mo Fei, why are all men this way?

484
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:57,340
"They're eating from their bowl but thinking about what's in the pot."

485
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:01,160
In front of you, he'll pledge an eternal oath.

486
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,880
Behind your back, he is intimate with another woman.

487
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,760
Good-for-nothing.

488
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:13,400
Men don't consider what women are thinking of at all.

489
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,240
Tang Mingxuan just had a big argument with me about me taking care of Fang Xiaoyu.

490
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,180
What? Fang Xiaoyu was kindhearted in saving him.

491
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,450
He actually got angry about you taking care of him?

492
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:28,380
So absurd.

493
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:36,280
Say... What exactly is the misunderstanding between him and Fang Xiaoyu?

494
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,170
Could it be that Tang Mingxuan stole

495
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,650
his girlfriend in the past?

496
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:46,490
Is that possible?

497
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:51,140
What do you think happened between them then? What happened?

498
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:54,450
I don't know either. Don't ask me. I'm so annoyed.

499
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,450
Brother Xuan, I think Miya's assistant finds me annoying.

500
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:04,690
I stayed in her office for a whole day today but didn't get to see the person.

501
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:15,930
Brother Xuan, are you feeling unwell?

502
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:17,110
What is it?

503
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,550
You don't look well.

504
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,390
I'm guessing that if I see Miya now,

505
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:26,340
my complexion will immediately look better.

506
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:32,530
I can fight the protracted war.

507
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:34,810
But I want to know, is it worth it?

508
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:39,320
SLC is our first choice, but it's also our only choice.

509
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,790
Therefore...

510
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:43,440
We must get them.

511
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,100
By the way, I asked you to find that Chinese designer for me. How is that going?

512
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,490
I've already contacted him.

513
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,760
We must not let others rob him.

514
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,900
Don't worry.

515
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,750
Tang Mingxuan.

516
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,820
Hello. Cheng Yang.

517
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,400
Sit.

518
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,770
Mister, what would you like to order?

519
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,480
Coffee, please.

520
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,540
How did you find me?

521
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:27,710
We have alway paid attention to Chinese designers of all the major fashion schools in Europe.

522
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,440
The important point is

523
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:34,030
you just received the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers, right?

524
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:38,390
Therefore, I would like to invite you to join Mingyuan Fashion Group.

525
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:43,660
President Tang, I don't have a strong desire to go back to China to develop my career.

526
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,440
Why?

527
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,840
I want to accumulate more experience here

528
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,290
and establish my own brand.

529
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:52,450
You should also know that that is easier to do in Europe.

530
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:57,740
Then, are you interested in designing Chinoiserie

531
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,750
fashion?

532
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:07,050
To tell you the truth, I personally really like Chinoiserie designs.

533
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:08,850
However, there isn't much of it in Europe.

534
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:13,580
Occasionally our workshop will produce some items with Eastern elements.

535
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,470
But it's not the same as Chinoiserie.

536
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,890
In actuality, our company's origin

537
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:21,750
was to make Chinoiserie clothing.

538
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:27,330
But the most pivotal factor in Songtang's transformation is the shortage of designers.

539
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,490
There are indeed not many Chinoiserie designers.

540
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:32,510
That's because many people think China doesn't have its own fashion.

541
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:36,780
But, actually, a long time ago, China already started producing its own fashion.

542
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,500
Thanks.

543
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,910
Enjoy, please.

544
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:44,940
It's easy to speak of it but it's difficult to do.

545
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:49,750
What's difficult is how to apply things from traditional cultures to our current times.

546
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:53,080
I think this is a way of transmitting one's blood heritage.

547
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,900
It isn't just about an element or a symbol.

548
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:02,040
But instead of being a spectator, how about doing it and trying it for yourself?

549
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,210
This is what my experience tells me.

550
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:07,220
No matter what you'll need, I can satisfy you.

551
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:10,120
You don't have to worry about any issue regarding globalization

552
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,850
because our company acquiring international companies

553
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:16,130
is one of our strategies.

554
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:18,150
Also, Cheng Yang,

555
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:23,760
through your works, I see a deep connection to Chinese culture.

556
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,280
I've also discussed it with our design department.

557
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,290
There is hope for you to carry Chinese elements

558
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:32,040
from ourselves to the international stage.

559
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,240
Through our collaboration, I further hope

560
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:40,400
that you will help successfully transform Mingyuan in order for it to reach the world.

561
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:54,420
Taking your own path is the best choice.  [Mingyuan Fashion Group - Collaboration Proposal]

562
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,260
President Tang,

563
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:06,620
I will seriously look at this collaboration proposal,

564
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,930
but I cannot give you an answer now.

565
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:12,880
To tell you the truth, there are other companies looking for me now.

566
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:16,750
That is not important at all.

567
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,860
I think you deserve the best choice.

568
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:24,720
Thank you for the coffee.

569
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,910
- Thank you, President Tang.
- Thank you.

570
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,680
Very nice meeting you.

571
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,850
Brother Xuan, how was your chat with Cheng Yang?

572
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:52,590
Someone already talked to him before we did.

573
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,090
Which company?

574
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:55,950
That is not important.

575
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:59,400
Let's go. We'll go to Miya's.

576
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,460
Here, there are some tops of different styles.

577
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:10,070
Over here, there are dresses in various colors.

578
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:12,660
I think this one suits your skin tone quite well.

579
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,970
Would you like to try?

580
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,230
No, thanks.

581
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:23,180
Goodbye.

582
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,700
You... Why are you here?

583
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:32,800
Turns out you work here.

584
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,240
Why are you here? To apologize to me?

585
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,540
Why do I need to apologize?

586
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,930
If you are not here to apologize, why are you here?

587
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,740
Mo Fei, is there a problem here between you and this gentleman?

588
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,400
Hi, I want to ask about Miya.

589
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,170
When will she come to this store?

590
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:59,080
Sorry, sir. If you are looking for Miya, you can go to her office.

591
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,930
I cannot reveal her itinerary to you.

592
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:05,220
Also, Mo Fei is working right now.

593
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,420
This is my business card.

594
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:11,570
When Miya comes here, I hope you can give me a call.

595
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:18,030
Mo Fei, go take care of other clients.

596
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:22,750
Thank you.
