[Episode 16]

3
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,150
But then again, Mo Fei,

4
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,580
if you really like him,

5
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,110
you have to have a great ability to deal with a lot of pressure.

6
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,210
Last time, I said he's not simple.

7
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,940
I didn't mean anything else.

8
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,170
I just wanted to remind you that he has Xia Xueling by his side.

9
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,510
The parents on both sides already see them as a couple.

10
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,250
- Actually... Xia Xueling called me today.
- What?

11
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,440
Why did she call you? To warn you?

12
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,120
Show of force?

13
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,690
Probably both.

14
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,020
Does Tang Mingxuan know?

15
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,880
He's so busy with work, I don't want to tell him.

16
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,630
You are quite considerate of him.

17
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,290
Actually, when dealing with relationship problems,

18
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,140
Tang Mingxuan's EQ and IQ are quite worrisome.

19
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,790
However, about his marriage,

20
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,510
it must be tied to Mingyuan.

21
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:46,680
Only by being together with and marrying Xia Xueling,

22
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,690
would there be an alliance of two great powers. If he chooses you,

23
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,400
it means he will have to fight against everyone around him.

24
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,080
Therefore, do you think he can do it?

25
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,000
Tang Mingxuan bears the entire Mingyuan Group's burden on his back.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,550
A romantic relationship is only a very small part of his life.

27
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,150
So, are you really sure

28
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,100
that you are ready to be with him?

29
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,300
It's late. Let's hurry and go.

30
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,690
Give this venue contract to President Wu.

31
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,410
Okay.

32
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:37,430
Xueling, come in.

33
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,290
Director Xia.

34
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,410
I've finished modifying the designs of the ten new outfits as you wanted.

35
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,190
Taking into consideration Master Li's embroidery pieces that are still in good condition,

36
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,030
as well as those that can be mended in the next few days,

37
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,980
I've modified the original designs.

38
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,240
Take a look to see if there are any other problems.

39
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,300
You are amazing.

40
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:09,320
If there are no problems, I will send these drawings to the factory.

41
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,640
Okay. Xueling.

42
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,610
Let's have another chat.

43
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,270
Sorry, I don't have the time.

44
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,220
What about after work?

45
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,480
I am meeting someone after work.

46
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,630
You are thinking of everything too simply.

47
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,820
Do you think that love is enough?

48
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,880
Do you actually believe that you and Mingxuan can be together?

49
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,840
The parents on both sides already see them as a couple.

50
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,770
Mo Fei, do you know how to get to this place?

51
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,430
Where?

52
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,800
Hey, phone call.

53
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,910
[Tang Mingxuan]

54
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,230
He hung up.

55
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,330
Call him back.

56
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,250
What if he's looking for you about something urgent?

57
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,700
It can't be anything urgent. If it were, he wouldn't have hung up.

58
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,490
If he needs something, he will call again.

59
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,130
Do you think there is nothing urgent,

60
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,930
or are you afraid?

61
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,190
Afraid of what?

62
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,160
Afraid that he won't come. You've waited for him for three days now.

63
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,400
If Tang Mingxuan doesn't come, would you be very disappointed?

64
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,970
I won't.

65
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,720
Hello.

66
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,090
Hello, President Tang, please wait a second.

67
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,380
Hello.

68
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,220
Mo Fei.

69
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,790
Sorry, I forgot about the time difference just now.

70
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,590
I'm not resting yet.

71
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,020
Then, what are you doing right now?

72
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,270
What else? I'm making clothes.

73
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,950
However, you haven't contacted me for the past few days.

74
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,460
What have you been up to?

75
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,770
I've been really busy at the company these days.

76
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,830
Didn't I originally promise that I would go to France to see you?

77
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:27,790
But then the corresponding company canceled, so I can't go for now.

78
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,980
Are you unhappy?

79
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,310
It's fine. Are you still at work now? Go work.

80
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,390
I also need to go make clothes. Bye-bye.

81
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,270
Wait.

82
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,720
I want to tell you something really important.

83
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,790
What is it?

84
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,190
I...

85
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,090
really...

86
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,890
miss you.

87
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,810
I miss you, too.

88
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,690
Good night.

89
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,300
- Good night.
- Wait.

90
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,350
What is it now?

91
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:26,620
- Before going to bed, shouldn't there be some expression of affection?
- What?

92
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,440
Give me a kiss.

93
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,980
Good night.

94
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,550
Good night.

95
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,100
Yang Guang, what is it?

96
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,770
Brother Xuan, a worker took photos that day when Lu Jun entered the embroidery workshop.

97
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,560
Wait for me.

98
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,580
I never thought something like this would happen.

99
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,760
It's truly our family's misfortune.

100
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,410
It's a fact that he has done wrong.

101
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,930
He should know that what he did is illegal.

102
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,020
I know.

103
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,470
You won't sue him, right?

104
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:52,060
President Tang, I promise you

105
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,870
that I will take care of this matter regarding the embroidery pieces.

106
00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:00,000
I can also... I can have some embroidery masters from Nanjing, Yangzhou, and Suzhou come.

107
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,560
I will mend all the destroyed embroidery pieces.

108
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,030
Let's not think about these things for now.

109
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,290
Give me a little time to think this over.

110
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,640
President Tang, listen to me.

111
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,570
I'll pay for all the losses. I will also promise you

112
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:20,110
that all the work will be done before the press conference for the new releases.

113
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,690
I'm begging you.

114
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,210
Master Li, with Lu Jun doing such a thing this time,

115
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:34,690
you don't know what he'll do in the future.

116
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:39,040
Today, no matter what, we should give him some kind of punishment. Right?

117
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,320
Drink some water.

118
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,630
As long as you don't sue him,

119
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,290
I'll agree to

120
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,610
all of your requests, President Tang.

121
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,600
I beg you.

122
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,360
- Hello?
- Hey.

123
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,550
It's me.

124
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,920
What do you have planned today?

125
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,560
Work, school.

126
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,640
After that?

127
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,230
Eat. Say, everything you've just said is nonsense. I'm busy right now.

128
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,220
I'm hanging up. Bye-bye.

129
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,910
Hello?

130
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,580
Why did you hang up?

131
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:43,260
Say, you really don't know how blessed you are.

132
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,210
Are you really not going to consider that person living across from us?

133
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:51,570
The two of us can only be ordinary friends.

134
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,250
Heaven, please bless me with such a considerate

135
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,160
and handsome ordinary friend.

136
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,710
Open the door.

137
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,300
You go.

138
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,070
For sure it's someone looking for you.

139
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,280
That ordinary friend of yours.

140
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,720
You are so cruel.

141
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,370
He treats you so well.

142
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,630
Mo Fei, why did you hang up on me?

143
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:23,530
Didn't I tell you I'm busy?

144
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,500
Even your Chinese frog fasteners

145
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,380
and contrasting color stitching have characteristics specific to you.

146
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,830
The ruffles on the waist are a great transition between the connecting pieces.

147
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:45,370
They alleviate the hard contour of Western tailoring.

148
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,520
It also makes the waistline more graceful.

149
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,890
The fabric is perfectly straight and elegant at the baseline.

150
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,250
The baseline flows smoothly.

151
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:02,530
The inner and outer stitchings are meticulous as well as uniform. The stitches are closely sewn.

152
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:05,620
This kind of waistline can enhance one's figure.

153
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,990
I thought I wouldn't find any flaw.

154
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,240
You need to add a layer of lining around the waist.

155
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,110
That way there is better absorption of sweat.

156
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,860
Where the body touches the material, it will feel much more comfortable. Remember.

157
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:24,620
No matter what kind of clothing it is, comfort is a priority.

158
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,930
Mo Fei, if he continues to speak like this,

159
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,060
I'm going to want to dump my Cheng Yang.

160
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,400
If you could lift the waistline two centimeters higher, it would be more elegant.

161
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,560
That will make this outfit more perfect.

162
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,290
Don't worry, this outfit will certainly get a high mark from André.

163
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:51,470
But if I raise the waistline by two centimeters,

164
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,290
wouldn't it look unfashionable?

165
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,660
Unfashionable? How would it be unfashionable?

166
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:59,470
Let's not talk about whether it's fashionable. I'm saying...

167
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,590
If I raise it by two centimeters, then it won't be the style I want.

168
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,350
I want to make clothes in my own style

169
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:09,050
and not in a conventional style.

170
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,320
Do you... not trust my professionalism?

171
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,670
No. I agree with all the previous points you have made about my shortcomings.

172
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:20,910
I just want to keep my stance on this particular matter.

173
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,990
All right. Very good.

174
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,750
Thank you.

175
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,330
Mo Fei, you still owe me a meal. Right?

176
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,440
I'll treat you another day.

177
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,330
Which day?

178
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,540
Another day when we are all free.

179
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,230
Also, thank you for your suggestions on this.

180
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,150
I am going to change it right now.

181
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,890
When you're busy, you can't see anyone around you! I admire you! I'm leaving now!

182
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,950
- Bye-bye, thank you!
- Are you leaving already?

183
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,460
Bye-bye.

184
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,570
You are so cruel.

185
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,930
Duoduo.

186
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,720
Mingyuan Fashion is the industry's standard.

187
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,260
It's also the platform that all young people dream of having.

188
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:11,600
I am no exception. I hope I can showcase myself on this platform.

189
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,220
Manager Hu.

190
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,020
Help me get these done as soon as possible.

191
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,750
All right.

192
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,790
- You?
- Do you two know each other?

193
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,230
Yes. She's Pan Su's student

194
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:28,050
and participated in our company's Chinese Style Fashion Contest.

195
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,050
How come you want to work in our company?

196
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,730
I know that Mingyuan Fashion

197
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,830
has high requirements for those who want to join it,

198
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:37,010
especially for a recent graduate like me. I'm also not outstanding enough.

199
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,310
However, that is exactly what motivates me to work hard.

200
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,810
You all should already know.

201
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:47,320
I think that our design department should have some new additions.

202
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,850
Therefore, I have decided to go to Paris

203
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:53,400
to see some designers who have just won awards.

204
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:58,290
Xueling, I will leave the designers in Milan for you to see.

205
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,160
All right.

206
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,100
Our design department might experience changes in personnel,

207
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,730
but no matter what changes there are,

208
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:06,600
Director Xia will still be the core of it.

209
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:37,730
Director Xia, these are the resumes of all those who passed today's interview.

210
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,370
How many have passed it?

211
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,250
Thirty people.

212
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,220
By the way,

213
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,440
do you still remember the designer Shen Jiaxi?

214
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,900
[Resume - Shen Jiaxi]

215
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,600
[Shen Jiaxi]

216
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,020
This is a participant of our Chinese Style Fashion Contest, right?

217
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,030
Yes, that's her.

218
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:08,430
Honestly, based on her qualifications she should be disqualified.

219
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:12,320
But I thought it over and let her pass the initial review.

220
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,440
It will be up to you to decide whether we keep her in the running.

221
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,990
This is Mo Fei's classmate, right?

222
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,960
Yes, exactly.

223
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,140
Not bad.

224
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:30,120
Also, I think there are some things you don't need to worry so much about.

225
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,710
Look. In today's meeting, President Tang announced

226
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:36,500
that no matter what designer gets in, you will still be the core.

227
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,950
It clearly shows that he knows how important you are.

228
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:40,800
Is that so?

229
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,890
Yes.

230
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:44,990
I think he is not clear enough about that.

231
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,440
Let's do this. Ask this Shen Jiaxi to come and see me.

232
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,430
Okay.

233
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:51,240
By the way, I'm going to make a trip to Milan in a few days.

234
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,290
I'll leave the design department to you.

235
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,330
Don't worry about it.

236
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,560
Give us back the necklace!

237
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,180
You can't come in! T-This is illegal!

238
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,870
- Let me go!
- Hurry! Hurry.

239
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,020
This is illegal!

240
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,830
Mo Fei!

241
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,610
What is going on?

242
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:50,100
They're the ones who are saying I'm a thief.

243
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,760
Stop! The necklace is not here!

244
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,560
Stop!

245
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,520
Hello, Cheng Yang. It has been a long time. Have you been doing well?

246
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,760
These two girls are my friends.

247
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,790
She really didn't steal your necklace.

248
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,630
Why are you so sure about it?

249
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:14,280
I have never lied to you before, you know that well.

250
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,510
Please let them go.

251
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:22,250
Okay, but only for tonight.

252
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:31,570
Cheng Yang, what are you two doing?

253
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,730
Your girlfriend is really noisy and ugly.

254
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,790
Goodbye.

255
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:57,130
Mo Fei, what did that girl say to Cheng Yang just now?

256
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,880
Translate.

257
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,180
Cheng Yang said that I didn't steal the necklace and that they've misunderstood me.

258
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,630
I am not talking about that. What did she say about me?

259
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:11,290
That sentence with "copine."

260
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,890
Duoduo.

261
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,710
Speak!

262
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,450
She said you're ugly and noisy.

263
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,550
Duoduo, Betty...

264
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:27,610
She was spouting nonsense and didn't think before speaking.

265
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:29,120
Betty?

266
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,530
You're saying her name so affectionately. For how long have you known each other?

267
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,780
- Duoduo! Let me explain.
- Don't touch me! You have just kissed her!

268
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,320
Duoduo, let me explain!

269
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,980
This is what happened.

270
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,950
During my first year in France, I lived in Betty's house, so that's how we know each other.

271
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,720
Didn't you tell me it was a homestay?

272
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,960
It was! Her family is in the hardware business.

273
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,560
During my free time, I used to deliver goods for them. In the end, it was too tiring, so I stopped living there.

274
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,990
You're so high-sounding even now. Delivered goods?

275
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,550
From what I saw, she doesn't view you that simply.

276
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,930
Duoduo, think about it.

277
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:07,430
If I wanted to do something (cheat), why would I let you come here to France?

278
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,720
That woman already kissed you in front of me,

279
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,170
yet you're still lying!

280
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,770
You just saw how sudden the situation was!

281
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,050
She was sowing discord between us!

282
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,660
But you two kissed!

283
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,250
- Leave.
- Duoduo.

284
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,690
- Listen to me!
- Leave, leave!

285
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,190
Cheng Yang, leave!

286
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:25,520
I am not leaving! You know how much I love you!

287
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,280
I say, you two calm down a bit.

288
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,670
Help me take good care of her.

289
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,090
If you have time, help me talk to her.

290
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,920
I will do what I should.

291
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,600
You go back and calm down, and let Duoduo calm down as well.

292
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,870
I will leave then.

293
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:08,980
Duoduo, it's quite hot. Drink slower.

294
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,320
I want to have another one!

295
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,600
Duoduo, this hot chocolate is quite fattening.

296
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,460
What is there to be afraid of?

297
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,500
I am broken-hearted anyway. Let me tell you... From today onwards,

298
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,500
I'm going to drink and eat as much as I want.

299
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,260
I don't want to lose weight for Cheng Yang anymore!

300
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,760
Fine, fine. Then do you feel a bit happier after drinking that?

301
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,160
I am extremely happy. I have never been so happy!

302
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:48,930
Don't drink so much of this. This is really fattening.

303
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,590
Why... is she smiling at me?

304
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:54,320
- That girl. She's smiling at me.
- Who?

305
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,920
She's coming in. She's coming in.

306
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:01,030
This is Meng Jing, the classmate I told you about.

307
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,010
Let me do the introduction. This is Duoduo. This is Meng Jing.

308
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,450
- Hello, Duoduo.
- Hello.

309
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:07,170
Mo Fei mentioned you to me before.

310
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:10,010
Mo Fei, today's tour is very important. Let's hurry there.

311
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:12,030
Or else, we'll be late.

312
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,750
How about you go first? I will stay with Duoduo for a bit longer.

313
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,310
It's fine. Go do what you have to.

314
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,590
You don't need to stay with me.

315
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:23,830
How is that okay? With your current state, I'm worried.

316
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,400
Look... It's rare for me to get out of a relationship.

317
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,430
You should give me a chance to meet handsome boys, right?

318
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:33,680
If a handsome guy shows up, then you'll be in my way.

319
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,730
I'm leaving then.

320
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,630
If anything happens, send me a WeChat message.

321
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,450
- So pretty.
- Mo Fei.

322
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,840
Didn't you say you weren't interested and weren't coming? Or did you miss me?

323
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:19,120
You are overthinking. Our visit is organized by the school.

324
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:23,170
Did you come to our school to look for Mo Fei before? I think I've seen you before.

325
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,800
Yes, I'm the fashion director at Cayman Group, Fang Xiaoyu.

326
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,550
Hello, I'm Meng Jing.

327
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,320
Let me show you guys around.

328
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,450
It's okay, we can look around by ourselves.

329
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,940
I heard that you will get graded.

330
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,570
If I show you around, surely it'll double the result with half the effort. Right?

331
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:42,010
Mo Fei, we don't know the way anyway.

332
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:45,250
Just let Director Fang show us around.

333
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,970
Look! This is Cayman Group's headquarters in France.

334
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:50,220
Nineteenth-century architecture.

335
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,350
In approximately 1946,

336
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:55,690
Cayman officially moved into this building.

337
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:58,590
1946?

338
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,130
In 1945, Germany surrendered.

339
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:06,090
Paris then entered a period of recovery.

340
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:10,230
It was also the time when Cayman thrived and grew.

341
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,500
- Mo Fei, I'm going to take this call.
- Okay.

342
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,260
Hey, look at the architecture over there.

343
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,930
Architecture from the 19th-century

344
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:25,030
is quite different, right? Very artistic.

345
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:30,190
Mo Fei, something came up with where I'm staying, so I need to go back and take care of it.

346
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:32,520
- Do you need me to help?
- It's fine. You can continue to look around.

347
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,630
If I'm done early, I'll come back to find you.

348
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:38,280
When you're done, you can go to my office to find Mo Fei.

349
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,610
Okay.

350
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:43,040
I'm leaving first then. Bye-bye.

351
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,310
- Bye.
- Call if you need anything.

352
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,470
I'll continue to tell you about it.

353
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:51,130
Why did you decide for me?

354
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:53,600
You can't stay and wait here, can you? It's so cold.

355
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,330
You'll have to wait for her in my office for sure.

356
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:00,010
I'll continue the introduction for you then.

357
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:02,770
Actually, this architecture is especially mysterious.

358
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:07,400
In the morning sunlight, it looks especially like a rich French lady,

359
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,030
noble and romantic. At noon,

360
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:13,570
it looks like a well-mannered English gentleman,

361
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:17,720
imbued with an aristocratic air all over him that makes him inaccessible.

362
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,630
It's even more interesting at night.

363
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,830
Under the shine of opulent lights, it's especially

364
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,870
like a glittering Hollywood star,

365
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:27,060
mysterious and alluring.

366
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,740
Say, you use very accurate terms.

367
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:33,430
Let me tell you. A mature designer must use all kinds of ways

368
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,950
to describe his work.

369
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,390
Just imagine.

370
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:42,000
Cayman at midnight, without the boisterous crowd

371
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,020
and with shining, opulent lights,

372
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,030
doesn't it look like it's waiting for

373
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,140
the love that it's been yearning for?

374
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:53,640
Meandering, lonely,... just like me.

375
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,030
Doesn't it seem like me?

376
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:59,060
It's very cold out here. Shall we go inside?

377
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:03,310
You're so good at ruining the mood. Let's go inside.

378
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,150
I'll show you around for a bit longer.

379
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:32,060
After that, I'll take you to see my French boss, Ansel. Let's go.

380
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:36,170
[Cayman]

381
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:39,400
The floor we were just on, had all designing rooms.

382
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,530
This floor is mainly offices. The conference room is over there.

383
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,900
- Hello.
- Hello.

384
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,130
The boss is probably in the office up ahead.

385
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:50,710
- Hey, nice to see you.
- Hello, Fang.

386
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,630
- Long time no see.
- Yeah.

387
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,460
Hello.

388
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,680
The women here are from all over the world.

389
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,180
What they have in common is being strong, without making others feel hateful.

390
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,730
Their greatest characteristic is that they are full of passion.

391
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,430
Let's go.

392
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,230
Okay, bye-bye.

393
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,070
- Hey.
- Hey.

394
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,700
Xiao, I'm so happy that you can come.

395
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,650
Sorry, I couldn't go welcome you.

396
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:21,840
- I'm sorry, really.
- It's fine.

397
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,460
You know how to speak Chinese?

398
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,670
Yes. He has a Shanghainese wife.

399
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,820
I am Shanghainese.
 (spoken in Shanghai dialect)

400
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,830
Hello, I'm Mo Fei.

401
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:33,610
By the way, you wanted me to come, is something going on?

402
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,300
Don't be anxious so quickly

403
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,330
You haven't introduced this beauty to me yet.

404
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,770
Is she your girlfriend?

405
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,860
No, no! We are neighbors.

406
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,810
Yes, she is my neighbor, Mo Fei.

407
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:48,570
This is Ansel, my French boss. This is Mo Fei.

408
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,680
She just entered ECSCP.
 (School Of Chambre Syndicale De La Couture Parisienne (École de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne))

409
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,910
She is André's student right now.

410
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,830
It's not easy to be André's student.

411
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,820
You flatter me.

412
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:02,330
However, your outfit looks very nice.

413
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:04,300
Where is it from?

414
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,390
I made this myself.

415
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,270
It's designed really well.

416
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,300
I like it a lot.

417
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,490
Look! We're great friends.

418
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:17,400
If you need anything, come to me. Okay?

419
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,250
Thank you.

420
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:23,150
Are you ready? Some good news.

421
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:26,540
You, my friend, will become Chief Designer.

422
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,000
- Really?
- Yes.

423
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,930
You must attend next season's Cayman couture release conference.

424
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,370
- Okay?
- Okay, no problem.

425
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,050
- Use the opportunity well.
- Okay.

426
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:36,270
We all have faith in you.

427
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,590
My office.

428
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,590
Take a look around.

429
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,980
This is where I reached the top.

430
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,780
- Can I see?
- Sure.

431
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:56,860
I can tell that Ansel likes you a lot.

432
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:01,810
Trust me. He is famous for being sharp-eyed and difficult to deal with.

433
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:06,450
Just by looking at his facial expression when he saw your dress, one could tell how much he liked you.

434
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:10,140
What do you think? Are you interested in coming to Cayman to work together?

435
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,920
I already told you that I don't want to think too much about that.

436
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,930
Besides, the school work is already so heavy that I can hardly breathe.

437
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,890
It's not because of Tang Mingxuan, is it?

438
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:25,390
If it's because of him, I will look down on you.

439
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:30,180
I've already told you. It has nothing to do with him.

440
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,660
Then stay.

441
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:36,710
Indeed, a company like Cayman is

442
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,970
a rare opportunity for someone like me.

443
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:41,520
But you also know that I still have two years until I graduate.

444
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,770
I don't want to make a choice so early.

445
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:47,700
I believe there will be other suitable places for me in the future.

446
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:56,870
Mo Fei, I think your current problem is that you think too much.

447
00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:00,610
I think that if there's an opportunity, you should grab it.

448
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:03,200
An opportunity may come, but not when you ask for it.

449
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,390
If you miss it, with your creativity

450
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,630
and insight,

451
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,950
there won't be room for you to grow.

452
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:16,870
But, I think that one should create one's own opportunity.

453
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:26,040
Meng Jing is looking for me. Then... I'll get going.

454
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,820
Hello, Meng Jing, where are you?

455
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,780
Sorry, Mo Fei, I can't get away from here.

456
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,150
I won't go to meet up with you.

457
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,080
It's fine. You just do what you need to.

458
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,270
We'll get in touch back at school.

459
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:47,830
- See you later.
- Bye-bye.

Don't worry.

I'm already an adult. Why do you guys nag so much?

How can I not worry about you?

If working at the bar is too hard, then don't go.

Here, when you are walking on the road,

even the air smells like time has walked by (rich in history).

Nice! You're indeed different since you've gone to France.

00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:59,940
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

483
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,340
- Mo Fei.
- Yes.

484
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,980
How about I give you a ride in a bit?

485
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,090
It's fine. I can get back on my own.

486
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:10,240
Then... I'm leaving.

487
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,780
Okay.

488
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:20,130
Why don't you make any sounds?

489
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:23,670
- Was that Sister Mo Fei just now?
- Yes.

490
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:26,460
Then, why did I see Fang Xiaoyu there as well?

491
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,420
Was he? You must have been mistaken.

492
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,770
Impossible. I watched for a while behind your back.

493
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:33,090
I saw it very clearly. It was Fang Xiaoyu.

494
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:36,890
Tell me. Are they together?

495
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,660
Wait.

496
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,430
You're not thinking about secretly reporting this to your brother, right?

497
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,990
I won't be fooled this time.

498
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:49,000
Why would I secretly report this? I just care about Sister Mo Fei.

499
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,030
Just tell me.

500
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:58,820
Okay then. Since you won't tell, let's talk about us.

501
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,090
Us?

502
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,800
That's right. About our matters.

503
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,150
What matters do we have?

504
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:06,010
We have plenty of matters. Let's go. I'll take you somewhere.

505
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:09,710
Where? Don't you need to go home today?

506
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,800
If I leave, what will you do then?

507
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,210
Look at your little aggrieved expression.

508
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:16,420
I, your older sister, will take you to eat something good.

509
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,490
How am I aggrieved? I am just fine.

510
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:22,590
Let's go. Just... Just think of it as keeping me company, okay?

511
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:26,560
I'm about to starve to death. If I die, will you take responsibility?

512
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,120
Okay, okay. You are so strange today.

513
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,460
Let's go. Go, go, go.

514
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,000
Don't drink so much.

515
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,500
Do you know how many calories there are in one beer?

516
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,000
I know. The same as one bowl of white rice.

517
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I haven't eaten well for days now.

518
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,400
There must be some happiness in life.

519
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:52,000
No, you will get drunk.

520
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,400
I'll get drunk then.

521
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,200
I'm very light. You can just take me to my home.

522
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,400
I'm not going to your home.

523
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,800
It's the middle of the night, would I carry a drunk you home?

524
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,400
Aunt will kill me!

525
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,400
Chicken.

526
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,000
Why aren't you willing to go home? Isn't it quite lively?

527
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,700
It's not that lively.

528
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,800
But it sure has a lot of rules.

529
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,300
Just think... When you are at home,

530
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,600
aren't you annoyed that they boss you around?

531
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,900
It may have been a little like that before.

532
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,600
But ever since my sister went to France,

533
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,200
I think it feels quite nice when someone is bossing me around.

534
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,600
My sister bosses me around because she's trying to take care of me.

535
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,400
On the contrary, I didn't do anything for her.

536
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,900
You are the younger brother. It's natural that the older sister takes care of the younger brother.

537
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:44,300
But I've already grown up, and I'm the only man in the family.

538
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,000
If I don't take care of them, who will?

539
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,800
Your older sister is so independent.

540
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,400
She doesn't need you to take care of her. You only need to take care of yourself.

541
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,400
Besides, you are working hard too.

542
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:59,200
You are the up-and-coming junior whom Linda looks most fondly upon.

543
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,700
Thank you for consoling me.

544
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,000
It's no big deal.

545
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,300
It's your birthday today. The least I can do is say some nice words.

546
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,200
How did you know today was my birthday?

547
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,600
How can I not know such a trivial matter?

548
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,900
Besides, isn't it written on your WeChat profile?

549
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,000
Okay, a toast!

550
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,060
My sister used to celebrate my birthday with me every year.

551
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
But that busy person seems to have forgotten this year.

552
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,800
Who was the one that just said he was a man?

553
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,400
Now you're complaining?

554
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,200
Quickly, quickly, there's still time! Let's sing the birthday song.

555
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,600
I'm not going to sing it. Children sing that.

556
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,800
Since you won't sing, then I will sing.

557
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:15,500
♪ Happy Birthday to You ♪
♪ Happy Birthday to You ♪
♪ Happy Birthday to You ♪
♪ Happy Birthday to You ♪

558
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,100
Mo Fan, from now on, I will celebrate every one of

559
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,000
your birthdays with you.

560
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,400
Thank you.

561
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,800
Why are these two people lying here?

562
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,800
This morning, when I passed by, I already saw these two lying here.

563
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,600
The cleaning workers found them early in the morning.

564
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,000
I don't know what's going on.

565
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,200
The police are here. The police are here.

566
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,000
The police are here.

567
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,100
The police are here.

568
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,400
Who called the police?

569
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
I did.

570
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,800
When I came this morning, I saw these two people lying here.

571
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,800
I didn't know what's going on, so I called the police.

572
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,800
How are they? Are they okay?

573
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,300
They're probably drunk. They stink of alcohol.

574
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,400
They must have drunk a lot.

575
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,800
Young lad! Young lad, wake up!

576
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,600
Young lad!

577
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,410
Miss! Hey!

578
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:42,400
Wake up!

579
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,400
Miss!

580
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,200
The bag. There's a phone in the bag.

581
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,430
Hello.

582
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:57,020
I'm the police. May I ask what's your relationship with the phone's owner?

583
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,200
It's nothing. They're probably drunk.

584
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,200
Please come pick them up.

585
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,400
- Hello.
- Hello.

586
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,600
Are you here to pick them up?

587
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,000
Luckily nothing serious happened.

588
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,200
She is just a girl.

589
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,700
Your brother is here.

590
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,000
That's all then.

591
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,600
Thanks.

592
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,600
Okay then. Let's leave.

593
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,200
Older Cousin...

594
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,900
Older Cousin.

595
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
What's happened to you two?

596
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,000
This... It's not our fault.

597
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,400
It's really not our fault.

598
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,000
You got drunk and slept here for the night. If it's not your fault,

599
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,800
is it my fault?

600
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,200
It's your fault.

601
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,400
Sister Mo Fei isn't in the country so shouldn't you help her take care of her younger brother?

602
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,200
Yesterday was Mo Fan's birthday.

603
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,400
You two are something.

604
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,400
One goes to have fun with Brother Xiaoyu.

605
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,200
The other only knows how to scold us here.

606
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,400
Don't say that.

607
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,800
It's the truth.

608
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,600
Not caring about others like this,

609
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,000
be careful, Sister Mo Fei may be abducted by my Brother Xiaoyu.

610
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,400
Come here. Come here.

611
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,600
That... I'm wrong.

612
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,200
Come here.

613
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,600
You made a mistake, yet you're here reasoning with me?

614
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,200
Get in the car.

615
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,500
What a coincidence!

616
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,200
We are truly connected at heart.

617
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,000
Didn't we just coincidentally meet at a market? How is that connected at heart?

618
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,600
Of course, we're connected at heart. Look! There are so many people here, and I've never run into Mi Duoduo.

619
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,000
But I ran into you.

620
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
It is quite coincidental.

621
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,200
Why are you always avoiding me?

622
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,800
I'm not avoiding you. I'm going that way to buy something.

623
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,410
You're buying a hammer?

624
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:31,600
How are things with Tang Mingxuan now? Are things between you young couple

625
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,200
going smoothly?

626
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,000
Hey, why are you as nosy as Duoduo?

627
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,400
I'm just caring about you.

628
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,600
Say, Tang Mingxuan sure is big-hearted.

629
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,800
He was also hit by those three brothers last time.

630
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,800
Why doesn't he care at all about your safety?

631
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:56,000
He has business to take care of. Do you think everyone is as idle as you are?

632
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,800
Am I idle? I'm really not.

633
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,200
Think carefully. If he really loves you that much

634
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,600
and he has you in his heart, shouldn't he drop everything for you?

635
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,300
Stop sowing discord.

636
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,400
I'm really not sowing discord.

637
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,400
Really? I've been hired?

638
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,800
I already noticed you when you participated in the Chinese Style Fashion competition.

639
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,800
I really like that design you created.

640
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,400
It's called Tung Blossom at Sea, right?

641
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,500
You remember that? Do you really remember it?

642
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,100
Of course.

643
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,000
Your work made people feel very comfortable and carefree.

644
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I've always liked styles like yours

645
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,600
where someone can tell what you're trying to convey with one look. Simple and clear.

646
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:42,000
However, this isn't the only reason I hired you.

647
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,200
Frankly, having natural talent isn't the most important to me.

648
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:50,000
What I regard even more importantly are a person's character and self-cultivation.

649
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,300
Don't misunderstand. I'm not saying that you aren't naturally talented.

650
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,800
It's because there is no exact definition of talent in the field of fashion.

651
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,000
Different wise men see different pearls of wisdom.

652
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,800
That's why in fashion design, experience is more important than talent.

653
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,200
Whether you can obtain experience, will depend on your long-term endurance

654
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,400
and degree of humility.

655
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,700
As long as you are steadfast, willing to work, and practical,

656
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:23,200
the experience that you need, as well as the platform to showcase the design,

657
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,600
can be given to you by Mingyuan.

658
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,800
Do you understand what I'm saying?

659
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,300
Thank you, Director Xia! I'll work hard.

660
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,700

667
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,800
♫ The unintentional sparkle of the planetesimal ♫

668
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:19,800
♫ The fine rain that's sprinkled in front of the flower ♫

00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:24,600
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

670
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:29,400
♫ Like a shy water lotus that bows to a cool breeze ♫

671
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:34,200
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:03,400
♫ You're like the ivory field after snowflakes ♫

676
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:07,800
♫ You're the round moon every night ♫

677
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,600
♫ You're the naïve ♫

678
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:17,800
♫ white lotus that floats on the water ripples of your dream ♫

679
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:23,200
♫ You're the flower blossoms of tree after tree ♫

680
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,400
♫ The swallow twittering within the beams ♫

681
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,800
♫ You are love, hope, and warmth ♫

682
