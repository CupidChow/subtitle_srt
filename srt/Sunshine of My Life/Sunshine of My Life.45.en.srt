00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,800
[Episode 45]

3
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,430
Qiren, we haven't heard from Mingxuan

4
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,000
for several days now.

5
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,900
Nothing's wrong, right?

6
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,000
He is not a child anymore. Why are you worried?

7
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,400
That's why men and women are different.

8
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,800
The saying goes, "Raise a child to be a hundred years old and worry for 99 years."

9
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,900
That's why you worry. Just keep worrying.

10
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,000
It's useless to worry anyway. This son was raised for nothing.

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,200
All he thinks about is Mo Fei. I have no place in his heart.

12
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,100
What about Zhu Zhu?

13
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,700
She said she wasn't coming back to eat dinner.

14
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,400
But she didn't say she wasn't coming back to sleep.

15
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,800
That's right. What time is it now?

16
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,800
Let's call her.

17
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,000
This restaurant is quite good.

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,600
- Are you cold?
- Yes.

19
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,800
Are your hands cold? Put them in my pocket.

20
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,800
- Wait for me a little.
- Okay.

21
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,600
Hello, Auntie.

22
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,000
Where are you? It's so late. Why aren't you back?

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,800
I was just eating with a friend. Now that we've eaten, I'll be going home.

24
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,400
What friend? Do I know them?

25
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,790
It's that... that friend from the modeling company.

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,100
Okay, then come home soon.

27
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,000
You're a girl. We're worried about you when you're outside.

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Understood. Don't worry. I'll go back right away.

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,900
Who are you talking on the phone with?

30
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,780
Who's that, Zhu Zhu?

31
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,400
Hurry and come back right now!

32
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,000
Auntie, I...

33
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,400
- Auntie?
- Auntie.

34
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm doomed! What do I do?

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,800
I need to hurry home.

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'll take you.

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,200
What's wrong?

38
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,800
I heard a male voice. It sounded like Mo Fei's younger brother.

39
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,400
Mo Fei's younger brother?

40
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,000
What's going on with our children?

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,200
They are always entangled with that family.

42
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,200
Yes... Maybe it means that their family's children have many good qualities.

43
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,800
What good qualities?

44
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,600
Taking Zhu Zhu out to eat in the middle of the night and not bring her back here. That's good quality?

45
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,200
Then shouldn't you also think, why is it that

46
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,700
the children you raised end up liking that family's children?

47
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,600
Let's sleep. I misspoke just now.

48
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,700
Didn't you teach the children, too? Did I teach them by myself?

49
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,900
It's all my fault.

50
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,200
Hurry. It's late. Let's sleep now.

51
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,100
- That other one is even more annoying.
- Yes.

52
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,200
She kidnapped Mingxuan so that we don't see him for days.

53
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,600
Those two children.

54
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,060
- You scared me!
- Did you miss me?

55
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,200
Why did you suddenly come back? I was so scared.

56
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,600
You're pressing me down.

57
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,000
Why are you wearing so much at home?

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,800
Come.

59
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Why did you suddenly come back?

60
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Do you know how hard it's been for me these days?

61
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,600
Staying by myself in our marital home after getting married.

62
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,400
I was so lonely every day.

63
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,000
Haven't I returned now? I'm back!

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,600
As soon as I opened the door today, my wifey was in the room.

65
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
This is a really happy feeling.

66
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,200
I feel happy, too.

67
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,500
I finally get to see you.

68
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,200
What did you say before?

69
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,000
Shouldn't you pay me back properly?

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,800
Isn't that right?

71
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,400
You want to run away?

72
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,000
Brother-in-Law is probably busy now.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,930
What could he be busy with?

74
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,600
At most he is clinging with your sister.

75
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,800
But I think it's useless even if he answers his phone.

76
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,200
Do you think your aunt will listen to him?

77
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,300
But he knows how to deal with my aunt.

78
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,200
He's the best at using all sorts of ways to anger my aunt.

79
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,800
Anger... No.

80
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,800
I want your aunt to accept me. Why would I anger her?

81
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,000
That's true. I'm so muddled.

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,800
What do we do then? Without my cousin,

83
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,000
I really don't know how to deal with my aunt.

84
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,900
She might peel your skin and eat you alive.

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,400
No way. Really?

86
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,800
How about... we elope?

87
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,400
Elope?

88
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,500
If we leave Shanghai, no one will interfere with us then. Let's go!

89
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,200
Wait.

90
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,910
Lu Zhu, we want to

91
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,200
properly date and continue long-term.

92
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,200
How can we elope?

93
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,200
Let's do this.

94
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,400
I'm going to see your aunt and uncle now.

95
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,400
Are they both here?

96
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,400
Yes. My aunt is home every day.

97
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,800
My uncle hasn't been healthy lately, so he rarely goes out.

98
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,100
I also secretly asked Nanny Wu just now. She said my aunt hasn't been in a good mood lately.

99
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,400
She is very irritable and yells at people for the littlest of things.

100
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,800
That scary?

101
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,100
What? Do you not dare to go in now?

102
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,000
If you don't dare to go in, we will elope.

103
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,200
Stop saying elope. If your aunt hears it, we're dead.

104
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,000
Are you going in or not?

105
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,600
Yes!

106
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,800
Aunt and Uncle, I'd like to formally introduce to you.

107
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,000
This is my boyfriend, Mo Fan.

108
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,700
We were born in the same year.

109
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,800
We previoiusly met when we were models in Cayman.

110
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,700
He is preparing to enter the entertainment field.

111
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:51,600
As for the rest, like family background, you already know about it.

112
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,000
You've said it all.

113
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Did you bring a little mute home today?

114
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Let him talk for himself.

115
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,500
Auntie, I can talk. I'm not a mute person.

116
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,300
Auntie?

117
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,600
I'm Lu Zhu's auntie. You can call me "Madam."
 (Gu Ma and A Yi are both translated as Aunt. But here, Madam is used to show the difference)

118
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,300
Yes, Madam.

119
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,400
Auntie, don't bully him.

120
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,200
Can I not say anything? How long have you been together?

121
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,600
Your elbow is pushing out. (taking the outsider's side)

122
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,900
Look at this kid. He is so nervous.

123
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,000
You are Mo Fan, right?

124
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,300
You... drink some water. Don't be nervous.

125
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,200
Here, sit down.

126
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,000
Auntie has a tongue sharp as a blade, but her heart is soft as tofu.

127
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,800
Just listen when she is talking.

128
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,300
Thank you, Uncle.

129
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'll be frank then.

130
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,400
Zhu Zhu has had an ill fate since she was a child.

131
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,600
Her parents died early. Even though she is my niece,

132
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,000
but her uncle and I raised her since she was young.

133
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,200
In our hearts, she is our own daughter.

134
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,600
Therefore, we make the decisions about everything in Zhu Zhu's life.

135
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,200
We think...

136
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,400
These two are okay together. The prerequisite is that

137
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,200
this guy likes Zhu Zhu and Zhu Zhu also likes him.

138
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,600
I haven't agreed yet.

139
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,000
Let the kids decide on the kids' own affairs.

140
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,200
When we were dating, didn't your parents disagree, too?

141
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,000
Besides, we should learn from what happened with Mingxuan.

142
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,600
Uncle is right.

143
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,200
Is it right to pamper you and spoil you?

144
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,600
I've raised you for nothing after all these years, you little white-eyed wolf. (ungrateful)

145
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,000
Auntie, don't be upset.

146
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,400
They all say that a daughter is her parents' intimate little quilted jacket.

147
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,600
Even though I'm not your biological child,

148
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,300
but I can at least be considered a padded cotton vest?

149
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,400
You are a sweet talker.

150
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,400
I know that

151
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,140
Auntie is concerned about me and doesn't want me to suffer.

152
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,200
But I've already grown up.

153
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,400
I can tell who is sincere towards me.

154
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,200
Even though I always bully him, he has always tolerated me.

155
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,400
He is also very aspirational.

156
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,800
What else can you complain about?

157
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,600
Besides, you know my personality.

158
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,000
I've been pampered by you since young, so I'm more willful. Right?

159
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,200
If you deliberately push a wealthy heir to me,

160
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,000
it would be an uproar of jumping dogs and flying chickens within just a couple of days.

161
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,400
Besides, my cousin is always so busy at work and doesn't have time to spend with you.

162
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,000
Now it will be better, with me and Mo Fan here.

163
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
The two of us will come and spend time with you two whenever we are free. Won't that be great?

164
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That is great. What Zhu Zhu said is great. She has matured.

165
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,800
This is an improvement. I think her improvement is related to Mo Fan.

166
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,200
Isn't that right? Thank you.

167
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,400
Okay, okay. A grown-up girl can't be forced to stay.

168
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,600
But, young man, listen well.

169
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,200
If you bully her, our family won't spare you.

170
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,400
Madam, don't worry.

171
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,200
You can call me auntie now.

172
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,600
Thank you, Auntie.

173
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,800
- Thank you, Uncle.
- Good.

174
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,630
Hello, Xiaoyu.

175
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,350
Hello, Xueling.

176
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,330
What have you been busy with lately? There are not many updates on your WeChat Moments.

177
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,220
I'm working out right now.

178
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,060
Let's have some drinks when you are free.

179
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,710
Are you in a bad mood?

180
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:24,170
No, I... just miss you.

181
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,240
All right. Send me the address.

182
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,080
This shop is nice.
[Mo Fei's Shop]

183
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,240
Look at this.

184
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,220
- Sister!
- Hello!
- You're here!

185
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,810
- Hurry in.
- You're here.
- Take a look.

186
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,290
What do you think of our shop?

187
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,500
Wow. This outfit looks so nice.

188
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,080
I'll buy it for you if you like it. I can also show support for my sister.

189
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,270
Mo Fei sewed this by hand.

190
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,960
Doesn't it look so radiant?

191
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,200
I gave this outfit the name of "Faraway Mountain." What do you think?

192
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,850
So tacky.

193
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,570
What? How can you say that?

194
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:02,190
I don't care about the name at all.

195
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,850
I just care if you have enough stock.

196
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,310
Don't let what happened last time happen again. Let me tell you.

197
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,910
We just put them on the rack and they were all sold out.

198
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,540
I don't want to be the annoying woman rushing the manufacturers.

199
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,360
But you also know that this kind of outfit is very complicated to make.

200
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,510
Besides, all the fabrics use natural dyes.

201
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,660
This is a limited edition. What's rare is precious.

202
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,680
Well, we can make a few more.

203
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,100
This won't do. I will have Cheng Yang help you make them.

204
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,750
What do you think?

205
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:32,430
Wait! How come Cheng Yang isn't here yet?

206
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:36,040
Let me call him. Where's my phone? My phone...

207
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,540
- What are you doing?
- Take this.

208
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,980
I'm a bit nervous. My hands are sweating.

209
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,460
What are you nervous for? Why didn't you

210
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,350
tell me earlier so I could prepare better? Look at what I'm wearing.

211
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,830
Well... Duoduo... I...

212
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,860
- I will!
- Will you marry me?
- I will!

213
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,390
Stand up. Don't be embarrassing.

214
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,610
Put the ring on. I have been busy with the proposal these few days.

215
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,020
When I was outside earlier, I thought of many things to say to you.

216
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,380
However, once I came in, I forgot everything.

217
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,260
Wow!

218
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,340
I love you.

219
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,490
I love you, too.

220
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:41,450
I'm so happy for them. They're finally getting married.

221
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:46,670
It hasn't been easy for them the last few years.

222
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,050
They are finally settling down.

223
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,530
You don't even know how hard it was for me to hide it from Duoduo.

224
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:55,210
I almost let it slip on many occasions.

225
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,230
Look at how hard it was for you.

226
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,720
Of course, it was hard.

227
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,030
There are so many things on your mind every day.

228
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,070
Is that not okay?

229
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,950
But seeing them this way,

230
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,730
I'm really happy. Cheng Yang knelt down.

231
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,970
Then look at how Duoduo was.

232
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,990
It was funny,

233
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,070
yet touching.

234
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:19,840
Was it as touching as when I proposed to you?

235
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,930
No. Of course, yours was more touching.

236
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,270
Yours was the best!

237
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,070
Sir, here's your beer.

238
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,830
Hey, handsome, are you alone?

239
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,300
Oh my. You're here.

240
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,450
What do you want to drink?

241
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,120
- Tequila Sunrise, please.
- Okay.

242
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,090
Such Western taste.

243
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,130
What's the matter? Asking me to come out.

244
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,800
Can't I ask you out for a drink for no reason?

245
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,770
I miss you. Just miss you.

246
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:09,810
Miss me? Whatever. Who knows who you're missing?

247
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:12,050
How have you been lately?

248
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,880
I've been quite well.

249
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,220
My sister has recovered.

250
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,250
My dad and I have pretty much patched things up.

251
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,140
I've also moved back home. I'm quite well.

252
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,020
Quite well?

253
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:28,560
Then, why are you out drinking alone?

254
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,330
I just want to chat with you. Let's talk.

255
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:35,510
Are you still thinking about Mo Fei?

256
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:42,900
Why would I think about her? She's so happy now, right?

257
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,060
Why are you bringing her up? Let's drink.

258
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,540
Xiaoyu, do you know? You and I are very much alike.

259
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,780
Back then, we were stuck in the whirlpool of love.

260
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,430
I think that maybe we were enjoying

261
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,350
the feeling of love.

262
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,790
What about you?

263
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,660
Have you jumped out of the whirlpool?

264
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,240
I've gotten out. Look how great I'm doing.

265
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,930
Is that so?

266
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:20,770
Actually, you must admit,

267
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:24,830
I think perhaps you still can't get over Mo Fei

268
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,510
because you haven't accepted it.

269
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:35,530
Why do you keep bringing her up? I asked you out for some drinks. My goodness.

[Mo Fei's Shop]

271
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,550
What a coincidence. Why are you here?

272
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,740
Aren't you also here?

273
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,820
Long time no see. Let me buy you dinner.

How long were you hiding there?

275
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,820
I wasn't hiding.

276
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,310
I was passing by so I went to take a look.

277

Jiaxi,

278
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,430
we've already come to this.

Can't you be more honest?

280
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,640
In any case, I wasn't just passing by.

281
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,600
I especially went to check out Mo Fei's shop.

282
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:26,540
Now that you saw it, do you feel better?

283
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,730
Before, I kept thinking

284
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:38,830
that Mo Fei was lucky.

285
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:42,200
I thought that she relied on men to succeed.

286
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:47,890
But after so many things that happened, I finally understand

287
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,840
she was a really persistent person.

288
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,500
She is passionate about fashion design.

289
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,670
Therefore, she wholeheartedly does it.

290
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,170
Thus, it is inevitable that she succeeds.

291
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:11,380
If I had also sincerely studied design back then,

292
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:16,100
perhaps the one creating brands with her would have been me.

293
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,940
Perhaps...

294
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,630
we would still be good friends now.

295
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,370
Do you hate me to death?

296
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,070
If it weren't for me back then,

297
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,910
you wouldn't be so miserable now.

298
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,320
Yes, I hate you to death.

299
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:46,550
But that was only for a period of time, after some time, I thought it through.

300
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,000
Back then, you didn't force me to do it.

301
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,970
I was possessed.

302
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,270
Everything is my own fault.

303
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,090
Yes.

304
00:19:56,090 --> 00:20:00,660
Saying all these now is too late.

305
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,480
Regret in life happens because there isn't a road to go back to the past.

306

In the future... we will be well, right?

307

What plans do you have?

308
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,740
I have been jobless for half a year now.

309
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,800
I have gone everywhere during this half-year.

310
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:28,150
Some time ago, I even shamelessly went to see Teacher Pan Su,

311
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,100
but he also cannot help.

312
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,240
So I've decided I want to leave Shanghai.

313
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,140
Change cities.

314
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,970
Or go to a mountain village to help with education.

315
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,770
What are you thinking of?

316
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:48,240
Me? I changed professions.

317
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,090
I'm taking it slowly.

318
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:55,350
I believe everything will turn out well, right?

319
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,610
Okay, thank you.

333
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:40,340
Compared to him, am I so bad?

334
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,690
You are a really outstanding designer,

335
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,920
and a very loyal friend.

336
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:49,180
In all the aspects, you are just as good as he is.

337
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:53,690
But feelings cannot be compared.

338
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,390
I admit that I really admire your talent.

339
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,810
But that's all there is.

340
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:06,260

[Mo Fei Solo Exhibition]

345
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,940
I'm very grateful to everyone who was able to come to my solo show.

346
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,740
This show was able to be completed perfectly

347
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,760
all thanks to the support of my friends

348
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,140
and my family.

349
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:41,240
Today, the person that I want to thank the most

350
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,900
is my partner, Mr. Tang Mingxuan.

351
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,930
Congratulations, Wifey.

352
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,350
Mingxuan, have you set the wedding date?

353
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:17,030
I'm just waiting for you and mom to decide it for me.

354
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,600
Your mom has a tongue sharp as a blade but a heart soft as tofu.

355
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,080
- Hello, Chairman. Hello, President. 
- Hello.

356
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,130
She is too anxious about things and wants to control everything.

357
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,830
But she means well.

358
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,950
Let's meet with her later.

359
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,720
Invite her to a meal, so that she can back off gracefully.

360
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,480
I'm relying on you then, Dad.

361
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,200
Okay. What else can I do?

362
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,290
What do you want to say?

363
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:54,150
Have you done something wrong towards me so you are so attentive in inviting me out to eat?

364
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:56,520
How could I do anything wrong towards you?

365
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,280
I'm addicted to pampering my wife.

366
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,650
It's just a meal. Come on.

367
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:04,450
Don't think that I don't know.

368
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:08,160
Aren't you treating me to a Hongmen Banquet to make me acknowledge the daughter-in-law?(Treachery is planned under the guise of a feast)

369
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,340
Look at you.

370
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:15,860
We are an old couple now. Besides, we are all one family. How can you say it's a Hongmen Banquet?

371
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,580
I just can't accept it.

372
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,120
Our family's kids are so outstanding.

373
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,980
How did they get kidnapped by that model's son and daughter?

374
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,790
Of course, your children are all outstanding.

375
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:30,460
But the children have grown up now.

376
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,830
We can't keep treating them like kids, right?

377
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:39,040
They are no longer kids, but they haven't grown up.

378
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,880
They don't have life's experiences and wisdom.

379
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,650
Once the passion of love fades, they will finally learn

380
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:46,120
that life isn't as easy as they originally thought.

381
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,540
Life is originally beautiful.

382
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,330
It should be happy.

383
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:52,830
Just like how you live every day now.

384
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:56,790
Besides, Mingxuan has been managing Mingyuan Group so well.

385
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:00,490
Lu Zhu has also done well as a model agent.

386
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:04,370
These are things that they like and chose by themselves.

387
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:06,220
We can't keep interferring.

388
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,770
Besides, they've already got their marriage license.

389
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,870
The rice is already cooked.

390
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:14,070
You just spoil them.

391
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,940
I'm also spoiling you.

392
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,950
Is that right? Will you spoil me for the rest of your life?

393
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:22,410
Of course, I must spoil you for life.

394
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:25,120
This is your favorite Mingqian tea. (Green tea picked before April, considered the best green tea)

395
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,640
You're about to see my parents. How are you feeling?

396
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,120
I'm nervous.

397
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,330
What's there to be nervous about? My parents are quite nice.

398
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,560
You're here!

399
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,020
Your mom has been waiting for you.

400
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,270
Hello, Mom and Dad.

401
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,820
- Hurry and sit.
- Come.

402
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,630
Early this morning,

403
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:10,420
your mom got prepared and arrived here an hour early.

404
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:15,040
She prepared this wine, too. Didn't you?

405
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:21,760
I haven't been sleeping well lately.

406
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,490
Come on. Mo Fei and I will toast Mom and Dad.

407
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,000
Good, good.

408
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:31,720
I wish Dad to remain handsome and healthy

409
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,420
and Mom to remain beautiful and smart forever.

410
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,790
Say something.

411
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:43,210
Then, I also wish you two to be happy forever.

412
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,360
- Thank you, Mom.
- Thank you, Mom.

413
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,980
Thank you, Dad.

414
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,210
I wish you two happiness.

415
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,310
Come. Sit down and eat.

416
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,710
Didn't you like a dress in that shop around the street corner?

417
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:07,940
I couldn't give you any feedback. Now that Mo Fei is here,

418
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,750
she can help give you some.

419
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,680
Right after we eat,

420
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,860
Mo Fei can go walk around with Mom.

421
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:17,250
- That's right.
- Mom, I'll go with you.

422
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,100
Do you know which shop it is?

423
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:23,960
It's that one in a row of stores. There was a blue one and a floral one, and she didn't know which one to choose.

424
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,920
Which one do you think Mom will be suited for?

425
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,320
Mom must look good in any dress.

426
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:33,330
That little mouth. Mom really likes this dish. Get some for her.

427
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,590
Mom, eat more.

428
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,410
You are so skinny.

429
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,010
Her mouth is sweet.

430
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:43,080
Yes.

431
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,220
Say, turns out it's so troublesome to hold a wedding.

432
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,690
What? Are you regretting it now?

433
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,730
Who says I'm regretting it?

434
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:21,170
Say, can't I just complain a little?

435
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,640
Wife,

436
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,480
tomorrow shouldn't we

437
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,450
bring out the wedding outfits we each designed

438
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,970
to have a good battle?

439
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,670
Battle?

440
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,380
Take me to the store right now.

441
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,640
I forgot something there.

442
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,870
I realize that you want to make my life difficult.

443
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,400
I-I am not making your life difficult.

444
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,860
Okay, okay! Serving my wife

445
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,090
is my duty.

446
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,890
Thank you. Thank you.

447
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:12,390
Wife, why did you bring me here at this hour?

448
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,290
Are you touched?

449
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:35,360
Why did you steal my clothing to bring here?

450
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,780
When did you find it?

451
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,630
I found it long ago.

452
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:44,480
I know you were planning on wearing it at the wedding.

453
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,920
So I made one with a similar style.

454
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,000
What do you think? Are you satisfied?

455
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,670
♫ When you feel tired, ♫

456
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:58,450
♫ I'll be your softest pillow ♫

457
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:01,370
♫ I want… ♫

458
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,920
We will look so beautiful wearing these clothes.

459
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,040
Come here.

460
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,700
♫ That I'm the inexhaustible candlelight ♫

461
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,940
♫ You're the one I love extremely ♫

462
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,000
Did you know why I designed this formal attire?

463
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:23,450
I want to listen to you explain.

464
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,690
You must know but don't want to say.

465
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:30,040
♫ Many people come and go ♫

466
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,020
We met because of Suzhou embroidery.

467
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,050
This is my notebook.

468
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:38,380
We've already registered a trademark for this red-crowned crane. It has a patent on it.

469
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,710
You have a trademark for this red-crowned crane logo,

470
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,960
but have you trademarked the red-crowned crane itself?

471
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,920
Okay, I'll return it to you.

472
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:48,320
Hey, I'm speaking to you.

473
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,090
You've come here to ask someone to do something for you yet you don't even greet them.

474
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,180
Isn't that very impolite?

475
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:01,120
President Tang, can you give me back my sketchbook?

476
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,690
I did promise you,

477
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:05,480
but did I say which day I'd return it?

478
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,140
Are you playing word games with me?

479
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:14,000
Are you the unscrupulous businessman who came to acquire

480
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,790
the embroidery workshop?

481
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:18,580
♫ That I'm the inexhaustible candlelight ♫

♫ to your endless night ♫

483
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:23,020
What are you doing?

484
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,570
♫ You're the one I love extremely ♫

485
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:30,080
Thank you.

486
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:34,130
It is so nice to have met you.

487
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:37,200
I also thank you for continuously giving me surprises.

488
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,540
♫ Many people come and go ♫

489
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,970
♫ I want to be your last visitor ♫

490
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:47,810
♫ So please don't be afraid anymore ♫

491
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:51,960
Why are you so unreasonable?

492
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,510
Have you really listened to what I've said?

493
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:02,010
I listen to what you say attentively day and night.

494
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:04,210
Can you pay attention to my feelings?

495
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:07,910
You? You are that listener?

496
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:16,610
"I cannot promise that every single day you are in Paris is a lovely day.

497
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,430
But I hope all of these lights

498
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:22,010
can light up every night of yours."

499
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:26,020
So he likes me!

500
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,800
I lived alone like this

501
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:35,740
with no one I could truly talk to.

502
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:42,120
But ever since I met you,

503
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:46,440
I feel I have lived every day very happily.

504
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,930
There are colors in my life now.

505
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,890
You are like my sleeping pill,

506
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,810
inducing me to sleep every night,

507
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,600
allowing me to have a good dream every day.

508
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,740
Thank you.

509
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:47,160
Will you marry me?

510
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:10,300
I want to share a small story about fate to everyone.

511
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,380
When I was 10 years old,

512
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:18,740
it was the first time I came here, where I am having my wedding.

513
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:24,660
That day in the afternoon, I met a 5-year-old little girl.

514
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,760
She was holding a small fox in her hands

515
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,930
and a fairytale book.

516
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:35,060
That day, right here,

517
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:40,650
we had a really wonderful afternoon.

518
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,820
I still remember that afternoon. She kept telling me about

519
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,350
a fairytale about a little prince.

520
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,270
Twenty years later,

521
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:57,190
fate allowed us to meet again.

522
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:01,420
I brought her to this lawn again.

523
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:04,360
I asked her uneasily...

524
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,080
"Do you still remember me?"

525
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,450
Do you know how much I wanted to hear her say,

526
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:12,170
"I remember"?

527
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:16,090
But she told me,

528
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:23,320
"I only remember a black ladybug."

529
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

530
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,450
If I told you earlier, then you wouldn't be surprised.

531
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:51,420
But I was only 5 years old back then, how would I remember?

532
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:01,430
Everything today... feels like a dream.

533
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,970
It is like a dream.

534
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:19,100
We used 20 years of time

535
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:23,090
to walk out of a dream and get to each other's side.

536
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:27,580
We met. Then I fell in love with her.

537
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,610
Today,

538
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,950
you are about to become my wife.

539
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,190
From today onward,

540
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,620
I am Mr. Tang

541
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,540
but who are you?

542
00:40:56,260 --> 00:41:00,640
I am... your Mrs. Tang.

543
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,330
Wife,

544
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,510
I love you.

545
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:18,440
Husband, I also love you very much.
