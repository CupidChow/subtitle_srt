32
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Then, why did you suddenly come over to hug me?

This... What are you doing?

No, that person just now almost crashed into you.

Don't you think that the delivery man just now

38
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,200
had the intention to crash into you?

39
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,800
I don't think so.

When I was little, I used to come to this area often.

45
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,200
Is there a Jing'an Temple nearby?

46
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,000
Yes.

47
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,400
Although the building is a bit old, it's warm during the winter and cool in the summer. It's very comfortable.

48
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,700
Here. Have some water.

00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,200
Thank you.

50
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,190
I see that you are preparing to apply to

51
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,900
the School of Union Chamber of Parisian Couture.

52
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,800
But you like the Chinese style so much

53
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,500
and the domestic market now is so good,

54
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,700
why do you want to go abroad?

55
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,000
Didn't you also come back from abroad?

56
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,200
Don't have such a limited scope for your question, all right?

57
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,600
I'm going there to study.

58
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,000
Studying does not distinguish between domestic and foreign countries. It is borderless.

59
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:04,100
That's right. Studying is always a good thing.

60
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,000
Say, we finally have a little consensus.

61
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,600
We've already reached a consensus on something

62
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,200
long ago.

63
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:16,750
Then, do you know why I wanted to help you acquire the embroidery workshop?

64
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,130
Because of your master.

65
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,300
That's just one of many reasons.

66
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,000
When I was in school,

67
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,200
I wrote an essay on Songtang's brand culture.

68
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,300
Back then, I did a lot of research.

69
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,000
Initially, Songtang's designs

70
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,300
were actually very forward-thinking. I really liked them.

71
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:43,400
However, in the last few years, the designs have been barely satisfactory.

72
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,800
I think that you must know where the problem lies,

73
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,600
so that's why you want to acquire the embroidery workshop to change the situation. Am I right?

74
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,000
I also think that creators in every field

75
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,200
are essentially the same.

76
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,800
Their original creations are based on their own national culture.

77
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,200
Just like when it comes to suits, we can never surpass Westerners.

78
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,600
However, when it comes to the cheongsam,
(T/N: Chinese style dress)

79
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,800
they are unable to create the same oriental charm as us.

80
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,000
So if Chinese clothing wants to establish itself in the world,

81
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,400
it must have its own Chinese culture.

82
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
That's how it will go far.

83
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,200
I think that Songtang can do that.

84
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,400
- I forgot what I was going to say.
- What?

85
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,200
By the way,

86
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,200
will you be going to Suzhou again anytime soon?

87
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,600
I don't think so. I'll be in Shanghai.

88
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,000
Have you completed your design to submit to the institution yet?

89
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I still have a little bit of work to do, mainly because I have work to do at the studio.

90
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You even have a studio?

91

How would I have a studio?

93

I just work part-time at Teacher Xiongying's studio.

Long time no see. Even the way you greet people has become so unique now.

Sister Mo Fei, my scissors didn't touch her.

I didn't do it. I don't know how it ripped.

From what I see, it's too late.

Say, Mo Fei,

do you think I'm easy to bully just because my family isn't powerful or wealthy?

Bai Xiaoman, if you trip on stage,

then you're ruining your own career.

Since you're so smart, you should know what I'm talking about.

I asked you to come over here to explain things to me.

I don't care about them. But your car can't park here.

Is it because their cars are more expensive, so you don't dare talk to them?

She's smart and has great skills.

She is Master Li's student,

322
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:54,400

Are you worried about the designs you sent to Paris

so you are really nervous?

331

I think it is fine if you just create the designs as you usually do.

By the way, how is our "Chinese Style Fashion" going?

Right now, we have sponsorships and intermissions lined up.

The price is also much better than ordinary companies.

are in the open auditions?

373
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,400
I've discussed it with the TV stations. Our designers will be exempt from the open auditions.

That will be beneficial for our brand promotion.

00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:32,120
Director Fang, what is this?

479
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,650
These are the scissors that Alexander used.

480
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:41,010
This is worth a lot more than that autograph you got.

481
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,810
You can have it.

482
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,460
No, no! I did nothing to deserve this.

483
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,370
I can't just accept it like this.

484
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:52,340
Just treat it as a first meeting gift to my junior sister.

485
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,180
Take it.

486
00:38:55,460 --> 00:39:00,180
A few days ago, at the showcase, I heard Teacher Pan say that you are applying to the School of Union Chamber of Parisian Couture.

487
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,810
I graduated from there.

488
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:03,250
Really?

489
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,130
As the design director of Cayman,

490
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:07,610
I plan to write a recommendation letter for you.

491
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:11,350
That way you will be accepted without a problem.

492
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:16,370
Even though I really want to get into that school, I still want to do it through my own hard work.

493
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:18,210
Please don't misunderstand.

494
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:22,220
I'm willing to write you a recommendation letter because I recognize your talent.

495
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:25,190
The admission committee lacks my kind of insight.

496
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:28,930
The possibility of not being admitted is still there.

497
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:31,890
But if the committee does not approve of my designs,

498
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:35,520
it's probably because my design is not compatible with the school.

499
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,810
So, I also won't go to a school that is not compatible with me.

500
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,140
But the School of Union Chamber of Parisian Couture is a really good school.

501
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:48,630
If you can study there, it will help you a lot.

502
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,720
Then I'll accept this gift. As for the recommendation letter...

503
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,370
I still hope I can be accepted with my own hard work.

504
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:00,930
- Then I'll get going now, Director Fang.
- Okay.

505
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,880
Why don't you go in?

506
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,760
Are you that afraid of our company's security guards?

507
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:33,390
Who's afraid? I'm just afraid of going inside and disturbing their work.

508
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:37,590
Then, do you think that asking the boss to come down to see you during work hours

509
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:40,900
doesn't affect the workflow?

510
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,950
Aren't you just forcing me to admit it right now? Fine, I'll admit it!

511
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:48,520
I feel bad for the employees here after I made such a ruckus last time.

512
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:54,090
But when I called you, I couldn't get through. Then what do I do? I can only wait here for you.

513
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:12,000
I'll reluctantly accept that excuse.

514
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,810
Tell me. What do you need?

515
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:16,420
My master agrees! We can proceed with the contract.

516
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,180
Really?

517
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,300
All thanks to you.

518
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:26,700
It's nothing. Then just draft the contract first. After that, I'll go over the details with my master.

519
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,270
I'll draft the contract as soon as possible.

520
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:31,150
- Well, I've relayed the message. Bye-bye!
- Wait a second!

521
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:34,030
Do you think leaving like this...

522
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:36,580
is appropriate?

523
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:39,430
What's not appropriate about it?

524
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:43,400
First of all, this was accomplished through our joint efforts.

525
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,450
So, should we...

526
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:49,680
celebrate a little?

527
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,460
Celebrate?

528
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:06,190
♫ I say you're an April day ♫

529
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:10,280
♫ The sound of your laughter lights everything up ♫

530
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,790
♫ Even the spirit of a light breeze ♫

531
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:19,880
♫ In the midst of the brightness and beauty of spring,
shift as one would in a dance ♫

532
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:25,090
♫ You're the mist on a dry April day ♫

533
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:29,490
♫ The gentle breeze blown during dusk ♫

534
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:33,130
♫ The unintentional sparkle of the planetesimal ♫

535
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:39,120
♫ The fine rain that's sprinkled in front of the flower ♫

536
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:43,920
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

537
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,770
♫ Like a shy water lotus that bows to a cool breeze ♫

538
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:53,420
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

539
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:58,320
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫

540
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:02,950
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

541
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:09,200
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫

542
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:22,820
♫ You're like the ivory field after snowflakes ♫

543
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:27,180
♫ You're the round moon every night ♫

544
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,920
♫ You're the naïve ♫

545
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:36,010
♫ white lotus that floats on the water ripples of your dream ♫

546
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:42,390
♫ You're the flower blossoms of tree after tree ♫

547
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:46,830
♫ The swallow twittering within the beams ♫

548
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:50,510
♫ You are love, hope, and warmth ♫

549
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:54,790
♫ You're an April day ♫

550
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:59,560
♫ The gentlest moment is when you lower your head ♫

551
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:04,310
♫ The bittersweet parting words of "take care" ♫

552
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:09,150
♫ Time is like water, wordless ♫

553
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:15,570
♫ If you're well, it's a lovely day ♫
