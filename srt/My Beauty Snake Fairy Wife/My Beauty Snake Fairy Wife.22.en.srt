1
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:12,240
It's so hot.

2
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:14,919
Guest, take a look. Guest, take a look.

3
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:17,519
Miss, you must be tired.
Have a cold tea and rest a while.

4
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:18,440
Just right.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,359
Come, please sit.

6
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:21,679
Come.

7
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:28,199
Take your time.

8
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:29,039
Try it.

9
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:32,640
Don't drink so fast, it's bad for your stomach.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,320
It's fine, let's have another cup.

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,520
What is this steeped in?

12
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:45,719
Hong E, your ears.

13
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:48,640
There's a demon! Quick, don't let her escape!

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,520
Brother Zhang, Brother Li, there
must be some misunderstanding here.

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,439
This is not how it is.

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,320
Who are you calling 'brother'?

17
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:54,320
Who is your brother?

18
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,679
You even can't hide your ears.
What's there to explain?

19
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,560
Quick grab her, run.

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,520
Catch her, run quickly.

21
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,640
Quick, catch her.

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,399
Come on, hit her.

23
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,079
Catch her.

24
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:02,320
Hit her, hit her, quickly.

25
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,359
But lack it.

26
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:06,159
Madam.

27
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,920
Madam, we need your help.

28
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:10,799
What's wrong?

29
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,239
Hong E turned into her original form and was caught.

30
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,519
Go and save her.

31
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:16,959
Go.

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,519
Lin Haoxuan, come out quickly.

33
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,200
Lin Haoxuan.

34
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:25,359
You you you...

35
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:27,439
You dare to hide demons in the clinic?

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,959
Demons? Isn't this a rabbit.

37
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:34,439
We saw it with our own eyes,
it's the medic transformed.

38
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,439
The medic is a demon, your wife is a demon.

39
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,159
You might be a demon too.

40
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,920
In my opinion, we should arrest them all.

41
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,719
Hand them over to that master, right?

42
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:42,959
Right, right, right.

43
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,079
Brother Zhang.

44
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,280
We once saved your mother's life,
how could you be so ungrateful?

45
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:50,840
That's true.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,799
That's wrong!

47
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,120
Humans and demons cannot coexist.

48
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,560
Why bother talking to him, just hit him.

49
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,640
Hit him, hit him, hit him.

50
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,560
Finally they are gone.

51
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:16,680
She is Hong E

52
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,719
Hong E is a demon?

53
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,840
How do you know she is a demon?

54
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,319
Not only Hong E is a demon.

55
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,680
They

56
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,120
are all demons.

57
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,840
This.

58
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,000
Madam.

59
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:40,960
Don't touch her.

60
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,479
Let her go.

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,039
Don't blame them.

62
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,759
They are all little demons you've converted.

63
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:57,719
To repay the kindness, they transformed
into a human form and returned here to help.

64
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,319
Master, do you remember?

65
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:06,439
When you reincarnated me, I was unwilling to enter that demon
refining furnace and accidentally fell and this scar was left.

66
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,319
You are the butterfly demon?

67
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,280
Well.

68
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,560
You are.

69
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:25,520
Master, there's me too.

70
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:33,439
Didn't I order you to go back to the mountain and practice
well, and stop causing trouble in the human world?

71
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,800
Why are you so disobedient?

72
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,879
And you.

73
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,240
Are you being possessed by your demon nature again.

74
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:43,800
I...

75
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:44,840
No, master.

76
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,560
It's strange to say

77
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,159
Hong E was fine before she left today.

78
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,319
Yes.

79
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,479
After drinking a bowl of cold tea, she suddenly
changed her temperament and even her eyes turned black.

80
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,319
Master, master.

81
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,879
He's fine.

82
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,080
The city has been restless lately, you guys
should go back to the mountain and hide first.

83
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:14,360
Don't be used by those with ulterior motives.

84
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,040
Yes, Madam.

85
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,240
Sister.

86
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,079
Sister, are you okay?

87
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,319
I heard that Hong E showed her
true form in public and got caught.

88
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,680
It's the evil spirits causing trouble,
letting Hong E reveal her true form.

89
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:42,839
Old Li.

90
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,720
I just came back from his place.

91
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,720
No wonder.

92
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,839
Those four children of his family were shouting that their
father was going to the East City Clinic to find his benefactor.

93
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,319
East City Clinic.

94
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:59,199
I suspect that something is amiss there.

95
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,160
Bring it on.

96
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,079
Changgong.

97
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,519
How could you also be controlled by the evil spirits.

98
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,839
Did something happen to the tribe?

99
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,040
What's happened.

100
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,680
This is all because of you, demoness
who took away the Revival Pearl.

101
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,680
How can you talk like that

102
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,519
Qingdai, you mustn't be rude.

103
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,120
What does this have to do with Revival Pearl.

104
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:37,879
You really don't know?

105
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,439
The power of the Revival Pearl.

106
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:45,759
All I know is the Revival Pearl
can help my husband resurrect.

107
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:49,319
The Revival Pearl is not the
life-prolonging treasure you mentioned.

108
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:53,160
Its real power is to suppress evil spirits.

109
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,839
How can it be like this?

110
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,040
Changqing has been sickly from a young
age. His father left the pearl in his care.

111
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,279
To resist the power of evil spirits.

112
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:11,480
All these years, Priest Xia has
been coveting the power of the pearl.

113
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,800
She just got the opportunity when you took it away.

114
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,199
You've misunderstood. I only used
the Revival Pearl for a few days.

115
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,680
I've set things straight with Changqing.

116
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,120
Once my husband's health improves a
little, I'll return the Revival Pearl to him.

117
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:27,600
At worst, you can call him over
and we can confront him in person.

118
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,519
Call him over?

119
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,120
I really wish I could call him over.

120
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,840
Changqing is in trouble?

121
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,399
After you left.

122
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,519
Priest Xia colluded with the
evil spirits and started a rebellion.

123
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,399
Be careful.

124
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,639
Changqing.

125
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:03,919
Changqing.

126
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:05,360
Changqing.

127
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,200
Bro.

128
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:11,919
I'm sorry.

129
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,120
Never mind.

130
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:28,720
Changqing met you.

131
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,240
Perhaps it's his destiny.

132
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,720
I'm sorry.

133
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,559
I was only thinking of saving my husband,
and didn't think it would harm Changqing.

134
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,159
It's no use saying these things now.

135
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:46,039
Only by retrieving the power of
the pearl can we confront Priest Xia.

136
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,879
But my husband's health has not improved yet.

137
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,240
Then I will personally retrieve it from his body.

138
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:55,200
Two days.

139
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,279
Give me two more days.

140
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,240
Two days later.

141
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:03,039
I will personally give back the Pearl.

142
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,320
Things have already turned out this way.

143
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,039
At that time, we will help
you deal with that priest Xia.

144
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,159
Consider it for Changqing's sake.

145
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,639
I'll give you two more days.

146
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,720
Return the gem to me in two days.

147
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,919
Priest Xia will definitely find
the Revival Pearl at all costs.

148
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:35,519
Damn it.

149
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:37,759
Why are you grabbing me?

150
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:38,759
Brother Li.

151
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,000
Is there some kind of misunderstanding?

152
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,600
Brother Li.

153
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:49,799
Watch closely.

154
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,039
This is the real Sky Thunder Spell.

155
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,559
Don't call me your master anymore in the future.

156
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:07,559
Get out of the way quickly.

157
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,879
Isn't this my master's Immortal Binding Rope.

158
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,480
It's mine now.

159
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,879
Kid, just stay aside.

160
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,000
It's settled.

161
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:47,240
Was I handsome?

162
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,440
Be careful.

163
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,120
What's going on?

164
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,279
Where is Lin Haoxuan?

165
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,679
Lin Haoxuan, it's you messing around again.

166
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,399
It really wasn't me, Brother Li.

167
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,879
- You believe that I'm not...
- Stop making excuses.

168
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,440
Where is the snake demon in your family?

169
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:18,360
Where's the snake demon?

170
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,879
Snake!

171
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:22,759
I'm afraid of snakes.

172
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:24,279
I'm afraid of snakes.

173
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:25,919
Don't come over
