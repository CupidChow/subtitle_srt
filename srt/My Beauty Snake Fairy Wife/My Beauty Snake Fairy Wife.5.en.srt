1
00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:25,209
I boast of my medical skills and help the world, yet.

2
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:30,330
I can't even diagnose what's wrong with this child.

3
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,449
Mr. Lin, could you push me higher?

4
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,490
Mr. Lin.

5
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,369
Save me.

6
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:13,290
Look.

7
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:14,970
Look, look.

8
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:22,010
Look at that.

9
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,209
That's really good.

10
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,889
Mother, let's go see in front.

11
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:43,010
You slow down.

12
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,250
Child.

13
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:46,729
What are you doing? Dr. Lin.

14
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,209
What are you doing? Dr. Lin.

15
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,250
Let go.

16
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,209
I just want to take his pulse.

17
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:01,329
He seems to have recovered.

18
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:03,570
But he was clearly suffering from a terminal illness.

19
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,729
You couldn't cure it.

20
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,410
Don't curse my son because
your medical skills are not good.

21
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:08,370
Go away.

22
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:09,690
But.

23
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,410
Mr. Lin.

24
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:23,489
Miss Linglong.

25
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:29,530
My medical skills are not good, I made a wrong diagnosis.

26
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:33,530
You didn't, something is strange.

27
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:52,609
Mother, someone hit me.

28
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:53,810
Stop.

29
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,329
Son, get up.

30
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:01,049
Mom, she hit me.

31
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,049
Where did this crazy woman come from? Dared to hit my son.

32
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:06,449
He has been controlled by the demon spirit.

33
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:09,929
If you don't want him to die, give him to me to deal with.

34
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:11,370
Nonsense.

35
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:12,290
Servants.

36
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:13,169
Here.

37
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,649
Quickly, get this crazy woman out of here.

38
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:17,570
Yes.

39
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,649
Miss Linglong.

40
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:26,089
Dr. Lin.

41
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:28,690
So you're in league with her?

42
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,250
Why would you say this?

43
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,209
Are you still playing dumb?

44
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,529
It must be you who can't cure my son's illness.

45
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:39,889
You let this mad woman frame
my son to save your reputation.

46
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:43,570
What nonsense about spirits, I wonder how you made that up.

47
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:47,849
Miss Linglong, what she said is true?

48
00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:51,289
I can't explain this, but I can prove it to you.

49
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:51,810
You.

50
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:54,010
She wants to hit me again.

51
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,370
Are you still pretending

52
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,610
Xue Linglong, have you had enough.

53
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,690
I know my medical skills are not refined.

54
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,050
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

55
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,969
I don't need you to make a fuss over this trivial matter.

56
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:15,690
Madam, I'm really sorry.

57
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:19,170
Go.

58
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,370
Xue Linglong.

59
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:29,769
I, Lin Haoxuan, don't need your cheap sympathy.

60
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:35,969
My faith is in healing the sick. 
If you lie and harm others for me.

61
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,610
I would only feel like a failure.

62
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:06,810
Different paths don't make plans together.

63
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:19,810
Haoxuan.

64
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,089
No.

65
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:25,050
You, drink one by yourself.

66
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,010
No, no, no.

67
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,370
If you don't drink, I'll drink by myself.

68
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,810
You, you had a fight?

69
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,170
Love makes a fool of people.

70
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:44,010
Or we are just not meant to be.

71
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,649
Isn't it just about love? Come
on, let me calculate for you.

72
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:47,610
No.

73
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,889
If it is fate, why need to calculate?

74
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:53,209
What's the use if me and her are not meant to be together.

75
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:54,769
Let's go.

76
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:00,209
This is outrageous. This Lin is too much.

77
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:07,570
Okay, okay, don't be sad.

78
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:12,690
Look, I told you long ago, didn't I?

79
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,930
Humans and demons have
different paths. This is your barrier.

80
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,370
Only our kind can understand each other.

81
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,810
XOXO.

82
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,849
Stop jabbering.

83
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,690
Don't think I don't know what's on your mind.

84
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,370
Seize the opportunity to sow discord whenever possible.

85
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:40,329
Go and attend to proper business
