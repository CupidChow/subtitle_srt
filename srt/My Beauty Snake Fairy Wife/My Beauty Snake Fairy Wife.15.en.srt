00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:04,159
Merfolk's Shore.

00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,360
Merfolk's Shore.

4
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,599
Who are you?

5
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,560
You guys go first.

6
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,240
Yes, yes.

7
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,039
My name is Xu Changqing.

8
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,479
May I ask, miss, what is your name?

9
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,560

Where am I?

12
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,120
This is Merfolk's Shore.

13
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
Great.

14
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,319
Young Master Xu.

15
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,919
I want to ask you something.

16
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,759
Okay.

17
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,159
What do you want to ask, Miss.

18
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,599
I heard that on Merfolk's Shore.

19
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,439
There is a treasure called Revival Pearl.

20
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,680
Do you know where that treasure is?

21
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,879
Revival Pearl.

22
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,599
Where did you hear about the Revival Pearl.

23
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:42,120
My sister had been to Merfolk's Shore
so she knows a thing or two about it.

24
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,520
Be careful, they're controlled by evil spirits.

25
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,800
Why did your hair change color.

26
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,639
This is a characteristic of our merfolk

27
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,519
I'll explain slowly to you later.

28
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,879
Judging by your look, it seems like
you urgently need the Revival Pearl.

29
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:28,519
I came to find it actually to save someone.

30
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,199
To save someone?

31
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,160
Changqing.

32
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,399

[Xia Zi Su, Love-struck Mermaid]

34
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:37,279
You, how did you metamorphose?

35
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,279
You metamorphosed just for a
common girl with unknown background?

36
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,279
What is a common woman?

37
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,800
If you're not common, are you a beauty?

38
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,839
Whoever falls for you must be blind.

39
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,639
Where did this uncouth mermaid come from?

40
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,439

Miss Linglong.

44
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,240
I apologize on behalf of Zi Su.

45
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:05,879
Zi Su

46
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,959

50
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,240
Brother.

51
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,040
Changqing, you.

52
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,399

This is my brother, he is the leader of our Merfolk Tribe.

56
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,360
Nice to meet you, tribal leader.

57
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,560
No need for formalities.

58
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,399
You guys...

59
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,360
We are twins.

60
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,079
Recently, Merfolk's Shore has been unstable.

61
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,360
Didn't I tell you not to wander around?

62
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,560
How could you bring a stranger here?

63
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,600
Brother.

64
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,040
Miss Linglong is not a malicious stranger.

65
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,079
Besides, I was attacked just now, and she saved me.

66
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,680
Attacked? Where? Were you hurt?

67
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,639
I'm fine, see.

68
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:33,800
Who attacked you?

69
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,800
Well

70
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,560
I was about to tell you about this.

71
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,160
The attackers were merfolks controlled
by an evil spirit in the Lotus Pond.

72
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:46,439
The day of sacrifice is approaching and the
evil spirit is taking advantage of the situation.

73
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,680
Come on, let's go check out the forbidden area.

74
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,480
Hold on.

75
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,759
Miss Linglong

76
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,560
I still have something to deal with my brother.

77
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,600
You have a rest first. I'll have someone
prepare some tea snacks for you.

78
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,879
What we were talking about just now...

79
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,319
About that.

80
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,519
Wait for me to finish my tasks and I will inquire for you.

81
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,120
Be careful, young master.

82
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,000
Let's go.

83
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,080
Don't worry, the barrier is still there
