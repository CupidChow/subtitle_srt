1
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:24,400
Qingdai, you...

2
00:01:30,318 --> 00:01:34,464
I only hope that your heart is like mine,

3
00:01:34,488 --> 00:01:37,678
definitely not betraying the ardent longing.

4
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:40,535
The heart is like flowing water, tirelessly blossoming.

5
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:44,000
I am like the bright moon, you mustn't be infatuated.

6
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,604
Do not let the heart of spring
compete with the flowers for bloom.

7
00:01:47,628 --> 00:01:52,239
An inch of love sickness is an inch of ash.

8
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,385
Seagull and mandarin duck make one pond,

9
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:01,040
you must know that they are not a match.

10
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,759
Why did I have such absurd dreams?

11
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:37,879
Sister.

12
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,039
Sister, I'm here to comb your hair.

13
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,599
Don't bother, sister-in-law, we have already groomed.

14
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,639
I'm late, right?

15
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
Mr. Lin.

16
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,520
There's an emergency at the clinic.

17
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,520
You need to leave now.

18
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,919
You're not fooling me, are you?

19
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,350
Why would I fool you? Lives are at stake.

20
00:03:07,374 --> 00:03:08,560
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

21
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,840
You two seem to get along well with each other.

22
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,280
Didn't we agree to leave together?

23
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,000
Why did you change your mind again?

24
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,240
Aren't I doing this for having a child?

25
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,599
Once you start a thing, you need to see it through.

26
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:37,520
Don't you just want a child? We can "dual cultivate" too.

27
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,120
I see you are falling for him, you
don't want to leave at all, do you?

28
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,680
Sister, there's no good man among human males.

29
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,400
And his Master, who knows when she'll come back to kill us.

30
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
No way, you must leave with me today.

31
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:06,280
If you continue to instigate our relationship,
you can go back to the mountain now.

32
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,479
I'm doing this for your own good, sister.

33
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,199
Get out.

34
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,639
Get out immediately.

35
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,959
Kindness is met with ingratitude.

36
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,600
If I'd known it would come to this, I wouldn't
have let you stay here in the first place.

37
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,199
Here.

38
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,040
It's so beautiful.

39
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,560
How do you feel now, take it slow.

40
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,079
As long as the patient is okay

41
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,319
I'll be relieved. That's all.

42
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,319
My lord.

43
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,240
My lady.

44
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,160
If you have something, say it briefly.

45
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,959
You want to chat?

46
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,240
Sister.

47
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,360
Then you chat first, I'll go back first.

48
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,120
No problem.

49
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,759
What on earth is the matter.

50
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:12,800
Actually, there is nothing important.

51
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,360
Let's talk about it later.

52
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,800
Let's go.

53
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,040
Don't rush.

54
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:06,600
My lady.

55
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:11,879
My lord.

56
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,279
Go to bed in the house

57
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:16,759
I'll work on a new prescription in the study tonight

58
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,160
I can accompany you.

59
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,279
No need.

60
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,360
Follow me, "When you have found the noble and virtuous,".

61
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:40,040
Why is she here again?

62
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,240
Yan Zhihong came to thank Dr. Lin for saving her life.

63
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,759
She said she would give herself in return.

64
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,680
"Why bother asking about the mediocre?"

65
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,319
Brother-in-law.

66
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,040
Call me Haoxuan.

67
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,639
Hao

68
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:04,959
Haoxuan.

69
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,150
There are trees and branches in the
mountains,

70
00:08:09,174 --> 00:08:12,680
I'm fond of you but you don't know.

71
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,680
If you don't mind,

72
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,150
I am willing to make tea and pour water for you,

73
00:08:19,174 --> 00:08:20,680
do laundry and cook.

74
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:30,790
If I share the bed with you, my girl,

75
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:33,200
how can I let you fold the quilt and make the bed
