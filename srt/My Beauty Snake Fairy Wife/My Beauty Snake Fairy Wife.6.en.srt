1
00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:25,273
Xuyuan & Zhu Qingdai.

2
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,620
Lin Haoxuan & Xue Linglong.

3
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,409
Come on.

4
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:46,729
Draw one.

5
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:56,769
Mountains are high and waters deep, seemed no way out, until
another village appears surrounded by willows and flowers.

6
00:00:57,089 --> 00:00:57,930
What does it mean.

7
00:00:58,809 --> 00:00:59,769
Let me see.

8
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:03,729
It's simple, just the literal meaning.

9
00:01:04,088 --> 00:01:09,729
Don't believe in appearances, believe in your heart.

10
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:14,729
The two of you will overcome
numerous difficulties and be together.

11
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:16,490
What?

12
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:19,609
Why do we have the same sign,
but I am the lowest-ranked sign.

13
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:22,130
Lowest-ranked sign.

14
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,130
It's also literal.

15
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,210
It also tells you not to believe in appearances.

16
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,130
But.

17
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,329
This person is not a good match.

18
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:40,089
The next one will be "another village
surrounded by willows and flowers".

19
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,369
I am leaving first.

20
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:45,650
Where are you going?

21
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:14,850
Speak up, demon. Why are you
causing chaos here, harming the innocent?

22
00:02:14,929 --> 00:02:16,250
I'm just trying to help him.

23
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:17,090
Help him.

24
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:21,570
I see that he won't survive much longer.
You'll suck all his vitality and he'll die.

25
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:23,889
He should have died anyway.

26
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,810
Now I let him be alive for a few more days.

27
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,970
It's not your turn to make decisions.

28
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:35,889
You can't stop us, sooner or later
all of you will be controlled by us.

29
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,010
What are you doing?

30
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,929
You didn't diagnose wrong before.

31
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:12,370
He's just being controlled by the demonic
spirit, so it seems like he's recovered.

32
00:03:21,929 --> 00:03:25,530
Why is his pulse gradually improving?

33
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:29,769
The energy of the demonic
spirit is the best elixir in the world.

34
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:33,729
After he took it, his condition can stabilize quickly.

35
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,290
Then I'll prepare some more medicine
for him to help him recover soon.

36
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:47,970
Miss Linglong.

37
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:48,970
I...

38
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:49,810
Never mind.

39
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,289
What's a good gift for a girl?

40
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:58,209
It seems that Miss Linglong is
going to become our teacher's wife.

41
00:04:58,209 --> 00:04:59,449
I knew it all along.

42
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,529
Look at them, one is highly skilled in martial arts.

43
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,409
The other is highly skilled in medicine. What a match!

44
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,209
Don't be too optimistic you two.

45
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:10,089
A demon catcher and a thousand-year-old demon.

46
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:11,810
Who knows what will happen in the future?

47
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,209
Watch your mouth.

48
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,289
It's true.

49
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,289
At that time, I was so confused that I sought this sign.

50
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:28,610
Fortunately, the temple host gave me guidance and my mind
became clearer. It's how I didn't miss a good marriage with you.

51
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:30,930
Thank you for the guidance.

52
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:42,289
This is the jade pendant left by my mother.

53
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:47,490
She hoped that I would give it to my future lady.

54
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,089
All along, it has been you
expressing your affection for me.

55
00:05:54,329 --> 00:05:58,889
Today, I also prepared a surprise for Miss Linglong.

56
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,289
How can this man be so
old-fashioned to use this trick again?

57
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:17,930
Miss Linglong.

58
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:23,250
In the next life, if you are a lock, I would be your key.

59
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:26,289
Guard you through life after life.

60
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:31,930
This is the final selection
contest of Mr. Lin's concubines.

61
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,649
Tonight will we will choose from among beauties

62
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:38,810
to form a group of Mr. Lin's mistress.

63
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:42,370
And to hatch eggs and have babies for the Lin family.

64
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:45,170
Next, it depends on your performance.

65
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:48,490
Do you think I'm beautiful.

66
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,170
You.

67
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,289
Go to Korea.

68
00:07:54,969 --> 00:07:58,810
Let Madam Qing check your bodies.

69
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,529
Flat chested.

70
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:08,730
What are you doing?

71
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:09,889
The butt is too flat.

72
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,130
No, sit down, sit down.

73
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,449
This face.

74
00:08:16,772 --> 00:08:21,024
[Yan Zhihong, Graceful Courtesan]

75
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,930
This figure

76
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:20,497
I'm even better.

77
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,490
Zhu Qingdai.

78
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:22,610
What are you up to.

79
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,649
Sister.

80
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:28,449
Are you satisfied with the dowry I sent you.

81
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:33,370
What do you mean?

82
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,769
Nothing.

83
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,649
You are getting married.

84
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,769
As a your sister

85
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:41,250
I can't give a valuable gift

86
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:44,529
I can only find a few concubines to play with you.

87
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:47,610
Why do you keep instigating my relationship with Mr. Lin

88
00:08:47,689 --> 00:08:49,010
I didn't.

89
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:56,610
I just want you to take a look
at the true face of Lin Haoxuan.

90
00:08:58,689 --> 00:09:00,610
Mr. Lin is an upright person.

91
00:09:00,689 --> 00:09:02,769
He would not possibly engage in such flirtatious behaviors.

92
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:11,970
Just now, he was openly expressing his love to you.

93
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,689
Now he's with another girl.

94
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:15,010
So close.

95
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,689
He's indeed upright.

96
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,610
Could he be really as what Qingdai said?

97
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,250
Your skin is so white.

98
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,529
Your hand is so cold.

99
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,370
This is.

100
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:33,490
Symptoms of qi and blood stagnation.

101
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,850
Qi and blood stagnation, what does this mean?

102
00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:39,370
This could be serious.

103
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:42,330
In the short term, it will only cause
abdominal pain and chest tightness.

104
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,370
Is it so terrifying?

105
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,850
The worst is yet to come.

106
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,450
If it develops into a chronic disease.

107
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:49,769
It will get you looking pale.

108
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,370
Swelling and obesity.

109
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:52,889
Aging faster than others.

110
00:09:54,289 --> 00:09:55,450
Is it that serious.

111
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,649
If it gets worse.

112
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,130
It's very likely to develop into stroke symptoms.

113
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,610
You can't care for yourself in your old age.

114
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,090
Dr. Lin, you must save me.

115
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:07,970
How about

116
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,409
I give you two doses of medicine tomorrow

117
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:10,769
and you take care of yourself.

118
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:13,850
Dr. Lin, I will come to you tomorrow.

119
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,330
Take leave.

120
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:16,529
Everyone

121
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,450
I'm sick, I won't participate

122
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,689
I'll go back first.

123
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:21,730
Well

124
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,010
Mr. Lin, help me take a look too.

125
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,250
Me me me, I'll go first.

126
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:28,049
Don't rush, take turns.

127
00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:29,970
Don't rush, one by one.

128
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,529
I am indeed not mistaken about people.

129
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,210
Lin Haoxuan

130
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:36,409
I will marry you for sure.

131
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,330
Help me take a look

132
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:38,409
I'm first
