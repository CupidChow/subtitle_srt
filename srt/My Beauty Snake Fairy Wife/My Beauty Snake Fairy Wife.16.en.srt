1
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:15,800
Cheers.

2
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,719
Very good.

3
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:43,520
Yes.

4
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,719
Everyone.

5
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:50,679
Today, Changqing was facing danger.

6
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,200
Fortunately, Miss Linglong stepped in and saved him.

7
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,039
I bet Miss Linglong must be sent by Heaven.

8
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,759
Changqing.

9
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,399
Since you guys are so fated.

10
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:07,200
Why don't you accompany Miss
Linglong around in the next few days.

11
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,280
To experience the local customs of our Merfolk's Shore.

12
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:14,159
Miss Linglong.

13
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:16,640
Wherever you want to go, I'll guide you.

14
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,079
Frankly speaking.

15
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:23,879
The reason why I'm here is because.

16
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,000
Miss Linglong.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,599
Changqing just met danger, it's not
convenient for him to hang out with an outsider,

18
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,959
If you really are interested, I can lead the way.

19
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:36,840
Zi Su.

20
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,120
Don't be rude.

21
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,280
Miss Linglong is a noble guest, not
someone you can get in touch with.

22
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,439
But I need to protect Brother Changqing,
it's always been like this since we were young.

23
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,480
Zi Su.

24
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,239
I've seen the martial arts of Miss Linglong.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,040
She can protect me, you don't have to worry.

26
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:00,640
I

27
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,400
Miss Linglong.

28
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,719
We can go out and play tomorrow.

29
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:13,680
Everyone.

30
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,800
Toast to you.

31
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,919
Okay, cheers.

32
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,560
Cheers.

33
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:27,800
Miss Linglong really has good skills and knows some magic.

34
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:30,560
Are you a demon catcher?

35
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,639
Does knowing magic necessarily mean being a demon catcher?

36
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,719
Demons know magic too.

37
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:50,759
I'm just an ordinary person who has
learned some basic techniques for self-defense.

38
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,639
Exactly.

39
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,759
How could Miss Linglong possibly be a demon?

40
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,639
What's wrong with the demon?

41
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,439
Why do you look so disgusted with the demon?

42
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,759
You don't know about it.

43
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:10,280
That's a long story.

44
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,199
The demons used treacherous
means and killed countless of our people.

45
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,360
We naturally hate their guts.

46
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:42,319
Over the years, our merfolk clan
has always avoided the demon clan.

47
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,759
I see.

48
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,039
Alright.

49
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,800
Let's not talk about these unhappy things.

50
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,879
Today.

51
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,400
It seems that Changqing has met a destined person.

52
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:59,400
As I see it, the wedding day is imminent.

53
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,840
Let's all drink, everyone. No going home sober.

54
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,919
Come on.

55
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,960
Cheers.

56
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,199
Good. Cheers. Come on.

57
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,639
Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.

58
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,759
Go in.

59
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,839
How long do you plan to locke me up?

60
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,360
You've hurt so many people.

61
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,279
How about for a lifetime?

62
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,639
A lifetime?

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,079
We've only known each other for a
short time, and you're thinking so far ahead.

64
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,000
Stop your nonsense.

65
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,240
Stop pretending.

66
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,600
Have another drink.

67
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:27,839
I heard there's a rare Revival Pearl at Merfolk's Shore.

68
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,199
I'm willing to exchange with my heart.

69
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:34,120
That's just a legend.

70
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,000
No smoke without fire.

71
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,240
So you came to me for that pearl.

72
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,720
If you don't know, then forget it.

73
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,399
Wait.

74
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:17,439
Not sure when we'll meet after today.

75
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,000
A cup of fine wine, for your journey.

76
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,759
I once loved a girl named Shuang'er.

77
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,319
She was seriously ill and didn't have long to live.

78
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:54,759
I was seeking the Revival Pearl to save
her, thus I sought Priest Xia's guidance

79
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,759
I crave for blood whenever I go mad.

80
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:15,160
Let me go, you crazy woman.

81
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,639
My bloodthirsty possession is incurable.

82
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,439
Even you could be harmed if I lose control.

83
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,560
Turns out, he too is a man of feelings.

84
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,439
Changqing.

85
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,199
Zi Su.

86
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,040
You... metamorphosed?

87
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,279
Changqing.

88
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,199
I

89
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,000
I like you.

90
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,240
But I already have someone I love

91
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:29,399
I don't want you to be taken away by that woman.

92
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,600
We grew up together since childhood.

93
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:35,840
We are all merfolk, we should be together.

94
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:40,480
But for a woman you've only met once.

95
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,840
You've given the most precious chance
of metamorphosis in a merfolk's life.

96
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,799
Zi Su.

97
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,440
Affection for someone isn't measured by the times spent.

98
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,480
So all these years we've been together,
can't match up to a single day between you two?

99
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,879
Since you're willing to metamorphose for
her, I'm also willing to metamorphose for you.

100
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,799
Brother Changqing.

101
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,799
She has ulterior motives for
you, she doesn't truly like you.

102
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:11,519
Enough.

103
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You don't need to worry about my affairs with Linglong
