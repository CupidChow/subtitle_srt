1
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:15,039
Hong E, Lu Rui.

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,039
Miss.

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,000
When you go for medicinal herbs tomorrow.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,559
Bring back more ginseng, Poria, and Xionghuang.

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,120
Alright.

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,920
Didn't we just restock these herbs yesterday?

7
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:25,519
How could it be out of stock so quickly.

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,760
The calming soup has been in high
demand these days. We should stock up more.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,280
Okay.

10
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:37,399
This is a bit strange.

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,200
Sister

12
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:39,560
I'll go investigate.

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,479
Mr. Lin.

14
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:42,920
Mr. Lin.

15
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:44,359
Mr. Lin.

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,880
Mr. Lin hurry up

17
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,560
Mr. Lin.

18
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,600
Take your time to speak.

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,000
You have to help me.

20
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,079
Your home hasn't also
encountered a snake demon, has it?

21
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:54,920
You...

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,560
How do you know?

23
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,000
And the snake demon, only you can see?

24
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,439
You know this too?

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,560
Brother Zhang.

26
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,439
In your case, it doesn't seem like a demon
is causing trouble. It's more like hysteria.

27
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,599
Hysteria?

28
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:18,480
Don't come over here, I'll hit you.

29
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,280
I'll hit you.

30
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,239
Don't come over, don't come over.

31
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:23,519
Don't come over.

32
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,680
Bold demon, stop harming people.

33
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,959
No, this, you took it in?

34
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:40,799
You are my benefactor. Thank you so much!

35
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,280
Thanks to you!

36
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,000
If there's anything, find me
in the city's eastern city clinic.

37
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,280
Eastern City Clinic.

38
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,439
I'm so mad.

39
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:56,000
Everything we said is the truth.

40
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:59,400
It's fine if Old Zhang doesn't
believe, but he even scolded you.

41
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:06,959
But the hysteria shouldn't have been contagious

42
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,120
I've been practicing medicine for nearly ten years.
This is the first time I've seen such a strange thing.

43
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,080
Could it be not hysteria?

44
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:22,400
But looking at them, they clearly
believe they saw a snake demon.

45
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,280
If it's not hysteria, then what could it be?

46
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,280
Could someone be messing around?

47
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,199
Master, this small gift is not much.

48
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,840
Accept it, accept it, accept it.

49
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,800
There's no need for formalities.

50
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,960
I don't need any gifts, but I
would like to ask you all for a favor.

51
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,919
We're all family, no need to differentiate.

52
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,080
Speak frankly.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,319
Have any of you ever consider.

54
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,120
Why Lin Haoxuan, a demon catcher,
didn't recognize the snake demon.

55
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,000
I know.

56
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,800
Because this Lin Haoxuan, his skills are not refined.

57
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:07,680
Yes.

58
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:08,319
No.

59
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:13,680
The only reason Lin Haoxuan
can't recognize the snake demon is

60
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,199
his wife is a snake demon.

61
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,159
Impossible, master.

62
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,479
How could Miss Linglong, beautiful
and kind, possibly be a snake demon.

63
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,520
Isn't she beautiful?

64
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,840
You can know a person's face, but not their heart.

65
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,599
Ever since Linglong married into the Lin family, the city,
which used to be peaceful, has been haunted by the snake demon.

66
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,639
Only his Lin family is safe and sound.

67
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,840
He even falsely claimed that you have hysteria.

68
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,280
With a dose of calming soup, I don't know
how much silver you have been cheated.

69
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,759
Exactly.

70
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,039
Do you still think so now?

71
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,039
That's what happened.

72
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,039
It's simple.

73
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,360
Bring him over, we'll know once we ask.

74
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,439
How is it?

75
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,360
I think it's gonna work

76
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,199
I think it's okay.

77
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,560
Okay, okay, okay.

78
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,439
Yes, Your Grace.

79
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,280
You just wait.

80
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,599
We'll bring him over right away.

81
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,159
Right, right.

82
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:13,319
Go, go, go.

83
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,120
Annoying.

84
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,639
Young master.

85
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,959
You should drink this cup too.

86
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:41,800
Cold as ice for eternity, everything is still quiet.

87
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,120
Cold as ice for eternity, everything is still quiet.

88
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,399
My heart is at ease, concentrating on my own thoughts.

89
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,800
Crazy woman.

90
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,240
Who are you looking for?

91
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,439
Still sleeping? Time to get up.

92
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,000
Was my palm strike that heavy.

93
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,360
How did you get so hurt?

94
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,240
Could it be that, you wanted to die for me?

95
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,600
Don't be so full of yourself.

96
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:11,360
The barrier of the Immortal Binding
Rope is activated by my inner strength.

97
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,720
You forcibly broke the
barrier, I'm lucky to be alive.

98
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:21,639
You, why are you back?

99
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,240
I

100
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,120
I... I forgot to take something, isn't it okay?

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,920
What did you write?

102
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,920
Old man.

103
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,079
Observing the chicken?

104
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,360
The man saw the demon,
and there was chaos in the city
