1
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:21,369
Come over here.

2
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,529
Hello, teacher.

3
00:00:30,049 --> 00:00:31,529
Let me see your hand too.

4
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:35,850
Yours.

5
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:39,729
All of you go out.

6
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:40,970
Yes.

7
00:00:47,409 --> 00:00:50,650
Take this bottle of medicine to the backyard,
dilute it with wine, and bring back quickly.

8
00:00:57,809 --> 00:00:59,369
I know you guys are demons.

9
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:01,089
Stop pretending.

10
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:04,290
As long as you don't do bad things, don't entangle with me

11
00:01:04,448 --> 00:01:07,369
I won't capture you, I will let you leave.

12
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:09,249
Mr. Lin.

13
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:14,770
Just because I'm a rare beauty in the world,

14
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,889
doesn't mean I'm a demon.

15
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,369
Of course, it's not just about this.

16
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,729
Her looks change frequently, once a man, and now a woman.

17
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,490
So it was because of this?

18
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,770
Mr. Lin, you have misunderstood.

19
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:33,969
Due to my sisters' stunning beauty,
she often attracts some perverts.

20
00:01:34,169 --> 00:01:37,369
Therefore, our father has applied
a spell on her since childhood.

21
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,770
Anyone who has bad intentions towards her

22
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,449
will see her as a handsome young man.

23
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,050
Do you...

24
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,490
I didn't. Don't make baseless assumptions.

25
00:01:54,089 --> 00:01:56,089
This fool is so easy to trick.

26
00:01:58,369 --> 00:01:59,369
That's not right

27
00:01:59,529 --> 00:02:01,490
I clearly saw you guys at your house that day.

28
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,010
Sister.

29
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:05,369
Tail?

30
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:08,250
Mr. Lin, you saw it wrong.

31
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:12,649
The Dragon Boat Festival is in a few days,
we are rehearsing the snake dance at home.

32
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,649
If you don't believe me, we can show you.

33
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:55,929
Mr. Lin.

34
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,209
My sister and I are good girls from a decent family.

35
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,090
It's really sad to be called a demon by you.

36
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:12,090
This is Xiong Huang wine.

37
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:13,489
Miss Linglong.

38
00:03:13,929 --> 00:03:18,810
Whether you're demons or not, we'll find out after a drink.

39
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:26,570
Alright then.

40
00:03:26,649 --> 00:03:27,729
Sister, don't.

41
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,649
This man does not trust us.

42
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:32,410
What if he poisoned the wine?

43
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,090
It's okay.

44
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,810
Mr. Lin, this wine

45
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:48,570
tastes terrible.

46
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:52,290
Wait a moment.

47
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,010
Lin something.

48
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,449
You actually served us such cheap wine.

49
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:21,849
That's a bit too much.

50
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:26,170
Could it really be that I'm mistaken?

51
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,889
They are not demons.

52
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:38,690
My apologies for my recklessness.

53
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,289
Whatever you need from me, just ask, ladies.

54
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,690
Fine, then marry me.

55
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:47,490
What.

56
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,170
Dr. Lin.

57
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:51,610
Please save my child.

58
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:53,889
Quickly put him on the bed, I will treat him.

59
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:13,250
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,370
I’m afraid there’s nothing I can do.

61
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,050
Son.

62
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,289
Please open your eyes and see your mother.

63
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,769
Son.

64
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:28,010
Son.

65
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,930
Son.

66
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:39,010
Son.

67
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,089
Son.

68
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,209
I will bring you home, son.

69
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,050
I can cure him.

70
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:05,610
Qingdai, why do you, as a girl, want to become a boy.

71
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,409
Sister, I've told you before.

72
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:13,170
This Mr. Lin is not a good man.

73
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,050
They even used Xionghuang to test you, it's really hateful.

74
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:20,930
It's a minor thing, I didn't take it to heart.

75
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:26,329
What I worry about is how to help him solve the problem.

76
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,050
Sister, how can you still be so stubborn.

77
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,570
You are still thinking of helping him at this point.

78
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:38,610
You are such a powerful demon.

79
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:40,409
Isn't that too disadvantageous?

80
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,730
Demons should enjoy their day. Live joyfully each day.
