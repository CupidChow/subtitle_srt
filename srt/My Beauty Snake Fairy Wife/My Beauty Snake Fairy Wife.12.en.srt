1
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,519
Look.

2
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:23,440
I told you, Lin is no good.

3
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,439
Is he worth it.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I never thought such a thing would happen to me.

5
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:46,240
What should I do now?

6
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,280
I don't want to leave him.

7
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:51,000
Sister.

8
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,359
I apologize for speaking candidly,

9
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,399
there's not a single good thing about human males.

10
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:01,000
You just won't listen.

11
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,640
Now that his true nature is exposed, don't be stubborn.

12
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,879
So what should I do now?

13
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,120
Cut the losses in time.

14
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,879
Sister.

15
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,920
Stop daydreaming.

16
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,480
Let's go, sister.

17
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:43,400
Do you want to be alone all your life.

18
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:46,400
Come with me, sister.

19
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,719
Let's go.

20
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,239
Let's go.

21
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,800
Qingdai,

22
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,159
I'm pregnant.

23
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,120
Madam.

24
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,199
Did teacher return?

25
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,759
Teacher said he won't return tonight.

26
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,058
He... he has someone else now,

27
00:02:54,082 --> 00:02:55,639
seems like he really likes her.

28
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,000
The other woman is seven or eight months pregnant.

29
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,680
Miss.

30
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,719
Miss.

31
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:12,560
It's too scary.

32
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,159
What's happening? How could this happen.

33
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,199
What is that thing.

34
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,759
Why has she laid an egg? I don't know.

35
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,680
It's too terrifying, let's go.

36
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,159
My lord.

37
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,759
My lord, wait for me.

38
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,138
Even if I gave birth to a normal child,

39
00:03:51,162 --> 00:03:53,599
you would still not love me like before.

40
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:55,639
Right?

41
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,280
After all, humans and demons are different.

42
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,759
I don't love you anymore.

43
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,519
Sister.

44
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,959
Forget Lin Haoxuan.

45
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:52,279
From now on, we will live in this
mountain and happily cultivate immortality.

46
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:55,920
So smelly.

47
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,519
Do I smell bad?

48
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,160
Sister.

49
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:20,839
My lady.

50
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,160
You're awake.

51
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:24,120
Do you know how long you've been unconscious?

52
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,279
Take it easy.

53
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,360
You say I've been unconscious?

54
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,279
Yes.

55
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:38,079
After I went to the clinic that day,
you passed out and wouldn't wake up.

56
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,600
No matter how much we called, you didn't wake up.

57
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,959
Fortunately, Master helped us.

58
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,399
To break the illusion, only one thing is needed.

59
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,120
I'm fine now.

60
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,959
It's great.

61
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,519
It's great.

62
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:23,839
Master said, you have been affected by
an illusion technique of a soul-eating flower.

63
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,519
But I can't find this dreadful
flower anywhere in the house.

64
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:50,639
Sister.

65
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,079
I was wrong about what happened today

66
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,000
I sincerely apologize to you.

67
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,800
You got me so annoyed early in
the morning, a sachet wouldn't help.

68
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,879
Sister

69
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,360
I was doing it for your own good.

70
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:15,439
If you are bullied under someone
else's roof, I would be heartbroken.

71
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:18,800
In the future,

72
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,560
As long as my you are OK, I will not talk too much anymore.

73
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,759
Really?

74
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,720
This is more like it
