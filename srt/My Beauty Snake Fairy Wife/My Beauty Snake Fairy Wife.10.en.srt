1
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,720
My lady.

2
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:12,119
Drink it while it's hot. Here.

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,480
I can't.

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,320
Good medicine tastes bitter.

5
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:22,039
Here.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,079
Not because it's bitter.

7
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,960
Can you guys give us some room?

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,679
It should be you who gives room.

9
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:37,200
Go, go, go.

10
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:38,759
Give it to me.

11
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:39,280
You.

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,159
Take it easy.

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,079
Sister, let me feed you.

14
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:49,359
No need, I can do it myself.

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,240
Excuse me.

16
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:51,759
Miss Qingdai.

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,359
Your injury can't be taken lightly.

18
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,520
I don't want.

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:56,960
Drink it.

20
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:59,600
I'm not sick okay.

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,119
Drink it.

22
00:01:04,358 --> 00:01:04,999
Enough.

23
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,159
Can you two go out?

24
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:08,599
So annoying.

25
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,879
Go go go.

26
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:10,879
Get out.

27
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,159
You get out too.

28
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,799
Hurry up and let Qingdai marry Xuyuan.

29
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:20,519
This.

30
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,599
In fact.

31
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,680
I'll stop pretending.

32
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,879
If it wasn't for you.

33
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:51,079
My sister and I would have been
happily cultivating in Qingfeng cave by now

34
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,120
I don't care what your relationship is.

35
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,519
She's already married to me,
you'd better stay away from her.

36
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:01,640
Haven't you ever doubted.

37
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,760
How could my perfect sister fall for
someone like you, a smelly doctor?

38
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,479
Don't you see what kind of person you are

39
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:13,280
I'll tell you the truth.

40
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,960
You're just a tool for assisting my
sister in her tribulation and ascension

41
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,039
Qingdai.

42
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,159
So I warn you, don't be a toad trying to eat swan meat.

43
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:25,000
Stay away from my sister.

44
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:25,919
My lady.

45
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,000
What she said is true?

46
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,360
My lord.

47
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:29,960
It's not like that.

48
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,639
Sister, stop lying to him.

49
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,800
Your kindness will only lead him to misunderstand.

50
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,919
He really thinks he's worthy of you.

51
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,439
You don't have to lie to me.

52
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,120
She really wants to be with me.

53
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,000
She has already married me.

54
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:45,680
If she's just trying to get through
the tribulation, why is she still with me.

55
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,800
It's all because you're incapable.

56
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,120
If she had a child, she would have
run away with the child a long time ago.

57
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:50,840
You.

58
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,599
My lord, don't listen to her nonsense.

59
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,840
Don't listen to her nonsense.

60
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,520
You don't need to say anymore.

61
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,240
I understand.

62
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
My lord.

63
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,319
I'll go to the clinic first.

64
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,360
Dr. Lin.

65
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,199
Dr. Lin.

66
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,639
Brother Zhang.

67
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,159
Look

68
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:50,879
this is.

69
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,919
My wife heard you're marrying Miss Linglong

70
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,879
she got peanuts and big jujube from the country relatives.

71
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,919
To wish you have children soon.

72
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,479
Because you are so kind-hearted.

73
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:14,120
So that's why heaven has bestowed
you such a lady who loves you

74
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:15,319
yeah.

75
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,360
She truly loves me.

76
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,000
Of course, everyone is watching.

77
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:23,839
Split them.

78
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,879
Come on, split these red dates and peanuts.

79
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:28,680
Yes.

80
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,160
Well...

81
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,720
Split them.

82
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:40,510
Sister

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,560
sister

84
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,240
sister.

85
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:57,000
I have already apologized to
you, why are you still ignoring me?

86
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,560
I can also warm your body.

87
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,800
I won't bother brother Qingdai to warm my lady's body.

88
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,000
Get out.

89
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:30,639
My lady.

90
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,000
Feeling warmer?

91
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,639
My lord, are you no longer angry at me?

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,279
I'm angry.

93
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,839
Of course I'm angry

94
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,399
Qingdai's attitude towards you...

95
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,399
My lord

96
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,639
I've known Qingdai for hundreds of years.

97
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,560
If I could do something with her, it would have happened.

98
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,920
So, you really don't need to worry about this.

99
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,399
I'm just angry that you can't be honest with me.

100
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:03,920
Of course, I know you have me in your heart.

101
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,199
No matter what your purpose for me was before.

102
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:10,360
But I hope from now on

103
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:16,600
we can live a good life as a loving couple.

104
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:22,439
It seems that I did not give you enough sense of security.

105
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:26,839
It's about time we should deepen our feelings.

106
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,160
My lady.

107
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:33,399
Are you in good shape now?

108
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,759
No big problem.

109
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,319
My lady.

110
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,800
What if we end up with an egg?

111
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,240
Different question.

112
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:44,759
OK.

113
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,079
How old are you?

114
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,720
Can you please stop talking at this point?
