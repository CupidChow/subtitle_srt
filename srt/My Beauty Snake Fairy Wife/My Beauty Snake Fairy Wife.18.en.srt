1
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,399
You are truly a demon, give me your life.

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,719
Stop.

3
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:28,000
Stop.

4
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:30,359
Changqing.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,280
Miss Linglong is a friend of mine, you can't harm her.

6
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:34,759
You.

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,759
Prince.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,159
You know she colludes with the Black Evil Spirit.

9
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:41,920
Yet you still allow her to stay here,
disregarding the safety of the merfolk.

10
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:44,719
Changqing, don't be fooled.

11
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,159
Brother.

12
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,520
There must be some misunderstanding.

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,759
Miss Linglong is definitely not like that

14
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,759
I can guarantee with my life.

15
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,000
Okay.

16
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:58,600
Don't blame me for being rude then.

17
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:19,760
It's all my fault. I didn't protect
you well. You got hurt so badly.

18
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,159
I also don't know why.

19
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,400
From the first look, I liked you very much.

20
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,879
Perhaps.

21
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:39,680
We might have met in a past life.

22
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:49,879
Brother.

23
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,840
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,519
Miss Linglong will be fine.

25
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,879
I have already arranged for
the best spiritual medicine for her.

26
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,640
Brother.

27
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,959
I want to lend her the Revival Pearl.

28
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:03,519
Nonsense.

29
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,319
Do you understand what this pearl
means to you, to the entire merfolk tribe?

30
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:11,319
If anything goes wrong.

31
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:14,560
Not just you, the entire merfolk tribe will suffer.

32
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,639
I know.

33
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,599
You met someone you like for the first time.

34
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:20,439
I understand.

35
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,960
But you can't joke about this.

36
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,159
We will surely find a win-win solution.

37
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:27,719
But Miss Linglong, she...

38
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:28,400
Enough.

39
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,240
Let's stop the topic here, don't bring it up again.

40
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,919
My lord.

41
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,960
My lord

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,840
Linglong.

43
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,439
My lord.

44
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,879
I thought I would never see you again.

45
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,240
My lord.

46
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,840
Why are you looking at me like this.

47
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:53,240
So this is the look when you watch the person you like.

48
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,520
My lord.

49
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,240
Is there something on your mind.

50
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:18,839
If I can't survive, are you really
willing to go to the underworld with me.

51
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,879
I'm willing to live with you, and die with you.

52
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:32,639
My lord.

53
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,319
Why don't you call me your lady?

54
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,279
I...

55
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,040
My lady.

56
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,279
Let's never separate again.

57
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:13,720
My lady.

58
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,319
Can you help me fulfill a wish.

59
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,959
As long as it's what you hope, I will.

60
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:39,439
My lord, this is...

61
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,560
My lady.

62
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,399
I want to marry you again.

63
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,800
Are you joking?

64
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,600
We've already married.

65
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,040
I want to marry you again.

66
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,000
But I have forgotten the routine.

67
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,079
Can you teach me.

68
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:09,680
With the matchmaker as witness, I, Xue
Linglong, today become wife of Lin Haoxuan.

69
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,360
From now on.

70
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:17,720
Whether we are poor or rich, through sickness
and health, I am willing to bear it with him.

71
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,720
In life we share a blanket, and in death - a grave.

72
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,920
With the Matchmaker as witness, I

73
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,000
become husband of Xue Linglong.

74
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,879
From now on.

75
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,079
Whether rich or poor, through illness and hardships.

76
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,879
I will always protect her.

77
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,879
As long as she is happy, I can do anything.

78
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,319
My lady.

79
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,639
I am just a mortal after all.

80
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,000
In a few decades, I will still leave you.

81
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,720
Why not find someone who can be together forever.

82
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,920
My lord.

83
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:19,480
No matter which life, I will definitely find you.

84
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,560
I see.

85
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,600
Why not take the chance and take the Revival Pearl.

86
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:25,000
What else is more important than saving his life?

87
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,199
I can't violate the righteousness to take your things.

88
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,320
Nor can I force you to help me.

89
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,399
I can fulfill you.

90
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,799
Really?

91
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:55,879
Revival Pearl can call back the scattered
soul of a person from the three realms.

92
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:59,039
It can save your husband's life.

93
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:05,080
Without my consent just now,
you couldn't take the Revival Pearl.

94
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:06,879
But you must know.

95
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,759
The Revival Pearl relates to
the survival of the merfolk tribe.

96
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,639
After using it, return it intact immediately.

97
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,080
Go, use it to save your husband's life.

98
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,200
I've turned the pearl into a
koi, may luck always be with you.

99
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,120
Thank you for the pearl, prince.

100
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,559
I will never forget this kindness in my entire life.

101
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,879
No need.

102
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,919
Perhaps.

103
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,159
It can make me feel a bit of what I have been longing for.

104
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,000
You once saved my life.

105
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,840
Consider it as a return.

106
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:56,519
From now on, neither of us owes each other.

107
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,840
You must be very careful.

108
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:08,440
After using the pearl, I will
definitely return it immediately
