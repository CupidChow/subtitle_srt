1
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,280
Sister

2
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,039
Qingdai.

3
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,880
Here are some flowers for you.

4
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,439
I've made up my mind.

5
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,479
You treat me best in this world, I
will now go with you to anywhere

6
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,759
I think it's possible.

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,359
Let's bring some ritual feeling.

8
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:08,840
My lord.

9
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:11,799
My lady.

10
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,079
She... she's enchanted by my zither music.

11
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,280
My lady.

12
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,200
Your zither music is very melancholy.

13
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:26,200
I dreamed yesterday that you ran away with another woman.

14
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,159
What a coincidence.

15
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,120
When you are in a coma, I've also been having nightmares.

16
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,599
But dreams are usually the opposite.

17
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,560
You and I would never separate.

18
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,159
I know.

19
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,719
We haven't been sleeping well these past few days.

20
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,400
How about we catch up on some sleep
and, maybe, make a baby or something.

21
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,040
My lord.

22
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,079
What if I lay an egg.

23
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,319
Don't worry.

24
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:03,120
Then we'll play rock paper scissors.

25
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,640
Loser gets to hatch the egg.

26
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,400
You big bad egg.

27
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,319
I'm just your little dummy egg.

28
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,360
Qingdai

29
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,639
I've brought you a jar of ginseng tonic wine.

30
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,520
You are now a woman, you need to take good care of yourself

31
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,599
Xue Linglong, how dare you.

32
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,840
You are heartless to treat me so cruelly

33
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,080
I've been accommodating you, tolerating you, loving you.

34
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,680
Do not do unto others what
you do not want done to yourself.

35
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,159
The feeling of being rejected by
someone you care about is not pleasant.

36
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,199
There's a snake!

37
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,560
He won't remember anything when he wakes up.

38
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,520
I being discovered and banished,
isn't that what you wanted.

39
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,520
After all, you and I are of the same kind

40
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,120
I won't really harm you.

41
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,960
But you shouldn't try to drive a wedge
between me and my husband in the future.

42
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,560
Let's consider it even.

43
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,280
Since you don't like this ginseng tonic wine.

44
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,639
Then I'll take it back and taste it with my husband.

45
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:02,360
Madam

46
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,560
I don't know what's going on.

47
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,240
Lately I've been fainting easily.

48
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,560
Madam

49
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,879
You sit down and rest for a while.

50
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,520
Also,

51
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,120
this shoulder always hurts a bit.

52
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,360
Let me see this shoulder.

53
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,279
It is indeed a bit red.

54
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,279
Does it hurt here?

55
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,480
Here, right?

56
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,000
Feeling better?

57
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,120
Is this the place?

58
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:31,160
Are you feeling better now?

59
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,120
Gently, Dr. Lin.

60
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,199
Okay, I'm going to apply more pressure now.

61
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:43,839
Dr. Lin.

62
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,639
Madam.

63
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,240
Be gentle!

64
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,800
Teacher can't care about anything
else when he sees a patient.

65
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:50,720
I know my own husband.

66
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,920
Dr. Lin.

67
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,079
Thank you.

68
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,759
No problem, you can find me anytime.

69
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,560
Okay.

70
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,879
Dr. Lin.

71
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:15,879
It hurts here, here, and here. What should I do?

72
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:18,920
My lady, don't be like this.

73
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:22,800
Even beset by a frail beauty, you still remember others.

74
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,120
The beauty is already in my arms. Of
course, I don't care about anyone else.

75
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,639
My Lord, the Dragon Boat Festival is in a few days.

76
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,519
We need to live apart for a while

77
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,600
I'm worried that during the month I
won't be able to maintain my human form.

78
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,839
Just right.

79
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,120
We'll take this time to prepare ourselves properly.

80
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:42,720
No.

81
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,360
How can you bear to leave me alone in the cold quilt.

82
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,240
You... you just let me stay alone in the empty room?

83
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,399
No, you can't leave.

84
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,639
Be good.

85
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:55,920
I fear that you will be scared when I reveal my true form.

86
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,519
Besides, it's not convenient for you,
a mere mortal, to come to our place.

87
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,920
Fine, I agree.

88
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,360
Is there a reward?

89
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:18,319
All right.

90
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,600
It's getting late. Let's go home early.

91
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,319
To celebrate the festival before you leave.

92
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,480
Okay

93
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,920
I've prepared something good.

94
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,759
Awake?

95
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,120
Leave quickly.

96
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,920
Miss Qingdai, what happened to me just now?

97
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,759
You've had too much to drink.

98
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:03,240
Is that so? Sorry.

99
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,600
If you know it's impolite, then leave quickly.

100
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,560
Miss Qingdai

101
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:14,240
I've been having a bad dream.

102
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,199
I dreamt of a big snake chasing after me.

103
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,759
And then Miss Qingdai saved me.

104
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,839
Then I devoted myself to you.

105
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,000
That's right.

106
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,800
This is a carefully chosen gift
for the Dragon Boat Festival.

107
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,199
Xionghuang Wine.

108
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,160
What is this?

109
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,759
You almost killed me.

110
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,560
How could I kill you.

111
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,720
That's not right.

112
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,199
This is not the wine I brought.

113
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,519
What happened to you, my lady?

114
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,399
My lady.

115
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,079
There's something wrong with this wine.

116
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,560
There is Xionghuang in this wine.

117
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,079
My lady.

118
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:05,639
My lord.

119
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:06,600
Are you alright?

120
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,680
I don't feel very well, I... I need to go.

121
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,439
My lady, what are you doing?

122
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,000
You rest early.

123
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,120
My lady, where are you going?

124
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,399
I...

125
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,040
My lady.

126
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,279
Are you alright?

127
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,720
My lady.

128
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,680
You leave quickly, I don't
want you to see my original form.

129
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,839
My lady.

130
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,480
I accept you no matter what you look like

131
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:29,000
I like you no matter what you look like.

132
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,239
Don't be afraid, I'm here
