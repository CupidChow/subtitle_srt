1
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,359
﻿Don't be afraid, I'm here.

2
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,000
Binding Spell

3
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,439
Sister's vitality was damaged and has not recovered.

4
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,039
Overconsumption of Xionghuang
wine caused her to lose consciousness.

5
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,479
I'll first take control of her body and enter her spirit.

6
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:02,880
You guard the door.

7
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:49,480
This is a unity charm.

8
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,519
It allows your spirit to leave your body
and enter the spirit world of the demon.

9
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,280
You've already decided to live with the demon.

10
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,359
Maybe one day it will come in handy.

11
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,039
Qingdai

12
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:36,360
My lady

13
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,719
It's me

14
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,680
My lady

15
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,840
I am Haoxuan, my lady.

16
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,240
Wake up, my lady.

17
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,080
Wake up quickly.

18
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,080
Wake up

19
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,919
I am Haoxuan.

20
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,240
I am Haoxuan, my lady.

21
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,800
Wake up

22
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,759
My lady

23
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,439
I am Hao...

24
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,840
Wake up quickly, my lady.

25
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,560
I want to be with you every day.

26
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,960
Even if we do nothing,

27
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:48,639
I'm happy just holding you.

28
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:57,560
I love you so much.

29
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:07,919
See you in the next life.

30
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:45,879
My lord

31
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,560
My lord

32
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,959
What are you doing?

33
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:27,959
Are you crazy?

34
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,000
You will lose your life.

35
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:35,920
My lord

36
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,399
If you hadn't met me, you hadn't been with me.

37
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:43,800
Perhaps you wouldn't have been hurt by me.

38
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:45,199
He's just a mortal.

39
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:47,519
A mortal can reincarnate, what about you?

40
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,000
Why waste your thousand years
of cultivation on such a person?

41
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:59,399
He died for me.

42
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,160
I'm willing to waste all my cultivation to bring him back.

43
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,720
He was ultimately harmed by me.

44
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,160
Wait

45
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,399
Sister

46
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,720
Do you remember when we were practicing? I heard,

47
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,879
in the Eastern Sea region

48
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,600
Merfolk's Shore

49
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,439
There is something called the Revival Pearl.

50
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:53,879
Within seven days, as long as
we find it, he can be resurrected.

51
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,639
Help me guard his body.

52
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,120
Within seven days

53
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,240
I will definitely return with the Revival Pearl.
