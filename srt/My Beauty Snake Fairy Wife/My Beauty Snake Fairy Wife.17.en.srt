1
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,879
Chief, you were looking for me?

2
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,760
Everyone can leave

3
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:31,160
Yes, yes

4
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,799
Miss Linglong, please sit

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,039
Miss Linglong

6
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,439
I have a request that may be asking too much

7
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,840
Please speak

8
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,599
Could you marry Changqing and
stay at Merfolk's Shore thereafter

9
00:01:05,078 --> 00:01:09,560
Thank you for high regard, but I'm already married

10
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,959
Miss Linglong may not understand our Merfolk clan

11
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,599
Do you know why Changqing's hair turned black?

12
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,519
Our merpeople don’t have a gender at birth

13
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:36,000
Only when we meet the one we
like, our gender will be confirmed

14
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:38,319
Thus, the white hair will turn to black

15
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,920
Once we commit to someone we like, we stay loyal till death

16
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:46,439
Even if Changqing has recognized me

17
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,480
But I'm always an outsider. I'll have to leave eventually

18
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,200
I see Zi Su cares a lot for Changqing

19
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,120
Chief, why don't you bring them together

20
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,319
Zi Su is good to Changqing, I know that

21
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,519
But her mother, Priestess Xia, is too ambitious

22
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,640
I've actually known all along

23
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,800
Priestess Xia has been secretly trying to
arrange a marriage between Zi Su and Changqing

24
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,800
If she succeeds

25
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,120
The entire Merfolk's Shore will be in danger

26
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,879
Miss Linglong

27
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,240
I know it's a bit too much to ask
you to accept Changqing immediately

28
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,960
But whatever you want

29
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,599
As long as you are willing to speak
up, I can try my best to satisfy you

30
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:37,479
I believe Miss Linglong's arrival at
Merfolk's Shore is definitely not that simple

31
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,840
To tell the truth

32
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,199
My husband, his life is hanging by a thread

33
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:46,000
This time I came to Merfolk's Shore just to
borrow the Revival Pearl of the Merfolk tribe

34
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,800
Revival Pearl?

35
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,000
If I use Revival Pearl as a trade

36
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,319
Would you like to stay?

37
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,319
Changqing

38
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,800
My husband is critically injured due to my mistake

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,400
Within seven days, I must return
with the Revival Pearl to save him

40
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,319
Otherwise, he will surely perish.

41
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,000
As long as you're willing to lend me the pearl

42
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,560
In the future, whenever the Merfolk tribe needs me

43
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:35,680
I will surely not refuse even if it means death

44
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:40,599
I don't want you to face death

45
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,439
I want you to stay with me

46
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:52,759
If I ask you to take the pearl to save him, but
the condition is that you have to come back to me,

47
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,240
Would you like to?

48
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,560
Changqing

49
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:18,920
I know the Revival Pearl is an
extremely important treasure,

50
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,399
If you are willing to help me,
I will be very grateful to you.

51
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,720
But if you don't want to

52
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,800
I won't force you

53
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,519
Linglong

54
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:33,160
If you want to save people with
our Merfolk's Shore's treasure

55
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,600
You have to exchange it with yourself

56
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:44,519
I can die for it, but I can't be with you

57
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,800
No matter what, I can't be parted from my husband

58
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,240
You'd rather see your husband die than stay with me?

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,439
As long as you agree, I can give you the pearl right away

60
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,720
You don't have to hurry to answer me

61
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,319
I can give you a little more time

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,160
Linglong

63
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,279
How can I keep you

64
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,879
Changqing

65
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,600
You're not really going to give
the peral to Xue Linglong, are you?

66
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,439
Brother

67
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,560
Tell me,

68
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,199
what should I do to keep her?

69
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,360
I have also tried to persuade her

70
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,639
but she made it clear that she will never leave her husband

71
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,720
Why do you insist so much?

72
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,040
You are only together briefly

73
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,639
If it's only because she has saved your life

74
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,959
We can think of other ways to show gratitude

75
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:00,839
Brother

76
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,720
For all these years, I've been surviving
on the power of the Revival Pearl

77
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,240
Sometimes

78
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,199
I feel like I'm just a container

79
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,759
Until her arrival

80
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,199
Though the time I spent with her wasn't long enough

81
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:30,360
But lately, I feel like normal

82
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,800
If she's willing to stay

83
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,680
I'd prefer to hand over the Revival Pearl

84
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,519
No way

85
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:45,199
Next month will be the
strengthening ceremony for the barrier

86
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,800
The big picture cannot be ruined
because of your personal affairs

87
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:53,240
Changqing

88
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,920
If you truly want to keep her

89
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,759
I'll think of other ways for you

90
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,519
Zi Su

91
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:29,800
Miss

92
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,000
Where did I offend you?

93
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,720
You like Brother Changqing, don't you?

94
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:37,920
You're overthinking it.

95
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,040
Changqing and I are just friends.

96
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:43,639
I came to Merfolk's Shore

97
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,279
because of the Revival Pearl
that can bring people back to life

98
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,759
I want to borrow it to save my husband

99
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,040
Husband?

100
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,959
You have a husband and you're
still flirting with Brother Changqing

101
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,839
Does he know?

102
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,319
He knows, and I didn't...

103
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,319
Would he still be willing to
metamorphose for you knowing this?

104
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,839
What kind of magic potion did you give him?

105
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:04,399
The metamorphosis of Changqing is just an accident

106
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
But I assure you

107
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,759
My love for my husband is as sincere as yours for Changqing

108
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,959
What happened to your husband?

109
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,959
He is critically injured by my mistake

110
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,800
I must get the Revival Pearl now to save him

111
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,320
Since you can't let go of Changqing
that you've metamorphosed for him

112
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,639
Then just take him back

113
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:52,279
What's so great about a Xue Linglong?

114
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:53,919
At worst, mother will help you

115
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,440
Mother

116
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,759
She doesn't like Changqing

117
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:04,519
She's here for the Revival Pearl

118
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,840
Then give her the Revival Pearl

119
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,000
then she will leave

120
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:10,399
But isn't the Revival Pearl a legend?

121
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,679
I grew up in Merfolk's Shore and never saw it

122
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:21,320
I've also heard of the Revival Pearl, it's sealed somewhere

123
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,120
It is said that the Revival Pearl
is sealed in the Spirit Shrine

124
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,080
Xue Linglong

125
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,879
You trespassed into forbidden territory, breaking
the seal, trying to release the Black Evil Spirit

126
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,320
Black Evil Spirit?

127
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:08,600
You misunderstood

128
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,879
You dare to argue?
