1
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:34,200
Good daughter.

2
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:37,119
I watched him grow up since childhood.

3
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,320
I'm also heartbroken to see him like this.

4
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:47,439
After all,

5
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,679
blame it on Xue Linglong.

6
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,280
If she hadn't taken the Revival
Pearl, Changqing wouldn't be like this.

7
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,960
Good girl.

8
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:06,920
I have a way to save Changqing.

9
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,840
But it is somewhat difficult.

10
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,719
As long as I can save Changqing, I'm willing do anything.

11
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,319
Tell me quickly.

12
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm thinking,

13
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:29,959
since this Revival Pearl can save Lin Haoxuan.

14
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,120
It must also be able to bring Changqing back to life.

15
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,599
My lord, what's wrong with you.

16
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,319
My head hurts so much.

17
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,159
It's much better after the massage.

18
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,280
Thank you, my lady.

19
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,920
I feel like our destiny might span beyond this life.

20
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,400
Why do you say that?

21
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,080
It seems like we've married once again.

22
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,840
I still have a fishtail.

23
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,800
Is it because of the Revival Pearl?

24
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,240
It's as if I saw my past life.

25
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,120
Probably.

26
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,719
My lady.

27
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,080
Where did you get such a magical Revival Pearl.

28
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,000
I borrowed it from a friend.

29
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:36,919
Wait until you get a little
better, I have to return it to him.

30
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,879
Let's take the medicine.

31
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,280
I originally thought you were very cunning.

32
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,840
How can't you even escape the rope.

33
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,840
If I really want to run, could this rope hold me back?

34
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,840
That's not right.

35
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,479
You keep saying you want to help
me, now you just lock me here alone.

36
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,280
What is it?

37
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,360
You are possessed and craving for blood.

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,400
How can I help you?

39
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:35,240
Go ahead, relieve your craving.

40
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,759
You fooled me with chicken blood, who will eat it.

41
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,039
Suit yourself.

42
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,560
Miss.

43
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,000
These herbs, too much or too little both won't work.

44
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,560
If more, patients will have nosebleeds, if fewer, no effect.

45
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,360
How do we control the dose?

46
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:35,600
My lady.

47
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,399
Look at this, Dr. Lin

48
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,279
Dr. Lin.

49
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:39,600
Dr. Lin.

50
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,800
There is a snake demon, snake demon.

51
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,040
There's a snake demon.

52
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,040
Dr. Lin.

53
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,120
You... you don't believe me.

54
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,639
Brother Li.

55
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,199
Don't worry, calm down.

56
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,839
Let's talk in the backyard.

57
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,000
What else to say.

58
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,519
That snake demon has turned my home upside down.

59
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,360
What.

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,800
Your house.

61
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,079
Yes.

62
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:58,519
Dr. Lin.

63
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,279
You need to come and save me.

64
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,360
Brother Li, take a rest, I'll prepare the tools.

65
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,040
Okay.

66
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Snake demon.

67
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,279
My lord, something is amiss.

68
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,199
What's wrong, my lady.

69
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,079
That person doesn't have a demonic aura. He
doesn't look like he has encountered a snake demon

70
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,240
I'll check it out.

71
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,319
I have to go now.

72
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,199
Brother Li, let's go.

73
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,879
Should we bring more people?

74
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,040
That snake is really big.

75
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,680
Come, both of you, follow me.

76
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,160
Here you go.

77
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,160
Dr. Lin, look.

78
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,879
This is my family's yard.

79
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,040
This estate clearly doesn't have any demon
energy, something strange must be happening.

80
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,879
You're right.

81
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:09,639
Because only my dad can see the demon.

82
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,560
You.

83
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,959
Demon does not exist.

84
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,920
Sure.

85
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,720
You little brats, don't even
trust what your own father says.

86
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,720
All rise.

87
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,600
Go and face the wall.

88
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,439
Hurry up.

89
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,560
Quite productive, eh Brother Li

90
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,560
I only have this ability, to make children.

91
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:34,600
Did you maybe misjudged, Brother Li.

92
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,399
Miss Linglong.

93
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,839
Even you don't trust me

94
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:37,800
I tell you.

95
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:41,160
As long as you help me catch this snake demon in the yard.

96
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,759
I will give double the reward. No, I will give triple.

97
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,759
My lady, three times.

98
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:59,920
But there are obviously no demons
in this house, what are we catching?

99
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,879
Although we are not making money from this.

100
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:07,199
But our rooftop really needs a renovation.

101
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,879
The medicine cabinet should also be reinforced.

102
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,040
The backyard wall is also loose.

103
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,600
Hello.

104
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,399
How have you guys decided.

105
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,000
Snake.

106
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,000
It's over there.

107
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,639
It's just over there.

108
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,480
Don't come over.

109
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,480
Brother Li.

110
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,040
Brother Li.

111
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,680
Brother Li.

112
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,439
You must have seen it wrong,
there really are no demons here.

113
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,439
Dr. Lin.

114
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:07,639
The snake demon is right there.
You quickly capture it. Capture it!

115
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,199
Brother Li.

116
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,079
You obviously messed up this yard
yourself, where did any demon come from.

117
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,040
No.

118
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,000
Why don't you believe me yet? Look
at the snake demon, that snake demon.

119
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:21,879
It's too scary.

120
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,120
I said.

121
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,519
There are no demons in our house.

122
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,799
My dad is obviously lying.

123
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,759
Only three-year-olds would believe him.

124
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,279
That's it.

125
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,320
My lord.

126
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,600
I feel that Brother Li is not lying.

127
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:51,039
He seems to have hysteria, he really
believes that he saw a snake demon.

128
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,960
What should we do, Dr. Lin?

129
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,240
Please save my dad.

130
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,559
Yes, yes, please save my father.

131
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:57,519
Don't worry

132
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,399
I'll go back and make a calming herbal soup for your father.

133
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,159
At that time, remind him to take the medicine on time.

134
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,080
Thank you Dr. Lin.

135
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,960
We should also have four.

136
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:25,039
Cold as ice for eternity, everything is still quiet.

137
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,559
Cold as ice for eternity, everything is still quiet.

138
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,440
My heart is at ease, concentrating on my own thoughts.

139
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,360
My heart is easy.

140
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,440
It's "My heart is at ease“.

141
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,320
Alright.

142
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,200
I appreciate your kindness, but don't waste your time on me.

143
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,600
Didn't you promise me to concentrate on your cultivation.

144
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:49,759
Quickly read with me.

145
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,039
I regret it.

146
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:53,240
I'm not cultivating anymore.

147
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,039
How will you cure your bloodthirsty
problem without cultivation

148
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:01,759
I've lived so many years, you're
not the first to urge me to be good.

149
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:06,039
I have tried too.

150
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,519
But I've made a big mistake.

151
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,039
Even the gods won't help me.

152
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,440
Don't waste any more time.

153
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:20,559
God will not help you, I will.

154
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,759
You are a good girl, why bother to deal with demons all day.

155
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:41,200
If you are an ordinary girl.

156
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,960
How carefree you must be living.

157
00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:07,440
The rope is gone, crazy woman,
you didn't expect it, did you?

158
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
We'll meet again
