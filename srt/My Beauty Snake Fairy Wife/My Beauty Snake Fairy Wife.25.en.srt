1
00:00:39,332 --> 00:00:40,051
Hurry.

2
00:00:40,811 --> 00:00:41,892
Come out quickly.

3
00:00:42,012 --> 00:00:42,771
No.

4
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:47,691
Without my cultivation to drive the Revival
Pearl, the Black Evil Spirit cannot be suppressed.

5
00:00:48,332 --> 00:00:52,212
If you don't come out, you'll
be trapped in there with her.

6
00:01:04,652 --> 00:01:07,132
Don't hesitate anymore, there's no time.

7
00:01:13,371 --> 00:01:16,572
Don't hesitate anymore, there's no time.

8
00:01:48,371 --> 00:01:50,052
Crazy woman.

9
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:53,251
Don't think of me.

10
00:02:31,331 --> 00:02:32,412
My lord.

11
00:02:34,451 --> 00:02:35,331
My lord.

12
00:02:35,891 --> 00:02:36,731
My lord.

13
00:02:36,812 --> 00:02:37,651
Sister.

14
00:02:39,611 --> 00:02:40,611
Sister.

15
00:02:53,692 --> 00:02:56,491
I warned you about the troubles of
beautiful woman, but you didn't listen.

16
00:02:57,731 --> 00:02:59,771
Now two grown men are lying in one bed.

17
00:03:00,532 --> 00:03:02,412
Thank goodness my Qingdai is not a beauty...

18
00:03:02,812 --> 00:03:03,651
No, no.

19
00:03:04,692 --> 00:03:06,451
She's not trouble, she's not trouble.

20
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,532
Beauty...

21
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:11,972
No.

22
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:12,891
Miss Linglong.

23
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:14,012
Where is Qingdai?

24
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:15,012
She's alright.

25
00:03:15,171 --> 00:03:16,012
Step aside.

26
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:18,771
Are you out of your mind?

27
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:26,492
All your cultivation is in this inner elixir.
How can you ascend to immortality if it's lost.

28
00:04:26,932 --> 00:04:32,451
I don't want to be immortal,
I just want to be with my husband.

29
00:04:34,771 --> 00:04:36,971
Since we can't be together in this life.

30
00:04:37,732 --> 00:04:41,732
I hope to see him again in the next life.

31
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,692
The soul and body cannot be unified.

32
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:06,172
What use is it for you to keep his soul.

33
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:12,211
Take good care of him for me.

34
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:18,372
Don't.

35
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:20,891
Don't.

36
00:05:34,331 --> 00:05:36,651
Stop!

37
00:06:32,252 --> 00:06:33,891
I will definitely take care of him.

38
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:38,851
And you.

39
00:07:20,411 --> 00:07:21,612
You are Qingdai?

40
00:07:21,612 --> 00:07:23,091
You are naughty again.

41
00:07:23,612 --> 00:07:26,692
Why did you transform to a man.

42
00:07:28,891 --> 00:07:29,492
Look.

43
00:07:29,932 --> 00:07:31,612
I am your destined one.

44
00:07:31,771 --> 00:07:34,252
Why do you keep trying to drive
a wedge between Mr. Lin and me?

45
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,451
I didn't.

46
00:07:41,492 --> 00:07:44,451
He talked about helping you hide your true form?

47
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:47,531
I don't think he accepts the real you.

48
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:54,932
Take good care of him for me.

49
00:07:58,732 --> 00:08:02,851
It's been hundreds of years,
you still don't understand me.

50
00:08:08,932 --> 00:08:10,771
I don't want to become immortal.

51
00:08:12,252 --> 00:08:13,812
I just want to stay by your side.

52
00:09:03,092 --> 00:09:06,531
Cold as ice for eternity, everything is still quiet.

53
00:09:06,852 --> 00:09:10,452
My heart is at ease, concentrating on my own thoughts.

54
00:09:10,811 --> 00:09:14,291
Cold as ice for eternity, everything is still quiet.

55
00:09:14,811 --> 00:09:18,372
My heart is at ease, concentrating on my own thoughts.

56
00:09:19,612 --> 00:09:24,092
Cold as ice for eternity, everything is still quiet.

57
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:30,891
My heart is at ease, concentrating on my own thoughts.

58
00:09:32,092 --> 00:09:35,452
Cold as ice for eternity, everything is still quiet.

59
00:09:35,852 --> 00:09:39,612
My heart is at ease, concentrating on my own thoughts

60
00:09:43,092 --> 00:09:46,492
18 years later.

61
00:09:53,771 --> 00:09:54,612
Is the medicine ready?

62
00:09:54,691 --> 00:09:55,411
Ready.

63
00:09:55,531 --> 00:09:56,291
Put it there.

64
00:10:00,452 --> 00:10:01,492
Where is Xuan?

65
00:10:02,012 --> 00:10:05,012
This kid left early in the morning,
I don't know what he's doing.

66
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,212
Probably went to the mountain again.

67
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,171
Still so obsessed with medicinal herbs.

68
00:10:13,931 --> 00:10:15,092
Isn't he just like me?

69
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:16,732
Like you?

70
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:22,092
Yes, like I have been obsessed
with you for so many years.

71
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,092
Stop. People are watching.

72
00:10:26,891 --> 00:10:28,291
What's wrong with a kiss?

73
00:10:28,492 --> 00:10:29,891
Xuan will be back soon.

74
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,612
He's grown up. He probably will meet his love too.

75
00:10:32,852 --> 00:10:33,891
Come on, give me a kiss.

76
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:27,531
Miss
