1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,199
Snake, snake.

2
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:11,160
Don't come over.

3
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,600
My lord.

4
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:36,960
Benefactor.

5
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,000
You.

6
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:40,240
How come you are with her?

7
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:42,759
All were misunderstandings before.

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,039
Everyone misunderstood Linglong.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,640
Now the snake demon has been tamed by me.

10
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:54,119
Mr. Lin.

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,439
Miss Linglong.

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,359
I

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,759
I'm sorry, for both of you. I'm really sorry.

14
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,880
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,439
Dr. Lin, my sister is not doing well.

16
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,599
What's wrong, little sister?

17
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:19,719
My sister got a serious illness.
Only you can save her.

18
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,239
Go.

19
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:21,840
Master, miss once said.

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,599
No matter what happens, you cannot leave the clinic.

21
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,000
Dr. Lin, my sister's in bad shape.
You need to come with me to save her.

22
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:33,159
Does she look like she's possessed by evil?

23
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,719
Master, we will go with you.

24
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:37,200
It's urgent to save lives, go
and boil the medicine just now.

25
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,840
Little girl, will you take me there.

26
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,799
Good, hurry up.

27
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,799
Master.

28
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,239
It's time for your medication.

29
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:57,840
Thank you.

30
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,120
I will feed you.

31
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,079
No need.

32
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,040
I can handle this minor injury by myself.

33
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,319
You talk lightly, the old wounds have
not yet healed, and new ones are added.

34
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,080
How can you help me like this in the future?

35
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,680
I

36
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,240
What are you doing.

37
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,000
Why are you so nervous.

38
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,039
To tell you the truth.

39
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,560
Do you want to help me or love me.

40
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,879
My life is long.

41
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:41,400
Since you want to love me, you must live a long life.

42
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,479
Where is the Master?

43
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,039
Miss.

44
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,800
Master has gone to treat a little girl.

45
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,759
Didn't I tell you to keep an eye on him all the time.

46
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,199
Miss.

47
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:14,000
The kid wasn't controlled by the evil spirit.
It seemed like a real emergency.

48
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,479
Dr. Lin, my sister is inside.

49
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:24,840
Okay.

50
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,879
Miss, where do you feel unwell.

51
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,879
How many hours has he gone.

52
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,240
It's been at least three hours.

53
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,800
Do you still remember
what that little girl looks like.

54
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,080
Not tall.

55
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,800
Looks about 11 or 12 years
old with two little braids.

56
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,680
Don't all kids look like this?

57
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,759
By the way,

58
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,280
I remember, I saw her playing with Old Li's son.

59
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,160
It was Zi Su.

60
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,040
How did you recognize this.

61
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,839
There's no mistake.

62
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,600
I grew up with her since childhood.

63
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,079
It must be Priest Xia who instructed
her to take Lin Haoxuan away.

64
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,639
I need to save him.

65
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,000
Everyone come over.

66
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,839
Hong E, Lu Rui.

67
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,480
Please take good care of the clinic for me.

68
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,000
If I don't come back.

69
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,399
You all, just take everyone
back to the mountain to practice.

70
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,199
Do not waste Haoxuan's work.

71
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:54,920
Miss.

72
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,560
Miss Qingdai.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,879
Miss Qingdai, me too.

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,839
Why are you here

75
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm going with you to save Old Lin.

76
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,560
What's it to you? We are going
to save people, not play around.

77
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,680
I promise not to slow you down.

78
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,399
We can't break in forcefully.

79
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,800
Otherwise, we won't be able to save him
and our strength and power will be exhausted

80
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,199
I'll take you through a secret passage.

81
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,360
Come with me.

82
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,079
Zi Su.

83
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,079
How do you know my name?

84
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,120
I don't know either.

85
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,319
I just feel familiar when I see you.

86
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,120
You.

87
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,600
Don't know why.

88
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,360
After I woke up.

89
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:36,600
There are many memories in
my mind that do not belong to me.

90
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,879
And some names.

91
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:41,879
Changgong.

92
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,079
Zi Su.

93
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,720
Changqing.

94
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,040
Who is he?

95
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,360
He is Xu Changqing who died because of you.

96
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:14,079
So he becoming like this, and the suffering
of Merfolk's Shore, all because of me?

97
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,439
Yes.

98
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,920
You harmed our mermaid tribe.

99
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,079
Did you bring me back to get the Revival Pearl?

100
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,519
Yes.

101
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,120
So if I return the Revival Pearl,
I can save him and your tribe?

102
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:32,600
You.

103
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,199
Are you willing to give up the Revival Pearl?

104
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,839
This originally belongs to you.
It should rightfully be returned.

105
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:49,839
But.

106
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,000
You might die.

107
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,959
I've already died once.

108
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,439
There's nothing to be afraid of.

109
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,639
But you have to agree to one condition.

110
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,720
What conditions.

111
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,079
If I die, never let my wife know.

112
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:16,360
I don't want her to be sad.

113
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,320
Mother.

114
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,440
What are you doing?

115
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:28,720
Xu Changqing

116
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:30,120
dead by poisoning.

117
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,960
This body

118
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,360
it's already wasted.

119
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,440
Even if the Revival Pearl can bring back his soul,

120
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:40,200
He cannot bring the dead back to life.

121
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,759
How could Changqing be poisoned?

122
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,360
You...

123
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,000
You poisoned his medicine?

124
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,919
No.

125
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,519
It's you.

126
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,720
It was you who poisoned him.

127
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,360
You killed him.

128
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,039
Mother.

129
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,720
Why did you harm Changqing?

130
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,799
You deliberately deceived me just for Revival Pearl.

131
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,240
Make way.

132
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,600
I won't.

133
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,240
This pearl is Changqing's thing.

134
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,480
You can't take it away.

135
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,200
What does love count for?

136
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,120
Wait for me to get the power of Black Evil Spirit.

137
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,480
The entire Merfolk's Shore must be destroyed.

138
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,360
Move away.

139
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:39,919
I won't
