1
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,839
Xun Huan?

2
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,839
It's been three years since
we parted, you're finally back.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,039
This is?

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,600
This is my daughter, from
the second princess of the tribe.

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,079
Eldest princess also has my children.

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,240
My eldest son Xu Changgong,
my youngest son Xu Changqing.

7
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:44,280
She promised me she would help
me take the throne of the Merfolk King.

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:56,759
I've been waiting from spring to the
winter, until I can't wait any longer.

9
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,840
What I've been waiting for is
your child with someone else.

10
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:08,560
Yao Tiao.

11
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,959
You're so kind, you will
help me raise her, won't you?

12
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,840
Because you and I both like the color
purple, I have thus named the child,

13
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,200
Zi Su.

14
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:36,879
Why should women bear the mistakes of men?

15
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,239
Nor can his daughter.

16
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,840
Zi Su.

17
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,159
Zi Su.

18
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,960
Zi Su.

19
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,879
Changqing.

20
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,919
That's fantastic.

21
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,879
You're okay now.

22
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,719
Changqing.

23
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,319
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:48,199
I... I didn't know the medicine was poisonous.

25
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,439
My mother lied to me.

26
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:55,520
And she took the Revival Pearl.

27
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,599
I couldn't stop her.

28
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,240
Where did she go.

29
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,240
She's going to release the Black Evil Spirit.

30
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:08,759
Changqing.

31
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:17,599
Can you please go easy on my mother?

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,240
I'm so cold. Could you hold me tighter?

33
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,520
Changqing.

34
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,360
I want to hear you say you love me, and never regret.

35
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,000
I

36
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:11,919
Zi Su.

37
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,159
Zi Su.

38
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,719
Zi Su.

39
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,720
My lord.

40
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,160
My lord.

41
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,240
Even with the combined strength
of four people, we can't save him.

42
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,519
There is still hope for him.

43
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,920
I will take you to find the Revival Pearl.

44
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,879
Black Evil Spirit

45
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,879
I'll help you open the barrier.

46
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,439
You need to keep your promise
and help me take Merfolk's Shore.

47
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,319
No, it's us.

48
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:04,399
Oh no.

49
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,360
She has been completely controlled by the Black Evil
Spirit, and now she has swallowed the Revival Pearl.

50
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:09,680
Sister.

51
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,439
Let's play by ears.

52
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:50,720
Are you okay?

53
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,680
These are the runes of a demon catcher.

54
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,439
What are you still doing at this time?

55
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,279
I need some time to crack it.

56
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,360
A thousand-year snake demon.

57
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:36,439
Since you've delivered yourself
here, just be my meal obediently.

58
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,839
Hurry up, is it ready yet?

59
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,480
It's Revival Pearl.

60
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,279
Revival Pearl can activate the barrier

61
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,319
and seal the Black Evil Spirit.

62
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,839
But the sealing ceremony must
be carried out in the formation.

63
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,439
My lord.

64
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,000
My lord.

65
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,799
My lord.

66
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:36,000
Such a touching love story.

67
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,320
Revival Pearl.

68
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:55,440
Not good.

69
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,159
I will be back soon.

70
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:17,200
Why is the Revival Pearl cracked?

71
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,960
It's just a regular stone now.

72
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,200
You know the millennia-old power of the Revival
Pearl is gone, yet you walk into your own trap.

73
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,200
It seems you're the one walking into a trap.

74
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,759
Even if you pour a thousand years of cultivation
into the Revival Pearl, you can't defeat me.

75
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,559
Crazy woman.

76
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,159
Quick, activate the barrier
