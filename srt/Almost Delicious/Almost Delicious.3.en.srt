I know you like cooking.

153

But you need to be self-aware.

154

Even dogs wouldn't eat your dishes.

155
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,640

161
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,360
It's not because you did well.

162
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,900
But you all have to follow the rules.

163
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,560
Anyway, just tell him where he is.

164
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,200
I can't say.

165
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,320

166
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,240
If you don't tell me,

167
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,160
I'll tell Mr. Shu

168
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,560

some of them are related to heredity.

191
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,750
Usually, the closer the blood relation,

192
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,500
the higher the probability of illness.

193
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,240
Mr. Shu,

194
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,680
what a coincidence!

195
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,400
Why is it you again?

196
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,800
Maybe this is what they call fate.

197
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,960
I've already told you.

198
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,680
The competition results are decided.

199
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,900
Stop dreaming.

200
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,780
No, it's not for that.

201
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,480
What's wrong?

202
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,040
Can't I see a doctor?

203
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,400
Mr. Shu,

204
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,860
haven't you felt it?

205
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,320
The intense emotions in my dishes.

206
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,680
Only dishes filled with emotion

207
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,200
are truly soulful.

208
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,240
Mr. Shu,

209
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,680
I believe you must have felt it, right?

210
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,480
We have met time and time again.

211
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,440
This is fate.

212
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,300
Mr. Shu,

213
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,720
give me another chance, please.

214
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,420
Choose me.

215
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,740
The cost performance is excellent.

216
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,660
You won't regret buying it.

217
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,050
You won't be deceived by buying it.

218
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,160
Are you crazy?

219
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,040
You're crazy.

220
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,540
Fang Meng,

221
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:24,990
what are you doing here?

222
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,160
Xie Jun.

223
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,440
(Specialist Clinic)
I forgot you also work here.

224
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,000
Are you here for a check-up?

225
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,180
How do you feel uncomfortable?

226
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,160
No, no.

227
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,540
I'm here for something important.

228
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,640
I'll tell you next time.

229
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,980
The SAGA Food Street Plan

230
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,300
is a project by Bo Fei Group

231
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,380
to introduce star-rated restaurants.

232
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,280
It's a large plan for gourmet center.

233
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,360
It's located in the commercial center.

234
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,260
(Conceptual image of the gourmet center)
Through communication,

235
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,020
the government will fully support

236
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,820
our food street plan.

237
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,940
It will also provide our group

238
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,560
with various preferential policies.

239
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,280
So, this project is almost a sure thing.

240
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,400
You could say that.

241
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,340
86% of the shops

242
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,100
in this commercial street

243
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,320
have signed a letter of intent with us.

244
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,500
I have already contacted Ms. Yin Miaolan

245
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,720
via email.

246
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,860
She has agreed

247
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,880
to serve as the culinary consultant.

248
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,600
Let me emphasize this,

249
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,940
she's an expert in molecular cuisine.

250
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,120
If she opens a branch in the street,

251
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,520
it'll be a great opportunity
for Bo Fei Group

252
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,360
to establish a strong image.

253
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,640
By then, we will invite some media

254
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,320
to cover the event thoroughly.

255
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,800
Manager An,

256
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,820
the food street project is also one of

257
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,080
your most important tasks lately.

258
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,840
Mr. Shu has made a breakthrough.

259
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,340
In the future,

260
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,750
you need to cooperate well with him,

261
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,360
to utilize your strengths

262
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,960
and show your ability
to the Board of Directors.

263
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,300
Do you understand?

264
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,700
I will definitely cooperate fully.

265
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,600
Are you not working today?

266
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,840
Isn't it nice to hang out with you?

267
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,120
Your boyfriend is so busy,

268
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,000
while you have a lot of free time.

269
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,320
Do you work at the same company?

270
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,540
The head of Attendance Department

271
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,780
was a blind date arranged by my dad.

272
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,880
He pulled some strings.

273
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,400
You really have some skills.

274
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,920
What are you reading?

275
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,200
A recipe.

276
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,000
Recipe?

277
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,880
Left by Master Pi.

278
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,960
Then why don't you follow the recipe?

279
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,680
Take a closer look.

280
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,700
It's written in a messy way.

281
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,200
Some don't indicate the raw materials.

282
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,000
Who can understand it?

283
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,380
Meng,

284
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,460
if things continue like this,

285
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,820
Hua Su will eventually go bankrupt.

286
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,300
Was there an acquisition a few days ago?

287
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,700
Just sell it, what are you thinking?

288
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,140
Shut up.

289
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,900
My dad was so good to you.

290
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,160
He just died, you want to sell Hua Su.

291
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,980
Do you really think after selling it,

292
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,320
anyone else would hire you?

293
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,240
It can't be sold.

294
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,180
I will defend Hua Su to the death.

295
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,600
I'll fight whoever tries to sell it.

296
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,680
Don't stay in the store.

297
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,960
Go out and have some fun.

298
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,820
It's good.

299
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,260
We can go to the suburbs.

300
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,460
- Move.
- Then…

301
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,080
What are you doing?

302
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,260
What?

303
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,520
What do you think I'm doing?

304
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,000
- Move.
- Do it.

305
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,740
What are you doing? Don't move.

306
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,680
I'll call the police.

307
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,960
No need.

308
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:44,580
I heard Master Pi has passed away.

309
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,840
I'm here to check on you,

310
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,980
and to take some things away.

311
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,860
You really know how to talk nicely.

312
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,140
When my dad was alive,
he took care of your business.

313
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,620
He just died, you're here to rob.

314
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,700
What do you mean?

315
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,960
What do I mean?

316
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,820
He takes care of me, and I'll repay.

317
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,220
Isn't this mutual?

318
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,920
I value relationships the most.

319
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,020
Move.

320
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,720
And the chair.

321
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:07,990
I told you not to move.

322
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,240
Let's talk it over calmly.

323
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,280
I know.

324
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,580
I didn't say I wouldn't pay you back.

325
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,480
Just give me a little more time.

326
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,460
You see, my shop is still here.

327
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,400
More time? Who gives me more time?

328
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,200
Move.

329
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,280
Let's talk this over calmly.

330
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,580
I've given Master Pi a lot of favor.

331
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm only taking some

332
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,720
beer, drinks, mineral water.

333
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,100
When I come next time,

334
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,260
I'll leave nothing.

335
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,120
- You.
- Shut up.

336
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,440
Look at your shiny forehead.

337
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,460
In broad daylight,

338
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,200
you're not taking me seriously.

339
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,980
Put it down.

340
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,680
I'll carry it.

341
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,560
Don't just stand there, let's go.

342
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,080
There are quite a few things later.

343
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,260
Make yourself at home.

344
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,760
Let's have a drink later.

345
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,660
- Put it down.
- I'm telling you, brother.

346
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,050
If you need something, just say it.

347
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,540
You're really particular.

348
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,390
We shall have a drink tonight.

349
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,380
Sure.

350
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,760
There's no point in working here.

351
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,800
Oh my...

352
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,000
Those guys are really clueless.

353
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,550
They just grabbed some chopsticks.

354
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,960
The beers expired.

355
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,240
Settled.

356
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,180
Fang Meng, should we just give up?

357
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,560
Ever since Master Pi died,

358
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,760
Hua Su has received more complaints.

359
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,960
Even if there are customers,

360
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,680
after eating the dishes you made,

361
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,800
didn't they all ask for a refund?

362
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,900
You can't even cook properly.

363
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,160
How can you open a restaurant?

364
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,280
Excuse me, is this Hua Su?

365
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,720
Sorry, we are closed.

366
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,440
We are here to eat.

367
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,640
What are you here for? To eat?

368
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,000
You better eat somewhere else, okay?

369
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,320
Are you the boss lady of Hua Su?

370
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,720
We came here specifically for you.

371
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,280
Have you had any difficulties?

372
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,740
Don't be discouraged.

373
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,400
There are many beautiful things in life.

374
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,000
- You…
- No.

375
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,020
Frankly, we're here to explore the shop.

376
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,940
We came here

377
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,540
because we've heard a lot about it.

378
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,720
We especially want to try your dishes.

379
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,540
My…

380
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:45,900
Yes.

381
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,080
I've heard a lot about you.

382
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,140
Are you available to cook for us now?

383
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,700
Anything will do, just something.

384
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,640
Yes, we're not picky eaters.

385
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,320
Sure.

386
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,900
I'm particularly available.

387
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,340
Then please wait for a moment.

388
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,100
Go find a seat.

389
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,240
I'll be right back.

390
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,880
Buddy, what were you thinking?

391
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,380
(Strive)

392
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,820
Almost finished.

393
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,300
We can see four dishes at the scene.

394
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,520
One dish is to come.

395
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,800
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

396
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,140
Family,

397
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,620
today we fulfill our promise.

398
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,480
We're in Hua Su Restaurant.

399
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,580
It is said that

400
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,820
since the founder

401
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,300
Master Pi passed away,

402
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,520
their dishes have been known

403
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,720
for their peculiar taste.

404
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,920
We are going to take on a challenge.

405
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,420
Family, follow and send some gifts.

406
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,280
We are now ready to start eating.

407
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,080
Let's try one first.

408
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,540
(If the blogger is still alive tomorrow,
remember to let us know.)

409
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,700
Clean and hygienic, guys.

410
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,760
Clean and hygienic.

411
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,600
What are you looking at? Let me see.

412
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,640
What is this?

413
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,160
Hua Su Restaurant.

414
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:04,460
Watching this live stream.

415
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,760
It's so interesting.

416
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,600
Is there still this kind of dish now?

417
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,700
It…

418
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,080
Isn't this too disgusting?

419
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,420
You are here. Look quickly.

420
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,260
What are you looking at?

421
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,160
Check out this comment.

422
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,500
- It's really interesting.
- Yes.

423
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,700
Look, look.

424
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,860
This is just too interesting!

425
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,180
What kind of dark cuisine is this?

426
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,340
Will this require a hospital visit?

427
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,680
I see a lot of people.

428
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,480
Why don't we go there too?

429
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,960
Sure, we can go and experience it.

430
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,440
No, don't push!

431
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,660
One…

432
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,360
One at a time, don't push.

433
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,480
This is that internet-famous restaurant.

434
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:38,080
Look over here.

435
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,980
(Endure)

436
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,430
It's too awful to eat.

437
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,500
Guys,

438
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,000
please give me a follow.

439
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,840
I'll show you another trick.

440
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,560
What are you watching?

441
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,500
Mr. Shu.

442
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,000
Give me the phone.

443
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,300
This Hua Su Restaurant,

444
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,320
do you know where it is?

445
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,000
At a prime spot on our food street.

446
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,500
Now these videos,

447
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,820
are spreading all over the internet.

448
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,020
Hua Su Restaurant has become popular.

449
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,320
No one is going there for the gourmet.

450
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,240
If we continue to let this happen,

451
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,180
everyone will consider our food street

452
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,140
bizarre and attention-seeking,

453
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,440
nothing to do with gourmet.

454
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,540
Once this kind of thing spreads,

455
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,060
it'll inevitably have a severe impact

456
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,480
on future restaurant tenants.

457
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,660
If Ms. Yin Miaolan learns

458
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,580
our food street

459
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,960
has such a restaurant,

460
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,780
it's very likely to affect her decision

461
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,400
to bring her On Forest Restaurant in here.

462
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,600
Before the end of the month,

463
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,800
I must see all the merchants' contracts.

464
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,660
(Why would a girl want to learn cooking?)

465
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,860
(I'll throw up first.)
Come on, take a look.

466
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,080
Everyone, come and have a look.

467
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,860
This looks unappetizing.

468
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,420
The food is smelly and unappetizing.

469
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,540
The taste is also bad.

470
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,800
Thank to Bro Long for the gift.

471
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,280
Thank you.

472
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,020
Exactly.

473
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,720
You shouldn't come here, my dear.

474
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,620
(Hua Su)

475
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,740
Got it.

476
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,680
Internet celebrity earns money quickly.

477
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,100
Farewell.

478
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:17,980
Really nice.

479
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,020
Meng.

480
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,300
The salary owed from last month,

481
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,520
I took it directly.

482
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,440
I really didn't expect

483
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,020
that you cook so poorly,

484
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,400
yet still make money.

485
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,780
Of course.

486
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,100
Meng, it's because your cooking is bad.

487
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,680
Or we all can't have this effect.

488
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:38,900
Fang Meng,

489
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,200
you look unhappy.

490
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,840
Hua Su has been saved.

491
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,640
They came because my cooking is bad.

492
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,780
Right?

493
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,080
Of course.

494
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,780
If your cooking was good,

495
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,520
not so many people might have come.

496
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,040
Now people are curiosity-driven.

497
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,360
You have all kinds of dark cuisine here.

498
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,500
For them,

499
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,280
it's all about the hype and the topic.

500
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,480
Why didn't I think of this before?

501
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,320
This trick is absolutely brilliant.

502
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,640
Why are you sighing?

503
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,600
Isn't it good that we're making money?

504
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,220
Hua Su became famous

505
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,480
thanks to my dad's skills.

506
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,020
But what I'm doing now

507
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,640
is tarnishing this brand.

508
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,600
Maybe I'm just not fit for this work.

509
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,800
Are you still trying to pay off debts?

510
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,600
At least now is the best opportunity.

511
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,360
Let's earn the money first.

512
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,120
As for the brand,

513
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,240
we'll discuss it later.

514
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,820
Exactly.

515
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,480
Making delicious food is also for money.

516
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,540
I want to run Hua Su,

517
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,080
not only for my dad,

518
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,960
but also for myself.

519
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,400
I genuinely enjoy cooking.

520
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,140
Unfortunately, those who're here

521
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,280
are not for the dishes themselves.

522
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,480
They just want to see how bad it be.

523
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,000
I ended up ruining my dad's reputation.

524
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,680
The taste from a couple of days ago,

525
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,040
why don't you try it again?

526
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,520
Here we go again.

527
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,460
There's Michelin available,

528
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,260
yet you choose the unappetizing things.

529
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,680
What exactly are you thinking?

530
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,680
What's wrong with that?

531
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,720
Is gourmet rating really that important?

532
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,640
Everyone has their own preferences.

533
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,300
As long as you put your heart,

534
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,320
passion and sincerity,

535
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,040
what you create will be delicious.

536
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,200
Sounds you really understand gourmet.

537
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,480
Better than I do.

538
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,460
I won't listen to your threats.

539
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,640
I don't know where to eat.

540
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,380
Alright.

541
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,600
Just wait.

542
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,560
Let me show you my skills.

543
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,800
