It's almost there.

111
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,940
How do you know
it's almost right?

112
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,320
Because when the flavor is right,

113
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,230

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,980
Think about it carefully.

117
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,580
Now that you mention it,

118
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,820
I think I remember.

119
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,700

120
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,720
No.

121
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,380
I remembered what's missing.

122
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,040
It should be

123
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,640
the heat-resisting wine jar

124
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,580
used for holding rice wine for years.

125
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,040
Only with it

126
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,480
can the fragrance seep into the dish.

127
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,100
But where can I find
such a special wine jar?

128
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,180
I can't remember either.

129
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,720
I'm helping you recover your memory now.

130
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,720
I suspect what I saw

131
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,000
was not a dream

132
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,060
but your memory.

133
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,860

134
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,760
I've checked it all.

135
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,220
We didn't miss anything.

136
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,320
When your Dad made this dish,

137
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,900
did he use a wine jar?

138
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
Yes. How did you…

139
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,000
Go get that wine jar.

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,420
With it, the dish will be perfect.

141
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,180
Well,

142
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,440
I broke that wine jar

143
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,550
when I was cleaning earlier.

144
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,680
Don't be like that.

145
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,500
We can just buy one
at the supermarket.

146
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,560
No.

147
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,960
It has to be the heat-resisting win jar

148
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,220
used for holding rice wine for years.

149
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,980
I remember there were words on it.

150
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,580
It's "Winemaking Genius Master Zhang".

151
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,860

154
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,920

155
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,660
to make patient's privacy report
disclosed.

156
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,400
Please investigate thoroughly

157
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,900

158
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,420
Brother Xie Jun, are you off work?

159
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,700
If you are here to pick up Sweetie,

160
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,440
it's over there.

161
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,160
I'm not here for Sweetie.

162
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,460

Sorry.

165
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,140
Then I'll wait until you're done.

What's that?

170
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,060
I'll tell you once I figure it out.

171
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,620
I don't want to scare you.

172
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,480
You're always acting all mysterious.

173
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,380
- Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Shu.

174
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,320
I got the information
about the "Winemaking Genius".

175
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,900
His name is Zhang Tiancheng.

176
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,100
His family has been brewing rice wine
for generations.

177
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,120
I know.

178
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,500
Find a way to get me a few
of his wine jars.

179
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,960
But he's switched careers.

180
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,300
He doesn't make rice wine anymore.

181
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,900
I can pay him handsomely
for his jars.

182
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,000
I said it,

183
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,820
but he just hung up the phone.

184
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,940
Did you get his address?

185
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,520
Yes.

186
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,300
He's in Peach Blossom Town.

187
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,520
Alright.

188
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,580
So you're looking for the wine jar!

189
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,540
Pack your bags tonight.

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,250
Tomorrow,
we'll go to Peach Blossom Town.

191
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,500
Tonight?

192
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,600
What's so special

193
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,980
about Fang Meng?

194
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,200
Mr. Shu's been suspended.

195
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,180
He's not considering
returning to Bo Fei,

196
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,680
but spends all day teaching Fang Meng

197
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,980
to cook at Hua Su.

198
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,220
It's not that Fang Meng's charm,

199
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,100
but Mr. Shu loves her deeply.

200
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,940
Unlike you,

201
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,640
who won't even admit
I'm your girlfriend

202
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,660
for the sake of work.

203
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,920
Didn't I do that for you,

204
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,760
huh?

205
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,680
If I don't work hard,

206
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,680
how would we live?

207
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,520
Exactly.

208
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,640
Then why do I see you

209
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,740
flirting with

210
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,420
Elva

211
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,300
every day?

212
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,720
I've said it many times.

213
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,340
I'm the CEO's

214
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,280
assistant.

215
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,140
I need to get along with colleagues.

216
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,180
Is work more important than me?

217
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,780
You're more important.

218
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,400
Last time we were shopping,

219
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,140
I noticed you stared at it
for an extra 0.0001 second,

220
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,300
so I knew you liked it.

221
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,700
Then why didn't you wear
the couple's outfit I gave you?

222
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,340
That's why you should learn from me.

223
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,640
I get you bracelets
or something like that,

224
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,760
and no one will know we're a couple

225
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,900
when you wear it.

226
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,640
But you give me couple outfit,

227
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,100
which will tell everyone
that we're together.

228
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,580
Then wear this.

229
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,140
It's not apparent.

230
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,750
Why's there a carrot pattern on it?

231
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,900
- Hello.
- It's me,

232
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,240
Xie Jun.

233
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,200
What's up?

234
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,420
Is Mr. Shu with you?

235
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,700
You want to speak to him, right?

236
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,720
He's outside.

237
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,720
I'll call him for you.

238
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,560
No need.

239
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,620
I'm calling for you.

240
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,740
Are you free to come out now?

241
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,380
I'm nearby.

242
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,620
I'll send you the address.

243
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,980
(Arcade)

244
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,260
Is this the place?

245
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,320
Fang Meng.

246
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,660
Why are you here?

247
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,500
Looking for childhood memories?

248
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,900
Sit, sit.

249
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,780
I'm sorry.

250
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,020
We can only meet here.

251
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,900
I really don't know where else to go.

252
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,180
What happened?

253
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,900
Teach me

254
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,020
how to reject people.

255
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,620
Reject?

256
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,820
You're talking about Shen An'an, right?

257
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,500
She's always around me.

258
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,440
Whenever I go to my old haunts,

259
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,620
she always shows up.

260
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,980
I'm sorry.

261
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm sorry.

262
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,380
I can't focus on work anymore.

263
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,940
I don't know

264
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,520
how to reject her.

265
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,260
Is it really that bad?

266
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,700
But it really sounds like Miss Shen.

267
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,850
I've already taken leave
from the hospital.

268
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,270
I want to take a break for few days

269
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,480
and avoid her.

270
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,480
Just be clear with her.

271
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,800
Tell her you're not interested.

272
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,860
I just don't know how to say it.

273
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,860
What if she gets really upset?

274
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,820
Then what should I do?

275
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,060
That's why

276
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,180
I'm asking you.

277
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,460
You know,

278
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,640
you're too kind.

279
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,020
You make too much of it.

280
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
If you don't like a girl,

281
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,540
just tell her directly.

282
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,340
If you care so much about her feelings,

283
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,600
she'll think

284
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,000
you're interested in her.

285
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,660
And she'll get more persistent.

286
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,020
Is that so?

287
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,850
I know
you've never been in a relationship.

288
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,720
Otherwise, I'll think

289
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,180
you're a Mr. Nice Guy.

290
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,620
But have you figured out

291
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,980
if you like her?

292
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,780
To be honest,

293
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,980
I don't really know
what it is like.

294
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,540
When I was young,

295
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,260
my parents

296
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,780
always fought

297
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,260
before they divorced.

298
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,220
I feel nothing from them,

299
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,700
not a single emotion,

300
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,380
let alone love.

301
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,180
So,

302
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
I really don't believe

303
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,780
that Shen An'an likes me.

304
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,000
Fang Meng,

305
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,700
do you think

306
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,240
people can really fall

307
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,620
in love so easily?

308
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,180
I... I don't know either.

309
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,660
I've never been in a relationship.

310
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,620
But I think

311
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,820
love

312
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,540
should happen in an instant.

313
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,260
Are you talking about

314
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,900
your feelings for Mr. Shu?

315
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,340
No,

316
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,260
don't read stuff into this, okay?

317
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,500
You're off tomorrow, right?

318
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,760
I'm going to Peach Blossom Town
tomorrow.

319
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,700
Do you want to join me?

320
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,580
Peach Blossom Town?

321
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,260
It's a perfect chance for you
to avoid her

322
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,580
and figure out

323
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,840
whether she still feels the same

324
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,880
about you

325
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,380
after all this time.

326
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,140
Is Mr. Shu going?

327
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,220
Is it okay if I join you?

328
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,120
What's wrong with it?

329
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,540
He's not that petty.

330
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,520
Mr. Shu,

331
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,580
I can't go with you this time.

332
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,940
I need to go find An Zhijiang later.

333
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,420
Why is he here?

334
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,040
Who?

335
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,360
Mr. Shu.

336
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,620
- Doctor Xie.
- My…

337
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,460
- Mr. Shu.
- Why are you here?

338
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,300
He's on vacation and going out with us.

339
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,880
Excuse me, let me through.

340
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,580
I'll put down the luggage.

341
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,240
And his, too.

342
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,400
- Let me help you.
- Thank you.

343
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,240
Doctor Xie,

344
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,980
what about An'an?
You're just leaving her behind?

345
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,520
Someone's looking after her.

346
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,600
We rarely get a chance to go out.

347
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,560
Hurry up and get in the car.

348
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,020
What are you waiting for? Get in.

349
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,820
Come on!

350
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,800
Look at the books in his car,
all CEO romance novels.

351
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,840
I've been really into them lately.

352
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,140
Can you imitate it?

353
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,440
Imitate?

354
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,560
I can't.

355
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,560
Imitate it, please.

356
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,620
Three, two, one, action!

357
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,620
My rules are the rules.

358
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,180
- Is that okay?
- Where did you know that?

359
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,980
Can you guys be quieter?

360
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,520
What's wrong?

361
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,580
Did we disturb you?

362
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,900
You disturbed my eyes.

363
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,400
Mr. Shu,

364
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,900
do you mind if I drive?

365
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,940
No need.

366
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,660
Let him drive.

367
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,520
You drive.

368
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,860
What are you doing?

369
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,420
It's fine. I like driving.

370
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,040
You…

371
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,300
Mr. An, you wanted to see me?

372
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,580
Where is Shu Zhengyan?

373
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,140
I found out that he has a flight
to Taocheng today.

374
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,460
Taocheng?

375
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,380
What's he doing there?

376
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,580
I guess he's going for treatment.

377
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,920
What are you waiting for?
Keep an eye on him!

378
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,900
The scenery here is really nice,

379
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,620
and the environment is also good.

380
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,680
Look.

381
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,740
Fang Meng, look there.
It's nice, too.

382
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,540
Yeah.

383
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,520
We could've hired a car.

384
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,900
Why do we have to ride this one?

385
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,720
You said your eyes hurt

386
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,020
and didn't want to drive.

387
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,060
He can drive.

388
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,660
He's here to have fun with me.

389
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,500
Why should he drive?

390
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,840
Mr. Shu,

391
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,180
are you feeling carsick?

392
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,050
Lean your back against the seat.

393
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,080
What are you doing?

394
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,020
Don't puke!

395
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,640
Please don't puke!

396
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,750
Sir, do you have a plastic bag?

397
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,000
- A plastic bag.
- Don't puke on me.

398
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,020
Do you have a plastic bag?

399
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,920
Sir, Miss, do you have a plastic bag?

400
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,500
- Don't puke on me.
- Sir, do you have one?

401
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,660
- Plastic bag.
- Help!

402
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,540
Xie Jun!

403
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,240
Mr. Shu.

404
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,700
(Please note: only for plot,
do not imitate.)

405
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,160
Mr. Shu.

406
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,460
Are you okay?

407
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,200
None of your business.

408
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,400
He means well.

409
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,740
Why are you acting like this?

410
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,180
Do I need his kindness?

411
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,640
You…

412
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,220
How could you say this?

413
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,120
Just ignore him.

414
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,220
Let's go eat.

415
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,760
You!

416
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,700
Come on.

417
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,900
You made me into this.

418
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,420
Summoning Technique.

419
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,700
Trying to escape?

420
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,940
You think you can escape me?

421
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,080
You're here to guard the nexus.

422
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,300
I'm going to attack the turret.

423
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,120
Enjoy your meal.

424
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,300
This one's delicious.

425
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,580
Try it.

426
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,840
It's really good.

427
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,120
Look at this picture.

428
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,420
Isn't it particularly beautiful?

429
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,260
And it looks just like the view here.

430
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,900
Don't you think?

431
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,360
Let's take a picture.

432
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,500
- Let's take one.
- Nice shot.

433
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,360
Hey, what are you doing?

434
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,640
Come on.
Why did you bring him here?

435
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,220
Don't you know what we came for?

436
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,280
Aren't we here

437
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,160
for the wine jar for the fourth dish?

438
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,000
Oh, you remembered.

439
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,250
Then why did you bring him here?

440
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,620
You think this is a vacation?

441
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,900
The scenery is so nice.

442
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,700
We can also have a little fun here.

443
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,920

Fang Meng?

491
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,340
Is it because I'm here

492
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,100
that Mr. Shu is upset?

493
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,700

What's wrong?

Shh. Don't say my name.

498

Brother Xie Jun,

499
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,540
guess what kind of Shen An'an is today?

500
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,640
An'an,

501
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,940
how did you get here so fast?

502
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,360
Shu Zhengyan,

503
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,300
Fang Meng and Xie Jun.

504
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,260
They went out together.

505
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,800
I don't get what they're doing.

506
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,240
It seems
that Fang Meng invited Xie Jun.

507
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,700
Fang Meng invited him?

508
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,800
She's really never been
in a relationship,

509
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,880
so she doesn't know

510
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,340
that when a guy gets jealous,

511
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,760
he's even more dramatic
than a girl.

512
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,980
Mr. Shu was cool with it,

513
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,860
but he did invite Shen An'an.

514
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,580
What?

515
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,260
Shen An'an?

516
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,940
This is getting interesting.

517
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,860
I wish I were there.

518
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,040
I also want to go have fun, too.

519
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,760
You've never taken me out.

520
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,360
Always just massage!

521
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,360
Massage! Massage!

522
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,440
Every time, it's just massages!

523
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,750
Why not just massage you to death?

524
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,820
(Fair)

525
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,680
Brother Xie Jun,

526
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,800
let's go.

527
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,080
It's so late.

528
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,480
Let's find a place to stay for the night.

529
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,200
We'll look for Master Zhang tomorrow.

530
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,320
Okay, okay.

531
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,160
Brother Xie Jun,
we stay here for the night,

532
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,700
- and tomorrow, we'll go...
- Help me.

533
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,420
Why she's here?

534
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,340
I don't know.

535
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,820
Did you invite her here?

536
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,220
No.

537
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,260
You already slipped up.

538
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,740
You're petty-minded.

539
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,700
Petty-minded?

540
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,040
I am a Company President,

541
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,380
and you say I'm petty-minded?

542
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,940
Only two rooms left?

543
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,040
Yes, Miss.

544
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,180
How will you arrange your stay?

545
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,980
I'll share a room with him.

546
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,300
Why do you share a room with me?

547
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,080
I don't want to share a room
with a guy.

548
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,860
Brother Xie Jun,
why are you avoiding me?

549
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,200
An'an,

550
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,140
I'm not a good sleeper.

551
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,220
I grind teeth, snore, fart,

552
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,380
and even sleepwalk.

553
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,940
It's really scary.

554
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,300
I'm afraid I'll disturb you.

555
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,460
It's okay.

556
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,660
Aren't you afraid of disturbing me?

557
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,880
I'm not afraid of being disturbed,
Brother Xie Jun.

558
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,460
- It's okay.
- An'an, An'an.

559
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,880
Let's share a room.

560
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,960
- I have so much to tell you.
- I have nothing to say to you.

561
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,160
Come on, let's have a good chat.

562
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,120
Really, I have so much to tell you.

563
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,460
Come on, let's go.

564
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,040
Thank you.

565
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,540
(Datang)

566
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:40,940
(Xiaotang, Datang)

567
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,680
Shh.

568
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,180
Shh.

569
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,380
Why are you here?

570
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,260
How did you get in?

571
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,480
I…

572
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,300
Can't I be with you?

573
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,020
You didn't seize your chance before.

574
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,140
Then

575
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,580
I'm taking it now.

576
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,380
Where's Shen An'an?

577
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,300
Xie Jun should be fine, right?

578
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,220
I'm a bit worried about him.

579
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,660
Don't worry, he's fine.

580
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,420
An'an won't do anything to him.

581
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,500
Didn't you say
she might be my daughter?

582
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,340
If she really is,

583
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,420
how could I kiss her?

584
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,020
Shu Zhengyan!

585
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,740
Go to hell!

586
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,700
Brother Xie Jun,

587
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,500
am I really that scary?

588
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,620
You keep avoiding me.

589
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,880
An'an,

590
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,000
it's so late.

591
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,140
Why aren't you sleeping?

592
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,860
I just can't sleep.
