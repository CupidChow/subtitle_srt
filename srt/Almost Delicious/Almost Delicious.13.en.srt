31
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,220
Mr. Shu,

32
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,640
she won't even admit

33
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,100
that you're her boyfriend.

34
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,300
Is she really worth all this?

35
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,220
You even have time for this?

36
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,750
You don't care about anything!

37
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,900
What are you even good for?

38
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,280
Marrying you was the worst luck

39
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,700
of my entire life!

40
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,700
Sorry about that.

41
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,240
That's exactly what they are,

42
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,220
so shameless.

43
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,140
Should we call the police?

44
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,320
No need.

45
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,320
It's fine.

46
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,020
Lately, I keep having flashes

47
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,620
of déjà vu.

48
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,900
It's like a dream.

49
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,620
That still moves you long
after waking up?

50
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,580
I'm serious.

51
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,140
I was just joking.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,300
So you believed me?

53
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,680
My stepmother and sister

54
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,560
can be so annoying.

55
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,580
Were they making you hallucinate?

56
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,120
I'm tired.

57
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,940
You should get some rest, too.

58
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,460
Take a good rest.

59
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,660
I'll head downstairs.

60
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,320
Mr. Shu.

61
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,980
I want to apologize in person

62
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,740
for the disclosure
of your medical records.

63
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,820
Would now be convenient time
to meet you?

64
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,260
I am really sorry

65
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,440
for being late.

66
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,500
Doctor Xie,

67
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,300
wh-what happened?

68
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,500
I've heard

69
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,900
that you were suspended.

70
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,860
It's a disgrace to my career

71
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,900
to cause my patient's privacy
to be disclosed.

72
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,260
We've already contacted the police.

73
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,120
Once the investigation is over,

74
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,380
I'll inform you right away.

75
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,860
I asked you here

76
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,300
to apologize in person.

77
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,080
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,480
It's fine.

79
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,580
It wasn't your fault.

80
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,520
And I've already undergone

81
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,340
the necessary health checks.

82
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,860
If all goes well,

83
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,780
I'll return to my post soon.

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,310
So, don't blame yourself too much.

85
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,440
Then, Mr. Shu,

86
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,300
how are you feeling?

87
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,060
Well…

88
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,720
Come on.

89
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,920
Let's pass it.

90
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,100
How are things going with you
and An'an?

91
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,640
What's wrong?

92
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,380
You told me before

93
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,940
that there's always a voice

94
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,020
in your head, right?

95
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,440
Yes.

96
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,100
Honestly, at first,
I thought it was impossible.

97
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,780
But now, I can get it.

98
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,940
Now, all I hear in my head

99
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,820
is Miss Shen's voice.

100
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,900
I can't even sleep at night.

101
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,820
That's different

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,660
from what I meant.

103
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,200
She's always after me.

104
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,860
I can't even focus on work.

105
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,820
I feel like I'm sneaking around

106
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,460
like a thief every day.

107
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,300
She seems to have a sixth sense.

108
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,340
No matter where I am,

109
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,580
she suddenly appears in front of me.

110
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,740
That bad?

111
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,040
Worse.

112
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,600
She even

113
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,340
disguised herself and popped up
in front of me.

114
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,700
Sir, here's your coffee.

115
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,640
Brother Xie Jun,

116
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,080
I followed your requirements

117
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,040
and didn't bring any guards.

118
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,440
Today, I'm your
exclusive VIP service attendant

119
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,100
Shen An'an.

120
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,180
Brother Xie Jun!

121
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,660
What do you mean?

122
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,220
Speak clearly with me!

123
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,600
Brother Xie Jun!

124
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,100
Brother Xie Jun, you're here!

125
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,340
Brother Xie Jun,

126
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,420
I'm waiting for you here.

127
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,860
I'm waiting for you.

128
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,220
Brother Xie Jun,

129
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,380
why did you run so fast just now?

130
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,900
Do you know how long
I've been looking for you?

131
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,580
You dislike me?

132
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,160
No.

133
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,220
No? Then you like me!

134
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,800
By the way,

135
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,900
how's Brother Zhengyan doing?

136
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,180
I heard he has

137
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
a mental illness.

138
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,860
But I don't think so.

139
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,940
Brother Xie Jun,

140
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,420
what's wrong?

141
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,080
Nothing.

142
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,780
Are you afraid of heights?

143
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,840
- You're afraid of heights.
- An'an, An'an.

144
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,680
Don't move.

145
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,820
An'an, don't move.

146
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,900
Okay, okay.

147
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,960
I won't move. I won't move.

148
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,860
Don't be afraid.

149
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,940
I won't scare you.

150
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,740
We're almost there.

151
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,540
Don't be afraid.

152
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,820
I have two pieces of good news.

153
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,000
First, the top 10 restaurants in the city

154
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,320
have signed agreements with us

155
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,020
and agreed to move into Food Street.

156
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,800
Second, our senior culinary consultant,

157
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,900
Miss Yin Miaolan, is about to return.

158
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,040
At the same time,
her gourmet restaurant brand

159
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,000
will officially open branches

160
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,580
on our Food Street.

161
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,840
Oh,

162
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,880
has Shu Zhengyan's medical examination

163
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,860
result come out?

164
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,200
Here's the thing.

165
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,060
Due to Mr. Shu's

166
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,440
special condition,

167
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,460
we've brought in specialist doctors

168
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,800
from abroad

169
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,380
to give him a professional health checks.

170
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,860
This may take

171
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,780
a bit more time.

172
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,120
What about Hua Su?

173
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,540
How are things on its end?

174
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,860
After Hua Su closed down,

175
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,100
I thought it would be soon

176
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,260
that the landlady gave up.

177
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,340
But…

178
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,680
But what?

179
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,260
I discovered

180
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,540
that Fang Meng, Hua Su's landlady,

181
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,180
is now Mr. Shu's private chef.

182
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,320
Did all of you

183
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,540
know this?

184
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,660
Is this information accurate?

185
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,360
Sorry.

186
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,240
I haven't been around Mr. Shu recently,

187
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,100
so,

188
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,990
I'm not very clear about it either.

189
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,960
I'll truthfully report this matter

190
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,980
to the Board of Directors.

191
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,540
Hello, Mr. Shu.

192
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,960
How are the doctors

193
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,700
the company arranged
for your health checks?

194
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,480
They keep finding excuses

195
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,620
to delay the health checks.

196
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,640
They're stalling

197
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,820
to prolong the health check process

198
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,440
to buy An Zhijiang more time

199
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,940
to push the Food Street Plan.

200
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,600
By the time you return,

201
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,700
you won't get any credit for it.

202
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,780
How's the Food Street Plan going?

203
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,600
The Top 10 restaurants in the city

204
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,990
have all signed contracts with him.

205
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,020
The only spot left is Hua Su.

206
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,660
Alright, calm down.

207
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,880
We need to find a way

208
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,860
to get them to leave.

209
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,020
Do you have a plan?

210
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,660
Maybe I should return to Hua Su.

211
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,700
Even if you go back now,

212
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,580
Hua Su still can't be up and running.

213
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,740
Then what do I do?

214
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,680
They are so comfortable here.

215
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,380
They definitely won't leave
on their own.

216
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,300
We need to think of a way

217
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,860
to make them leave on their own.

218
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,660
I've got an idea.

219
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,700
Mom, I didn't eat enough yesterday.

220
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,640
Then what?

221
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,980
I'll make you something later.

222
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,500
Okay. I'll go back to my room.

223
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,690
Sure, you go rest.

224
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:10,990
- I'm leaving.
- I'm going to watch TV.

225
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:11,800
Okay.

226
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,700
Will this really work?

227
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,420
Trust me.

228
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,700
They're super timid.

229
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,320
Even the slightest scare

230
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,660
will send them running.

231
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,740
We just need to scare them a bit,

232
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,180
and they'll run away overnight.

233
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,020
Well, isn't this a bit mean?

234
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,360
Do you want them

235
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,700
to stay here forever?

236
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,860
Go prepare in your room.

237
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,320
I'll go first.

238
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,180
What are you doing?

239
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,300
Shh.

240
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,860
What's going on?

241
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,900
Someone died

242
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,340
in this house before.

243
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,680
So, we usually do rituals

244
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,900
to ward off evil spirits.

245
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,020
Are you serious?

246
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,260
Of course!

247
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,940
You're lying

248
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,540
just to kick us out, aren't you?

249
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,800
Definitely not.

250
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,900
Why would I lie
about something like this?

251
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,460
Don't be afraid.

252
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,540
It's just a ritual.

253
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,340
Nothing will happen.

254
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,620
After all, this ghost only harms

255
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,860
those with guilty consciences.

256
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,300
(Main Switch)

257
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,150
Shh.

258
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,300
Don't let them hear you.

259
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,360
Take this Talisman.

260
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,580
It's for protection.

261
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,200
I'll go check outside.

262
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,100
Hold onto it tightly.

263
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,300
Don't be afraid.

264
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,580
Fang Meng,

265
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,180
don't leave!

266
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,280
Don't go!

267
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,280
Please don't go.

268
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,460
Fang Meng, I'm scared.

269
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,980
I'm scared.

270
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,560
Shh.

271
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,180
Ready?

272
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,640
Well,

273
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,760
I've set it all up.

274
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,180
- Rest assured.
- Okay.

275
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,160
Is this mine?

276
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,260
This one is for me.

277
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,960
How's it?

278
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,980
It's good.

279
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,240
Let's go.

280
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,520
Your mask is too scary.

281
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,420
Let's switch.

282
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,820
Mom!

283
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,540
Don't come for me!

284
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,460
Don't come for me!

285
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,300
Mom!

286
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,380
Hurry! She's coming out!

287
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,880
Mom!

288
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,080
Mom!

289
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,520
What's going on?

290
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,620
What happened?

291
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,560
Fang Meng.

292
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,340
(Intensive Care Unit)

293
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,580
Here's the thing.

294
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,660
Director Zhang's daughter is sick.

295
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,400
She specifically asked for you
to treat her.

296
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,780
I can't refuse.

297
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,660
Please take care of her.

298
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,200
Matron,

299
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,200
bring me the medical file
of Director Zhang's daughter.

300
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,080
Where is he?

301
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,260
I just saw him.

302
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,820
Where did he go?

303
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,160
Where is he?

304
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,060
You stayed up so late last night.

305
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,420
Why not skip cooking today?

306
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,560
Those days I've paid attention
to fighting against these two

307
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,220
and forgot the most important thing.

308
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,100
I've only recreated two dishes so far.

309
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,500
The third one

310
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,980
is "Horse from the Sea Fried Rice".

311
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,900
I remember my Dad's was yellow,

312
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,140
but no matter what I tried,

313
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,180
like curry sauce, curry powder
or curry paste,

314
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,120
my dish

315
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,340
never matched his.

316
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,980
Is this

317
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,540
the dish you made for me
the first time we met?

318
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,260
Am I supposed to step in again?

319
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,440
Yes. Tell me,

320
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,700
how do we make it?

321
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,280
Prepare the ingredients.

322
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,220
Heat the pan.

323
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,620
No time for plating.

324
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,780
Just try it first.

325
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,100
When will you teach me to cook?

326
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,620
Do you really want to be a chef?

327
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,060
Of course.

328
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,020
If I put in the effort,

329
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,580
I'll be better than you.

330
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,140
Then, wait a bit longer.

331
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,500
When I have time, I'll teach you.

332
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,380
(I have a date with Wintersweet,
so it should blame me for my leaving.)

333
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,340
(Hua Su)

334
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,140
Why did you bring me here?

335
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,820
This is my restaurant after all.

336
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,140
I'd want to come back.

337
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,800
You said in the car

338
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,320
that you had another dream

339
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,500
when you ate the seafood fried rice.

340
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,000
Yes.

341
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,980
You said the same thing last time.

342
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,820
Are you lying to me?

343
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,100
Why would I lie? It's true.

344
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,300
Then tell me,
what was your dream about?

345
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,740
I dreamed

346
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,100
that Hua Su was up and running again.

347
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,620
If only it were true.

348
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,500
You've already recreated three dishes.

349
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,600
I believe

350
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,320
you will master

351
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,680
all six signature dishes

352
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,700
soon.

353
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:06,960
Moreover,

354
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,320
you have me as well.

355
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,060
Thanks to you.

356
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,440
If it weren't for you,

357
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,000
I wouldn't be able
to recreat these dishes.

358
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,360
Alright.

359
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,380
I'm starting to feel

360
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,540
like I have superpowers.

361
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,980
Superpower?

362
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,060
What is it?

363
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,420
Show me what you mean.

364
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,080
I can see things

365
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,940
others can't.

366
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,700
Sometimes, I think
it's from a parallel universe.

367
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,500
Other times, I think it's prophecy.

368
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,740
Anyway, just trust me.

369
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,640
So, in your parallel universe,

370
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,020
has Hua Su has already reopened?

371
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,160
Yes.

372
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,620
I was right here in this place.

373
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,660
And I even wrote something

374
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,760
on this sign.

375
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,340
What did you write?

376
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,860
These words were written
by my Dad.

377
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,700
But how did you know
there were words here?

378
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,580
Could you

379
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,100
really be a prophet?

380
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,760
Mr. Shu,

381
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,200
have you gotten your results?

382
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,060
Let me ask you,

383
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,280
was the day I fainted

384
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,640
April 15th?

385
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,260
The day you fainted…

386
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,720
But you fainted a few times.

387
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,300
The first time.

388
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,900
The day the Reske Comet arrived.

389
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,900
Let me think.

390
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,020
Reske.

391
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,100
Yes, it was April 15th.

392
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,000
Hello?

393
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,480
Are you there?

394
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,540
Did you smell it?

395
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,480
Don't wave that in my face!

396
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,950
I'm telling you that I can't bear it.

397
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,740
Do you know Fang Meng?

398
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,840
Who?

399
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,160
You own a restaurant named Hua Su.

400
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,320
You're the head chef there.

401
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,120
You also wrote

402
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,560
"I have a date with Wintersweet,

403
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,250
so it should blame me for my leaving."
on the sign.

404
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,320
You know the Director Niu
of the Organic Milk Farm.

405
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,600
You also have a gold-digging wife

406
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,720
named Ruan Mingfang,

407
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,260
and she has a daughter named Fang Fei.

408
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,320
Wait, wait.

409
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,280
Speak slowly.

410
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,200
I never understood why

411
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,080
you know so much about food,

412
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,320
you still want
to eat Fang Meng's cooking.

413
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,160
Now I get it.

414
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,320
Because you are her father,

415
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,700
Pi Zijie, Master Pi.

416
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,620
What does that have to do with it?

417
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,360
You've always said
it was almost right.

418
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,200
The "almost right" is the gap

419
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,000
between recreating the exact flavor
of your six signature dishes.

420
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,320
You eat Fang Meng's cooking

421
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,520
is not because you like it,

422
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,040
but because you're her father.

423
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,760
You expect her deeply

424
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,460
and care about everything she does.

425
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,660
If you can't remember,

426
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,580
I have a way to help you recall.

427
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,960
