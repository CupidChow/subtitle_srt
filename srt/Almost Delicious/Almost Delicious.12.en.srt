31
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,960
Don't mention them.

32
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,420
It annoys me to talk about them.

33
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,000
Staying at Shu Zhengyan's house

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,500
is actually a good thing.

35
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,270
At least I can avoid
those two troublemakers.

36
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,340
Why don't you tell Shu Zhengyan

37
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,940
to help you figure something out?

38
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,680
Why should I tell him?

39
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,140
I'll handle my own problems.

40
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,740
Don't tell Lin Chuxiao either.

41
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,380
He's just Shu Zhengyan's spy now.

42
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,820
All he sees is his dear boss.

43
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,980
It's fine. You two will
fall in love sooner or later.

44
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,260
Just tell him.

45
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,940
Who wants to fall in love with him?

46
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,660
I'll help you.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,840
Mom.

48
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,360
Fang Meng is carrying lots of bags.

49
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,580
Where is she going?

50
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,980
Didn't they say
the restaurant is closed?

51
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,820
Follow her.

52
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,160
How did An Zhijiang

53
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,700
get your case report?

54
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,260
Could it be Doctor Xie
who gave it to him?

55
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,660
An Zhijiang must have used some tricks.

56
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,240
Do you think

57
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,260
we should hold the hospital
accountable for this?

58
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,480
Never mind.

59
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,380
What's done is done.

60
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,900
But now that you're suspended,

61
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,740
what should I do then?

62
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,900
If they assign me to An Zhijiang,

63
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,980
will I have any good days left?

64
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,340
But to be fair, Mr. Shu,

65
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,100
you said in the meeting just now

66
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,670
that you wanted to bring out the dishes

67
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,020
of Hua Su Restaurant.

68
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,300
What exactly were you thinking?

69
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,340
Yes, Fang Meng made a great dish,

70
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,460
but

71
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,860
given Hua Su's current situation,

72
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,740
who in their right mind would do this?

73
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,940
I don't mean your mind isn't right.

74
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,620
So,

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,900
if I forcibly acquire Hua Su,

76
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,300
will Fang Meng agree?

77
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,040
She won't agree,

78
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,980
but

79
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,700
Hua Su is already closed, isn't it?

80
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,900
If you wait a little longer,

81
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,050
Fang Meng won't be able to hold on.

82
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,860
She'll definitely sell the restaurant.

83
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,550
As soon as she sells it,

84
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,020
this matter will be settled, won't it?

85
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,240
Even if...

86
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,460
Even if An Zhijiang
got the report,

87
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,500
so what?

88
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,220
As long as you complete the task,

89
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,060
nobody will think
there's anything wrong with you.

90
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,920
Don't worry.

91
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,700
As long as I can prove I'm healthy,

92
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,820
I'll be back soon.

93
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,820
(The 2nd Signature Dish)

94
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,620
Why is this second dish

95
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,260
even harder?

96
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,800
Whatever.

97
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,830
I'll just start making it.

98
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,980
What are you making? It smells so bad.

99
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,740
I'm making fish balls.

100
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,600
You...

101
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,180
Fish balls look like this?

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,560
I just don't know why.

103
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,080
I can never roll them properly.

104
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,280
But I think the taste
should be the same.

105
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,380
I'll get you one to taste.

106
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,260
I told you

107
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,760
I'm not coming home for dinner.

108
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,860
You don't have to cook.

109
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,620
We clearly agreed

110
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,630
that the kitchen at your house
is under my command.

111
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,600
And this happens to be

112
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,160
our restaurant's second signature dish.

113
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,820
It's called Golden Fish Balls.

114
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,780
Try one.

115
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,480
Oh no.

116
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,440
I told you,

117
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,180
the taste didn't change.

118
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,920
Even if it's good,
you shouldn't eat so fast.

119
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,260
Look at you, choking.

120
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,680
Are you okay?

121
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,880
I know now.

122
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,980
Is it that every time
you smell her cooking,

123
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,850
you just want to eat?

124
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,720
Yeah.

125
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,940
Then I'll stop her
from cooking from now on.

126
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,250
You won't show up this way, right?

127
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,860
It's not right.

128
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
Back when I was at home,

129
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,360
she didn't cook.

130
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,380
Didn't you still show up?

131
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,180
Could it be

132
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,700
you have memories of these dishes?

133
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,340
Memories?

134
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,140
Do you remember what you

135
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,180
told me before?

136
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,040
You said the flavor
was always slightly off.

137
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,540
You're still not recovered?

138
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,460
This crab roe isn't very fresh.

139
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,260
Did you buy frozen ones?

140
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,740
Do you know how to make this dish?

141
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,100
Why not give it a try?

142
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,260
You bought frozen crab roe, didn't you?

143
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,820
How do you know?

144
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,980
Get the ingredients ready

145
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,260
and we'll make it again.

146
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,320
Wait.

147
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,100
You know how to make this too?

How do you know everything?

164
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,940
I just felt like

165
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,860
I had a dream.

166
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,140
Had a dream?

167
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,020
What kind of dream?

168
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,260
I dreamed about you.

169
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,900
Was it a serious dream?

170
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,060
How was it not serious?

171
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,620
Just kidding.

172
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,260
But how did you learn it?

173
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,980
Because there's someone in my head...

174
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,940
(No, I can't say this.)

175
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,900
(What if she thinks I'm insane again?)

176
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,860
Because I'm a gourmet expert.

177
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,400
These dishes

178
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,540
are a piece of cake for me.

179
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,060
Anyway,

180
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,180
thank you.

181
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,100
It's no trouble at all.

182
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,560
I didn't expect this little girl

183
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,780
to be so capable.

184
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,040
When did she start associating
with such a big boss?

185
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,460
She's living in such a big villa.

186
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,060
No wonder she doesn't care
that the restaurant is closed.

187
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,540
Mom, what should we do next?

188
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,840
Wait her out.

189
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,760
Where did he go?

190
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,420
Search properly, check here too.

191
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,940
Hello, Doctor Xie.

192
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,320
- Xie Jun.
- Miss Shen.

193
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,300
What are you doing here?

194
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,680
Nothing.

195
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,760
I was going to the restroom.

196
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,120
Liar.

197
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,520
Are you avoiding me on purpose?

198
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,620
Do you hate me?

199
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,660
No.

200
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,260
Then do you like me?

201
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,460
- I...
- I like you, don't you know?

202
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,960
No, Miss Shen.

203
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,020
Let's go outside.

204
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,540
Xie Jun.

205
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,140
Will you be my boyfriend?

206
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,240
I'll give you three seconds to decide.

207
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,100
If you don't deny it,
then you've agreed.

208
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,140
- Three, two, one.
- Miss Shen.

209
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,020
- You agreed!
- Miss Shen!

210
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,780
Miss Shen.

211
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,860
Do you really like me?

212
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,340
Of course.

213
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,060
Isn't it obvious that I like you?

214
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,500
Can't you tell?

215
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,740
Is it really this easy

216
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,300
to like someone?

217
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,500
Does liking someone
have to be so complicated?

218
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,100
I've never been in love.

219
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,000
I don't understand.

220
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,340
But Miss Shen,

221
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,780
you're so outstanding.

222
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,180
You must know better than I do

223
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,020
that liking someone

224
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,260
isn't something
you can decide in one glance.

225
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,880
But I just took one glance at you

226
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,180
and I liked you.

227
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,160
But

228
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,620
you've already affected my life.

229
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,660
Every time you come to find me,

230
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,380
I'm always so scared.

231
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,100
I like to keep things low-key.

232
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,870
I can't handle being so open about

233
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,860
liking someone.

234
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,500
Do you understand what I mean?

235
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,140
I don't understand.

236
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,100
Miss Shen.

237
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,980
I have to get back to work.

238
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,840
(He's a doctor after all.)

239
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,580
(It's not good for me
to keep disturbing his work.)

240
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,420
Keep fighting!

241
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,080
Go!

242
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,940
Oh my God.

243
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,820
How did you guys find this place?

244
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,680
What kind of talk is that?

245
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,060
Mom's here to check on her daughter.

246
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,960
Pack your things and leave now.

247
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,160
Or I'll call the police.

248
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,000
Leave now.

249
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,440
You...

250
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,220
I didn't mean to intrude on your life.

251
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,860
I had debts before.

252
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,060
I had to sell the house
to pay them off.

253
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,800
Here you go complaining again, huh?

254
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,800
Would you really let Mom and your sister

255
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,380
be homeless on the streets?

256
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,520
Would you?

257
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,820
Yes.

258
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,500
How can you be like this?

259
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,220
Lower your voice.
Let's go outside and talk.

260
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,790
- Fang Meng.
- No, I'm not leaving.

261
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,100
- Fang Meng!
- Don't touch me.

262
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,820
What's going on here?

263
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,040
I...

264
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,420
Are you Meng's boyfriend?

265
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,020
He isn't.

266
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,360
How is he not?

267
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,360
I saw you cooking for him.
How is he not?

268
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,920
If you're not my brother-in-law,
are you just a chef?

269
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,820
Exactly.

270
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,940
You are...

271
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,820
I'm Meng's mom.

272
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,540
I'm Meng's sister.

273
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,340
We're all family.

274
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,500
So you're her mom and sister.

275
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,660
Don't mind them.

276
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,760
Just leave.

277
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,320
Fang Meng, Fang Meng!

278
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,280
Don't be like this.

279
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,740
Let them stay for one night.

280
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,280
You're so kind.

281
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,120
We'll rest first.

282
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,300
Fang Meng, it's fine.

283
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,240
The house is so big.

284
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,540
One night won't hurt.

285
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,340
Fang Meng.

286
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,440
So...

287
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,340
They're not your real mom and sister?

288
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,540
What did you think?

289
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,120
With them here,

290
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,420
I can't be your private chef.

291
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,480
What should we do?

292
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,140
I can't kick them out.

293
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,160
This is your house,

294
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,200
why can't you kick them out?

295
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,140
Son-in-law,

296
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,260
let me ask you,

297
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,840
how much did you pay for this house?

298
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,080
What exactly do you do for work?

299
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,460
Can you just take a shower and leave?

300
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,100
My son-in-law let me stay here.

301
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,940
I have to criticize you.

302
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,480
You're not even married yet,

303
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,580
and you're already
treating this place as your own.

304
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,040
Do you really see yourself
as the lady of the house?

305
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,200
My brother-in-law is kind to his sister,

306
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,220
is that not okay?

307
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,900
Isn't that right, Mom?

308
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,480
Let me say this again,

309
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,800
we're not in a relationship.

310
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,100
He's not my boyfriend.

311
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,820
Who would believe that?

312
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,560
Brother-in-law,

313
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,420
what exactly do you like about her?

314
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,040
Fine.

315
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,650
Pick it up and read it carefully.

316
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,820
Employment contract.

317
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,600
Today, Party A, Shu Zhengyan,

318
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,580
hired Fang Meng as a private chef?

319
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,280
So you're really a chef?

320
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,380
What else?

321
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,680
He and I have
an employment relationship.

322
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,220
I don't like him and he doesn't like me.

323
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,360
I don't have any feelings
for him.

324
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,780
Did you hear me clearly?

325
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,560
He allowed you to stay here tonight.

326
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,660
Tomorrow morning,
pack your things and leave.

327
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,420
Do you understand?

328
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,580
Understood.

329
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,460
Take the cup with you.

330
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,120
Move faster.

331
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,680
Who allowed you to mess with things?

332
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,880
Wash the cup properly too.

333
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,150
Don't touch anything in the room.

334
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,980
So annoying.

335
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,940
Why are you here again?

336
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,340
Well, sorry about this.

337
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,980
Those two

338
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,820
have caused you trouble.

339
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,020
What did you mean
by what you just said?

340
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,300
What did I say?

341
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,980
Was it serious?

342
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,480
Of course, it was serious.

343
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,480
You don't know those two.

344
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,260
If you're not serious,
you can't handle them.

345
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,940
So it was really serious.

346
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,740
Aren't you going too far?

347
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,040
Me?

348
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,340
What did I do?

349
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,740
What about everything
we've been through

350
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,740
these past few days?

351
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,180
You're talking about that?

352
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,740
Then besides saying that,

353
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,060
what else could I say?

354
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,280
At the milk factory,

355
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,660
didn't we already do that?

356
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,060
Did what?

357
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,920
What are you talking about?

358
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,220
That was just an accident.

359
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,920
What about this?

360
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,480
Is this also an accident?

I'm fine.

386
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,520
Mr. Shu hasn't made things
difficult for you, has he?

No.

388

You sound hesitant.

Why do you sound off?

390
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,020
Did you know Mr. Shu got suspended?

391
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,380
What?

392
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,400

Apparently, it's because

396
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,580
Mr. Shu defended Hua Su
in front of the Chairman.

397
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,340
He even mentioned discovering
Hua Su's signature dishes.

398
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,820
And then he got suspended.
