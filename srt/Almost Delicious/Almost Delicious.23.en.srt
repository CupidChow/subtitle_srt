I'm a bit...

35
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,940
I miss Master Pi.

36
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,820
It's too bad you can't taste it.

37
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,380
This flavor is exactly like his.

38
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,540
It's as if Master Pi made it himself.

39
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,180
It's true, Fang Meng.

40
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,780
I now have your father inside me.

41
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,060
In other words, I am your father.

42
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,940
No way.

(Legend says magical things happen
in the two months)

47
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,550
(when the two comets return successively.
This is called "Gemini Comet Miracle".)

48
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,940
No way.

49
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,660
This is for you.

50
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,820
I know last time,

51
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,500
you actually wanted this one, right?

52
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,500
You said you liked the one
on your hand,

53
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,020
but that was just to spare my feelings,
wasn't it?

54
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,460
Wear this new one

55
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,020
and throw that old one away.

56
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,220
Please don't be angry, okay?

57
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,020
What are you doing? Let go of me!

58
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,980
Come with me.

59
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,660
I said let go of me. Did you hear me?

60
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,180
Gao Ying, I was wrong.

61
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,340
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,220
I know I spoke harshly last time.

63
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,420
But look,

64
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,940
I brought this gift
to make it up to you.

65
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,500
Please forgive me just this once,
okay?

66
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,780
Assistant Lin, no,

67
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,420
I should call you Manager Lin now.

68
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,100
I think we'd better

69
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,860
avoid physical contact in the company.

70
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,740
Is there something you need from me?

71
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,220
If not, I'll be leaving.

72
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,700
Why can't you understand me?

73
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,540
I don't care if others don't get me,

74
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,460
but why can't you understand me?

75
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,900

76
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,740
I feel good

77
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,020

78
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,620
Do you think I feel good

79
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,860

00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,060
I'm telling you,
I'm not feeling good at all.

00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,160
But who am I doing this for?

143
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,380

147
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,660

so it's a team effort!

148

00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,140

153
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,340
Who says men can't be afraid of mice?

154
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,100
You're making me feel very awkward.

155
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,100
Do you know that?

156
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,660
Relax, don't be afraid.

157
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,020

158
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,140

you to be afraid of mice.

161
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,140

00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,380

00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,140

164
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,140
Nonsense.

00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,220
Her birthday is on April 15th.

166
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,580
Isn't your birthday on April 15th?

168
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,620
my Dad's birthday is coming up soon.

169
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,420

I've only been gone for a short time,

171
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,720

173
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,940
Your Dad's birthday has passed, too.

174

into buying you a gift?

Fang Meng,

176
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,220
I'm just joking.

177
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,180
If you want a gift, just tell me.

178
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,300
I'll buy it for you.

179
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,900
I never told you my birthday.

180
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:36,970
I…

181
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,680
I also never mentioned my Dad's birthday.

182
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,300

184
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,820
See? This is your fault
for interrupting.

185
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,980
Now, how am I supposed to explain this?

186
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,340
How would I know? What should we do?

187
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,340
I was just guessing. Don't...

188
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,740
So my Dad is really inside your body,

189
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,580
right?

190
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,020
(Hua Su Restaurant, please come inside)

191
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,500
Dad,

192
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,420
I miss you so much.

193
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,380
Okay, okay.

194
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,660
Don't cry anymore.

195
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,100
So, it's been you teaching me how to cook

196
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,980
this whole time, right?

197
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,580
Alright, alright.

198
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,220
What exactly happened?

199
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,660
Don't cry.

200
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,680
Don't cry.

201
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,620
At first,

202
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,900
I didn't even know who I was.

203
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,300
At that time,

204
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,260
I had this vague feeling

205
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,420
there was something important
I hadn't finished.

206
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,460
Then I smelled the food you cooked.

207
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,140
I thought,

208
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,980
why did this strange smell

209
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,660
interest me so much?

210
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,500
And

211
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,980
I couldn't help but try it.

212
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,020
After my memory slowly came back,

213
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,140
I realized

214
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,860
it wasn't that I liked terrible food.

215
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:53,980
It's

216
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,740
that I remembered

217
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,660
the taste of your cooking.

218
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,260
Because you are my daughter,

219
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,500
no matter how it turns out,

220
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,100
I can't help but try it.

221
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,900
Alright, alright, don't cry.

222
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,220
I'm sorry. I got carried away earlier.

223
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,420
I took up a bit more of your body.

224
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:46,980
It's okay.

225
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,500
I understand.

226
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,260
Shu Zhengyan, is my Dad still in here?

227
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,580
Just say I'm resting.

228
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,820
It's unbelievable.

229
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,980
I can't believe
something like this would happen to me.

230
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,740
So, should I call you Shu Zhengyan,

231
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,780
or should I call you Dad?

232
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,100
Calling you Shu Zhengyan

233
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,340
feels wrong,

234
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,620
but calling you Dad seems a bit off.

235
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,580
In this situation,

236
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,980
what should I call you?

237
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,180
Well,

238
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,860
I don't know

239
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,500
who I am to you anymore.

240
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,220
Sorry,

241
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,460
I got too emotional earlier.

242
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,340
It's okay, I understand.

243
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:40,900
Wait.

244
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,460
Does this mean

245
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,180
my Dad saw everything we did?

246
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,060
Yes.

247
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,300
Even kissing?

248
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,020
No wonder!

249
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,260
I thought you were…

250
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,340
So you were sharing one body.

251
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,500
That explains

252
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,820
your actions.

253
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,300
Alright.

254
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,100
Now that you know the secret,

255
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,530
we need to focus

256
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,540
on getting Hua Su back on track.

257
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,740
Yes,

258
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,900
definitely!

259
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,380
Well,

260
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,820
can you call my Dad out

261
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,100
to teach me a few more dishes?

262
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,720
I'll get to work now.

263
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,480
Call him out, please.

264
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,620
Where is Gao Ying?

265
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,860
Manager Lin,
she's filing her resignation.

266
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,380
When did she resign?

267
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,590
Just now.

268
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,420
She should be back later
to pack up her things.

269
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,180
Thank you.

270
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,100
(Conference Room)

271
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,340
I need to talk to you. Come with me.

272
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,780
Why are you zoning out?

273
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,820
I'm talking to you. Didn't you hear me?

274
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,880
I'm sorry.

275
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,140
Fang Meng and Shu Zhengyan

276
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,620
have opened another store.

277
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,540
Did you know about this?

278
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,580
I'm asking you.

279
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,860
Did you know

280
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,940
Fang Meng and Shu Zhengyan

281
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,540
opened another store?

282
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,060
I didn't know.

283
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,860
Mr. An,

284
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,340
I don't quite understand what you mean.

285
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,180
Figure out a way

286
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,460
to shut them down.

287
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,700
Their last store has already closed.

288
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,340
Aren't we just focusing
on developing Food Street?

289
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,020
If my enemies

290
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,540
still do the same thing,

291
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,500
I can't rest easy.

292
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,470
Do you understand?

293
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,060
The reason I won before was

294
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,400
because they had yet taste
Fang Meng's cooking.

295
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,340
But… but

296
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,420
if Fang Meng's cooking improves,

297
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,500
then they'll have a chance
to turn the tables.

298
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,940
I absolutely won't allow that to happen.

299
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,020
Do you get it?

300
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,140
Mr. An,

301
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,300
you have already won.

302
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,380
Shu Zhengyan is no longer the CEO.

303
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,980
They just want to cook.

304
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,340
They have no chance to turn the tables.

305
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,940
Lin Chuxiao!

306
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,300
Don't forget who you're working for now.

307
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,460
The position you have now

308
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,180
is something I gave you.

309
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,060
Do you know why I kept you

310
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,300
after Shu Zhengyan left?

311
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,900
It's not because of your abilities

312
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,180
but because you are a loyal dog,

313
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,820
a well-behaved dog.

314
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,460
But remember,

315
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,420
if a dog stops being obedient,

316
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,340
it's no longer a pet.

317
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,300
It's just a stray dog.

318
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,340
And a stray dog
that wants to eat its fill

319
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,620
is at the mercy of fate.

320
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,300
Let me tell you.

321
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,900
Being a dog isn't shameful.

322
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,500
But if a dog

323
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,140
insists on seeing itself as human,

324
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,700
that's crossing the line.

325
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,020
Tell me,

326
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,260
what makes you think

327
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,700
you have the right
to question my decisions?

328
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,420
What's wrong?

329
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:45,900
Do you have a problem with me?

330
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,660
Let me make it clear.

331
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,100
Without this job,

332
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,500
you're nothing at all.

333
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,500
Go crap in your hat.

334
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,460
What?

335
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,860
Can't understand, huh?

336
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,300
I told you to go crap in your hat.

337
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,620
You've got guts, Lin Chuxiao!

338
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,620
Let's see how you come crawling
back to me!

339
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,580
Gao Ying!

340
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,860
Everyone in Bo Fei Group, listen up.

341
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,800
Gao Ying is my girlfriend!

342
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,700
What are you looking at?

343
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,220
Yes, I'm living off a woman now.

344
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,020
Do you have a rich girlfriend? Do you?

345
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,140
Then find one if you are jealous.

346
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,260
Gao Ying,

347
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
you said
you wanted me wearing couple underwear.

348
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,940
I'm wearing it right now.

349
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,340
Listen,

350
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,500
I really like this pair of underwear.

351
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,020
I really like this color.

352
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,500
I really like this little carrot.

353
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,240
I think it looks just like me.

354
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,300
Look.

355
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,060
Gao Ying,

356
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,220
I really like you.

357
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,140
If you ever want
to make our relationship public,

358
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,620
I'll broadcast it downstairs

359
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,300
for 30 minutes every day.

360
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,780
Wherever you want to travel,
I'll go with you.

361
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,500
But if you want to stay at fancy hotels,

362
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,100
you might have to foot the bill for now.

363
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,860
Gao Ying,

364
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,180
I really like you.

365
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,860
I don't care if you're rich or not.

366
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,940
I like you all the same.

367
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,180
If you run out of money,

368
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,420
I'll support you.

369
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,740

(Hua Su)

388
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,260
Add the sugar first.

389
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,020
How many times do I have to tell you?

390
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,060
Why are you yelling?

391
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,300
I'm your Dad. Why can't I yell?

392
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,240
Do it properly.

393
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,940
Dad?

394
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,660
Is this how young people talk now?

395
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,540
Weird!

396
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,420
Quick, taste this.

397
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,300
It's really amazing!

398
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,740
One bite, and you're hooked.

399
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,940
What do you two think?

400
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,660
I think it's great.

401
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,580
What about him?

402
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,130
He thinks it's great, too.

403
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,740
That's great.

404
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,660
I told you I'm a genius.

405
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:57,980
Well,

406
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:58,980
Mr. Shu,

407
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,180
don't you feel

408
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,100
nauseous or something?

409
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:04,900
Nauseous?

410
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,940
No. It tastes great!

411
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,220
Don't you… he…

412
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:09,780
Forget it.

413
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,460
Let's talk business.

414
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,900
Hua Su has been open for days,

415
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,940
and we have yet to have a single customer.

416
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,180
What's the point of good food

417
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,700
if nobody comes here?

418
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,660
I think

419
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,860
good wine needs no bush.

420
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,780
We just need to wait.

421
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,980
Dazui is right.

422
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,380
This can't go on.

423
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,260
We need to come up with a plan.

424
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,100
You two think about it first.

425
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,340
I've used up all the ingredients,

426
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,500
so I'll go buy some more.

427
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,820
Take your time.

428
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,700
I'll be right back soon.

429
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,640
Bye-bye.

430
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,660
Pretty good.

431
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,540
Why is your cooking getting worse?

432
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,140
It tastes just like Hua Su's.

433
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,420
Who are you talking about?

434
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,740
My cooking is as bad as Hua Su's?

435
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,780
What a disgusting thing to say.

436
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,020
I'm telling you, stop crying.

437
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,140
If you don't stop,
I'll take you to Hua Su for a meal.

438
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,860
I really didn't. Don't overthink it.

439
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,900
Who knew
something like this would happen?

440
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,740
Did you eat at Hua Su?

441
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,100
Why are you so brainless?

442
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,980
What's wrong, Fang Meng?

443
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,020
I was just thinking

444
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,460
that if this keeps up,

445
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,580
I won't be able
to keep the restaurant open.

446
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,220
Mr. Shu,

447
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,100
we've come to join you.

448
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,540
You're down with work?

449
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:47,900
Not exactly.

450
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,260
I quit.

451
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,820
I quit, too.

452
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,390
You both quit?

453
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,130
Yes.

454
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,340
Without you,

455
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,180
there's not much meaning for me
at Bo Fei, right?

456
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,100
I think I'm better off with you.

457
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,020
Although

458
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,500
this restaurant is small now,

459
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,420
I believe it won't take long

460
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,180
before it becomes a franchise,

461
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,390
right?

462
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,020
No customers?

463
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,700
That's tragic!

464
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,380
It's all my fault.

465
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,220
I ruined Hua Su's reputation.

466
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,830
What

467
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,220
if I apologize to An Zhijiang

468
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,580
and ask him to forgive

469
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,100
me?

470
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,780
Just kidding.

471
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,380
Why does it have to be called Hua Su?

472
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,900
Can't you change the name?

473
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,260
I told her that.

474
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,820
But you know why she won't.

475
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,740
I know.

476
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,280
But given the current situation,

477
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,500
even if you change the name,

478
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:51,340
Master Pi still won't care.

479
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,020
Who says I don't care?

480
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,580
What's it to you?

481
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,260
Well, he means

482
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,220
the name "Hua Su" is still important.

483
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,900
We need to hold onto it.

484
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,780
What's the point of a name

485
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,500
if the restaurant closes?

486
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,700
What do we do now?

487
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,220
Actually, Fang Meng's cooking is
already great now.

488
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,180
She's as good as Master Pi.

489
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,060
Once people taste it,

490
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,940
we'll definitely get repeat customers.

491
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:23,980
I've got an idea!

492
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,700
Come here.

493
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,380
We can find a shill.

494
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,300
Shill?

495
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:35,940
It smells amazing!

496
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,940
What restaurant is this?

497
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,500
The food is so good!

498
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,900
Hua Su!

499
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,300
What? Say it again. What restaurant?

500
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,120
Hua Su!

501
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,380
(Hua Su) Oh, Hua Su.

502
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,500
It's really incredible!

503
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,700
Dazui!

504
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:48,940
No, no. No way!

505
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,300
I'm not doing this.

506
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,740
This could get me killed!

507
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,980
Absolutely not!

508
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,980
I've got an idea.

509
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,820
Have you ever known
"good wine needs no bush"?

510
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,700
Just let them catch the scent.

511
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,980
Come on, come on!

512
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,820
Take a look.

513
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,740
It's really good and incredible. Come on.

514
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,580
Come on. Quickly. Come on.

515
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,140
No, no.

516
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,660
If you do that,
people will wreck the place!

517
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:18,980
Think of something else.

518
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,540
Why so complicated?

519
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,820
It's just food.

520
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:23,900
Just feed them directly.

521
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,600
Hold him.

522
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,540
Come on.

523
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,380
Hurry up. Pour it in!

524
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,140
Come on.

525
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,420
- Call an ambulance!
- Oh my! Hurry up!

526
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,460
Someone passed out while eating!

527
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,310
- Call an ambulance!
- Ma'am!

528
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,220
Ma'am!

529
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,100
This won't work either.

530
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,140
We'll lose more than we gain.

531
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,860
So, nothing works

532
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,940
here.

533
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,100
What should we do?

534
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,020
I'm wondering

535
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,220
why my business has been so bad lately.

536
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,140
Turns out Hua Su is here.

537
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,380
What's that supposed to mean?

538
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,660
How's my restaurant bothering you?

539
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,460
How could you even ask that?

540
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,660
You…

541
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,460
Well, isn't this Mr. Shu?

542
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,940
I heard that

543
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,020
you're no longer the CEO.

544
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,340
To be honest,

545
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,540
the real reason you lost your job is

546
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,100
because you were too close to this jinx.

547
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,660
It was all fine when you hired me.

548
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,380
But you replaced me with her.

549
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,780
Now look at you.

550
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,660
You've got nothing left.

551
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,260
Look at him, acting like a fool.

552
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,460
- I
- Stop.

553
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,220
Chef Li,

554
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,180
weren't you here

555
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,460
before we arrived?

556
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:43,980
That's right.

557
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,500
Then let me ask you.

558
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,980
If your restaurant

559
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,580
moved from Food Street to here,

560
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,940
is the problem really us,

561
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,140
or is it you?

562
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,620
Whatever.

563
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,620
Hua Su affects my business.

564
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,660
You're nothing but a troublemaker.

565
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,100
It ruins business wherever it goes.

566
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,420
Fine.

567
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,900
If you think
Fang Meng doesn't deserve to be here,

568
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,580
let's have a cook-off.

569
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,100
A cook-off?

570
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,820
Competing for the worst food?

571
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,620
I'd lose for sure.

572
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,140
If I hadn't been injured last time,

573
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,740
could she have won?

574
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,540
Besides,

575
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,500
last time it was you

576
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,380
who organized the competition.

577
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,460
Do you think we don't know

578
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,860
there's something in it?

579
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:25,940
Rest assured.

580
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,740
This time, the judges will be

581
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,780
everyone on this street.

582
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,380
If we lose,

583
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,700
we will leave on our own.

584
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,820
Believe in yourself, You can do it.

585
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,780
I can't.

586
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,540
Why can't you?

587
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,540
You're different from before.

588
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,700
Exactly, Fang Meng.

589
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,380
Don't be timid once you're on stage.

590
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,100
I'm traumatized by competition.

591
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,980
The result of the last competition

592
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,420
wasn't your fault.

593
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,540
This time is different.

594
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,260
What's different?

595
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,460
No one's going to eat my food anyway.

596
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,060
How would you know
if you don't try?

597
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,140
Why don't you go instead?

598
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,700
Me?

599
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,220
Him.

600
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,740
Him?

601
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,860
Meng, don't be ridiculous.

602
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,500
The baby's just a few months old.

603
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,940
You're pregnant?

604
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,620
Nice, Mr. Shu.

605
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,820
Whatever, you're up.

606
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,140
Fang Meng,

607
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,340
the judges last time

608
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,140
don't represent everyone.

609
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,420
This time is different.

610
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,220
This time, the judges are all the people
on this street.

611
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,900
If you want to establish yourself here,

612
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,740
you must rely on your skills

613
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,900
to earn their support

614
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,380
rather than on him.

615
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,420
Looks like my daughter

616
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,700
has good taste in men.

617
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,740
Ladies and gentlemen,

618
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,420

619
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,250
unofficial exclusive
internal culinary competition.

620
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,540
Now, let me introduce the contestants.

621
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,420
First, from Hua Su Restaurant,

622
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,380
Chef Fang Meng!

623
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,980
Fang Meng!

624
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,940
Fang Meng!

625
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,580
Second, from Yushifang,

626
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,540
Chef Li Dalong!

627
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,220
Alright, so today,

628
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,060
the judges are none

629
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,260
than all of you here.

630
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,500
There are two chopsticks in your hand.

631
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,500
The red one represents Chef Li,

632
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,780
and the yellow one

633
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,140
represents Chef Fang.

634
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,460
Each contestant has 30 minutes

635
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,020
to prepare three dishes.

636
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,900
Then, everyone will taste their dishes

637
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,860
one by one.

638
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,020
The higher vote wins.

639
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,100
Without further ado,

640
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,980
the competition officially...

641
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,340
Hey, what are you doing?

642
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,180
The competition should be
about fairness and justice, okay?

643
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,500
Take it seriously.
Go back, go back.

644
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,100
Hurry up. Come here.

645
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,100
And you, too.

646
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,740
Don't think I don't recognize you!

647
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,780
Go back!

648
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,580
The competition officially begins!

649
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,300
Fang Meng!

650
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,740
What is she doing?

651
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:41,740
Is she joking?

652
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,860
She is meditating.

653
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,780
Meditation?

654
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,820
Top chefs

655
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,740
should not rush into action

656
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,620
but rather

657
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,500
sense the forces around them.

658
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,380
In their minds,

659
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,500
these ingredients are

660
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,940
people they can control.

661
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,860
Top chefs will let ingredients
perform their duties

662
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,020
in the perfect position.

663
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,340
Only then

664
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,740
can they create the greatest cuisine.

665
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,500
So amazing!

666
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,740
She's clearly just asleep!

667
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,180
Fang Meng, wake up!

668
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,180
Game on.

669
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,700
Oh, sorry.

670
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,020
I'm just so tired.

671
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,500
Seriously, dude?

672
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,660
If you want to establish yourself here,

673
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,420
you must rely on your skills

674
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,620

It's for me, too.

679
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,420
I truly love cooking.

680
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,100
Honestly,

681
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,660
you're just

682
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,900
tarnishing Master Pi's reputation.

683
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,060
Why humiliate yourself?

684
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,820
