31
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,180
Why are you watching?

32
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,620
This taste.

33
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,460
Who?

34
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,060
This taste is too strange.

35
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,220
Are you talking to me?

36
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,020
Isn't it just you in this room?

37
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,340
- Who?
- Good question.

38
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,820
I don't know who I am either.

39
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,420
Before figuring out who I am,

40
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,940
just consider me as you.

41
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,100
Where are you exactly?

42
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,420
Go look in the mirror.

43
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,940
Where are you?

44
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,980
You look really young.

45
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,580
Quite fresh-faced.

46
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,700
You are inside my body.

47
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,580
You can control me.

48
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,420
Yes.

49
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,180
Why can't I see you?

50
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,820
How would I know?

51
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,500
I have to go try that fried rice.

52
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,580
I'm leaving.

53
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,380
Wait a moment.

54
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,580
Fried rice.

55
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,300
Are you talking about that garbage?

56
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,820
The taste just now?

57
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,990
Just thinking about it makes me...

58
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,260
That was a special dish made for Mr. Shu.

59
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,820
Awful.

60
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,260
Fang Meng cannot be trusted.

61
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,060
I've told you

62
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,420
not to let her deliver the food.

63
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,820
Look at now.

64
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,180
Either you leave,

65
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,700
or I leave.

66
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,180
Why are you being harsh with me?

67
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,940
If I don't help her, who will?

68
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,620
Since Master Pi passed away,

69
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,860
she is in need of me.

70
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,900
Do you know that they

71
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,220
bumped into each other downstairs?

72
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,340
Bumped…

73
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,740
Bumped into each other.

74
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,730
Where's that fried rice?

75
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,340
I'm sorry, Mr. Shu.

76
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,940
I'm investigating.

77
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,500
I'm asking you where it is?

78
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,260
Thrown in the pantry.

79
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,900
But don't worry, I'm just…

80
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,380
Do you smell it?

81
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:33,980
It's right here.

82
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,900
You want me to eat garbage?

83
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,420
Nothing to worry, it wasn't touched.

84
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,310
Hurry up and take it out.

85
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,100
I won't.

86
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,420
Why are you being so stubborn with me?

87
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,060
It's just a bite of food.

88
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,020
No, I can't do it.

89
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,580
I need to take a bite.

90
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,020
Are you across from me?

91
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,540
Just that rice.

92
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,580
Let me take another bite.

93
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,460
How can that be eaten?

94
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,100
Then I'll do it myself.

95
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,340
Mr. Shu.

96
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:37,340
(President Office)

97
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,740
What's going on here?

98
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,660
Gao Ying,

99
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,480
I knew you are here.

100
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,100
The aroma soup, I just made it.

101
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,600
I thought I'd bring it for you to try.

102
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,200
Dear, why are you here again?

103
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,420
I…

104
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,020
Please try a bite for me.

105
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,860
I won't try it.

106
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,040
Just one bite, please.

107
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,800
I'm begging you.

108
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,880
I really don't want to be a guinea pig.

109
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,160
I just want to live longer.

110
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,800
Are you going to try it or not?

111
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,880
If you go on like this,

112
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,440
I'll send it to your company tomorrow.

113
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,860
My company?

114
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,860
Still have the nerve to mention that?

115
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,620
As you were caught by my boss,

116
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,140
I almost lost my job.

117
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,360
Your boss,

118
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,600
he's a pervert, you know?

119
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,620
Pervert?

120
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,500
(The scent on that girl)

121
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,400
(is the same as that of the fried rice.)

122
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,760
(Did she make the fried rice?)

123
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,080
It's the fried rice earlier today.

124
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,960
Let me have another bite.

125
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,440
What are you up to?

126
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,680
I just think that smell

127
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,820
is a bit special.

128
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,500
You call that smell special?

129
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,880
That's clearly disgusting.

130
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,750
I can't take it anymore.

131
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,460
This taste...

132
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,380
The more I think about it,
the more my head hurts.

133
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,500
I need to eat it immediately.

134
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:19,960
Lin Chuxiao.

135
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,200
What's wrong, Mr. Shu?

136
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,920
Can we still find that fried rice?

137
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,580
Let me tell you,

138
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,700
if I want to drink your soup again,

139
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,200
I am just a puppy.

140
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,460
Take a bite, I assure you.

141
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,460
It's really different this time.

142
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,340
No!

143
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,660
We're already at the company.

144
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,700
Don't follow me.

145
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,000
What if someone finds out?

146
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,560
Just one bite.

147
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,220
Mr. Shu, forget the fried rice.

148
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,660
Let me take you to the hospital.

149
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,360
Give some advice.

150
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,980
- I don't wanna drink.
- Just a sip.

151
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,620
- Just a sip. Give some advice.
- Gosh.

152
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,940
No. I don't want it.

153
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,400
Sorry, Miss, we're not buying.

154
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,940
Thank you, thank you.

155
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,080
What are you doing?

156
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,480
What's wrong with your eyes?

157
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,740
Is it spicy?

158
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,300
It's you.

159
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,600
Pervert.

160
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,960
How am I a pervert?

161
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,120
Gao Ying, do you know her?

162
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,660
Mr. Shu, I...

163
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,640
I don't know her.

164
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,660
Miss, if you don't want to buy it,

165
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,880
I'll leave.

166
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,640
What a smell.

167
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,240
I really want to taste it.

168
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,600
Do you want to eat this?

169
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,760
Who wants to eat?

170
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,020
Go away now.

171
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,000
You're driving Mr. Shu crazy.

172
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,840
Hurry up, go away.

173
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,200
Is it really that good?

174
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,440
Mr. Shu.

175
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,760
Have you found out why you fainted?

176
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,500
I switched to another doctor.

177
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,800
I've got an appointment for a check-up.

178
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,240
Don't worry, Dad.

179
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,200
You must take care of your health.

180
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,100
You have no idea how many people

181
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,960
are waiting to see us fail.

182
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,310
If you fall ill now,

183
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,000
it would just give them a chance.

184
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,040
Especially for your mom,

185
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,640
we can't let her know.

186
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,760
If she knew, she wouldn't let me off.

187
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,780
And you,

188
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,740
finish your homework before play.

189
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,800
Is it that difficult?

190
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,620
If you go on like this,

191
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,250
I won't attend the parent-teacher meeting.

192
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,220
(Specialist Clinic, Doctor Xie Jun)

193
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,740
Let me take a look.

194
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,260
Miss,

195
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,720
does it hurt here?

196
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,940
Miss,

197
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,600
please swallow.

198
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:18,940
Does it hurt?

199
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,980
No, it doesn't.

200
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,120
Please open your mouth a bit.

201
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,320
Rest more and drink more water.

202
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,540
Rinse your mouth with salt water.

203
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,600
It can relieve discomfort.

204
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,780
Next, please.

205
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,020
Mr. Shu.

206
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,660
This is Doctor Xie,

207
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,840
who has returned from abroad,
and very famous.

208
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,800
What did Physician Shen say to you?

209
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,480
He said there's nothing wrong.

210
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,040
Mr. Shu, please have a seat.

211
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,320
Based on the medical report,

212
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,120
there seems to be no problem.

213
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,960
Can you describe your condition further?

214
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,060
Doctor Xie,

215
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,520
I have a question for you.

216
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,360
Do you think people can be possessed?

217
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,620
I always feel like in my mind…

218
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,460
Mr. Shu, would you

219
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,940
visit the Psychiatry Department?

220
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,400
You meant I have a mental illness?

221
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,040
That's not what I meant.

222
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,920
If you are experiencing hallucinations,

223
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,160
it may be due to excessive stress,

224
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,680
leading to a mental disorder.

225
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,320
Isn't that still a mental illness?

226
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,300
(Specialist Clinic, Doctor Xie Jun)

227
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,300
Mr. Shu,

228
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,000
how about the Psychiatry Department?

229
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,200
Do you also believe I'm mentally ill?

230
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,500
No, I don't.

231
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,340
If I go to the Psychiatry Department now,

232
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,040
doesn't it prove I'm mentally ill?

233
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,750
Let's keep it like this for now.

234
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,220
By the way,

235
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,040
have you found a private chef?

236
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,720
I plan to hold a cooking competition.

237
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,320
Then you can select one.

238
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,320
Such a grand display.

239
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,600
Of course, it's necessary.

240
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,580
This way, it can reflect

241
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,440
your high standards for cuisine.

242
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,880
I even invited our employees to observe.

243
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,080
Doctor Xie.

244
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,680
Go check

245
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,240
where that girl's restaurant is.

246
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,560
Which girl?

247
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,760
The one I've already seen twice.

248
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,720
Mr. Shu, why are you looking for her?

249
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,320
Do you still want to eat her dish?

250
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,240
Ever since I smelled her dish,

251
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,160
I've started to feel abnormal.

252
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,040
I'm wondering if there's a possibility

253
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,680
that she put something in the food.

254
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,720
Something that causes hallucinations,

255
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,760
yet is irresistibly addictive.

256
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,200
It must be like this.

257
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,480
Shall we visit another hospital?

258
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,140
Mr. Shu, health is the greatest asset!

259
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:27,980
Mr. Shu.

260
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,280
No photos allowed here.

261
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,740
Stop right there.

262
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,340
Mr. An,

263
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,920
he was indeed at the hospital.

264
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,560
It seems he is really sick.

265
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,520
Go and keep an eye on him.

266
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,460
You must find out

267
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,240
what's going on with Shu Zhengyan?

268
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,600
If we can really prove he's sick,

269
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,760
we can find a way to bring him down.

270
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,500
Why are you snickering?

271
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,400
We're not bad guys.

272
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,020
(Hua Su)

273
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,200
A pinch of salt.

274
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,840
How much is a pinch?

275
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,680
Still so unreliable.

276
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,420
Ever since Master Pi passed away,

277
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,220
the business is getting worse.

278
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,900
What should we do about this?

279
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,220
(Break for an advertisement.)

280
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,540
(The cooking competition hosted)

281
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,150
(by Bo Fei Group will be held next week.)

282
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,740
(The winner of this competition)

283
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,320
(can receive a prize of 100,000 yuan.)

284
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,660
(As a leader in the food industry,)

285
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,540
(Bo Fei Group is renowned.)

286
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,660
(We believe this competition)

287
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,300
(is bound to cause a stir)

288
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,080
(in the food industry.)

289
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,900
What did you say you were going to do?

290
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,560
I didn't catch it, say it again.

291
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,920
I'll attend the cooking competition.

292
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:21,900
Why?

293
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,800
Let me check if you have a fever.

294
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,760
You're just talking nonsense.

295
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,240
I'm serious.

296
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,240
I'm so angry.

297
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,320
What's wrong?

298
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,760
Just because of Lin Chuxiao.

299
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,740
I gave him a couple outfit,

300
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,080
and he got angry with me.

301
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,960
What's there to be angry about?

302
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,560
At the company, he's now

303
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,620
treating me like a stranger,

304
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,680
afraid of disclosing our relationship.

305
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,120
Let me tell you this…

306
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,160
What's wrong with him?

307
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:53,860
He's sick.

308
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,580
Tell her what you're going to do.

309
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,550
What are you going to do?

310
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,060
Gao Ying, I want to

311
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,800
attend the cooking competition.

312
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,600
Do you have a grudge against cuisine?

313
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,760
What kind of words are you saying?

314
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,580
You're still laughing.

315
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,480
Don't laugh.

316
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,720
Choked, didn't you? Serves you right.

317
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,500
Let me tell you, if Hua Su is closed,

318
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,100
with you munching on a carrot every day,

319
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,560
would any other store hire you?

320
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,780
Stop laughing.

321
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,680
I'm off to work.

322
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,200
What are you really thinking?

323
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,160
Since my dad died,

324
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,000
the business has just plummeted.

325
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,960
We still have debts.

326
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,280
If I don't come up with a solution soon,

327
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,400
the store is about to be shut down.

328
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,620
Then you should stop the loss in time.

329
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,220
Competitions

330
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,520
have nothing to do with you.

331
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,100
Everyone's taste,

332
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,400
is different.

333
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,380
Dazui said

334
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,340
my dad often ate my dishes secretly.

335
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,220
That's because he's your dad.

336
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,200
It has nothing to do with your cooking.

337
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,460
Then how do you know

338
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,540
among the judges

339
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,800
there isn't one who likes my dish?

340
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,360
Moreover, there's a prize of 100,000 yuan.

341
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,620
If I get this money,

342
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,840
I can pay back the debts.

343
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,720
Anyway, signing up is free.

344
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,420
I'll just give it a try.

345
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,960
Just pray your dad is among the judges.

346
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,020
(Performance March Bo Fei Group Area A)
This is our performance last month.

347
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,480
Our performance

348
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,920
has seen a slight decline.

349
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,220
Thus, next month…

350
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,900
A 20% drop,

351
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,480
you call this slight?

352
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,540
You have indeed redefined

353
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,440
my understanding of the word "slight".

354
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,280
According to the company's system,

355
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,960
you're fired starting from next week.

356
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,140
After all, Manager Gao

357
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,350
has worked here for many years.

358
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,660
Mr. Shu,

359
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,500
you are new here.

360
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,680
Isn't it a bit too inconsiderate?

361
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,520
So, what did you mean?

362
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,600
Even if his performance is poor,

363
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,580
and he takes kickbacks from suppliers,

364
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,600
I should still hire him?

365
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,560
What do you mean by kickbacks?

366
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,740
Mr. Shu, I didn't do it.

367
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,360
Then how do you explain this?

368
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,380
Alice Restaurant wants to join

369
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,400
and gave you 100,000 yuan,
you want more.

370
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,400
Do you need me to play the recording?

371
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,340
(Hua Su)

372
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,920
My dad arranged another blind date for me.

373
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,480
It's the sixth one this month.

374
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,980
It's just a few days into the month.

375
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,180
And it's already sixth date.

376
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,620
Quite high efficiency, isn't it?

377
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,840
Isn't it just?

378
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,860
I'm still wondering

379
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,600
how to introduce Lin Chuxiao to him.

380
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,140
Why don't you try

381
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,200
the plan we discussed earlier?

382
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,340
Fang Meng.

383
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,680
Xie Jun.

384
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,160
I almost didn't recognize you.

385
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,520
This place is still the same as before.

386
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,940
Fang Meng,

387
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,880
is this your friend?

388
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,840
So handsome!

389
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,220
When did you meet him?

390
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,120
How come I didn't know?

391
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,420
This is Gao Ying,

392
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,040
my best friend.

393
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,740
This is Xie Jun.

394
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,440
We had been neighbors since childhood.

395
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,500
He went abroad to study later.

396
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,440
He's been outstanding.

397
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,560
Childhood sweethearts, huh?

398
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,880
Don't talk nonsense.

399
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,120
Sit down, don't just stand there.

400
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,180
Okay.

401
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,100
Okay.

402
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,280
You haven't said

403
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,740
when you came back.

404
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,000
Didn't even tell us.

405
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,820
I've been back for a while.

406
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,520
I'm a doctor at the People's Hospital.

407
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,620
You are Doctor Xie

408
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,360
who just returned from abroad.

409
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,180
Fang Meng, you don't know

410
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,660
how popular he is now.

411
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,520
Some of my friends have consulted him.

412
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,040
If I had known he was so handsome,

413
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,640
I would have gone earlier.

414
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,160
Don't forget, you have a boyfriend.

415
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,460
By the way,

416
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,200
it's been long
since I ate your dad's food.

417
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:11,940
Where is he?

418
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,520
Why haven't I seen him?

419
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,680
My...

420
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,160
My dad passed away.

421
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,100
I'm sorry.

422
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,560
I didn't expect something like this.

423
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,160
It's okay.

424
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,780
Have you started dating anyone?

425
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,280
Now I just want to focus on my work.

426
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,340
Nothing else.

427
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:37,360
So you're the manager of Hua Su now.

428
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,580
Yes, that's right.

429
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,120
I do the cooking.

430
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,560
Well,

431
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,920
can I try your dishes?

432
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,280
You need to think it through.

433
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,560
I learned by myself.

434
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,680
But if you want to try,

435
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,560
I can cook for you right now.

436
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:56,980
Sure.

437
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,280
Are you okay?

438
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,900
Since you finished the meal,

439
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,680
you haven't said a word.

440
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,220
I'm fine.

441
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,320
I'll leave.

442
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,660
Bye-bye.

443
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,120
Goodbye, handsome guy.

444
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,280
Please visit us often!

445
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,640
Alright, I'm leaving too.

446
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,660
Not waiting for him to pick you up?

447
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,560
No, it's already so late.

448
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,180
I'm leaving, bye.

449
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,140
Take care.

450
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,080
- Okay.
- Bye.

451
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,200
Why didn't you wait for me?

452
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,040
What are you doing here alone?

453
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,240
Why?

454
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,260
When I need you, you're not around.

455
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,640
Can't I have fun on my own?

456
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,080
I've been busy recently.

457
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,800
So, are you off work now?

458
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,520
Yes.

459
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,760
Put on the couple outfit I bought.

460
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,180
I just got off work.

461
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,820
How is it possible?

462
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,050
You just don't want to wear it.

463
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,100
Let me tell you something important.

464
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,960
Assistant Lin,

465
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,060
it's not working hours now.

466
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,240
It has to do with Fang Meng.

467
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,000
Mr. Shu asked me to find her shop.

468
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,780
Why?

469
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,400
Ever since

470
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,140
he ate that fried rice

471
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,080
and chicken soup,

472
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,800
he seems to be bewitched.

473
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,920
I don't know what to do now.

474
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,440
In any case,

475
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,180
make sure Mr. Shu never finds out,

476
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,680
we know Fang Meng.

477
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,520
It's best if they never meet.

478
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,500
Awful.

479
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,740
Why?

480
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,620
Fang Meng just told me today

481
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,200
she wants to attend

482
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,950
the cooking competition of our company.

483
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,640
What?

484
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,540
(Private Chef Selection Competition)

485
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,040
What have you all been studying?

486
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,580
I've been studying braised pork ball.

487
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,100
This dish looks simple.

488
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,450
- Actually, the most…
- Hi.

489
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,380
Fang Meng.

490
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,360
Brother Li, you're here too.

491
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,080
Do you know who's hiring a private chef?

492
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,600
I really don't know about that.

493
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,060
I've only heard rumors,

494
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,240
it's someone
with very high standards for food.

495
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,100
According to your setup,

496
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,240
you're also here to compete.

497
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,160
Isn't it obvious?

498
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,880
As soon as you step up,

499
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,060
later on,

500
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,040
won't I have to cook with a mask on?

501
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,520
Here they come.

502
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:44,980
