I used very little seasoning before.

it had no flavor after tasting it.

It was too bland.

00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,260
You didn't marinate it long enough.

54
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,990
It should marinate for at least
half an hour to absorb the flavors.

from adding more seasoning?

00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,800
Why insist on learning how to cook?

74

89
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,800
I couldn't make my dad's dishes again.

Just enjoy the benefits.

92
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,280
Why do you always talk about your dad

93

and never your mom?

94
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,080
Don't ask that.

95
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,180
Okay, let's call it a day.

96
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,580
Mr. Shu,

97
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,320
I've heard that

98
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,940
Hua Su has reopened.

99
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,040
I have to say,

100
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,780
you're really good to your girlfriend.

101
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,990
If you were as considerate
with Bo Fei

102
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,260
as you are with your girlfriend,

103
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,380
I think the chairman
would be quite pleased.

104
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,860
What does this have to do with you?

105
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,540
I'm just reminding you.

106
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,380
Ms. Yin Miaolan
will be here tomorrow.

107
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,580
If she sees Hua Su like this,

108
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,100
will she be scared and run away?

109
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,160
Oh, how long is left
in Mr. Shu's probation period?

110
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,220
It should be soon, just a few days left.

111
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,260
I'll arrange a farewell
ceremony for him.

112
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,680
You take care of it.

113
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,520
Looks like Fang Meng and I

114
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,100
have caused you quite a lot of trouble.

115
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,100
Actually, Hua Su

116
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,400
shouldn't have to be opened
on the food street.

117
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,880
Fang Meng has learned
a few signature dishes.

118
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,700
She'll manage no matter where.

119
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,020
But Hua Su means
something different to her.

120
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,900
How should I talk to her about this?

121
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,480
Mr. Shu.

122
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,100
Just the right time to talk to you.

123
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,100
How's the assessment process
coming along?

124
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,520
The catering companies that applied

125
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,580
are over a hundred.

126
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,040
Basically, all the rated restaurants

127
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,940
and trending restaurants have applied.

128
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,340
But...

129
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,680
But we must complete

130
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,720
the acquisition of all the shops
on the food street

131
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,300
before we can officially
start the assessment process.

132
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,500
Otherwise, the process
won't be compliant.

133
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,940
Right now, it's stuck on Hua Su.

134
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,860
You go ahead and arrange

135
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,680
the meeting with Yin Miaolan tomorrow.

136
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,160
Okay.

137
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,700
Is there anything else you need from me?

138
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,580
Dr. Xie came to see you.

139
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,300
Haven't you two made up?

140
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,160
No.

141
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,860
Maybe I've hurt her too many times.

142
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,620
Shen An'an is acting again.

143
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,660
After I realized I truly liked her,

144
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,540
I feel I should win her back.

145
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,220
If you want to pursue her,

146
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,880
why are you asking me?

147
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,660
I've never pursued any women

148
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,460
nor have I been in a relationship.

149
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,380
So,

150
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,940
I want to ask you.

151
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,780
What does An'an like?

152
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,840
She likes

153
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,280
a lot of things.

154
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,100
Mr. Shu, wait a moment.

155
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,820
Okay, remember them well.

156
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,420
She likes anime,

157
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,940
the ACG world.

158
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,340
And, well, she's a girl,

159
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,050
(Win Them Over with Words)
so she likes sweet talk.

160
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,300
She likes little surprises
from time to time.

161
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,440
Right,

162
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,780
her favorite is Jay Chou.

163
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,180
Someone once told me,

164
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,980
someone falls in love with a creek,

165
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,860
because they haven't seen the ocean.

166
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,220
But now,

167
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,500
I can finally say,

168
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,340
I've crossed the galaxy

169
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,580
but still only love you.

170
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,780
When will you be tired of
being a princess

171
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,180
and come be my wife?

172
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,300
Not a single customer.

173
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,980
This won't do.

174
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,280
The shops around here

175
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,980
are already complaining about us.

176
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,700
They say we're
blocking their way to wealth.

177
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,860
Some even say we're selfish.

178
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,780
I think,

179
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,340
after the last milk incident,

180
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,960
someone will definitely

181
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,500
come up with another milk incident.

182
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,580
Now, Hua Su

183
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,140
has become the public enemy

184
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,400
of these food street shops.

185
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,700
Lin Chuxiao is driving me crazy.

186
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,000
He doesn't wear couple outfits normally,

187
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,900
that's fine.

188
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,780
But he doesn't even
wear couple underwear.

189
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,380
What does that mean?

190
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,600
Is someone really going
to pull down his pants

191
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,820
to check his underwear?

192
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,960
I still wear the bracelet

193
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,420
he bought me every day.

194
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,900
I think he just wants
to distance himself from me.

195
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,660
Does he want to break up?

196
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,360
Fine, let him go.

197
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,580
I don't care about him.

198
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,160
The people who chased me back then

199
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,620
were lined up all the way to Baoding.

200
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,120
What right does he have
to own me without doing anything?

201
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,580
You have so many admirers.

202
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,980
Why don't you keep your options open?

203
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,380
This is the first time I've had
such a long relationship.

204
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,220
He just can't publicly acknowledge me,

205
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,380
but he's actually been
good to me most of the time.

206
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,900
A celebrity once said,

207
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,440
"Love without material support

208
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,940
is like a pile of scattered sand.

209
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,220
A gust of wind

210
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,420
and it will scatter."

211
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,540
I don't want it to scatter.

212
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,440
You know the financial situation
of our families.

213
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,680
I don't dare to give him
expensive gifts normally

214
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,620
for fear of hurting his pride.

215
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,380
If we went public in the company,

216
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,580
people'd say he's a gigolo.

217
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,980
Let them talk.

218
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,060
But I don't know what he's thinking.

219
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,200
Gao Ying.

220
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,780
I don't have the energy
to counsel you right now.

221
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,340
I was thinking,

222
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,660
maybe I should just sell Hua Su.

223
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,100
You want to sell Hua Su?

224
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,540
Why so suddenly?

225
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,540
There's no business.

226
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,560
Though I've learned

227
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,140
my dad's five signature dishes,

228
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,000
the previous reputation issue

229
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,060
still affects the business now.

230
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,480
And the shops around me

231
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,160
have already been acquired
by Bo Fei Group.

232
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,260
They can't make money because of me.

233
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,620
Now they are gearing up to deal with me.

234
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,280
Who knows what will happen

235
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,700
if this continues.

236
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,540
That's true.

237
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,880
After all, you used to cook

238
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,180
like that.

239
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,680
It's hard to restore Hua Su's reputation

240
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,100
in such a short time.

241
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,700
Actually, Shu Zhengyan

242
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,100
has been dragged into this as well.

243
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,400
No,

244
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,740
what happened to him?

245
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,520
Didn't he help Hua Su before

246
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,200
by participating
in the introduction program?

247
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,660
He was seen as crazy by others.

248
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,080
Later, he was suspended for a long time.

249
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,560
Now, he has just returned

250
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,140
but he's still making efforts.

251
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,640
Currently, in the company,

252
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,100
it's obvious that An Zhijiang
has more influence than him.

253
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,900
This Shu Zhengyan

254
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,580
is like walking on a knife every day.

255
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,380
Plus,

256
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,580
his probation period is approaching.

257
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,920
No,

258
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,020
isn't he supposed to be helping me?

259
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,500
You have three days left
until your probation ends.

260
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,320
I don't care what methods you use,

261
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,000
within three days,
the acquisition agreement of Hua Su

262
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,260
must be in my hands.

263
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,940
Go find that Fang Meng for me right now.

264
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,860
You should hold her hand down,

265
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,020
and make her sign it.

266
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:23,300
(Hua Su, resting)

267
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,580
Why don't you just tell Fang Meng?

268
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,780
The assessment will start

269
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,320
after acquiring all the shops

270
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,980
on the food street, right?

271
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,540
What if Fang Meng
can't pass the assessment?

272
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,620
Then Hua Su would be finished.

273
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,900
I completely trust Fang Meng.

274
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,240
She will work hard

275
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,700
and keep Hua Su.

276
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,180
Then,

277
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,080
Hua Su can compete

278
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,180
with other top restaurants.

279
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,460
Sounds great.

280
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,740
- I...
- I...

281
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,440
- You...
- You...

282
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,180
You go first.

283
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,700
How do you think my cooking is?

284
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,780
It's delicious.

285
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,260
What if compared to others?

286
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,060
Anyway, I think

287
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,100
no one can beat
those five dishes of yours.

288
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,860
Hurry up and say it.

289
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,380
Get to the point.

290
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,580
Well,

291
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,060
about Dr. Mark...

292
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,620
I've figured it out.

293
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,980
I misunderstood you.

294
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,620
You really make me anxious.

295
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,750
- I have something...
- I have something...

296
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,940
You go first.

297
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,580
Prepare the contract.

298
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,100
I'm willing to sell Hua Su to you.

299
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,020
You've seen it,

300
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,720
Hua Su is struggling
for some reason right now.

301
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,260
Its business is sluggish.

302
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,420
If I still don't sign,

303
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,180
it'll be hard for you
to explain to your dad, right?

304
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,880
I don't want to cause trouble

305
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,900
for the surrounding shops.

306
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,900
Isn't there still
the introduction assessment?

307
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,180
If I pass,

308
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,160
then Hua Su can

309
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,260
officially enter the food street.

310
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,100
Winning the competition,

311
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,300
and the reputation
will be re-earned, right?

312
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,340
Yeah, exactly.

313
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,320
But I'm not very confident

314
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,580
in my cooking skills.

315
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,420
What's there to be insecure about?

316
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,780
I'm a food expert!

317
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,940
I love eating it.

318
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,300
How can others not like it?

319
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,360
But you ate those dishes I made

320
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,620
at the beginning too.

321
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,740
Were they delicious?

322
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,020
Yeah.

323
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,760
Anyway, I think with those five dishes,

324
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,750
it'll definitely be fine.

325
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,660
Do you have time now?

326
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,240
Can you accompany me

327
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,900
and help me research the sixth dish?

328
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,740
So I can be a little more confident.

329
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,240
Okay.

330
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,060
(Jiangnan University Affiliated Hospital)

331
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,950
Why do you want to take leave again?

332
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,620
Didn't you just finish your leave?

333
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,140
Sorry, Director.

334
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,620
I really have something important to do.

335
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,380
What's so important?

336
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,260
A big deal in life.

337
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,180
You specially asked me out.

338
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,260
Is there something on your mind?

339
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,480
An'an.

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,420

00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,260
I haven't been sleeping well recently.

344
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,660
Is it because of work pressure?

00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,220
I liked you for who you were originally.

374
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,380
I know I might have...

375
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,780
So now,

376
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,620
I don't want you to feel

377
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,660
uncomfortable because of me.

378
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,500
No, I don't.

379
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,920
I really like Jay Chou.

380
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,160
Don't lie to me.

381
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,420
How could that be?

382
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,480
Really.

383
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,440
Look.

384
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,800
I've been working out recently

385
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,340
while listening to his songs.

386
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,980
Also, when I was young,
I used to imitate Jay Chou.

387
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,200
Everyone said

388
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,500
my back looks like his.

389
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,600
Look.

390
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,700
Wow, not bad.

391
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,080
Good, very well.

392
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,950
Does it look like him?

393
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,380
Do you think it looks like him?

410
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,380
How about trying this flavor?

411
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,040
I can't eat anymore.

412
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,980
Maybe next time.

413
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,140
What's going on?

414
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,620
I used to learn it quickly
every time before.

415
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,760
I've tried so many times this time.

416
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,860
Why it still doesn't work?

417
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,180
This dish

418
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,940
needs to be researched by yourself.

419
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,960
When you make it in a large pot,

420
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,100
there's always some variation.

421
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,740
So you have to find your own way.

422
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,140
But

423
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,260
weren't you able
to teach me every time before?

424
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,380
Why you can't teach me this time?

425
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,560
I...

426
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,700
I'm not omnipotent.

427
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,160
I have another version

428
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,080
in the kitchen.

429
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,400
I'll bring it out for you to try.

430
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,800
Why are you still standing there?

431
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,820
Hurry up and go!

432
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,020
Clever.

433
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,400
Where is him?

434
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,720
Meng.

435
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,840
Calm down.

436
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,760
Dazui.

437
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,580
Help!

438
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,060
Dazui.

439
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,400
No!

441
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,740
Now is okay?

442
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,880
Here.

443
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,640
Yes, it's done.

444
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,140
You need to prepare well
for this introduction assessment.

445
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,600
Otherwise, Hua Su

446
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,620
will be gone for good.

447
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,540
Why didn't you say this earlier?

448
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,480
It's all written here.

449
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,500
You didn't look carefully.

450
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,080
Don't worry.

451
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,460
I have faith in you.

452
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,760
What faith?

453
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,620
I haven't even learned the sixth dish.

454
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,940
How about you stay
and help me test the dishes?

455
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,460
I... I have to

456
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,240
entertain food consultants these days.

457
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,420
I'm quite busy.

458
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,220
Stop making excuses.

459
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,080
You don't want to help me, do you?

460
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,740
No, I...

461
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,140
Come on, don't stand here.

462
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,380
Be careful not to step on it.

463
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,440
But

464
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,940
this is my basin to wash vegetables.

465
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,500
What are you going to do with this?

466
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,420
Do you have rope at your place?

467
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,180
You're so smart.

468
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:13,920
How is it?

469
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,660

Mr. Shu.

487
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,300
Yin Miaolan went directly to the banquet.

488
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,240
Hello, Ms. Yin.

489
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,980
I am Mr. Shu's assistant, Lin Chuxiao.

490
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,600
Where is Mr. Shu?

491
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,020
Why didn't he come with you?

492
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,360
Mr. Shu has some
other matters to attend to.

493
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,660
I was asked to come pick you up.

494
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,860
Is there anything more important
than picking me up?

495
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,580
Bo Fei Group has specially prepared

496
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,980
a lavish banquet to welcome you.

497
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,520
Would you like to...

498
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,380
Dinner?

499
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,380
Do you know what I eat?

500
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,550
I need to go to the kitchen first.

501
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,290
This one is good.

502
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,860
Pack this meal for me too.

503
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,320
Manager An.

504
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,260
This is the menu you confirmed.

505
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,240
This is not important.

506
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,900
Well, let me ask you.

507
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,260
Did you arrange

508
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,580
Mr. Wang's daughter

509
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,940
and Mr. Zhou's eldest son

510
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,340
that I told you before?

511
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,200
As you instructed,

512
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,350
everything has been arranged.

513
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,500
The opportunity has been created.

514
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,700
Whether this will succeed

515
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,100
depends on their own abilities.

516
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,680
If they can win Yin Miaolan's favor...

517
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,060
I'll leave it to them.

518
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,980
What I have to do is just

519
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,540
let Mr. Zhou and Mr. Wang
owe me a favor.

520
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,920
Mr. An.

521
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,260
Who is the woman Lin Chuxiao brought?

522
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,120
- Yin Miaolan.
- Yin Miaolan.

523
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,060
Why is Yin Miaolan here now?

524
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,300
Ms. Yin, this is our fruit station.

525
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,560
Ms. Yin, look at the knife skills
of this chef.

526
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,220
So professional, so skilled.

527
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,660
Where is this salmon from?

528
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,720
Ms. Yin, this salmon

529
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,400
was just airfreighted

530
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,300
- from Norway yesterday.
- Freshly airfreighted.

531
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:31,750
Okay.

532
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,980
Bring me the airfreight
documents for this fish.

533
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,860
I threw it away yesterday.

534
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,600
Take this dish

535
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,460
off tonight's menu.

536
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,380
How do you do things?

537
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,520
Throw it away immediately.

538
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,120
Okay.

539
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,180
Which school did you graduate from?

540
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,320
Golf.

541
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,040
He graduated from a prestigious
international school, Ms. Yin.

542
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,800
Graduated from a famous culinary school

543
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,360
yet he can't tell the difference
in ingredients,

544
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,800
using inferior ingredients
as substitutes.

545
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,980
You probably bought your diploma, right?

546
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,140
We don't need him in today's banquet.

547
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,600
Okay, okay.

548
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,080
Put your hand out.

549
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,080
Ms. Yin, this chef...

550
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,760
Do you want me to eat dishes she made

551
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,220
or the diamonds on her nails?

552
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,760
I know this banquet

553
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,540
was prepared to welcome me.

554
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,120
So in some ways,

555
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,100
it reflects my culinary philosophy.

556
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,160
If the guests I invited today

557
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,840
feel that the dishes at my banquet

558
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,700
are of this level,

559
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:40,840
how would they think of

560
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,700
my title as a culinary consultant?

561
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,020
I don't know what Mr. Shu told you,

562
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,660
but I am very dissatisfied

563
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,000
with the back kitchen.

564
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,700
Ms. Yin, this is indeed our fault.

565
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,060
Why did you get your nails done?

566
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,160
Go, go, go.

567
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,880
Ms. Yin, please let me explain.

568
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,720
Ms. Yin.

569
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,140
You two, come here.

570
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,980
Take this over there.

571
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,020
What's going on?

572
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,160
I'm so annoyed by Yin Miaolan.

573
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,740
What's the big deal about her?

574
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,100
You don't know.

575
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,820
She just got off the plane

576
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,500
and immediately went into the kitchen,

577
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,340
fired the two new chefs.

578
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,160
The two new ones

579
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,950
got in because of
An Zhijiang's connections.

580
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,100
It's good that they're fired.

581
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,260
The enemy of our enemy...

582
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,940
There are people here,

583
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,580
is our friend.

584
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,780
Go be friends with her.

585
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,780
You know what the woman's called?

586
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,620
Angelica.

587
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,220
Sure, she's so famous.

588
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,260
The international superstar
who loves China.

589
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,060
What did she act in?

590
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,420
Forget it, never mind.

591
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,340
What? Are Yin Miaolan
and Angelica friends?

592
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,780
They used to be.

593
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,120
You know why
they're not friends anymore?

594
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,040
Why?

595
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,180
Because

596
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,540
last time she came to China
for an event,

597
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,420
she was photographed eating
grilled lamb kidneys on the street.

598
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,780
That's it?

599
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,980
Just grilled lamb kidneys?

600
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,220
Exactly.

601
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,400
Yin Miaolan said

602
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,080
she can't have dishes around her

603
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,980
which don't align with her values.

604
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,260
So,

605
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,380
you go be friends with her then.

606
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,420
I still want to eat
my grilled lamb kidneys.

607
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,320
Now, I can only wait for my king

608
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,180
to come back and save me.

609
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,660
Why have you become so strange too?

610
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,060
Your king is here.

611
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,500
Mr. Shu.

612
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,240
Manager An.

613
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,260
It's over, it's over.

614
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,420
Everything's ruined.

615
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,260
I've offended both bosses at once.

616
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,860
This Yin Miaolan,

617
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,140
who exactly is she?

618
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,980
She's just a...

619
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,200
She's gone.

620
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,820
Isn't she just a crappy chef?

621
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,100
She dares to boss me around.

622
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,220
Where did she go?

623
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,640
Don't know.

624
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:35,990
Get someone to keep an eye on her.

625
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,800
Okay.

626
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,140
Where's Yin Miaolan?

627
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,320
She left.

628
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,640
Mr. Shu,

629
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,260
why are you always so late?

630
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,900
You can't always forget business
because of your romance.

631
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,240
If I remember correctly...

632
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,900
If I remember correctly,

633
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,750
you're the one responsible
for this welcome banquet, right?

634
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,060
You left me with this mess.

635
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,420
I haven't even scolded you yet.

636
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,760
Mr. Shu,

637
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,160
you can't proceed the acquisition

638
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,380
of Hua Su

639
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,580
and came here to find trouble?

640
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,680
If I remember correctly,

641
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,220
your probation period...

642
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,990
You've made up your mind?

643
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,800
Wrote your resignation letter already?

644
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,400
Okay, let me see

645
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,340
if you need me to revise anything.

646
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,840
What's this?

647
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,900
Hua Su agreed to sell?

648
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,520
Manager An,

649
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,780
being the CEO

650
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,400
is not about connections or tricks.

651
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,700
Not anyone can sit in that chair.

652
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,700
Improve your business skills.

653
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,360
Dazui.

654
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,480
I'm really sorry.

655
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,600
I just called you back

656
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,050
and now I have to send you off again.

657
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,060
But don't worry.

658
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,760
As long as I pass
the introduction assessment,

659
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,820
Hua Su will officially
settle in the food street.

660
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,120
I'll call you back

661
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,240
right away then.

662
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,820
Meng, what do you mean?

663
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,320
Dazui.

664
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,000
I don't mean anything else.

665
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,320
You're going to
the competition by yourself

666
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,460
and leaving me here?

667
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,140
You think I can't handle it?

668
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,860
No.

669
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,800
I just thought it would be
too troublesome for you.

670
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,940
What trouble?

671
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,420
You'll need help

672
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,720
at the competition.

673
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,900
I can help you.

674
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,260
It's decided.

675
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,860
I'll go with you to the competition.

676
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,480
Come on.

677
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,800
