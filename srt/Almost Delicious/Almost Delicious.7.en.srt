What are we celebrating?

34
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,300
This time, my return to the country

35
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,200
is to establish
a particularly impressive

36
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,660
gourmet magazine.

37
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,900
With Brother Zhengyan's support,

38
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,880
we definitely need to
celebrate in advance, right?

39
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,920
You must come, okay?

40
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,120
An'an, I don't have time to attend.

41
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,500
You have time.
How can you not have time?

42
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,540
I've already taken a leave
from the company for you.

43
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,550
There's no problem at all.

44
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,900
The entire company should come.

45
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,100
When did you decide on your own

46
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:13,940
to give me time off?

47
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,460
Uncle Shu said

48
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,300
it's okay, no problem.

49
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,640
I've also taken a leave.

50
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,840
So you must come.

51
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,340
I won't talk to you anymore,
I have a lot to prepare.

52
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,520
I'll hurry back to prepare.

53
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,260
You will never guess
the theme of this party.

54
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,300
It's super unique.

55
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,820
You must attend
according to the requirements.

56
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,440
The requirements are clearly written
on the back.

57
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,540
You must come.

58
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,520
Everyone has to come.

59
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,400
You also need to bring
a partner of the opposite sex.

60
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,020
By the way, Mr. Shu,

61
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,220
since you said you wanted
to pursue Fang Meng, why not...?

62
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,140
I was just making an excuse to tell them
I want to pursue her.

63
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,480
I don't really intend to.

64
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,560
No, it's not like that.

65
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,420
The misunderstanding between
you and Fang Meng

66
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,330
needs to be resolved, right?

67
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,480
Think about it.

68
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,040
If you have any more health issues,

69
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,060
will she help you
given her current attitude

70
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,180
towards you?

71
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,560
No, she won't.

72
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,320
Let alone asking her to sell Hua Su.

73
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,900
(Hua Su)

74
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,100
Alright,

75
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,840
then let me give you an explanation.

76
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,200
I am pursuing Fang Meng.

77
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,040
What I said yesterday

78
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,640
must not be known to Fang Meng.

79
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,280
Otherwise, we'll be in trouble.

80
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,660
Got it.

81
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,980
Mr. Shu, the meeting is about to start.

82
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,000
Can we connect now?

83
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,020
Yes, we can.

84
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,500
Go away.

85
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,180
Fang Meng, we've already paid.

86
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,640
Why aren't we allowed to be here?

87
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,240
Are you crazy?

88
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,200
So she actually falls for this.

89
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,780
What?

90
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,380
Mr. Shu,

91
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,740
since she misunderstood,

92
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,920
why don't you just go and win her over?

93
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,360
Right now,
no one in the company can control you.

94
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,140
Besides, they already think

95
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,400
you're pursuing Fang Meng.

96
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,680

a bossy president?

186
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,820
Alright.

187
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,500
You have grown up abroad
since childhood.

188
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,850
It's normal if you haven't seen it.

189
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,740
However, since Miss Shen An'an wants
to make this party

190
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,960
"A Chinese Odyssey" themed event,

191
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,720
why don't you ask Fang Meng
to play Fairy Zixia

192
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,280
and you play Zhizunbao?

193
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,720
Fairy Zixia and Zhizunbao?

194
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,740
They are a couple,

195
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,240
a very famous couple.

196
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,300
Think about it.

197
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,040
Aren't you trying
to get close to Fang Meng?

198
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,060
Moreover,
in front of everyone in the company,

199
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,060
you boasted

200
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,400
that you two were dating.

201
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,300
If you don't dress like a couple,

202
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,840
what will happen if you're exposed then?

203
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,620
Isn't it too risky?

204
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,200
This time, An Zhijiang is also going.

205
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,360
Won't it be revealed?

206
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,700
Don't worry, I'm here.

207
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,900
I will definitely not let An Zhijiang

208
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,340
take half a step closer to Fang Meng.

209
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,860
I couldn't tell

210
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,960
that Mr. Shu is into this,

211
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,560
cosplaying.

212
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,720
You'd better give him back this dress.

213
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,220
I can't accept things from him

214
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,220
for no reason.

215
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,580
No,

216
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,680
Lin Chuxiao specifically told me

217
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,150
this is Mr. Shu's way of thanking you

218
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,060
for not betraying him,

219
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,680
so he bought this dress for you.

220
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,820
And you were

221
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,320
supposed to be going to this party.

222
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,160
But it's too weird to wear this.

223
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,680
What's so weird about it?

224
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,990
You'll definitely look good in it.

225
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,240
You are the little walnut
of whole wheat.

226
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,960
No, but I...

227
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,380
No buts.

228
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,300
I want to go too.

229
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,660
Why are you afraid if I'm going?

230
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,420
Wearing this dress to dance,

231
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,400
you'll definitely outshine everyone.

232
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,480
Need to dance?

233
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,780
Yes indeed.

234
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,200
It's a dance party,

235
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,290
and you need bring
an opposite-sex partner.

236
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,800
Opposite-sex partner?

237
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,940
Fairy Zixia,

238
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,680
and Zhizunbao.

239
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,860
But why does Zhizunbao

240
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,080
sound so unpleasant?

241
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,960
Actually, it's just

242
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,720
Sun Wukong.

243
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,080
So it's Sun Wukong.

244
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,400
Bro, you're in the wrong scene.

245
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,180
Sorry, Mr. Shu,

246
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,040
I'm late...

247
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,280
Mr. Shu,

248
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,160
isn't this outfit of yours...?

249
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,960
Isn't that Sun Wukong you mentioned?

250
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,480
I'm sorry.

251
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,840
It's my fault
for not explaining clearly.

252
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,380
I said I would help you prepare.

253
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,680
But you insisted on preparing yourself.

254
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,000
How did you prepare for Fang Meng?

255
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,580
Don't worry.

256
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,900
I've already helped her prepare.

257
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,880
Luckily, it is...

258
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,920
Luckily, I helped her prepare.

259
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,540
Come over here.

260
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,020
Can you get me something else to wear?

261
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,840
This is too embarrassing.

262
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,350
It's not that embarrassing, right?

263
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,840
You're not wearing the costume
from the 1986 version of Journey to the West.

264
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,740
What about the promised
Journey to the West?

265
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,620
Isn't this also Journey to the West?

266
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,740
I want A Chinese Odyssey!

267
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,740
A Chinese Odyssey!

268
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,760
Where's A Chinese Odyssey?

269
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,600
Sorry, Manager An.

270
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,760
I didn't hear clearly.

271
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,530
What are you looking at?

272
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,540
What for?

273
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,080
Don't you have a childhood?

274
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,080
The main character of today's party

275
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,600
is the daughter
of Huacheng Zhonghe Group.

276
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,470
Yes.

277
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,880
Shu Zhengyan is so arrogant

278
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,920
because he's close to her family.

279
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,260
Now it's all messed up.

280
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,220
Everything is ruined.

281
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,160
Thanks to you.

282
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,140
I'm sorry, Manager An.

283
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,160
So, what do we do now?

284
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,120
What else can we do? Go back for it.

285
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,180
Okay, go back for...

286
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,300
For what? Tathagata Buddha?

287
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,920
It's too late. Let's go!

288
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,420
Ladies and gentlemen,

289
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,180
friends present here,

290
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,020
today,

291
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,700
I am pressed down by the Bull Demon King
on Flaming Mountain,

292
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,780
waiting for my lover Zhizunbao

293
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,800
to ride the Colorful Cloud to rescue me.

294
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,620
I am the Fairy Zixia,

295
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,060
Shen An'an.

296
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:30,900
Welcome everyone

297
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:34,320
to the celebration party
of our Dahua Magazine.

298
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,380
By the way,

299
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,660
the most important thing is

300
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,540
that all the Zhizunbao present,

301
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,180
please make sure
to find your Fairy Zixia,

302
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,060
alright?

303
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,240
Alright!

304
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,220
(Theme Party)

305
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,300
Brother,

306
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,920
why are you dressed like this?

307
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,080
This must be Miss Shen, Shen An'an,
right?

308
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,220
Hello,

309
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,240
nice to meet you.

310
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,880
Who is he?

311
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,480
I am the Deputy General Manager
of Bo Fei Group.

312
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,600
My name is An Zhijiang.

313
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,320
I am just a nobody,

314
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,320
not worth mentioning.

315
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,600
Your way of speaking is not right.

316
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,660
The requirement for our party today is

317
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,100
to speak according to the role
you are playing,

318
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,080
not the way you said it.

319
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,640
Senior Brother,

320
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,450
did you just come from Five Finger Mountain
and don't know the rules?

321
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,680
You can't call Shen An'an by that name.

322
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,080
So annoying.

323
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,340
But speaking of which,

324
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,640
this Master Roshi's disciple,

325
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,440
(Wu)
have you gathered all the Dragon Balls?

326
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,780
Master,

327
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,940
I, Sun Wukong, will take my leave first.

328
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,920
I'm leaving.

329
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,020
Taking my leave now.

330
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,880
He's right.

331
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,220
Brother,

332
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,760
is this person mentally sound?

333
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,320
Patron, what are you eating?

334
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,400
You gave me a fright.

335
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,200
What are you wearing?

336
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,750
Where are the clothes I bought for you?

337
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,660
If I wear that set, they'll know

338
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,180
we are a couple.

339
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,220
So many people are dressed like this.

340
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,580
Who cares about you?

341
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,920
Wear it at home.

342
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,160
It's not impossible.

343
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,040
Assistant Lin, let's go for a drink.

344
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,420
It's not convenient right now.

345
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,820
Come on.

346
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,660
Go...

347
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,840
How about it? Did I manage okay?

348
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,880
What does the sigh mean?

349
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,780
Fang Meng,

350
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,170
there was something at the hospital,

351
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,440
so I didn't have time to prepare.

352
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,100
I'm dressed today,

353
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,300
isn't it strange?

354
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,380
I think it's fine.

355
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,360
Don't worry about it.

356
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,800
Why are you here?

357
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,180
I invited him.

358
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,260
The invitation stated

359
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,960
to bring a partner of the opposite sex.

360
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,900
Mr. Shu,

361
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,840
your style today

362
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,100
is impressive.

363
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,820
Is that what I meant?

364
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,120
Then what do you mean?

365
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,600
Miss... Miss Fang?

366
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,200
It's been a while since we last met
at the hospital, right?

367
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,180
- Last time I didn't...
- Manager An, I need to talk to you.

368
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,340
What is it? Tell me now?

369
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,150
Let's go first.

370
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,350
Excuse for a moment, Miss Fang.

371
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,740
Who told you to dress up as Fairy Zixia?

372
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,080
Don't you know
I'm the only Fairy Zixia allowed here?

373
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,540
Miss, my hair is messy.

374
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,040
Could you help me tidy it up?

375
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,620
Fang...

376
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,640
This young man,

377
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,560
what is your name?

378
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,700
Hello, Miss.

379
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,720
My name is Xie Jun.

380
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,840
I am a doctor.

381
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,180
My name is Shen An'an.

382
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,560
You can just call me An'an.

383
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,560
Why didn't you dress up as Zhizunbao?

384
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,440
I'm sorry, Miss Shen.

385
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,800
I came in a hurry.

386
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,170
There wasn't enough time to prepare.

387
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,260
If there are any impolite aspects,

388
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,500
please be understanding.

389
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,280
It's okay. I can give you a set.

390
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,920
Give me a set?

391
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,120
But you have to answer me first.

392
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,960
Is that girl

393
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,600
your girlfriend?

394
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,440
We're just friends.

395
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,460
Just friends?

396
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,000
Let's go. Let's get changed.

397
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,350
- Get changed?
- It'll be quick.

398
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,320
Go.

399
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,080
I'm angry.

400
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,700
I couldn't find the Dragon Balls.

401
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,240
And my girlfriend ran off
with someone else.

402
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,240
Senior Brother, you are right.

403
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,160
You guys,

404
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,420
come here.

405
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,840
Let him go.

406
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,400
Be gentle.

407
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,920
Release him quickly.

408
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,480
Doctor Xie,

409
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,760
you really look handsome in this outfit.

410
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,680
Miss Shen, thank you for the clothes.

411
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,890
I have things to do
and I'll leave first.

412
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,180
Sorry,

413
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,020
Miss Shen, I'm sorry.

414
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,950
It's okay.

415
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,840
Doctor Xie, can you dance?

416
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,680
I'm not very good at it.

417
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,080
Come on, I can teach you.

418
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,040
Miss Shen...

419
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,600
Where are you from, bro?

420
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,040
What's your mother's surname?

421
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,600
Dazui?

422
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,840
No, why are you here?

423
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,220
Gao Ying asked me to come.

424
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,840
I don't know why they tied me up.

425
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,120
I think it's just a prop.

426
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,720
How could it be you?

427
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,520
Dazui,

428
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,620
you are the most important presence
at our dance party.

429
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,540
There must be a reason
why I called you here.

430
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,020
You stand at the lead position

431
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,420
with two bodyguards beside you.

432
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,440
Isn't that great?

433
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,540
Right? Isn't it, Fang...?

434
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,380
Well...

435
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,320
What's she up to?

436
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,580
Doctor Xie,
which hospital do you work at?

437
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,980
Are you busy with work?

438
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,680
How many hours do you work in a day?

439
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,320
By the way,
are there many female patients?

440
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,000
You must deal with
a lot of them every day, right?

441
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,890
Do they have any
inappropriate requests for you?

442
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:12,770
Tell me about it...

443
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,860
Well, Miss.

444
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,800
He is the dance partner I brought along.

445
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,480
Sorry about that.

446
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,820
It's...

447
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,620
Let go of your hand.

448
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,400
No, I won't.

449
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,640
Let go of your hand!

450
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,640
This is my dance partner.

451
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,080
Let's go.

452
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,560
What do you mean?

453
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,840
Why are you getting angry with me?

454
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,330
You're the one who told me to come

455
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,780
and introduce me to the food editor.

456
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,320
You do nothing and keep this attitude...

457
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,620
- Then ask him to introduce you.
- I...

458
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,620
I gave you the invitation.

459
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,680
Why did you bring him?

460
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,520
The invitation says to bring a partner.

461
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,780
I invited you,

462
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,600
which means I'm your dance partner.

463
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,740
Is that what you mean?

464
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,250
Then why didn't you make it clear?

465
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,100
What else to clarify?

466
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,480
I gave you all these clothes.

467
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,100
Shu Zhengyan,

468
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,520
