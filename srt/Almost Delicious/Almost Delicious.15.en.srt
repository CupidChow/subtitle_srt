I'll wait for you ahead

(Jia Pu Ji)

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,620
Hello, good morning.

37
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,980
An'an.

38
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,900
How did you two sleep

39
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,380
last night?

40
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,380
I think it was fine, pretty good.

41
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,980
Him, though...

42
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,740
Ask him yourself.

43
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,080
An'an.

44
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,700
Why aren't you asleep this late?

45
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,980
I just can't sleep.

46
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,480
I'll go sleep outside then.

47
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,580
Wait a second.

48
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,960
An'an.

49
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,280
Does it itch?

50
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,240
Such a big mosquito bite.

51
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,080
Doesn't it itch?

52
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,340
Xie Jun.

53
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,500
Actually, you don't have
to avoid me like this.

54
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,800
If you don't like me,

55
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,980
just say it.

56
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,980
It's okay.

57
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,420
As for me,

58
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,060
I've only been in love once before.

59
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,340
I don't have much experience in love.

60
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,680
I'm not like this with just anyone.

61
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,700
Don't misunderstand.

62
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,260
You're always frowning at me.

63
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,380
Can't you smile at me once?

64
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,720
Done.

65
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,660
Truly worthy of being
Winemaking Genius Master Zhang.

66
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,660
Such aura

67
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,460
is unlike anyone else.

68
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,880
Hello.

69
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,860
I am Shu Zhengyan of Bo Fei Group.

70
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,500
May I ask if you are Master Zhang?

71
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,020
I know you are retired.

72
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,420
But don't worry,

73
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,920
I am willing to pay ten times the price

74
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,940
to buy a jar of your wine.

75
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,760
Hello.

76
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,120
What?

77
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,360
Everyone,

78
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,740
we've gone to the wrong place.

79
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,460
It's not this one.

80
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,740
This sauerkraut is verdant in texture

81
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,980
and vibrant in color.

82
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,020
It even carries a hint of wine aroma.

83
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,260
Master Zhang is truly

84
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,380
an extraordinary person.

85
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,660
And this sauerkraut
is no ordinary either.

86
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,040
Recently, I saw online

87
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,860
that stomping sauerkraut with feet

88
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,680
makes the flavor different.

89
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,520
So

90
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,160
I made some myself to try

91
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,780
to see how it compares to mine.

92
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,660
Rest assured.

93
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,960
The ones drying outside

94
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,100
and the ones I sell

95
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,700
are not stomped with feet.

96
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,220
It's absolutely clean and hygienic.

97
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,000
Sir,

98
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,900
we're not here to buy sauerkraut.

99
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,380
Not buying sauerkraut?

100
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,260
Then what are you here for?

101
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,660
To chat with me?

102
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,180
- I... I...
- We're here to buy wine jars.

103
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,820
Sorry.

104
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,540
I stopped selling wine long ago.

105
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,740
Well, didn't you want to chat?

106
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,860
We can chat with you

107
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,340
as long as you want.

108
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,780
You can see for yourselves.

109
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,200
These wine jars of mine

110
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,900
have long been used
for pickling sauerkraut.

111
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,480
Sir, name a price.

112
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,980
Just name your price,
we'll buy them all.

113
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,360
Money?

114
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,580
Since I switched to selling sauerkraut,

115
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,000
business has gotten worse.

116
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,540
There's not even
a cup of good tea at home

117
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,220
to serve.

118
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,420
Sorry, I can't receive you.

119
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,520
Please leave.

120
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,660
What kind of attitude is this?

121
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,720
What's so great
about your shabby wine jars?

122
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,840
Zhengyan and Xie Jun

123
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,300
- went all the way
- An'an

124
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,400
to find you.

125
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,860
Sir,

126
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,500
didn't you say
your sauerkraut isn't selling well?

127
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,860
We can help you sell it.

128
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,900
Help me sell sauerkraut?

129
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,960
Little girl,

130
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,620
do you like sauerkraut?

131
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,960
We'll take all the sauerkraut.

132
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,280
Can you throw in a jar of wine?

133
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,060
This deal is very worthwhile, isn't it?

134
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,780
What do you mean?

135
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,540
I don't need charity.

136
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,920
I sell sauerkraut

137
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,780
to people who truly enjoy it.

138
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,760
- Please leave.
- No, no, no.

139
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,880
You misunderstood,

140
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,720
Master Zhang.

141
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,760
Your sauerkraut

142
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,660
is pickled in wine jars.

143
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,840
Its flavor

144
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,700
is naturally different from others.

145
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,440
This person

146
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,720
is Shu Zhengyan,
President of Bo Fei Group,

147
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,780
a renowned domestic gourmet company.

148
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,880
With him here,

149
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,760
we can definitely help you

150
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,980
sell your sauerkraut,

151
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,700
and make it famous.

152
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,540
Before the sun sets today,

153
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,060
if you can sell all this sauerkraut,

154
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,100
I'll give you a few jars of wine.

155
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,840
Fang Meng, who allowed you
to promise him on your own?

156
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,140
What do we do now?

157
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,920
Miss Shen,

158
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,820
Fang Meng did it for Hua Su.

159
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,540
Please try to understand.

160
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,980
At this point,

161
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,020
we have no choice but to do it.

162
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,300
Everyone, share your thoughts.

163
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,380
Any ideas?

164
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,140
I have a plan.

165
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,140
Livestream.

166
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,940

00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,020
(Buy now! Place an order!)
Everyone,

00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,300
(Bo Fei Group has bought 100 jars)
Master Zhang's wine jar sauerkraut.

169
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,560
(Famous designer An Duoduo:
Awesome! I'll buy some for Qin.)

170
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,640
(Handsome Xie Jun: I'll buy some too.)
This taste

171
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,920
(Such a big discount.)
is just amazing.

172
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,780
(I just placed an order.)
Amazing! Amazing!

173
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,900
(Can you sell more? It's sold out.)
Amazing!

174
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,780
(It's sold out! Give us more!!)
Only 500 orders available.

Show the link.

177
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,560
Stop.

178
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,420
Do you want me
to keep my job at Bo Fei Group?

179
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,980
And without a streaming account,

180
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,500
who can make the livestream popular?

181
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,440
Got it.

182
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,940
I thought of a great idea.

183
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,080
Friends in front of the TV,

184
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,080
hello.

185
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,040
Behind me now

186
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,680
is Master Zhang's

187
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,860
wine jar sauerkraut.

188
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Let's learn about

189
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,120
the genuine reactions

190
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,520
of the passersby

191
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,980
to our wine jar sauerkraut.

192
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,600
This handsome, elegant,
and wealthy gentleman,

193
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,720
may I ask if you would accept

194
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,140
our TV station's interview?

195
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,280
This beautiful and lovely lady,

196
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,420
it's my honor to be interviewed by you.

197
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,120
Have you tried

198
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,100
Master Zhang's wine jar sauerkraut
from Peach Blossom Town?

199
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,260
Of course.

200
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,180
I eat it every day, every meal.

201
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,220
At night and in the morning too.

202
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,620
May I ask your profession?

203
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,480
Doctor.

204
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,400
No way.

205
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,500
I'm a doctor.

206
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,780
I have medical ethics.

207
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,060
And your TV shopping method

208
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,780
won't be effective.

209
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,220
By the time it's filmed, it'll be dark.

210
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,040
So this doesn't work, that doesn't work.

211
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,300
What do you suggest we do?

212
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,520
Well, Shu Zheng...

213
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,420
Mr. Shu.

214
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,660
Think of a way.

215
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,020
Let's go, I have an idea.

216
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,540
Cooking?

217
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,720
Right.

218
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,940
We can make a dish with the sauerkraut

219
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,340
and let people try it.

220
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,580
Maybe this will work.

221
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,740
But

222
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,980
what should we make?

223
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,120
Aren't you running a restaurant?

224
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,960
Don't you know?

225
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,720
You can't count on me

226
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,060
for such an important task.

227
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,380
I can't do it.

228
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,180
What can be made with sauerkraut?

229
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,060
There's so much
you can make with sauerkraut.

230
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,720
What do you want?

231
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,200
Preferably something

232
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,780
that can be made
in large quantities at once.

233
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,820
Think quickly.

234
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,940

are for you.

268
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,100
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

269
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,660
This is great wine.

270
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,300
I specially prepared it
for my son's wedding.

271
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,880
Oh, that's why.

272
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,260
No wonder you wouldn't sell it.

273
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,600
Smells amazing.
Where is your son now?

274
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,080
- Tell him to join us.
- Yeah, let's drink together.

275
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,920
Yes, call him over.

276
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,760
Yeah.

277
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,620
A few years ago,

278
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,420
my son had an accident

279
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,860
and passed away

280
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,640
due to drinking.

281
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,780
Since then,

282
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,980
I decided to stop brewing wine.

283
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,100
Speaking of which,

284
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,140
he was about your age.

285
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,160
Mr. Zhang,

286
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,940
we'll take the jars.

287
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,640
Let's drink

288
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,940
the wine together.

289
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,480
Okay.

290
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,560
Let's drink.

291
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,520
Okay.

292
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,360
Let's drink.

293
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,680
Let's drink.

294
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,980
Come, sit, sit, sit.

295
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,160
I'll pour you some wine, come.

296
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,720
- Let me do it, Mr. Zhang.
- Let me.

297
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,640
Mr. Zhang, let me, let me.

298
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,480
I'll pour it for you.

299
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,900
No, no, I'll do it, I'll do it.

300
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,040
- Let me do it.
- We'll get drunk tonight.

301
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,540
- Sit down.
- Okay?

302
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,830
- Mr. Zhang.
- Mr. Zhang.

303
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,840
Wake up, let me take you home.

304
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,070
- Let's go.
- Go.

305
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,160
Let's go, let's go back.

306
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,260
- No more drinking.
- No more drinking.

307
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,540
Yeah, let's go.

308
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,560
Xie Jun.

309
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,900
- Let's drink another bowl.
- Keep drinking.

310
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,160
Miss Shen.

311
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,660
Miss Shen, stop drinking.

312
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,860
I know you don't like me,

313
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,480
but I truly

314
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,860
only

315
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,580
have been in one relationship.

316
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,920
One time.

317
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,060
Just once.

318
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,880
He didn't want to come back with me.

319
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,200
He wanted to stay abroad,

320
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,600
because there were
better options abroad.

321
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,180
He had better opportunities.

322
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,780
It was my fault.

323
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,860
If I had

324
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,980
cherished him just a little more,

325
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,020
wouldn't that have

326
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,860
prevented the breakup?

327
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,580
Xie Jun.

328
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,940
Before I met you,

329
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,300
I really didn't want
to fall in love again.

330
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,620
But after meeting you,

331
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,700
everything changed.

332
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,460
I just wanted...

333
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,620
I just wanted to try every way

334
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,540
to be good to you.

335
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,900
I wanted you to feel my presence.

336
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,220
Did I

337
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,780
do too much?

338
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,460
I'm sorry.

339
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,140
Meng.

340
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,300
Did you win over Shu Zhengyan?

341
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,740
I've told you many of my stories.

342
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,780
But you haven't told me yours.

343
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,900
What is there to say about me?

344
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,380
Like the Food Street Plan,

345
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,260
what kind of plan is it?

346
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,300
Actually, right now, I have some doubts

347
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,060
about this plan.

348
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,500
What do you mean?

349
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,300
I always thought before

350
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,160
that Bo Fei Group's Food Street Plan

351
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,560
was about bringing in the world's

352
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,100
top cuisines.

353
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,700
Now I feel

354
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,700
every dish has its own flavor

355
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,820
and will find someone who loves it.

356
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,020
Truly wonderful things

357
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,520
are different

358
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,660
for everyone.

359
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,040
A person should be most clear

360
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,420
about what they want.

361
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,100
That's what I admire about you.

362
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,640
And you?

363
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,020
Do you not know what you want?

364
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,940
Since I was young,

365
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,660
my dad groomed me

366
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,900
to become him

367
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,620
and inherit his business.

368
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,420
Sometimes I feel like a puppet,

369
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,840
always unable

370
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,780
to follow my heart in making choices.

371
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,660
But you're different.

372
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,620
Even though
your sense of taste isn't sharp,

373
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,380
you know what dish you want to make.

374
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,140
And I, despite having everything,

375
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,460
don't know what I want.

376
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,860
The one who truly lost taste

377
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,100
is probably me.

378
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,920
Let's go.

379
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,280
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

380
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,480
- Bye, Mr. Zhang.
- Okay.

381
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,480
- Bye, Mr. Zhang.
- Bye.

382
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,200
- Take care.
- Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

383
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,660
- I had a great time.
- We'll head off now.

384
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,520
Goodbye, goodbye.

385
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,370
Bye.

386
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,800
Goodbye.

387
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,800
Goodbye.

388
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,300
So nice.

389
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,000
Mr. An,

390
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,820
Shu Zhengyan has returned.

391
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,660
How is he? Anything unusual?

392
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,420
He seems to have brought

393
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,000
something like a souvenir.

394
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,940
A souvenir?

395
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,660
Seems like

396
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,340
such a big jar.

397
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,580
A jar?

398
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,980
Someone saw him selling sauerkraut
in Peach Blossom Town.

399
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,180
Shu Zhengyan selling sauerkraut?

400
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,140
Could he have joined
some pyramid scheme?

401
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,640
What is Shu Zhengyan

402
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,060
up to all day?

403
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,560
Mr. An,

404
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,380
the overseas doctor has returned.

405
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,800
He went to the hospital
for a checkup today.

406
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,640
What?

407
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,480
This is what you
should be focusing on reporting.

408
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,920
Who cares about their love lives

409
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,260
or sauerkraut.

410
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,240
Can't you stop smiling all day?

411
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,360
All you do is smile, smile.

412
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,200
Can you stop?

413
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,000
No, I wasn't smiling.

414
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,840
Talking back?

415
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,240
Keep watching them.

416
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,420
- I really wasn't smiling.
- Get out!

417
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,340
(Jiangnan University
Affiliated Hospital)

418
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,680
Mr. Shu.

419
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,280
Originally, the doctor
wasn't supposed to come so soon.

420
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,780
Luckily, the chairman intervened.

421
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,020
Otherwise, who knows
when the checkup could happen.

422
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,720
Now our Food Street

423
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,140
is stuck because of Hua Su.

424
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,580
Your trial period
as president is almost over.

425
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,480
The closer you get to Fang Meng,

426
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,260
the more the board will object to you.

427
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,980
Her level now is not what it used to be.

428
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,360
Bringing in Hua Su

429
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,820
is a new attempt for Bo Fei,

430
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,540
but it could also be a breakthrough.

431
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,600
If Fang Meng has the ability,

432
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,740
let her take the assessment herself.

433
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,640
When you're in a meeting,

434
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,180
don't bring this up again.

435
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,260
Or they'll think you're crazy again.

436
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,240
Alright.

437
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,460
Let's not talk about this for now.

438
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,820
Has the doctor arrived?

439
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,500
Mark, is that you?

440
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,840
Shu!

441
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,540
You're here.

442
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,660
It's been such a long time.

443
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,980
How have you been recently?

444
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,020
Alright, alright, put me down.

445
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,200
I'm happy.

446
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,320
Chuxiao, let me introduce you.

447
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,220
This is my good friend
from abroad, Mark.

448
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,900
No, no, no, no need.

449
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,200
Shu,

450
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,760
how did they suspect

451
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,860
you had mental issues?

452
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,720
Tell me.

453
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,500
What's going on?

454
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,880
Fang Meng.

455
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,300
My little Meng, I'm here.

456
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,640
Hurry, hurry,

457
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,300
come shop with me.

458
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,240
Please, I'm really tired.

459
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,340
I just got back
from Peach Blossom Town.

460
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,160
Such a bummer.

461
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,820
I haven't finished shopping.

462
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,460
I only bought this little bit.

463
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,180
How have you been progressing recently?

464
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,460
I've already developed the fourth dish.

465
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,780
Who's asking about that?

466
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,500
I mean,

467
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,980
you and Shu Zhengyan.

468
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,380
How's it going?

469
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,020
What do you mean, "huh"?

470
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,900
Didn't you two go
to Peach Blossom Town?

471
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,320
Nothing happened

472
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,380
between you?

473
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,060
What do you expect to happen?

474
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,560
What do you think?

475
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:33,920
You're so annoying.

476
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,980
But still,

477
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,580
Shu Zhengyan really
understands food.

478
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,700
My recent dishes being recreated

479
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,980
are all thanks to him.

480
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,500
He taught you?

481
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,980
But Master Pi's dishes

482
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,900
are not casually taught to others.

483
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,240
He doesn't even teach you,

484
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,420
so how does Shu Zhengyan know?

485
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,820
I also find it strange.

486
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,380
But it's really all taught by him.

487
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,900
This must be a connection of minds.

488
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,560
Let me tell you,

489
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,920
when a boy

490
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,800
falls in love with a girl,

491
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,460
he becomes very powerful.

492
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,820
Well,

493
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,420
I truly

494
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,780
understand it deeply.

495
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,840
This doesn't look like your style.

496
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,260
Of course, it's not my style.

497
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,980
Isn't this what he bought?

498
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,260
I fancied another one at the time,

499
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,900
but he couldn't afford that.

500
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,380
Anyway,

501
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,480
I'll wear it for fun.

502
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,680
What are you saying?

503
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,640
Let's go.

504
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,860
Help me carry my stuff.

505
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,920
Carry them!

506
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,940
Stop shopping.

507
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,040
Shu.

508
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,100
You passed my test.

509
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,160
Medically speaking,

510
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,620
you're very healthy.

511
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,400
Occasionally, your brainwaves

512
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,300
show some minor deficiencies.

513
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,400
But you can normally

514
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,780
communicate with me.

515
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,280
I'll have your report

516
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,700
delivered directly to your company.

517
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,060
You're still very healthy.

518
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,560
Mr. Shu.

519
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,200
I don't understand, is my Chinese bad

520
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,340
or is his Chinese bad?

521
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,760
Mark,

522
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,160
before you leave,

523
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,380
come to my place anytime
for a couple of chess games.

524
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,760
By then, I'll have a new friend

525
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,040
to introduce to you.

526
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,260
She makes very unique

527
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,700
Chinese food.

528
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,660
She wouldn't be your girlfriend, right?

529
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,600
Waiting for you to come.

530
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,780
I'll head out now.

531
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,300
- Deal.
- Deal.

532
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,520
I'm leaving.

533
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,360
What is it?

534
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,980
You must keep your eyes closed.

535
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:46,960
Alright.

536
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,120
A surprise.

537
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,240
What kind of surprise?

538
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,220
Follow me.

539
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,360
We're here.

540
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,840
- Here?
- Careful, don't bump into anything.

541
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,860
- Alright.
- Here, you can sit down.

542
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,000
Where are you going?

543
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,860
Don't worry, I won't leave.

544
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,900
Smell it first.

545
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,720
Have a try.

546
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,600
How is it?

547
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,560
How is it?

548
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,140
I've already added wine

549
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,320
to the stewed chicken soup.

550
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,860
Why is it still not right?

551
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,620
Teach me again.

552
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,520
Okay?

553
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,640
Dad.

554
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,220
Please.

555
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,940
Did you see that?

556
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,220
This isn't a dream

557
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,340
nor an illusion.

558
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,740
It's your memory.

559
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,540
What are you doing now?

560
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,420
You don't teach me how to cook.

561
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,660
When will you finally
teach me how to cook?

562
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,220
(Hua Su)
If I were serious,

563
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,780
I would definitely be better than you.

564
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,060
