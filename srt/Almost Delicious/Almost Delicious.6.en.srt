31
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,580
Hello, how many?

32
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,500
Mr. Shu.

33
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,940
I forgot it.

34
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,180
Sorry, Mr. Bai.

35
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,060
I've seen it, no acquaintance.

36
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,500
Over there.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,270
What would you two like to order?

38
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,940
Not for now.

39
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,290
Dazui, please go to the back and
help me change the water.

40
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,700
What would you two like to eat?

41
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:26,980
Not yet.

42
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,500
Mr. Shu,

43
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,060
are we really going
to work and eat here?

44
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,900
Then what other solution do you suggest?

45
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,140
Then why not order some food?

46
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,160
Let's wait a bit longer.

47
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,660
Wait for what?

48
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,980
Order dishes.

49
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,050
Mr. Shu, please wait for a moment.

50
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,100
I'll get you some water.

51
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,700
Why exactly

52
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,590
would you want
to eat these unappetizing things?

53
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,060
I'm curious too.

54
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,060
Why am I interested in this taste?

55
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,860
Could it be

56
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,700
related to my identity?

57
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:36,980
I know it.

58
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,580
Your identity

59
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,060
is a fly.

60
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,330
What are you looking at?

61
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,780
Something feels off.

62
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,820
What's wrong?

63
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,100
Why aren't they live streaming yet?

64
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,660
Why?

65
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,140
Is it not allowed for someone

66
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,460
to genuinely like the food I cook?

67
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,560
Feeling confident again.

68
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,900
Mr. Shu, store acquisition.

69
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,140
Then where is Mr. Shu?

70
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:24,900
Where is he?

71
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,560
Manager An,
Mr. Shu is on a business trip.

72
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,020
On a business trip?

73
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,780
How come I didn't hear about it?

74
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,820
Yes, Mr. Shu said,

75
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,260
if you need anything,

76
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,380
you can contact him directly
by phone or online.

77
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,370
Meetings can also be conducted
as online meetings.

78
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,060
Alright,

79
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,190
get your things done first.

80
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,600
Manager An, it's almost time.

81
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,720
We can start the meeting now.

82
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,640
Let's connect with Mr. Shu.

83
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,820
This is Mr. Shu?

84
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,320
Look how professional they are.

85
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,300
They even brought the scene props.

86
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,500
Mr. Shu, where are you?

87
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,380
I'm at the hotel.

88
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,700
Well, I'm currently on a business trip
out of town.

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,040
Sorry about that, everyone.

90
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,740
Recently, I can only meet you

91
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,660
in this way.

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,390
Why does your voice sound like that?

93
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,240
Are you having a cold?

94
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,980
Yes.

95
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,940
(Video Conference)

96
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,020
Then what's with the sunglasses?

97
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,220
I have a stye.

98
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,560
Manager An, is this important?

99
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,100
No, Mr. Shu, why is your hotel so noisy?

100
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,180
The soundproofing isn't very good.

101
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,340
Hello, everyone.

102
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,700
Let me take you to see over there.

103
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,670
Mr. Shu,

104
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,820
there's a woman in your room.

105
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,660
She's in the next room.

106
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,500
Got the wrong room.

107
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,820
Next room?

108
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,420
Are your hotel rooms connected?

109
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,500
Please wait a moment, everyone.

110
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,580
What are you doing? Block people!

111
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,860
Sorry.

112
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,060
Be careful.

113
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,620
Alright, it's fine now.

114
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,700
We can start now.

115
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,620
Let's have the meeting.

116
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,380
No, Mr. Shu,

117
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,300
if this continues,

118
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,220
I will eventually be poisoned by
Fang Meng's cooking.

119
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,020
Actually, our top priority now

120
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,020
is not to reveal our identities.

121
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,020
As for the rest,

122
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,610
just bear with it for now.

123
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,190
Actually,
after eating her cooking for a while,

124
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,320
I've kind of gotten used to it.

125
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,340
Didn't you just throw up today?

126
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,460
And are you still used to it?

127
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,260
Stop.

128
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,080
As soon as you mentioned it,

129
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,340
I felt like...

130
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,980
(Wealth and Fortune)

131
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,820
(Washroom)

132
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,420
Mr. Shu, I really can't take it anymore.

133
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,140
I'm not sick.

134
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,860
How about I order takeouts myself?

135
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,740
I don't need reimbursement.

136
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,740
If you order takeouts,
won't she suspect you?

137
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,140
You can't stand this bitterness.

138
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,860
The bitterness you said
is ''What bothers''.

139
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,180
I think if you're sick,
you should see a doctor.

140
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,100
Stop coming here to suffer every day.

141
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,800
Haven't I told you
countless times already?

142
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,540
It's that guy in my head.

143
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,460
Mr. Shu,

144
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:14,980
did you ever

145
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,380
offend anyone in the past?

146
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,820
What do you mean?

147
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,780
I mean those curses and such...

148
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,020
Have you offended someone before,

149
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,190
and now he is taking revenge on you?

150
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,390
How can you believe the superstition?

151
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,660
Maybe Doctor Xie was right, wasn't he?

152
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,140
Your mental stress is overwhelming.

153
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,740
But when you feel unwell,

154
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,210
you should really see a doctor.

155
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,220
Look at us now, staying here...

156
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,060
Stop.

157
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,360
Last time we went to see a doctor,
we got photographed.

158
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,540
Let's not go again.

159
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,540
Every time I can't resist eating,

160
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,820
I always feel

161
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,740
the taste is just a bit off.

162
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,500
A bit off?

163
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,940
Is it really just a bit off?

164
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,620
What I mean is

165
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,140
every time I eat it,

166
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,180
I almost remember something,

167
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,300
but then it feels like
the taste isn't enough,

168
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,220
just a little bit off.

169
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,260
Could it be

170
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,020
because I threw up
everything I ate before,

171
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,270
so I didn't eat enough?

172
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,700
How about I eat a bit more next time?

173
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,540
You can try again.

174
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,940
Maybe give it a try?

175
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,420
Landlady!

176
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,340
What's up?

177
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,500
Make all these dishes.

178
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,580
Mr. Shu...

179
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,460
Make them all?

180
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,400
Yes, make them all.

181
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,780
Hurry up and serve the dishes.

182
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,020
Okay.

183
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,980
Are you really going to eat them?

184
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,800
Since we're already here,

185
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,140
it's too late to regret now.

186
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,740
This...

187
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,250
- He really ate it.
- Almost over.

188
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,580
Something's going wrong.

189
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,980
I'll go call an ambulance.

190
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,980
Oh my god,

191
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,420
they actually ordered so many dishes.

192
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,740
How desperate must they be?

193
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,240
Good gracious,

194
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,800
the two guys in the black and white caps

195
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,840
didn't even taste it
and just swallowed it directly.

196
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,580
What the hell.

197
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,580
This...

198
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,060
Such a big bite.

199
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,800
They are like the Black and White Darers
without tasting the food.

200
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,380
What a great appetite!

201
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,060
Oh my god,
how can they order so many dishes?

202
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,030
I can't take it anymore.

203
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,260
Stop taking pictures.

204
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,740
So, have you remembered anything?

205
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,740
My stomach is about to explode.

206
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,900
I can't remember anything.

207
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,040
If anything's going to explode,
it's my stomach.

208
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,790
Whatever, I don't care.

209
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,760
Anyway, I don't eat like this.

210
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,140
So it really is you two.

211
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,720
What exactly do you want to do?

212
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,580
I...

213
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,220
You open a restaurant,

214
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,700
and I'm not allowed to come and eat?

215
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,620
You don't like my cooking at all.

216
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,460
Is that right?

217
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,380
What exactly is your purpose?

218
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,130
What do you want to do with Hua Su?

219
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,940
I just like your cooking.

220
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,780
What's wrong?

221
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,380
Are you still lying there?

222
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,100
- Do you think...?
- Mr. Shu, let's go.

223
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,140
There are many people here.

224
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,740
Put on your mask. Let's go.

225
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,510
The Black and White Darers
without tasting the food online

226
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,300
are Mr. Shu and Lin Chuxiao?

227
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,140
Yes, they even dressed like that
to come and eat.

228
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,660
I just can't figure it out.

229
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,800
How can they be so embarrassed

230
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,020
about coming to eat at Hua Su?

231
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,580
I should call and ask him.

232
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,780
Stop.

233
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,900
Lin Chuxiao

234
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,940
was forced to come here by Shu Zhengyan.

235
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,940
It's no use calling to ask.

236
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,140
I'm wondering

237
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,740
if Mr. Shu likes you.

238
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,260
He wants to flirt with you.

239
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,100
Stop talking nonsense, will you?

240
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,700
Think about it.

241
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,740
He clearly dislikes your cooking.

242
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,260
Yet he goes to Hua Su every day.

243
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,380
Moreover,

244
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,620
he is still in the CEO probation period.

245
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,940
There are so many eyes
in the company watching him.

246
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,420
He doesn't go to the company,

247
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,100
but comes to eat your cooking.

248
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,720
If this isn't true love,
then what is it?

249
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,500
He wants to force me to sell Hua Su.

250
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,500
Are you silly?

251
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,740
He comes to Hua Su to eat.

252
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,300
Then Hua Su can earn more money.

253
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,570
How could it possibly close down?

254
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,620
He just likes you.

255
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,300
I understand the mind
of this kind of man best.

256
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:41,940
Really?

257
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,700
First, he wants you
to be his private chef.

258
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,220
Then he disguises himself
to come and eat.

259
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,420
By doing this,

260
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,100
he aims to get close to you.

261
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,420
So what should we do?

262
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,580
What?

263
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,340
CEO,

264
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,580
the CEO is pursuing you.

265
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,300
Do you want to try?

266
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,140
Try what?

267
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,020
Although

268
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,140
Mr. Shu has not officially
become the CEO yet,

269
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,980
he is young and promising,

270
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,780
handsome and wealthy.

271
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,220
Besides,
it's time for you to start dating.

272
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,820
No wonder he asked you
to stay at his house.

273
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,660
And you couldn't cook.

274
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,540
He even paid you a salary every day.

275
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,180
He is really good to you.

276
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,820
I'm so envious.

277
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,260
That's not right.

278
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,500
Is he trying to keep you as a mistress?

279
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,980
No need to order dishes today.

280
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,980
We've already eaten.

281
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,420
Come here with me.

282
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,700

You, the CEO of Bo Fei Group,

318

Yet you keep going to Hua Su every day.

321
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,660

Why don't we just go along with it?

323
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,540
You pursue her.

324
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,420
First,

325
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,580
if you win her over,
you won't have to worry

326
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,700
about any more health issues.

327
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,820
Second,

00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,300
when she becomes your girlfriend,

329
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,700

He didn't ask me
to do this kind of thing.

we should win with integrity.

up to now,

367
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,460
Hua Su Restaurant still hasn't
signed a contract with us.

368
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,900

370
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,380

371
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,160

the settlement of top-tier restaurants
in the future.

373
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,860
Mr. Shu,

374
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,020
you know this best.

375
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,940
You show up at Hua Su at this time

376
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,300
and promote it so vigorously.

377
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,540
Are you trying to acquire it

378
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,180
or open a branch for it?

379
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,980
You better not let down the Chairman

380
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,660
and all the shareholders who trust you.

381
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,380
You must give us an explanation.

382
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,460
Alright,

383
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,300
then I'll give you an explanation.

384
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,540
I am pursuing Fang Meng.

385
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,140
Are you pursuing the landlady of Hua Su?

386
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,580
Yes.

387
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,260
As an executive of the Bo Fei Group,

388
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,460
you should be aware of your position.

389
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,100
And you also know

390
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,100
Hua Su Restaurant

391
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,140
is currently in conflict
with our company's project.

392
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,740
Rest assured,

393
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,500
I, Shu Zhengyan,

394
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,580
will never take my job away

395
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,080
from my affection.

396
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,170
No, actually, this matter...

397
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,820
I do have the freedom to date, right?

398
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,300
As long as
I can successfully acquire Hua Su,

399
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,940
it's none of your business

400
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,740
who I fall in love with, right?

401
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,580
Mr. Shu,

402
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,580
I previously advised you to pursue her,

403
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,620
but you disagreed.

404
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,300
Yet you turned around
and said it yourself.

405
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,940
Could it be that you

406
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,580
really have fallen for her?

407
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,100
Is it because of the dishes she cooks?

408
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,660
Our visit to Hua Su has been exposed.

409
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,810
How should I explain this?

410
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,420
Should I tell them

411
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,900
that I have schizophrenia

412
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,060
and must eat her cooking

413
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,420
to maintain my health?

414
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,940
That definitely won't work.

415
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,100
If you say that,
you'll have to resign immediately.

416
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,540
If you leave our company,

417
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,860
the Chairman will then...

418
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,700
What else can I say

419
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,740
besides this?

420
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,260
Are we still going?

421
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,500
Where?

422
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,020
Hua Su.

423
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,860
Mr. Shu,

424
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,340
as for this matter,

425
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,580
it will eventually
reach the Chairman's ears.

426
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,800
He's still mad at you

427
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,640
for the Black and White Darers
without tasting the food.

428
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,380
And do you think he'll forgive you

429
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,020
if he knows about this?

430
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,380
Forget it. Let's not think about it.

431
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,140
When you mentioned my dad,

432
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,060
I suddenly remembered

433
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,500
another thing he told me.

434
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,740
Let's go.

435
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,860
Mr. Shu,

436
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,300
why do you look so nervous?

437
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,740
I'm not nervous but scared.

438
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,380
Who exactly are we picking up?

439
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,140
A cousin of mine.

440
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,060
Cousin?

441
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,340
What's so scary about a cousin?

442
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,820
This cousin of mine

443
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,340
has been pampered since childhood,

444
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,460
causing trouble everywhere.

445
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,700
The whole family spoils her.

446
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,420
Every time I see her, I get a headache.

447
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,100
If my dad hadn't asked me to come,

448
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,570
I really wouldn't want to pick her up.

449
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,100
She is just a rich young lady.

450
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,060
Is it really that exaggerated?

451
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,420
It's much more exaggerated than that.

452
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,940
Today, I'm a fairy who missed
the Queen Mother's Peach Banquet

453
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,420
and had to descend to earth,

454
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,460
Shen An'an.

455
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,980
Brother Zhengyan, long time no see.

456
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,780
