31
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,540
Do you still have any dishes
you haven't taught me?

32
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,060
Teach me a few more.

33
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,860
I'm starting to feel like
I'm unnecessary.

34
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,060
Maybe Fang Meng got close to you

35
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,860
because of me.

36
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,020
But you know,

37
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,180
people

38
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,340
come together

39
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,260
for all kinds of reasons.

40
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,700
The lyrics say,

41
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,740
this is love,

42
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,740
it can't really be explained.

43
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,900
I'm just unsure

44
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,780
whether the person Fang Meng likes

45
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,820
is really me.

46
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,060
You'll know the answer soon.

47
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,220
What does that mean?

48
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,460
I have to go.

49
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,260
Where are you going?

50
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,860
Where am I going?

51
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,540
Wherever I'm supposed to go.

52
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,100
To heaven, or to the underworld.

53
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,300
I'll go where I need to go.

54
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,620
You can just be yourself then.

55
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,780
Thank you.

56
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,900
Thank me?

57
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,340
I've been asked

58
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,820
to act like another person.

59
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,740
This is the first time someone's told me

60
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,420
to be myself.

61
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,420
I think Fang Meng will definitely

62
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,860
live a happy and fulfilling life

63
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,020
with you guys accompanying her.

64
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,660
I haven't thanked you yet.

65
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,140
Then should I tell her

66
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:44,900
about this now?

67
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,660
(Hua Su)

68
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,460
This is a new dish I've developed.

69
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,620
It's called the Gemini Comets.

70
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,300
Guess what it's made of?

71
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,740
What?

72
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,140
Take a guess first.

73
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,540
I can't guess.

74
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,020
Well, call my dad out,

75
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,300
let him guess too.

76
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,140
I have to go.

77
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,580
Hurry, they're asking for the dishes.

78
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,820
Quickly, quickly!

79
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,900
OK, we'll talk later.

80
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,740
I'm coming.

81
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,590
Because of your
one-sided version of the story

82
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,060
and now we've lost Hua Su.

83
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,900
Now all the comments online

84
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,060
are saying that Bo Fei Group
has manipulated things

85
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,580
to take Hua Su's spot.

86
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,940
As the president of the company,

87
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,700
you must take responsibility
for your actions.

88
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,970
And regarding your stealing of
Shu Zhengyan's medical records

89
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,020
and malicious competition,

90
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,780
the relevant authorities
have sent people to investigate.

91
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,390
You can just wait
for the consequences.

92
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,220
I'll be responsible.

93
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:02,900
I'll be responsible.

94
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,420
I'll be responsible!

95
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,140
This...

96
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,060
(Hello to all the listeners tuning in.)

97
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,490
(Have you been following
the latest updates)

98
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,140
(on the Zelda Comet?)

99
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,340
(If nothing unexpected happens,)

100
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,300
(in less than two hours,)

101
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,300
(the last comet of Gemini Comets)

102
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,180
(will arrive.)

103
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,460
(Have you all)

104
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,340
(prepared for)

105
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,340
(the end of this)

106
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,780
(two-month-long miraculous journey?)

107
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,380
Meng,

108
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,100
I'm about to get off work.

109
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,340
Alright.

110
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,340
Mr. Shu. I'll leave now.

111
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,580
You can come a little later tomorrow.

112
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,820
It'll give you more time to rest.

113
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,660
Go.

114
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,700
Don't worry, tomorrow
I will come on time.

115
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,860
Recently, there's been
a lot of news about this comet.

116
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,660
Do you think, with the situation
between you and my dad,

117
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,060
there might be others like you?

118
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,300
I think

119
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,780
Dazui is in the same situation.

120
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,940
He used to be lazy,

121
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,180
always late and leaving early.

122
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,540
Now, not only has he
become more diligent,

123
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,140
but sometimes he even
volunteers to work overtime.

124
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,780
And Xie Jun,

125
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,020
who used to be so refined,

126
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,860
now is...

127
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,260
And Lin Chuxiao,

128
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,020
he's pairing up with Gao Ying,

129
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,180
even wearing couple outfits.

130
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,820
He wouldn't have been like this before.

131
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,900
It's like they've all changed.

132
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,820
By that logic,

133
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,340
you've changed too.

134
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,100
Me?

135
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,300
I've always been like this.

136
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,540
You've become an outstanding chef.

137
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,100
Actually,

138
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,340
there's another person inside me.

139
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,700
Fang Meng.

140
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,740
She is inside me,

141
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,180
giving me strange instructions,

142
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,060
making me cook bad dishes.

143
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,420
The truth is,

144
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,820
I was always talented,

145
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,540
but because she was in control,

146
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,940
I didn't seem that great.

147
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,580
Now that she's gone,

148
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,020
you all are seeing

149
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,260
the real me.

150
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,420
Fang Meng,

151
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,420
I have something to tell you.

152
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,340
Fang Meng,

153
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,420
I tried the dishes you made.

154
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,860
They taste really good.

155
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,260
In the future, Hua Su

156
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,100
will definitely expand globally.

157
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,540
Fang Meng,

158
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,060
don't be too sad.

159
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,300
I'll take over your body for now.

160
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,740
Let me.

161
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,500
Look,

162
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,980
I'm telling you,

163
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,420
knife skills are important.

164
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,220
Look, you're cutting unevenly.

165
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,380
How's anyone supposed to eat that?

166
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:20,980
And the spring onions,

167
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,580
if you wait any longer,

168
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,140
they'll burn.

169
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,860
Actually,

170
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,100
I should have left a while ago.

171
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,200
Staying for a couple more months

172
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,780
is good,

173
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,340
at least I can leave in peace.

174
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,580
Most people don't get

175
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,900
this kind of farewell opportunity.

176
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,860
I must have accumulated
a lot of good karma.

177
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,500
Do you want to try a bite?

178
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,980
I've seen many people
eating my dishes,

179
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,060
some are happy,

180
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,380
some are rushing,

181
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,820
some even feel like throwing up.

182
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,940
But every time,
you secretly try my food.

183
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,420
I've never seen your expression

184
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,820
when you taste my dishes.

185
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,180
Since you're here,
why don't you try a bite?

186
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,180
Is it good?

187
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,300
It's good.

188
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,740
I'm going to a faraway place.

189
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,900
In this life, I've done good deeds,

190
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,020
so I'm sure I'll go to a good place.

191
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,380
I don't care where you're going.

192
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,460
You can't leave.

193
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,580
I really miss you every day.

194
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,020
You can't do this.

195
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,140
You can't come and go

196
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,820
as you wish.

197
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,700
If you leave, what will I do?

198
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,900
What will happen to Hua Su?

199
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,820
You can't leave us again.

200
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,300
Don't go.

201
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,020
I've already messed up Hua Su once.

202
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,420
If you don't come back,

203
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,940
there won't be a new Hua Su.

204
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,060
I wouldn't have learned to cook at all.

205
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,300
Dad,

206
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,620
since you have a way to come back,

207
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,940
then you must
have a way to stay, right?

208
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,940
You must have a way.

209
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,980
Don't leave, okay?

210
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,660
Please, I beg you.

211
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,660
Don't leave.

212
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,700
Don't leave, I'm begging you.

213
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,420
Don't leave.

214
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,740
You're awake.

215
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,540
Fang Meng,

216
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,340
are you okay?

217
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,780
I just...

218
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,220
I just don't know
how to make this dish.

219
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,820
Mr. Shu,

220
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,380
look who's here.

221
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,340
Mr. Shu.

222
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,860
Mr. Shu.

223
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,140
Mr. Shu.

224
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,220
It's true that someone interfered,

225
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,860
causing us

226
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,380
to misunderstand you.

227
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,060
But now

228
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,540
things are clear.

229
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:36,980
We,

230
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,220
on behalf of the board,

231
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,300
would like to apologize to you.

232
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,540
Yes, yes.

233
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,340
Right now, Bo Fei Group

234
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,540
is in the toughest period.

235
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,860
We need you back.

236
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,370
I believe

237
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,660
Chairman Shu would
really want you to return.

238
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:53,980
Yes.

239
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:56,980
Mr. Shu.

240
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,780
I said it. Evil can't win over good.

241
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,100
Look, one by one,

242
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,490
they're all coming back
to beg you now, right?

243
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,060
Then let's strike while the iron's hot.

244
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,740
How about returning next Monday?

245
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,740
You go back first,

246
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,200
I'll take some time to calm down.

247
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,460
Okay.

248
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,620
Eat something first.

249
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,420
I saw you haven't eaten all day.

250
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,260
Are you hungry?

251
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,100
I'm not hungry.

252
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,420
You go ahead and eat.

253
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,460
In the past,

254
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,220
no matter what I made,

255
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,140
you would always eat it.

256
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,540
I'm sorry,

257
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,860
I was just thinking other things.

258
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,100
I'll eat now.

259
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,100
Can I ask you a question?

260
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,100
If

261
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,300
my dad wasn't here,

262
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,500
would you like the dishes I made?

263
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,300
If your dad wasn't here,

264
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,020
would you like me?

265
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,900
Actually, I think

266
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,300
all of that doesn't matter.

267
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,060
Let the past go.

268
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,140
What matters is that you like it now.

269
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,660
Do you still like it now?

270
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,060
Well, these dishes

271
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,700
weren't taught by me.

272
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,460
During this time,

273
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,460
I've troubled you a lot,

274
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,820
Fang Meng. I didn't mean anything else.

275
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,740
In the future, no one
will force you to do things,

276
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,820
and no one will force you

277
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,060
to eat dishes you don't like.

278
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,140
Fang Meng...

279
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,620
Our restaurant

280
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,140
is about to close.

281
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,740
I heard

282
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,620
the company has asked you
to come back.

283
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,300
Yes.

284
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,180
What are your thoughts?

285
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,700
I know you want me to return,

286
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,540
but...

287
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,580
I don't want you to return.

288
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,180
You've grown up,

289
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:25,900
and I've always had

290
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,580
one expectation of you,

291
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,260
to make you

292
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,500
someone like me.

293
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,540
But after being in the hospital
for a while,

294
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,460
especially after Fang Meng came,

295
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,060
I've realized a lot of things.

296
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,820
I've overdone it.

297
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,500
I've participated

298
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,460
too much in your growth.

299
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,460
From now on,

300
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,580
your life path

301
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,020
is up to you to decide.

302
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,740
Whatever you choose,

303
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,980
I'll support you.

304
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,740
Well,

305
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,780
you can't live your life

306
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,700
always in my shadow,

307
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,700
like I'm inside your body,

308
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,540
controlling you at all times.

309
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,060
You can't be yourself then, right?

310
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,180
It's okay now,

311
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,140
but what if, in the future, I'm gone?

312
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,340
Dad,

313
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,820
I want to return to Bo Fei.

314
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,140
You really don't have
to think about me.

315
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,580
This is my decision.

316
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,980
Do you have any lollipops?

317
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,500
Starting over

318
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,020

Hello everyone, this is Miracle Radio.

338
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,820
I'm Lun.

339
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,100
I'm Li.

340
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,820
Today we've invited

341
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,580
Professor Chen, the famous astronomer.

342
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,420
Professor Chen, hello.

343
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,740
Lun, Li.

344
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,660
Hello.

345
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,780
We've received many
submissions from netizens.

346
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,340
Many listeners have told me

347
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,180
they've experienced

348
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,140
many magical things
during the two months

349
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,820
when Gemini Comets appeared.

350
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,500
- Mr. Shu, listen.
- We'd also like to represent

351
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,990
- Talking about the comets again.
- our audience

352
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:35,940
to ask Professor Chen,

353
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,740
does this Gemini Comet Miracle

354
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,780
really exist?

355
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,300
Is there any scientific explanation?

356
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,100
This definitely does not exist.

357
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,820
The so-called miraculous things

358
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,500
are actually just psychological effects.

359
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,100
Comets are actually

360
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,540
a normal astronomical phenomenon.

361
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,380
Remember not to overinterpret it.

362
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,500
The so-called Gemini Comet Miracle

363
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,660
is just a gimmick

364
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,980
for entertainment.

365
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,380
Are you going back?

366
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,900
Anyway, my restaurant is already in.

367
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,540
The mission is complete.

368
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,900
I should be leaving too.

369
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,820
Thank you for taking care of me
during this time.

370
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,380
I've heard about what happened

371
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,460
between you and Fang Meng.

372
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,340
You went to see her?

373
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,300
Now I can rest easy.

374
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,820
I think

375
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,780
she will definitely be
better than me in the future.

376
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,900
Is something bothering you?

377
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,100
I don't know how to face her.

378
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,300
What do you need to face?

379
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,700
If it weren't for Master Pi,

380
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,780
I could never have
eaten the food she made

381
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,700
and taught her how to cook.

382
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,260
This was all caused by Master Pi,

383
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,780
mot me.

384
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,620
We are like

385
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,540
ingredients that could
never be cooked together.

386
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,620
The forcibly added seasoning

387
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,700
covered our original flavors,

388
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,060
only then do we
barely resemble a dish.

389
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,420
Only the person who eats this dish

390
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,940
knows the true taste

391
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,940
of the two ingredients

392
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,980
combined together.

393
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,100
Have you ever thought

394
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,940
that the so-called seasoning

395
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,780
has never existed at all?

396
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,180
What do you mean?

397
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,340
You told me that
Pi Zijie exists inside you,

398
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,980
did you never consider

399
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,380
that Pi Zijie never existed at all?

400
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,020
Impossible.

401
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,820
He definitely existed.

402
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,260
Otherwise, how could I
have eaten Fang Meng's food?

403
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,220
Because of your schizophrenia.

404
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,660
Your father's and
the shareholders' expectations

405
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,780
forced you to sit
in the president's position.

406
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,060
I put all my chips on the line

407
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,020
to push you to where you are now.

408
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,580
Don't let me down.

409
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,540
This enormous psychological pressure

410
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,360
almost drove you to a mental breakdown.

411
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,520
(Medical Diagnosis Certificate)
So

412
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,960
(A split personality caused by pressure)
you developed a split personality.

413
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,660
There's nothing wrong with your body.

414
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,740
You fainted possibly because of

415
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,550
the mental pressure
from your new President position.

416
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,320
If you're truly
experiencing hallucinations,

417
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,460
maybe it's a mental disorder

418
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,980
caused by excessive pressure.

419
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,660
Deal.

420
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,020
If this is really the case,

421
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,180
could your meeting with Fang Meng

422
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,260
have another explanation?

423
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,020
You originally liked
the food Fang Meng made,

424
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,060
but you were unwilling to admit it.

425
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,060
But Fang Meng really did attract you.

426
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,140
You kept looking for her

427
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,980
until you fell in love with her.

428
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,940
But because of the company,

429
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,620
because of the pressure
from your father,

430
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,700
you've developed
a retreating mindset inside.

431
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,660
You have to give us an explanation.

432
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,940
From the very beginning, you thought

433
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,260
that you and Fang Meng
could never be together.

434
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,980
What about Pi Zijie?

435
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,500
He's the second personality you created

436
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,900
to escape your true self.

437
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,940
The so-called miraculous things

438
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,580
are actually just psychological effects.

439
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,220
Comets are actually

440
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,660
a normal astronomical phenomenon.

441
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,420
Remember not to overinterpret it.

442
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,020
Of course,

443
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,780
these are just my guesses.

444
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,940
Only you know

445
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,180
what the real situation is.

446
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,500
I'm telling you this

447
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,540
just to tell you

448
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,940
it's all the same
whether Pi Zijie existed or not.

449
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,580
The memories between
you and Fang Meng

450
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,940
always intersect somewhere.

451
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,100
If those memories remain,

452
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,940
then everything is in place.

453
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,420

454
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,580
does it even matter to you?

459

You're here at this early hour.

460
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:37,940
Of course.

461
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:38,980
Have you had breakfast?

462
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,340
Not yet.

463
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,380
I'm going to the kitchen later

464
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,500
to see if there's anything to eat.

465
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,460
You should've said it earlier,
so I could bring some for you.

466
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,980
I've already eaten six buns.

467
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,780
But to be honest,

468
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,420
the dishes in our restaurant
are really popular.

469
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,180
Of course.

470
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,060
We need to prepare more of these.

471
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,860
Meng,

472
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,180
we've been so busy,

473
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,260
but why hasn't Mr. Shu

474
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,300
come to help out these days?

475
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,700

476
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,180
Well,

477
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,580

preparing the dishes yet.

478
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,780
I need to go and help out.

479
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,260
No...

480
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,260
Fang Meng, have you heard?

481
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,500
Hua Su,

482
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,820
your old restaurant,

00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,100
is currently under renovation.

484
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,140
I don't know who moved in.

485
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,340

Let's go and take a look.

489
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,140

492
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,500
I heard that this restaurant

493
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,860
was just demolished
a couple of days ago.

494
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,340
Right, wasn't it demolished?

495
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,740

561
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,860
All of this

562
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,900
is the Hua Su in my memory.

563
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,220
Isn't this the same as before?

564
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,780
We need a chef here.

565
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,340
Would you be willing to come back?

566
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,460
So, have you made up your mind?

567
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,620
Is it true

568
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,500
that you really like my cooking?

569
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,780
Haven't I always liked it?

570
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,220
You're lying.

571
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,220
Who knows if this line

572
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,820
was taught to you by someone.

573

(Loving Father, Pi Zijie,

574
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,060
Dad,

575
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,420
Hua Su has reopened.

576
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,460
Do you think he can see this?

577
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,340
Of course he can.

578
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,820
The past two months felt like a dream.

579
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,820
It feels like it existed

580
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,220
and it also feels like it never existed.

581
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,140
Maybe those two comets

582
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,500
really made us dream.

583
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,980
I wish this dream could last forever.

584
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,060
The food is here.

585
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,740
So sumptuous!

586
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,020
Try it.

587
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,740
This is something I just made.

588
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,820
Try it, see if it tastes good.

589
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,820
Alright, hold on.

590
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,020
Let me feed you one first.

591
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,740
This is delicious.

592
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,260
I can't taste it anyway.

593
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,500
I'll eat it.

594
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,380
I think I can taste it now.

595
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,180
You...

596
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,140
Why is this so spicy?

597
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,140
Spicy?

598
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,100
You can really taste it now!

599
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,340
Has my sense of taste

600
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,380
come back?

601
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,380
Try this one too.

602
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,700
No, this is too spicy.

603
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:13,980
But

604
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,420
does this count as a miracle?

605
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,060
Just like your comet.

606
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,100
How can it be the same as the comet?

607
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,100
The professor said it's all fake.

608
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,300
I wish it were true.

609
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,980
Maybe next time
when the comet comes,

610
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,700
my dad will come back.

611
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,460
There aren't that many
comets in this world.

612
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,260
If you could taste it, eat more.

613
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,240
Come on, come on.

614
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,180
Look, what's that?

615
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,340
Is it a comet?

616
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,720
Fang Meng.

617
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,900
Fang Meng, are you okay?

618
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,260

620
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,980
