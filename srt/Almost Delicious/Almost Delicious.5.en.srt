31
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,780
Mr. Shu,

32
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,080
through various tests on your brain,

33
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,880
you've been ruled out

34
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,320
as a mental disorder

35
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,560
due to an organic brain disease.

36
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,480
From your EEG results,

37
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,080
your alpha wave basilic rhythm is
somewhat unstable,

38
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,560
indicating a mild abnormality.

39
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,860
This may be caused

40
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,360
by excessive mental stress

41
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,160
or other reasons.

42
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,360
Whether you're schizophrenic or not,

43
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,840
I suggest you

44
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,470
consider transferring to psychiatry

45
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,000
for a face diagnosis with a specialist.

46
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,980
Only people with mental issues

47
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,480
should go to psychiatry.

48
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,720
I shouldn't go.

49
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,220
Everything I said is true.

50
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,400
You should trust me.

51
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,340
How about this?

52
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,200
Mr. Shu,

53
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,710
since you are unwilling
to transfer to psychiatry,

54
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,900
come to my place one day

55
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,660
and I'll personally help you
with the test.

56
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,260
(ICU)

57
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,000
Is he alright?

58
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,720
There's no physical danger.

59
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,740
I was scared to death.

60
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,320
I almost got swindled by him.

61
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,300
Fang Meng,

62
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,840
how did you get to know Mr. Shu?

63
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,160
It's a long story.

64
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,420
But ever since I met him,

65
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,180
I've been quite unlucky.

66
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,060
I originally wanted
to be his private chef

67
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,360
to earn some money.

68
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,020
But before I even got to cook a meal,

69
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,360
this kind of thing happened.

70
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,260
It appears

71
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,560
that I can't be his chef either.

72
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,800
Are you Mr. Shu's chef now?

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,040
He specifically came to the restaurant
to invite me.

74
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,020
Did he taste the dishes you made?

75
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,920
Of course.

76
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,620
But I can't figure out

77
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,760
whether he really likes
the dishes I make.

78
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,120
As for him,

79
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,780
sometimes,

80
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,280
he is really like a mental illness.

81
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,340
Doctor Xie,
the director is looking for you.

82
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,500
I'll go out for a moment.

83
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,680
Wait for me here.

84
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,660
Go ahead.

85
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,940
(Disease Diagnosis Certificate
for Shu Zhengyan)

86
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,800
(Diagnosis: Possible schizoid personality
due to excessive mental stress.)

87
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,320
Regarding Shu Zhengyan,

88
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,320
are you really planning
to give up like this?

89
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,720
This is the best way for you
to repay your debt.

90
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,300
And last time you also said

91
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,080
you wanted him to teach you how to cook.

92
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,400
Can I ask you a question?

93
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,440
If

94
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,380
you find out your boss is sick,
what would you do?

95
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,760
Are you referring to Shu Zhengyan?

96
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,460
As for him,

97
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,600
he is indeed somewhat moody,

98
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,020
almost like having a mental illness.

99
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,860
Yes!

100
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,500
It's a mental illness.

101
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,560
How do you know?

102
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,080
Are you saying he has a mental illness?

103
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,680
How could I dare

104
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,240
to work under someone like him?

105
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,060
How did you find out?

106
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,900
I...

107
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,200
Could it be from eating your food?

108
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,940
We can't afford
to compensate this big boss.

109
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,140
I suddenly remembered

110
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,720
something Lin Chuxiao told me.

111
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,820
What is it?

112
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,960
Do you still remember

113
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,960
that tale
about the Gemini Comet Miracle?

114
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,640
But isn't that just superstition?

115
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,020
Anyway, Lin Chuxiao told me

116
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,860
that ever since Shu Zhengyan collapsed

117
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,340
and fainted last time,

118
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,280
he has become particularly strange.

119
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,940
Lin Chuxiao also said

120
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,780
your Mr. Shu

121
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,680
is eating my food and going crazy.

122
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,460
It's different.

123
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,640
This possibility is greater.

124
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,200
Anyway, he is someone

125
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,860
who is extremely picky
about gourmet food.

126
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,650
But do you remember I told you last time

127
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,220
he was picking through bins for food?

128
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,960
I said he has a mental illness.

129
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,160
Didn't you say

130
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,220
that the Gaga Food Street project

131
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,500
is also his responsibility?

132
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,760
It's Saige.

133
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,750
This is a food street developed
by our company,

134
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,820
called Saige Food Street.

135
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,100
We plan to acquire all the shops here

136
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,340
and also introduce

137
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,140
some famous star-rated restaurants.

138
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,620
Shu Zhengyan has been

139
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,360
extremely busy with this matter
every day.

140
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,660
Moreover, this matter

141
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,500
must be completed within a month.

142
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,680
Otherwise, his position as CEO
might be in jeopardy.

143
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,080
Please don't tell anyone about this.

144
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,040
I found this out secretly.

145
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,700
As for exploring gourmet food,

146
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,300
why does he keep coming here every day?

147
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,280
Is this place fine too?

148
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:22,940
I'm leaving.

149
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,120
I finally understand,

150
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,460
Shu Zhengyan didn't hire me
as a private chef

151
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,560
because my cooking is delicious.

152
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,360
You finally understand.

153
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,280
I'm not talking about this.

154
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,500
I mean he hired me as a private chef.

155
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,510
In essence, it was to transfer me
away from Hua Su.

156
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,180
This way, Hua Su couldn't operate.

157
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,360
No wonder

158
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,300
he wanted me to stay at his house
for 24 hours one day.

159
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,700
And he didn't even let me cook.

160
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,500
This is like the boiling frog
in warm water.

161
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,900
You see.

162
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,860
He pays me a salary to support me.

163
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,760
Gradually,

164
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,080
I have to put Hua Su aside,

165
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,460
and then he'll find
the right opportunity

166
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,540
to induce me to sell Hua Su.

167
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,760
His plan would succeed.

168
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,960
When you put it that way,

169
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,100
it does make some sense.

170
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,700
I'm really furious.

171
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,680
I almost got fooled.

172
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,880
So what do you plan to do?

173
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,760
What to do?

174
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,280
Fight back.

175
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,640
Manager An, you're here.

176
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,440
How is Mr. Shu's recovery going,
Chuxiao?

177
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,680
Much better.

178
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,500
Come sit.

179
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:48,980
Chuxiao,

180
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,280
how long have you been with our company?

181
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,700
Since graduation,

182
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,000
almost four years, I think.

183
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,520
Do you feel happy working

184
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,400
as an assistant to Shu Zhengyan?

185
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,480
There's nothing particularly
happy or unhappy about it.

186
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,400
It's just a job, after all.

187
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,280
Let me ask in another way.

188
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,200
Do you think working under Shu Zhengyan

189
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,720
has a promising future?

190
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,380
Manager An,

191
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,280
I don't quite understand what you mean.

192
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,120
Come over and help me.

193
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,960
Two years.

194
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,500
In two years,

195
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,280
I'll let you sit in my position.

196
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,000
I don't think I can.

197
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,600
Think it over carefully.

198
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,760
By the way, send my regards to Mr. Shu.

199
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,000
I'll be leaving now.

200
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,080
Lin Chuxiao, where is he?

201
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,240
How coincidental, young lady,

202
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,250
are you here for a checkup too?

203
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,550
- This way, please.
- I don't need one.

204
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,600
I'm asking where's Shu Zhengyan.

205
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,640
It's comfortable to have a medical checkup,
very comfortable.

206
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,220
- I'll take you there.
- Are you...?

207
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,080
Are you Miss Fang Meng from Hua Su?

208
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,080
Who are you?

209
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,680
You wouldn't happen to know our Mr. Shu,
Shu Zhengyan, would you?

210
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,480
She doesn't know him.

211
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,330
Are you all teaming up to deceive me?

212
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,950
Tricking me
into becoming a private chef.

213
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,600
Stop talking.

214
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,700
Fine,

215
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,180
I won't talk to you.

216
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,160
Where is Shu Zhengyan?

217
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:27,900
Miss Fang,

218
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,210
you must have something to discuss

219
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,660
with our Mr. Shu, right?

220
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,500
In that case,

221
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,340
tell me what do you need

222
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,900
and I'll find a way to solve it for you.

223
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,080
What do I have to say to you?

224
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,440
Fang Meng.

225
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,160
Xie Jun, you're just in time.

226
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,080
Where is Shu Zhengyan?

227
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,300
I have something to discuss with him.

228
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,840
Come with me first.

229
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,380
Xie Jun, why are you pulling me?

230
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,680
Where is Shu Zhengyan?

231
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,720
Don't pull me. Just tell me.

232
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,880
Fang Meng, calm down.

233
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,240
What exactly is going on?

234
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,860
He's being too much of a bully.

235
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,630
He tricked me
into becoming his private chef.

236
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,260
But it was actually
to bring down Hua Su.

237
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,940
He did many other things, but...

238
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,720
Fang Meng, take your time to explain.

239
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,200
I can't understand.

240
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,000
Then let me ask you a question.

241
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,780
You must tell the truth.

242
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,920
Is my cooking delicious?

243
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,180
It's not delicious, right?

244
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,280
I know it myself.

245
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,380
But he said it's delicious.

246
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,720
He even asked me to be his private chef.

247
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,380
He wanted me to live in his house.

248
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,500
But everything he did

249
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,680
was to deceive me into giving up Hua Su

250
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,840
because he thought

251
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,080
we would affect the reputation of
his food street.

252
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,140
However,

253
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,800
I have interacted with Mr. Shu,

254
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,990
and he doesn't seem like
that kind of person.

255
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,800
That's because you are too kind-hearted.

256
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,540
You don't know

257
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,620
that for the sake of profit,

258
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,260
some people can do anything.

259
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,220
Shu Zhengyan is just like that. He...

260
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,520
You're right.

261
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:57,860
Mr. Shu.

262
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,260
How dare you show up here?

263
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,600
Why shouldn't I dare?

264
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,620
Yes,

265
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,940
I am indeed doing it for profit.

266
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,540
I am developing the food street,

267
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,280
bringing gourmet food here.

268
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,370
It is not only
the development need of the company,

269
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,070
but also the development need
of this city.

270
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,220
So what you mean is

271
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,300
that the shops originally located in
the food street

272
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,340
are not worthy of appearing
in your new food street.

273
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,900
We have differences in gourmet food.

274
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,360
I don't want to debate this with you.

275
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,660
I don't want to talk so much with you,

276
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,800
you mental illness.

277
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,660
If you're sick, just go see a doctor.

278
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,760
Don't be the CEO or run the food street.

279
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,900
Who are you calling the mental illness?

280
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,960
Still deceiving.

281
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,600
I've already seen it.

282
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,660
Do you know you're invading my privacy?

283
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,100
You tricked me first.

284
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,590
I'm going to tell the people
in your company.

285
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,160
You, the CEO, are just mentally ill.

286
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:51,980
Go ahead.

287
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,520
You can't threaten me.

288
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,620
Mr. Shu, I'm sorry.

289
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,840
I'll go check what's going on.

290
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,600
Mr. Shu, what's wrong with you?

291
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,080
Are you okay, Mr. Shu?

292
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,120
Fang Meng took a photo
of my case report.

293
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,680
What?

294
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,360
What exactly were you discussing
on the rooftop just now?

295
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,580
I think I just saw An Zhijiang.

296
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,040
He also came down from the rooftop.

297
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,920
Could he have overheard
your conversation?

298
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,880
He went there too?

299
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,200
Almost over.

300
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,240
He must have heard it.

301
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,300
What should we do then?

302
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,620
He will definitely
make a big deal out of this.

303
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,880
- Then...
- It's fine.

304
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,020
Even if An Zhijiang heard
our conversation,

305
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:05,920
it's fine.

306
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,940
He doesn't have
any substantial evidence.

307
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,440
Based solely on his words,

308
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,460
the Board of Directors will not
make things difficult for me.

309
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,980
Notify the Public Relations Department

310
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,720
to closely monitor Fang Meng's
actions and words online.

311
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,380
Come up with corresponding strategies
in the shortest possible time.

312
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,220
We must ensure
that the impact of this matter

313
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,760
is minimized to the smallest extent.

314
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,620
However,

315
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,080
what if An Zhijiang goes
to find Fang Meng?

316
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,140
Gao Ying.

317
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,660
Gao Ying, why are you here?

318
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,600
Let's go.

319
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,960
Come on, everyone,
the dishes are being served now.

320
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,260
You're not really going to send out
our boss's case report, are you?

321
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,040
Is it only allowed for him
to deceive me?

322
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,500
I just don't want others

323
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,320
to be deceived
by this mental illness as well.

324
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,260
If you really do this,

325
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,900
then Shu Zhengyan's position as CEO

326
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,140
will truly be untenable.

327
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,140
It's better if he doesn't.

328
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,040
No, it's not.

329
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,560
My main point is,

330
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,780
what about our Lin Chuxiao?

331
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,700
Wouldn't he be unemployed?

332
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,640
Even if Shu Zhengyan can't be the CEO,

333
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,660
the Saige Food Street plan

334
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,280
will still proceed as usual.

335
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,560
Stop trying to persuade me.

336
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,600
Hello, welcome!

337
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,100
How many?

338
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,680
Clear the area.

339
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,700
What?

340
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,340
Clear...

341
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,320
Thank you, boss. Thank you.

342
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,600
Sir, is there anything you need?

343
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,280
Gao Ying?

344
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,340
Manager An.

345
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,600
No, why are you here?

346
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,140
Don't you need to return to the company?

347
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,800
I...

348
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,020
Miss,

349
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,180
the food you packed is ready.

350
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,040
I'll get it for you.

351
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,300
Alright, thank you.

352
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,440
Thank you.

353
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,480
Sorry to keep you waiting.

354
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,080
Alright, okay.

355
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,720
Goodbye, Manager An.

356
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,000
Eat less.
You seem to have gained weight lately.

357
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,020
Sir, this is the kitchen.

358
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,440
Do you have any business here?

359
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,680
Miss Fang,

360
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,080
please allow me
to introduce myself first.

361
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,080
I am An Zhijiang,
the Deputy General Manager of Bo Fei Group.

362
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,900
I am here

363
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,360
to discuss a deal with you.

364
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,680
What kind of deal?

365
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,420
Our Manager An wants
to buy a secret from you.

366
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,200
A secret?

367
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,680
Miss Fang,

368
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,240
I won't beat around the bush with you.

369
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,880
I want the photo in your phone.

370
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,840
Meng, what photo?

371
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,520
How could I possibly
have the photo you want?

372
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,120
The photo of Shu Zhengyan.

373
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,980
Hello?

374
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,820
Hello?

375
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,400
Where are you?

376
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,620
An Zhijiang came
to find Fang Meng again.

377
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,600
What?

378
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,600
You first calm Fang Meng down.

379
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,880
I'll hurry to inform Mr. Shu.

380
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,420
How can I calm her?

381
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,320
You know Fang Meng's temper.

382
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,480
Besides, An Zhijiang is still here.

383
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,480
Mr. Shu, let's go.

384
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,500
What?

385
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,820
Mr. Shu,

386
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,120
An Zhijiang really went
to find Fang Meng.

387
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,640
He is really going
to get the evidence?

388
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,520
Let's go quickly.

389
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,620
Where to go?

390
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,820
Go to Hua Su to find Fang Meng.

391
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,180
We must stop An Zhijiang.

392
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,920
We can't let Fang Meng
give him the photo.

393
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,360
Don't you have any other way?

394
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,630
I am a dignified CEO.

395
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,250
You want me
to ask a young girl for help?

396
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,520
I can't bring myself to say this.

397
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,020
I didn't ask you to request her.

398
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,600
I asked you to beg her.

399
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,020
If you don't go today,

400
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,680
you won't be the CEO tomorrow.

401
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,020
Hurry up.

402
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,540
Let me go by myself.

403
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,240
Don't go by yourself. There's no time.

404
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,880
Hurry up.

405
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,540
(Hua Su)

406
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,640
Have you thought it over, Miss Fang?

407
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,760
I know

408
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,680
you want to keep Hua Su.

409
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,240
If you are willing to cooperate with me

410
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,400
and hand over the photo
in your phone to me,

411
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,320
I can sign a contract with you.

412
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,100
(Restaurant Entry Cooperation Agreement)

413
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,320
By signing this contract,

414
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,400
you can ensure that your Hua Su

415
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,520
will not be removed
from the food street.

416
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,640
How about it? Isn't it tempting?

417
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,620
(Restaurant Entry Cooperation Agreement)

418
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,680
Don't hesitate anymore.

419
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,560
Give me the phone.

420
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,040
Fang Meng will definitely
hand over the phone.

421
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,960
What if An Zhijiang
really gets the phone?

422
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,440
We have to snatch it back.

423
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,720
What is this?

424
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,460
(Red Dragon)

425
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,720
Where's the photo?

426
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,800
It's here.

427
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,100
Isn't this what you wanted?

428
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,520
You know this isn't the photo I wanted.

429
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,680
Miss Fang,

430
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,380
do you still want to keep Hua Su?

431
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,000
Of course I want to keep it.

432
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,280
But Manager An,

433
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,020
I didn't lie to you.

434
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,980
The photo of Shu Zhengyan is here.

435
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,120
I have nothing else.

436
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,840
Then I'll sign the contract, okay?

437
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,480
This is your own choice.

438
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,580
Let go of that girl!

439
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,080
No, let go of that phone.

440
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,940
Hand over the phone.

441
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,780
Otherwise...

442
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,840
Otherwise, I won't be polite.

443
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,190
Fang Meng, you wouldn't...

444
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,290
you wouldn't really give him the photo,
would you?

445
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,140
Password...

446
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,700

I'm afraid that one day
you'll use the photo to threaten me.

Fang Meng,

00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,990
I have to take a high view of you
on this matter today.

487
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,120
Stay away from me.

488
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,760
You are just like him.

489
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,260
Why are you coming at me?

490
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,100

You still think I'm a fool, don't you?

492
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,820
Let me ask you.

493
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,980
Why exactly does Shu Zhengyan

494
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,520
want to hire me as a private chef?

495
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,820
I...

496
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,140
If it weren't for Gao Ying,

497
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,440
I'd kick you out along with him.

498
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,230
You mustn't mention
my relationship with Gao Ying

499
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,440
in front of Shu Zhengyan.

500
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,860
I really can't figure out

501
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,400
why he wants to find you.

502
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,860
What's wrong with me?

503
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,360
I'm just working, you...

504
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,340
Mr. Shu, what's the matter?

505
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,360
Hurry... hurry up and cook for me.

506
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,100
Are you going to eat again?

507
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,920
Go, now.

508
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,800
Are you feeling better, Mr. Shu?

509
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,240
I now feel like

510
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:56,840
my relationship with Fang Meng
is just like...

511
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,660
(Nantianmen)

512
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,220
Master, stop chanting, Master!

513
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,040
Master.

514
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,580
- Why have to do this?
- Stop chanting.

515
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,840
- What exactly did Senior Brother do wrong?
- Master, you handle him.

516
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,000
Stop chanting, Master.

517
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,080
This won't do.

518
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,740
Mr. Shu,

519
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm starting to believe what you said.

520
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,940
There's definitely something wrong
with Fang Meng's dishes.

521
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,400
Look at what you've become.

522
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:27,940
Alright,

523
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,200
let's not talk about Fang Meng.

524
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,600
Now I'm more worried about An Zhijiang.

525
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,260
You're right.

526
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,640
An Zhijiang has now completely
set his sights on you.

527
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,900
If this keeps up,

528
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,360
we'll be exposed sooner or later.

529
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,380
But you said you need to eat
the dishes made by Fang Meng,

530
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,480
only then will your body
return to normal.

531
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,680
However, due to the relationship
between you and her,

532
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:52,120
she definitely won't cook for you.

533
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,880
So what should we do?

534
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,460
It's not easy to find someone

535
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,000
who cooks as badly as she does.

536
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,420
Since the straightforward way
doesn't work,

537
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,880
let's try a more subtle approach.

538
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,120
What do you mean?

539
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,100
Isn't she determined to stay at Hua Su?

540
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,580
Then let's go to Hua Su.

541
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,260
We'll go to Hua Su every day.

542
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,560
We'll turn her into your private chef.

543
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,520
But I can't leave
the company's matters behind.

544
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,700
Mr. Shu,

545
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,000
cloud office, right?

546
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,140
Think about it.

547
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,340
You're not feeling well.

548
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,880
Even if you go to the company,
you can't work.

549
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,780
But can you really

550
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,960
eat the food she cooks every day?

551
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,980
Others can eat it.

552
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,320
Why can't I?

553
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,760
Now I'm more worried about An Zhijiang.

554
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,780
Hua Su has long been targeted by him.

555
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,360
I go to Hua Su every day.

556
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,200
Isn't this going against the company?

557
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,240
You're right.

558
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,920
So we absolutely cannot
let them find out.

559
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,180
Keep your eye on him.

560
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,160
I don't believe I can't bring him down.

561
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,480
What are you waiting for?

562
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,460
Mr. Shu, it's me.

563
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,300
Gao Ying.

564
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,120
Where is Mr. Shu?

565
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,960
Mr. Shu is not here.

566
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,280
Hello, how many?

567
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:55,960
Mr. Shu.

568
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,400
I forgot it.

00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,760
