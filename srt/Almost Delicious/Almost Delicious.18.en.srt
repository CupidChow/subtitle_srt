Why are you so happy?

You're even singing.

33
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,740
How can I not be happy?

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,960
Our great savior, Mr. Shu,

35
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,480
is coming back today.

36
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,860
He is coming back today?

37
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,700
Listen,

38
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,140
An Zhijiang wanted
to cause trouble to Mr. Shu,

39
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,860
so he specially invited a doctor
from abroad

40
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,300
to perform a health checkup to Mr. Shu.

41
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,300
Who knew,
that doctor is Mr. Shu's friend.

42
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,580
Now, Mr. Shu is fine

43
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,860
and coming back today.

44
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,100
That guy is a doctor?

45
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,240
Yes.

46
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,040
Just a regular doctor?

47
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,500
Nothing else between them?

48
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,500
Looks like they are old friends.

49
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,540
They probably met
while he's studying abroad.

50
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,700
Let me ask you something.

51
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,900
Why are you being so mysterious?

52
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,340
Keep your voice down.

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,500
Who told you that?

54
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,900
Who else could it be?

55
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,380
Don't tell me it's Fang Meng.

56
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,500
Who else then?

57
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,560
Think about it.

58
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,720
Fang Meng's been with Mr. Shu for so long,

59
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,140
and there's been no progress.

60
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,660
Is that even possible?

61
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,000
And Fang Meng said

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,560
whenever Mr. Shu gets close to her,

63
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,140
he's particularly fearful.

64
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,820
Maybe she's just overthinking it.

65
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,300
You don't know

66
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,800
some people nowadays are really good

67
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,300
at hiding things.

68
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,680
Please stop it.

69
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,440
You know what?

70
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,320
You're giving me a headache.

71
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,660
Why?

72
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,100
You even ask me why.

73
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,020
I've spent all day with Mr. Shu,
even going to the bathroom.

74
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,940
Thinking about it now, I'm kind of scared.

75
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,020
You're not…

76
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,380
Don't you know what kind of person I am?

77
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,440
Alright.

78
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,460
Forget it. Forget it.

79
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,860
Don't think too much about it.

80
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,260
The point is

81
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,860
that Mr. Shu is back today,

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,060
which means my good days are back.

83
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,260
Hello, Mr. Shu.

84
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,180
Mr. Shu!

85
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,080
Is it funny?

86
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,100
I'm not laughing.

87
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,540
Mr. Shu.

88
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,980
Is it funny?

89
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,540
Mr. Shu.

90
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,680
What's the matter?

91
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,900
Are you okay?

92
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,420
Did the checkup really go well?

93
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,180
(Hua Su)

94
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,780
How can a grand opening start
with only one person here?

95
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,580
Come on. There are no customers here.

96
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,100
Why's the stair polished so slippery?

97
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,660
Who's asking you
to do something weird?

98
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,180
And you even flicked your trench coat.

99
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,220
I was trying to surprise you.

100
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,880
It's been a few days.

101
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,780
It's time to take a fresh look.

102
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,860
You even read some books
these days?

103
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,780
Just a little.

104
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,680
Ouch.

105
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,860
But

106
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,060
why are you back?

107
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,100
Didn't you work for someone else?

108
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,100
I missed you.

109
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,040
Only Hua Su can give me

110
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,260
that feeling of home.

111
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,900
But why did I hear

112
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,780
when you were working for someone else,

113
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,940
you denied ever working at Hua Su?

114
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,660
What? Who told you that?

115
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,680
That's not true.

116
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,300
You're making things up.

117
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,940
I've asked around.

118
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,200
Do you want to know

119
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,060
who said it?

120
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,180
Come on, Meng.

121
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,660
It was just to get by.

122
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,540
You know, Hua Su had
a bad reputation before.

123
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,880
Then I must tell you

124
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,900
that Hua Su's reputation isn't good now,
either.

125
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,820
- What are you doing?
- After working for someone else,

126
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,980
I realized

127
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,580
Hua Su is the only place
that truly cares about me.

128
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,580
Those people

129
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,100
didn't treat me well.

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,380
Meng, you're the only one
who's been good to me.

131
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,800
Stop acting.

132
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,700
You saw right through me.

133
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,240
Anyway, I'm back now.

134
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,180
I'm not leaving this time.

135
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,560
I'm staying.

136
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,440
Why are you sighing?

137
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,860
I've learned my Dad's four dishes.

138
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,140
Four dishes.

139
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,540
Mr. Shu taught you?

140
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,260
Don't mention him.

141
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,500
What happened? Did you two break up?

142
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,320
No.

143
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,420
The contract expired.

144
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,460
You've learned four dishes now.

145
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,220
That's Master Pi's daughter.

146
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,280
Impressive.

147
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,220
But four dishes

148
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,820
won't be enough to save Hua Su.

149
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,420
Meng, listen to me.

150
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,480
You should do what you did before.

151
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,880
Have them come
and do a live cooking challenge.

152
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,180
That way, we can still make money.

153
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,020
And with your special talent
for bad cooking,

154
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,040
it'll be even better.

155
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,540
Shut up.

156
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,740
It's just a joke.
Why are you getting mad?

157
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,240
Wait for me.

158
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,560
Everyone,

159
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,500
let's give a warm welcome to Mr. Shu.

160
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,300
Welcome, welcome.

161
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,980
What are they all laughing at?

162
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,180
You promised me

163
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,020
you wouldn't get involved in my work.

164
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,880
Mr. Shu,

165
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,460
shall we start the meeting?

166
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,020
Thanks to everyone's care and hard work,

167
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,300
our Food Street Plan has moved

168
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,520
forward smoothly

169
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,980
during the days I was away.

170
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,700
I've mentioned before,

171
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,780
as for the introduction of local cuisine…

172
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,440
Mr. Shu,

173
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,060
you're gonna talk about Hua Su, right?

174
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,960
I'm not.

175
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,820
Mr. Shu, considering your current state,

176
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,020
are you sure
you're able to return to work?

177
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,840
Yes,

178
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,300
Hua Su cannot represent local cuisine.

179
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,100
I think all types of food

180
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,460
should be considered for assessment,

181
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,440
not just star-rated restaurants

182
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,580
that deserve this privilege.

183
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,380
It's about respect for food

184
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,220
and a responsibility to the customers.

185
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,480
Currently, more than ten

186
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,020
top star-rated restaurants in the city

187
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,540
have already reached a preliminary
cooperation agreement with us.

188
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,560
I believe

189
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,580
this high demand

190
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,600
and high standards

191
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,960
truly show our respect
and responsibility to the market

192
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,980
and our customers.

193
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,740
I agree with Manager An.

194
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,960
Since we are implementing
the Food Street Plan,

195
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,500
we need to raise the standard bar.

196
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,300
Otherwise,
why even bother with this project?

197
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,620
I also agree with Manager An.

198
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,020
I agree, too.

199
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,520
Agreed

200
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,500
(Hua Su)

201
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,500
Welcome.

202
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,760
Let's call it a day.

203
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,740
It's still early. Why get off work now?

204
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,740
Anyway, there's no customer here.

205
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,440
You can go home now.

206
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,900
You're reopening Hua Su,

207
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,420
so it's expected there's no customer.

208
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,360
Maybe people don't even know

209
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,620
that Hua Su has reopened for business.

210
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,940
How about

211
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,020
I give out flyers tomorrow?

212
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,420
Dazui,

213
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,260
it's not that people don't know,

214
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,360
but Hua Su's reputation

215
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,780
has been ruined.

216
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,460
No one trusts us anymore.

217
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,620
But the milk incident was
already resolved.

218
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,740
That's just one thing.

219
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,740
The main issue is

220
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,420
that the reputation of our dishes is
beyond repair.

221
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,040
That's the consequence
of letting those livestreams happen.

222
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,700
I knew we shouldn't have done that.

223
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,560
Meng,

224
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,300
why don't we do a livestream, too?

225
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,460
Don't mention it.

226
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,760
We could promote Hua Su

227
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,980
and our dishes ourselves.

228
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,060
Let's give it a try.

229
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,580
It's better than just sitting here, right?

230
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,420
You know, Mr. Shu,

231
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,780
everyone's teamed up with An Zhijiang

232
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,420
while you were away.

233
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,500
In my opinion,

234
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,900
you should stop talking about Hua Su.

235
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,460
They are using it

236
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,060
to bring you down.

237
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,780
Think about it.

238
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,300
How much trouble
has it caused you already?

239
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,060
This guy has freeloaded on Hua Su
so many times,

240
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,380
and now he's turning his back on us.

241
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,100
Next

242
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,280
is our

243
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,720
most excellent signature dish,

244
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,700
"Fragrant Delights Soup".

245
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,440
Oh my!

246
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,120
It's so tasty,
and the meat melts in your mouth,

247
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,860
it's smooth, and rich but not greasy.

248
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,040
Oh no.

249
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,880
Where is everyone?

250
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,720
Come on.

251
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,420
Why did they go?

252
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,920
Meng, I'm not kidding.

253
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,180
There were six people earlier,

254
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,680
and now there's no one left.

255
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,400
Meng,

256
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,060
listen to me.

257
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,500
(Hua Su)

258
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,440
Mr. Shu,

259
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,760
wear it.

260
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,100
Don't let the Company know
we're at Hua Su.

261
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,320
You brat.

262
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,540
I told you to keep quiet,
but you didn't listen.

263
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,920
It's not my fault.

264
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,780
You actually hit me over Hua Su.

265
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,760
You won't wear it,

266
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,940
but I will.

267
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,400
Meng,

268
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,760
this is my first livestream.

269
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,700
I don't have much experience.

270
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,980
I'll try again later.

271
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,500
It's okay.

272
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,740
It's not your fault.

273
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,540
I just

274
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,300
don't know what to do.

275
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,060
Don't lose hope.

276
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,780
Maybe

277
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,580
we should sell Hua Su.

278
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,640
What?

279
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,980
Sell Hua Su?

280
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,820
You let me really down.

281
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,640
No, I mean

282
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,200
selling Hua Su will let Master Pi down.

283
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,520
Do you think

284
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,780
I'm not letting him down now?

285
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,680
If I close it now,

286
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,740
Hua Su may leave a good impression
in people's hearts.

287
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,340
But if I keep this up,

288
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,900
there will be nothing good left.

289
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,680
Fang Meng,

290
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,260
Mr. Shu is to see you.

291
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,540
Oh my! Mr. Shu.

292
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,820
You're dressed like my uncle.

293
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,180
Why are you here?

294
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,820
You resume your post.

295
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,780
And why did you come here?

296
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,980
What do you mean?

297
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,020
You don't reply to messages
or answer my calls.

298
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,120
What do I mean?

299
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,980
I already made myself clear last time.

300
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,080
Don't bother me anymore.

301
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,020
What exactly did you make clear?

302
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,600
Besides, you are my girlfriend.

303
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,940
Why can't I come to see you?

304
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,980
Did you ever treat me as your girlfriend?

305
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,060
Of course I have.

306
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,660
I don't want to talk to you.

307
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,180
Go find your Doctor Mark.

308
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,100
What's wrong with Doctor Mark?

309
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,580
Dazui, see them out.

310
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,060
Please leave.

311
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,740
Chuxiao, let's go.

312
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,540
Take care, Uncle.

313
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,860
(Hua Su)

314
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,060
What's wrong with Doctor Mark?

315
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,380
I'll explain it on the way.

316
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,160
Stupid man.

317
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,620
Why don't you ever try to cheer me up?

318
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,420
- Meng.
- Get lost.

319
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,520
She's just a young girl.

320
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,740
Cut her some slack.

321
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,500
Did I bully her?

322
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,060
This is all your fault!

323
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,560
How's this my fault?

324
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,880
If you weren't watching us every day,

325
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,880
would I treat her like that?

326
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,760
If I didn't treat her that way,

327
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,980
would she even suspect me?

328
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,040
I am her father.

329
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,280
I have to protect her.

330
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,380
You protect her?
Are you going to protect her forever?

331
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,600
You are inside my body now.

332
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,900
How can we date?

333
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,160
You can date whoever you want,

334
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,380
just not her.

335
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,700
Otherwise,
my relationship with her will be ruined.

336
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,900
These clothes

337
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,900
and those insane behaviors

338
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,500
are all you're doing!

339
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,580
Fine, fine.

340
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,920
From now on,

341
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,000
I won't interfere with your clothes, okay?

342
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,720
Wear whatever you want.
Even if you wear nothing, I won't care.

343
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,420
That's not the point here.

344
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,600
Am I supposed to tell her

345
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,500
you're inside my body?

346
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,340
She'd still get mad. Don't you get it?

347
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,160
Girls are easy to be pleased.

348
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,700
Just do something to cheer her up.

349
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,300
I can cheer her up.

350
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,360
But can you stop interfering with us?

351
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,340
Stay quietly in my body, please!

352
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,040
Do you know that?

353
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,020
I even feel like I'm going crazy.

354
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,680
I…

355
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,780
I just

356
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,620
get so bored in here.

357
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,780
I'll try to behave, okay?

358
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,180
Now, Fang Meng has already learned

359
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,280
four dishes, right?

360
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,140
There are two more to go.

361
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,540
Once she's done,

362
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,560
I promise

363
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,100
to try my best not to appear. Deal?

364
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,180
You swear?

365
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,200
Yes, I swear.

366
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,480
Deal.

367
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,060
- What's wrong, An'an?
- Brother Zhengyan.

368
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,620
What happened?

369
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,580
Why did he suddenly disappear?

370
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,780
I don't know. Maybe he's mad at me.

371
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,520
It's understandable.

372
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,100
Shi Kai is back,

373
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,000
and he might feel like he got played.

374
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,120
I didn't play around with him.

375
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,660
I really like him.

376
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,840
Yes,

377
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,000
I didn't expect

378
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,220
Shi Kai to suddenly return.

379
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,380
But I quickly figured things out.

380
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,320
I was going to talk to him

381
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,340
once everything was settled.

382
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,840
Who knew he just left

383
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,040
without a word?

384
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,460
I can't find him anywhere.

385
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,400
Do you think

386
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,620
he might be on a ledge

387
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,660
- and leave me forever?
- Alright, An'an.

388
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,440
Stop overthinking it.

389
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,400
He's an adult.

390
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,500
There's no way
he'd do something like that.

391
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,780
But I can't reach him at all.

392
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,620
Should I call the police?

393
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,220
It's not that serious.

394
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,980
He probably never wants to see me again.

395
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,300
How about…

396
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,380
Quick, retreat.

397
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,280
How about

398
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,340
you go find Fang Meng?

399
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,260
She might be able to reach him.

400
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,920
You're right. I'll go now.

401
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,760
Wait a moment.

402
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,540
I'll go with you.

403
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,540
No need, Brother. You're so busy.

404
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,880
I don't want to bother you.

405
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,720
I can go by myself.

406
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:53,580
It's okay.

407
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:54,960
It's okay.

408
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,980
I'll go with you.

409
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,540
Maybe she won't tell you the truth.

410
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,840
Yes, you're right.

411
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,960
Let's go. Hurry up!

412
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,420
- There's no time, Brother.
- I haven't changed my shoes, An'an.

413
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,620
(Hua Su)

414
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,900
I can't live

415
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,940
without Xie Jun.

416
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,860
An'an,

417
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,920
easy, easy.

418
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,380
An'an, don't cry.

419
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,580
Even if you cry,

420
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,180
I don't know where Xie Jun is.

421
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,020
Am I disturbing your business?

422
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,960
Actually, there's no business right now.

423
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,940
Rest assured.

424
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,700
Am I interrupting your work?

425
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,740
Actually, I don't have any work to do.

426
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,820
I can't find him.

427
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,100
I want to cry, too.

428
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,980
Fang Meng,

429
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,380
please don't cry, okay?

430
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,640
I swear

431
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,220
I won't come to find you again.

432
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,500
I'm crying
while you're sleeping?

433
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,000
I… I…

434
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,100
I wasn't sleeping.

435
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,180
You were sleeping!

436
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,420
I even heard you snoring.

437
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,820
It was him snoring.

438
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,900
You don't care about me at all.

439
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,940
An'an! An'an!

440
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,820
What… what are you doing?

441
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,020
Brother!

442
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,540
Brother! Brother!

443
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,180
You'll strangle her.

444
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,820
I want Brother Xie Jun.

445
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,140
Why are you crying again?

446
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,900
I... I can tell you where he is.

447
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,080
Where is he?

448
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,240
Actually, he asked me not to tell anyone.

449
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,080
Where is he?

450
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,040
Here's the thing.

451
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,500
You take a long break

452
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,380
and don't contact her first.

453
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,460
See if she will come to find you.

454
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,060
What if she doesn't come?

455
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,300
Then you should give up.

456
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,340
Brother Xie Jun!

457
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,940
Brother Xie Jun!

458
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,660
Brother Xie Jun.

459
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,980
Where have you been these past few days?

460
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,100
I've been looking everywhere for you,

461
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,260
Brother Xie Jun.

462
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,540
Why are you going over there?

463
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,420
Brother Xie Jun,

464
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,660
why are you ignoring me?

465
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,660
Why should I respond to you?

466
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,980
I know

467
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,260
you're still angry.

468
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,420
What happened was my fault.

469
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,340
I didn't explain it clearly,

470
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,940
which made you misunderstand.

471
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,540
But I really didn't toy with your heart.

472
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,420
Is there any point going on with this?

473
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,700
Looking at Xie Jun's expression,

474
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,900
they're not getting back together.

475
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,620
What do you know?

476
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,020
This is called "hard-to-get".

477
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,900
I know

478
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,060
you don't like me.

479
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,660
All this time,

480
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,260
it's been my one-sided love.

481
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,700
I didn't come here today

482
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,940
to ask you to be with me.

483
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,060
I just wanted to clear things up.

484
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,740
I've said everything I have to say

485
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,460
and done all I can.

486
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,540
I have no regrets.

487
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,980
Thank you

488
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,100
for tolerating me

489
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,020
for so long.

490
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,420
I'm leaving now.

491
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,140
This isn't how it's supposed to go!

492
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,040
Wait a moment.

493
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,160
What's wrong?

494
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,600
Is…

495
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,860
is this all you wanted to say?

496
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,000
Yes.

497
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,020
Don't you have anything else to say?

498
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,980
I've said it all.

499
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,620
I guess you don't want to see me again,

500
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,460
so I won't bother you anymore.

501
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,480
You…

502
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,180
you can't just guess.

503
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,300
What do you mean?

504
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,800
You…

505
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,080
you…

506
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,440
Brother Xie Jun.

507
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,620
