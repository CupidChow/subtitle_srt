Hold on.

32
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,100
We often say

33
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,260
food must balance appearance, aroma
and taste.

34
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,020
For plating,

35
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,660
the basics are

36
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,140
a combination of the void and the solid,

37
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,380
and spot arrangements.

38
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,100
The negative space is necessary
to create a sense of artistry.

39
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,140
Just looking

40
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,620
at this dish's plating,

41
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,820
it's obvious

42
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,540
that the chef lacks

43
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,820
professional training.

44
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,140
Finally, someone gets it.

45
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,420
Yin Miaolan truly deserves her title

46
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,620
as an international
culinary consultant indeed.

47
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,540
A remarkable consultant indeed.

48
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,340
But a couple of days ago,

49
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,940
I saw her visiting Hua Su.

50
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,860
As the judges here,

51
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,500
you should uphold their professionalism

52
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,900
and maintain culinary standards

53
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,900
during the assessment.

54
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,740
So,

55
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,780
as the culinary consultant

56
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,060
and head judge for this competition,

57
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,140
I don't agree

58
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,660
with Hua Su's entry into the finals.

59
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,010
Is there any reason for this?

60
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:39,900
Brother Xie Jun,

61
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,140
go comfort her.

62
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,140
You're her childhood friend.

63
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,980
I…

64
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,540
I wouldn't dare.

65
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,500
Gao Ying, you are her best friend.

66
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,220
- You do it.
- Me…

67
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,380
Me neither.

68
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,220
I don't dare provoke her now.

69
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,340
I'll do it.

70
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,420
We're close.

71
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,340
I understand her.

72
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,580
Meng.

73
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,620
Get lost.

74
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,820
I don't understand her.

75
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,860
Do you know

76
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,860
that the judge who eliminated me today

77
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,020
was actually my mom?

78
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,300
Why aren't you surprised?

79
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,300
Wasn't she invited by you?

80
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,060
What a coincidence.

81
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,660
I wouldn't have attended

82
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,820
if I had known she was one of judges.

83
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,980
Actually, she came to Hua Su,

84
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,380
and asked me to study abroad,

85
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,020
but only

86
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,340
if I abandoned Hua Su.

87
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,460
Is it an either/or proposition?

88
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,740
She disapproves of my Dad's philosophy.

89
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,980
That's why

90
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,060
they separated.

91
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,660
I may have to give up Hua Su.

92
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,660
I can't protect it anymore.

93
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,420
Thank you.

94
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,540
With all due respect,

95
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,180
the issues between you and Master Pi

96
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,420
should not affect your daughter.

97
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,060
Looks like

98
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,660
you've done your homework, Mr. Shu,

99
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,300
and are even digging up

100
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,540
my old stories.

101
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,420
I just didn't expect

102
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,940
you'd let

103
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,660
emotions interfere

104
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,950
with professional judgment.

105
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,460
I'm not emotional.

106
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,300
As Hua Su's new owner,

107
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,140
she must

108
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,580
create her style.

109
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,420
Her dishes now

110
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,060
only reflect Pi Zijie's style.

111
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,340
I see nothing uniquely hers.

112
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,420
Then tell me,

113
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,740
how can I evaluate that dish?

114
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,100
Even if I taste

115
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,500
and score it,

116
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,780
the credit goes to Pi Zijie,

117
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,860
not Fang Meng.

118
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,740
Don't your Bo Fei Group

119
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,460
want to introduce Hua Su

120
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,450
with Fang Meng as the head chef,

121
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,460
not Pi Zijie?

122
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,980
I know her well.

123
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,780
She wants Fang Meng to give up Hua Su

124
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,020
and study her philosophy abroad.

125
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,900
So you're saying

126
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,140
Fang Meng is copying Master Pi's dishes,

127
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,260
and that's why you won't try them.

128
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,700
If Fang Meng creates her own dish,

129
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,660
would you taste

130
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,980
and score it?

131
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,540
Ms. Yin,

132
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,540
Fang Meng told me

133
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,260
you want her to study abroad.

134
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,580
If she has regrets,

135
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,940
I think she won't go with you.

136
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,420
So I'm asking you to give her a chance

137
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,820
to taste her dish.

138
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,540
If she fails,

139
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,060
she'll go with you willingly.

140
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,860
If she succeeds,

141
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,500
wouldn't it be a win

142
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,020
for you too?

143
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,780
I don't want to go.

144
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,980
Why not?

145
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,460
I've already convinced your mother.

146
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,780
I have already convinced Yin Miaolan

147
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,900
to let you enter the finals.

148
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,100
I don't need her pity.

149
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,020
This isn't the first time I've lost

150
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,620
or the first time someone said
I'm bad at cooking.

151
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,580
Let's not do it,

152
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:42,940
okay?

153
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,300
You're giving up now?

154
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,740
Think about Hua Su,

155
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,740
think about Master Pi,

156
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,820
think about me,

157
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,100
and Xie Jun, Shen An'an

158
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,340
Gao Ying, Dazui,

159
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,500
and other friends

160
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,660
cheering for you.

161
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,180
They're there not just
because they're your friends

162
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,100
to cheer you on

163
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,340
but because they believe in you.

164
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,060
We believe in you. Do you understand?

165
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,020
You can't be defeated by others,

166
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,100
and you definitely can't be defeated
by yourself.

167
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,020
Tomorrow morning,

168
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,660
I will wait for you at the finals.

the competition is about to start.

We're here.

179
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,820
I've been preparing ingredients
all morning.

Why don't you come to help?

(Yi Wushuang,
Head Chef)

187
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,620
The first contestant is Yi Wushuang,

188
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,460
39 years old,

189
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,740
graduated from Royal Baixiang Academy.

00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,260
Look at you, come over here.

193
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,260
Next,

194
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,460
we have Li Dalong,
head chef of Liuliuniu Restaurant.

195
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,620
Yeah.

196
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,980
Li Dalong won first prize

197
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,740
in the national dessert competition

198
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,740
with his desert
called Grandma Liu's Durian Milk.

199
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,980
In addition, he has led

200
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,100
Liuliuniu Restaurant to be

201
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,500
the nation's most popular restaurant

202
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,740
for two years in a row.

203
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,860
The third

204
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,500
is Simon,

205
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,500
(Simon, Head Chef)
head chef of MIX Restaurant.

206
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,160
As a chef with mixed heritage
from eight countries,

207
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,540
Simon combines

208
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,900
international techniques

209
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,860
and is renowned for his cutting skills.

210
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,580
You have your own strengths.

211
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,900
Don't worry.

212
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,820
And finally, our dark house,

213
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,980
stunning in the preliminaries,

214
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,180
eliminated in the semis,

215
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,100
and revived for the finals,

216
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,740
Fang Meng from Hua Su Restaurant!

217
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,820
(Fang Meng)

218
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,420
Meng,

219
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,460
I've stuck with you till the end.

220
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,980
Go get them!

221
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:09,980
Go get them!

222
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,860
I've heard

223
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,820
these chefs are all hidden masters.

224
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,700
Truly impressive.

225
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,980
So fast that I can't even see the knife.

226
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,180
Yet you even show off.

227
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,380
Oh my!

228
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,620
Dazui!

229
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,100
Are you blind?

230
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,540
Why are you showing off
when you can't do it?

231
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,660
Dazui!

232
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,020
Sir, you're under suspicion
for attempted murder.

233
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,860
You'll come with us.

234
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,700
Alright, there's been a minor accident.

235
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,380
Now, I announce that today's competition

236
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,980
will directly proceed

237
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,860
to the championship match!

238
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,780
Alright, let me

239
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,340
explain the rules.

240
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,420
This is a no-theme competition today.

241
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,660
Each chef has only one chance
to make a dish.

242
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,500
The high score wins.

243
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,660
Alright, without further ado,

244
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,900
let's begin the competition.

245
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,620
This is not my ingredient bag.

246
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,660
Miss Fang,

247
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,220
please don't blame me.

248
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,220
Blame Shu Zhengyan instead.

249
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,020
Sir, my ingredient bag has been switched.

250
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,060
I'm afraid I can't help you with that.

251
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,500
But these are all just some

252
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,860
leftovers from others.

253
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,380
The ingredients were prepared
by the contestants themselves.

254
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,140
So, managing them is your responsibility.

255
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,180
Fang Meng,

256
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,900
why are you back?

257
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,740
How is Big Mouth?

258
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,420
He's fine. Don't worry.

259
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,180
Fang Meng,

260
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:12,940
Dazui is okay.

261
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,820
- Meng.
- Don't push yourself too hard.

262
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,900
This time,

263
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,460
I can't help you.

264
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,420
As long as you're okay.

265
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,220
I'm fine.

266
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,620
I'm here to cheer you on.

267
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:25,980
Keep going.

268
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,140
- Keep going.
- We'll go ahead first.

269
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,420
I'll stay with you.

270
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,220
We'll face this together.

271
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,980
Mr. Shu, your direct involvement might…

272
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,900
I won't cook or speak.

273
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,260
I'll just stand with her,

274
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,780
like everyone else.

275
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,900
The sixth dish!

276
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,220
Quick, have a taste.

277
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,060
There's nothing on the recipe
for this dish.

278
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,780
You've always guided me before.

279
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,940
Do you have any idea this time?

280
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,380
The first five dishes alone

281
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,660
won't make you a true chef.

282
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,540
You need to create something
unique to you.

283
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,780
(Food Street Culinary Competition Finals)

284
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,540
People in Jiangnan value
eating with the seasons.

285
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,140
This dish

286
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,140
uses the plumpest Hairy Crabs.

287
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,060
Freshly extracted crab roe and crab oil

288
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,700
were stuffed into the special small tofu.

289
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,140
Then broth,
prepared with Cantonese techniques,

290
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,420
is garnished with West Lake Longjing tea.

291
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,580
The broth is clear,

292
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,620
and the meatballs are tender,

293
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,780
melting in your mouth

294
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,420
and leaving a lasting impression.

295
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,340
However,

296
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,300
the Longjing tea
you used is Minghou Longjing.

297
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,500
Mingqian Longjing

298
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,180
is green, and brighter,

299
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,460
with a sweeter aroma

300
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,580
and richer nutrients

301
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,740
compared with Minghou Longjing tea.

302
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,980
For ingredients,

303
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,620
you must learn to adapt to the timing.

304
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,260
Alright, now let's have

305
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,260
the judges score.

306
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,580
Yi Wushuang has earned
an impressive 19 points.

307
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,540
Next,

308
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,700
we have Fang Meng's dish.

309
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,320
This just looks

310
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,500
like a few ordinary dishes combined.

311
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,580
Nothing special.

312
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,860
Ms. Yin, I don't think

313
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,300
this dish is worth tasting.

314
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,140
If Fang Meng creates her own dish,

315
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,980
would you taste

316
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,140
and score it fairly?

317
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,900
It may seem simple,

318
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,860
but it's incredibly ingenious.

319
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,060
Able to transform discarded scraps

320
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,740
into something remarkable,

321
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,580
her skills are

322
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,500
truly impressive!

323
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,580

Fang Meng,

336
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,660
can I talk to you privately?

337
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,500
Let me change first.

338
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,220
I didn't expect you'd really pull it off.

339
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,020
This dish reminded me

340
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,700
of many things from the past

341
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,900
and made me

342
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,580
reflect deeply.

343
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,140
It's just a dish.

344
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,100
How could it make you realize so much?

345
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,620
Exactly speaking,

346
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,620
it's not just the dish.

347
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,940
It's because of you.

348
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,260
Back then, I left your father

349
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,700
because he was selfish.

350
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,340
He only wanted me to cook his recipes.

351
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,060
When I aimed higher,

352
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,580
he tried to hold me back.

353
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,700
At that time, I was too young,

354
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,660
so I left you both in anger.

355
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,300
What's the point

356
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,220
of telling me this now?

357
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,620
Previously, I rejected your cooking,

358
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,500
to a great extent,

359
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,820
not because of its taste

360
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,620
but because of these memories.

361
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,700
Today,

362
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,020
I tasted

363
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,700
your unique flavor from this dish.

364
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:32,940
Meng,

365
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,860
I owe you an apology.

366
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,020
My conflict with your Dad

367
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,660
hurt

368
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,380
and neglected you.

369
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,180
I don't ask for your forgiveness,

370
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,380
just hope

371
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,980
there's a chance

372
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,500
to make amends.

373
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,180
Today, I see hope in you.

374
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,340
I believe,

375
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,180
under your care,

376
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,660
Hua Su will flourish.

377
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,140
Manager An,

378
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,300
would the release of this video

379
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,420
affect the company?

380
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,340
If Shu Zhengyan continues

381
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,780
lording over me,

382
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,300
does this company's fate

383
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,100
even matter to me?

384
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,260
- Cheers!
- Congratulations, Fang Meng!

385
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,260
Congrats, Fang Meng.

386
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,540
Congratulations!

387
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,620
Let's sing a song!

388
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,060
- Sure.
- What should we sing?

389
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,420
♪Sister, you sit at the bow♪

390
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,540
That's so outdated!

391
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,180
- What should we sing?
- How about Those Bygone Years?

392
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,140
Those Bygone Years.

393
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,580
Okay, okay.

394
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,780
Come, Those Bygone Years.

395
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,860
Come on! Ready, one, two, three!

396
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,620
♪Those years of missed rainstorms♪

397
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,500

Let's take a picture!

401
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,500
Good idea. Let's snap one!

402
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,340
Come on.

403
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,580
Look at the camera!

404
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,380
One, two, three!

405
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,140
- Cheese!
- Wait, I'm not in it!

406
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,220
Hurry up, come on.

407
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,060
Quick, quick.

408
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,340
Come on, one, two, three!

409
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,340
Cheese!

410
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,540
What's wrong again, Dazui?

411
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,420
Dazui!

412
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,340
- Dazui.
- What's wrong now?

413
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:49,330
So annoying!

414
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,740
Can't you handle this? Let me do it.

415
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,300
Guess it's up to Mr. Shu.

416
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,180
What's going on?

417
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:03,860
Go take a look.

418
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,020
What happened?

419
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,100
- Fang Meng, don't look!
- Fang Meng, you…

420
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,740
- It's nothing.
- Come on. What happened?

421
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,580
Don't look.

422
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,260
- There's nothing wrong.
- It's nothing.

423
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,300
I want to see it. What's going on?

424
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,540
- Fang Meng.
- Fang Meng.

425
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,540
- Fang Meng.
- Meng.

426
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,460
- Fang Meng.
- Fang Meng.

427
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,580
- Meng.
- Fang Meng.

428
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,060
- Fang Meng.
- Meng, Meng.

429
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,180
An Zhijiang,

430
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,220
did you do this?

431
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,620
I might ask you the same question.

432
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,180
As of now,

433
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,580
12 leading merchants have already

434
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,540
(Defamation Lawsuit)
filed defamation lawsuits

435
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,120
claiming compensation
for reputation damage,

436
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,540
including three restaurants

437
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,860
we worked so hard to secure.

438
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,380
Besides, what was filmed was the truth,
wasn't it?

439
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,700
An Zhijiang,

440
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,040
Fang Meng won the championship

441
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,940
with her own abilities.

442
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,220
It has nothing to do

443
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,380
with me

444
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,180
or Yin Miaolan.

445
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,900
Fine.

446
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,340
Explain that to the netizens.

447
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,300
Tell them

448
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,820
how Hua Su transformed overnight
from a notorious restaurant

449
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,260
to a restaurant with tasty foods.

450
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,500
The company's stock is plummeting.

451
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,060
The combined compensation claims

452
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,700
could bankrupt the company.

453
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,820
We trusted you,

454
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,700
but you've sunk the company

455
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,900
because of one woman.

456
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,820
You've let us down.

457
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,660
You must have a plan, right?

458
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,140
I have an idea.

459
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,180
Actually, this is also

460
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,780
for the benefit of the company.

461
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,900
After all, your father is dedicating

462
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,500
his life to Bo Fei Group.

463
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,580
It's very simple.

464
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,220
You just need to release

465
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,580
a resignation statement,

466
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,260
and clarify

467
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,140
that you'll take full responsibility

468
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,660
as personal misconduct,

469
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,940
and you're willing to offer

470
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,460
to compensate the affected business.

471
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,220
That's the only way to save the company.

472
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,500
Mr. Shu, what's wrong?

473
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,180
Mr. Shu. Mr. Shu.

474
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,300
Mr. Shu, the Chairman's had an incident.

475
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,380
- What happened?
- Mr. Shu.

476
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,660
He fainted after hearing
about Bo Fei Group's troubles.

477
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,660
What's his condition now?

478
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,380
The doctor said he's out of danger.

479
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,060
If I weren't inside your body,

480
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,740
you wouldn't be facing all this trouble.

481
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,700
Sorry for burdening your family.

482
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,220
I'm sorry.

483
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,180
Mr. Shu.

484
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,300
I'll leave you guys alone.

485
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,100
How's the Chairman?

486
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,820
He's out of life-threatening danger.

487
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,180
I'm sorry

488
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,780
to cause this negative impact

489
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,580
on you and your team.

490
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,420
No need to apologize.

491
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,780
It's clear

492
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,740
someone is behind this.

493
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,020
I know

494
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,460
their target isn't me

495
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,300
but you.

496
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,900
I'm just worried about Fang Meng.

497
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,700
She will understand.

498
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,780
Speaking of her,

499
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,780
I must thank you

500
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,540
for standing by her.

501
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,060
She's told me everything.

502
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,860
Your journey together

503
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,420
sounds like

504
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,540
a story out of a book.

505
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,620
Ms. Yin,

506
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,180
there's something I want to tell you.

507
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:42,940
But I don't know

508
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,540
if you will believe me.

509
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,500
What is it?

510
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:49,980
Master Pi

511
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,020
