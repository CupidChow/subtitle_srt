(Organic Milk Farm)

33
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,220
This place…

34
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,800
seems like I've seen it somewhere before.

35
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,300
Mr. Shu, have you been to this farm?

36
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,080
I've really been to that farm.

37
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,050
They're exactly the same.

38
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,360
Where are you going?

39
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,500
- I'm not in the mood for your nonsense...
- I'll go with you.

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,320
The farm is far from here.

41
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,550
Are we opening the shop or not?

42
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,180
I think we should go there.

43
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,520
But if you go,

44
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,500
I'll definitely get
beat up here by myself.

45
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,960
Dazui, think about it.

46
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,810
Given the situation,

47
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,500
we can't open these days.

48
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,040
We need to look into the milk issue.

49
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,880
It's crucial for our reputation.

50
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,020
Yes, this needs to be investigated.

51
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,700
Mr. Shu, come here.

52
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,080
Save it. Lately, everything
at the company's been all about you.

53
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,420
How can you go?

54
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,240
You can't go to the farm with them.

55
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,420
There's one thing I need to check.

56
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,000
What's more important than the business?

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,120
I feel like I've seen

58
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,380
that farm before.

59
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,520
Fine, you've seen it.

60
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,240
But you don't have to go.

61
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,960
I've never been to that farm,

62
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,320
but I'm familiar with that place.

63
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,460
That's weird. I need to find out why.

64
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,040
If the Chariman asks, what should I say?

65
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,060
I won't get lost.

66
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,640
Besides, we can work

67
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,000
at Hua Su, can't we?

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,840
If Fang Meng isn't around,

69
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,320
what if my health issues act up

70
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,900
and An Zhijiang finds out?

71
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,260
Remember, cover for me.

72
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,700
I'll go with you.

73
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,700
You and me?

74
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,520
I don't think so.
It's inappropriate for us to be alone.

75
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,520
I'm taking time out of
my busy schedule to go with you.

76
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,920
How can you say that?

77
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,080
Go ahead with your busy schedule.

78
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,260
I really don't need that.

79
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,920
But I think that's a good idea.

80
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,120
You see, with your temper,

81
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,680
I'm worried something might go wrong.

82
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,240
What's more, it's safer for you

83
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,380
to have a guy with you.

84
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,480
Mr. Shu,

85
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,640
she gave you a cold shoulder.

86
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,540
Tone down your enthusiasm.

87
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,380
You know what, Meng.

88
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,320
I've heard that

89
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,880
there are often paranormal events

90
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,860
in the mountain area.

91
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,240
Boom!

92
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,940
Who knows what might pop up?

93
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:05,910
- You...
- Do you

94
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,120
still want to go alone?

95
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,200
It's really spooky.

96
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,980
Stop talking nonsense, please.

97
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,620
I think

98
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,540
you'll need a man at that moment.

99
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,260
Wait, Fang Meng.

100
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,600
Wait, Mr. Shu.

101
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,900
Will I get paid for these days off, Meng?

102
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,120
For the company,

103
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,220
I'll work online until I get back.

104
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,860
Mr. Shu, are you really going there?

105
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,460
Is there any problem?

106
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,600
No.

107
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,840
But remember to check
your phone messages.

108
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,000
Otherwise, if something happens to you,

109
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,500
- Fine.
- I can't handle it.

110
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,440
Remember, be nice to him

111
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,140
and don't be impulsive.

112
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,180
Mr. Shu, thanks.

113
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,000
- Go back.
- Go.

114
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,150
- I'll be fine.
- Okay, bye.

115
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,040
Enjoy the ride.

116
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,340
You're the first woman
to sit in the passenger seat.

(The Cold-hearted CEO's Overbearing Love)

118
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,920
What are you doing?

119
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,040
I was just kidding.

120
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,380
No need to be so sensitive.

121
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,900
Drive.

122
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,560
Surprise!

123
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,480
Xie Jun.

124
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,360
This is Shen An'an.

125
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,000
I may not be studying well,

126
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,080
but for you,

127
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,280
I can go back to school

128
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,280
and be a model student.

129
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,700
Hello, Senior Xie Jun!

130
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,300
Hello, Senior!

131
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,700
Miss Shen,

132
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,740
weren't you abroad?

133
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,300
That's right.

134
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,180
But I came back yesterday.

135
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,160
Are you here to take Sweetie?

136
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,320
I'll get it for you.

137
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,320
No, wait.

138
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,320
Xie Jun,

139
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,160
well...

140
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,100
I...

141
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,040
I'm going abroad again tomorrow.

142
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,380
I'm very busy.

143
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,760
Would you mind looking after Sweetie

144
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,180
for a bit longer?

145
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,300
What book are you reading?

146
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,180
I've picked one.

147
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,660
I've got work to do.

148
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,940
I gotta go.

149
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,620
Is it because I'm not charming enough?

150
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,880
No way!

151
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,180
I know, I know.

152
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,260
What's wrong?

153
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,620
No navigation signal.

154
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,240
Excuse me, Ma'am.

155
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,400
Do you know how to
get to Organic Milk Farm?

156
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,940
I can't understand your accent.

157
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,500
Organic Milk Farm...

158
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,620
I can't understand your accent.

159
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,600
Ma'am, you know, Organic Milk Farm

160
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,840
shouldn't be far from here, right?

161
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,800
Do you know how to get there?

162
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,240
I have no idea what you're saying.

163
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,440
I mean, do you know the way

164
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,560
to the Organic Milk Farm?

165
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,900
Fine, just get in the car.

166
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,860
So, what should we do now?

167
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,540
Let's take a detour and see.

168
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,380
What now?

169
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,150
The car's broke. I can't get it started.

170
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,420
M-Mister!

171
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,540
No need, they don't know Mandarin.

172
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,100
Hello, how can I help you?

173
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,560
Well,

174
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,500
is there a repair shop nearby?

175
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,260
Over there.

176
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,500
What?

177
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:09,750
Shh.

178
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,480
Assistant Lin.

179
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,320
Hello.

180
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,780
Fang Meng and Mr. Shu
went there together?

181
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,340
Yeah, I don't know why.

182
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,300
Mr. Shu must be possessed.

183
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,800
Fang Meng's dish

184
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,140
has quite a kick.

185
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,420
But didn't you...

186
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,300
- Assistant Lin.
- Hello.

187
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,360
But didn't you say

188
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,800
that after the Reske Comet appeared,

189
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,540
Mr. Shu became abnormal?

190
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,940
He was abnormal back then.

191
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,740
But now, he's gone crazy.

192
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,500
Everyone's quite busy today, huh?

193
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,520
We have a meeting today.

194
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,460
Mr. Shu isn't coming?

195
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,660
He said he would join us online.

196
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,420
Thank goodness.

197
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,100
Thank you, high-tech.

198
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,120
Hi.

199
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,460
Where is Mr. Shu?

200
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,820
Mr. Shu has other work today.

201
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,820
He will join us online.

202
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,980
Online? Again?

203
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,850
Where is he every day,
in an internet café?

204
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,940
As the CEO of the company,

205
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,980
isn't he supposed to
attend meetings in person?

206
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,760
He said he'll definitely
attend next time.

207
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,660
Definitely.

208
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,860
Alright, let's begin.

209
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,060
(Connecting...)

210
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,260
Is it ready?

211
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,980
Almost, almost.

212
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:59,100
(Bike repair, tire fixes, and air refills)

213
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,780
This is a repair shop.

214
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,700
What should we do?

215
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,020
Let's go back. The car is still there.

216
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,420
Wait.

217
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,100
You can't drive it anyway,

218
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,260
and calling a tow truck
will take forever.

219
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,400
I'll be right back.

220
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,680
Sir,

221
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,460
do you know where Organic Milk Farm is?

222
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,140
It's up ahead, about 2.5 kilometers away.

223
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,520
Let's go.

224
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,300
It's 2.5 kilometers away.

225
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,500
That's pretty far.

226
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,860
Are you going to walk there?

227
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,780
The phone has no signal,

228
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,060
and the road is terrible.

229
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,080
This morning I was a CEO,

230
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,320
and now I'm riding
this crappy bicycle with you on it.

231
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,380
Why am I doing this?

232
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,420
I didn't ask you to come.

233
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,620
You insisted on coming with me.

234
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,980
Come on, be careful.

235
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,640
Shu Zhengyan!

236
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,860
Watch out ahead!

237
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,260
Be careful!

238
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,600
Alright, no more waiting.

239
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,680
Let's begin.

240
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,800
As for the Food Street,

241
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,920
our operations department

242
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,680
has reached preliminary agreements

243
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,800
with the

244
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,580
three top five restaurants in the city.

245
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,120
Once our project is launched,

246
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,420
they'll start settling in right away.

247
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,460
Manager An, I appreciate your hard work.

248
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,380
You've taken on a lot for Zhengyan.

249
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,620
He should really appreciate you.

250
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,240
You're flattering me.

251
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,700
I'm only doing my job.

252
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,600
But yeah, Mr. Shu is
a few years younger than me.

253
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,380
At his age, people should be

254
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,780
settling down and getting married.

255
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,900
Is it connected?
How long will it take?

256
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,460
In a minute. In a minute.

257
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,340
Do you want to kill me?

258
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,540
I'm the one more injured, okay?

259
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,580
You did it on purpose.

260
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,220
It serves you right.

261
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,700
Signal's back.

262
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,860
I have a meeting now.

263
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,340
(Video conference)

264
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,820
Mr. Shu is here.

265
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,020
Mr. Shu is here.

266
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,940
Sorry,

267
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,480
something came up.

268
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,620
We can start now.

269
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,160
Mr. Shu, where are you?

270
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,660
It's really dark over there.

271
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,320
I'm out inspecting the food.

272
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,800
I want to add some local specialties

273
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,420
to our food street.

274
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,340
Did you go to Hua Su again?

275
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,400
No,

276
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,420
I'm inspecting the food.

277
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,680
I heard Hua Su

278
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,360
has been shut down for rectification

279
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,420
due to food safety issues.

280
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,320
Honestly, I think this is

281
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,660
good news for us.

282
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,780
We should take advantage
of this opportunity.

283
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,640
Yes, indeed. It's a good opportunity.

284
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,480
True.

285
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,800
Mr. Shu,

286
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,840
why not take this chance

287
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,900
and buy out Hua Su?

288
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,340
That way, we can move forward
with the SAGA Food Street Plan.

289
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,600
Yes, that's right.

290
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,120
I think that's a good idea.

291
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,480
(I've heard that)

292
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,040
(there are often paranormal events)

293
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,180
(in the mountain area.)

294
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,780
What was that?

295
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,380
Nothing,

296
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,940
my computer is broken.

297
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,940
Let me have a look.

298
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,900
Let me have a look.

299
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,020
Give it to me.

300
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,000
Mr. Shu,

301
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,420
where exactly are you?

302
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,800
I... I...

303
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,520
I'm on the road, on the road.

304
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,580
What was that sound?

305
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,100
N-Nothing.

306
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,740
Where exactly are you, Mr. Shu?

307
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,880
The signal's bad here.

308
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,920
I'll move to a better spot.

309
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,260
Keep it down. I'm in a meeting.

310
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,900
- Shu Zhengyan!
- Run!

311
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,420
Ghost!

312
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,760
There's a ghost!

313
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,840
What's wrong with you?

314
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,620
I can't even take a crap in peace.

315
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,340
(Organic Milk Farm)

316
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,720
Listen,

317
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,980
are you a man or not?

318
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,480
You cried out first.

319
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,100
Ever since I met you, I...

320
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,140
My luck's gone downhill.

321
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,040
Wait a minute.

322
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,860
Is that thing here?

323
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,400
We're here.

324
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,940
Stop. What are you doing?

325
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,840
Where are you going?

326
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,780
Sir, is the person in charge here now?

327
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,200
What? Why?

328
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,040
The milk you sent was spoiled.

329
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,480
I called earlier today.

330
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,500
It's off-hours. Go home.

331
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,740
Off-hours?

332
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,800
But our customers are food poisoned

333
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,940
from the bad milk
and are in the hospital.

334
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,700
You've got to let me in today.

335
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,640
No, no entry.

336
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,200
- It's off-hours.
- Why can't I get in?

337
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,240
I called earlier.

338
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,200
- It's off-hours. Come back tomorrow.
- Don't stop me.

339
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,160
I called earlier today.

340
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,800
- No, no, no.
- Let me go.

341
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,320
- You can't go in.
- I...

342
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,900
- No entry.
- Alright, let's go.

343
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,640
Hey, hands off me.

344
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,660
- Alright, it's okay.
- Come back tomorrow.

345
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,200
- Go home.
- Okay. Fine.

346
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,140
Listen to me.

347
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,800
It's so late.

348
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,800
They're just slacking off
and passing the buck.

349
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,760
It's your fault.
If you hadn't wasted time,

350
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,920
we wouldn't be here this late.

351
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,280
It's my fault?

352
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,240
I'm losing money because of

353
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,400
Hua Su's shutdown over this matter.

354
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,240
I must go in today,

355
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,460
no matter what happens.

356
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,920
That guy's guiding there.

357
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,940
How can you get in?

358
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,900
How can I get in...

359
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,300
Are you in good health?

360
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,080
Hurry, hurry.

361
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,260
Hi, Honey.

362
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,940
I'm not off work yet.

363
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,980
Less than an hour to go.

364
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,700
Why the rush?

365
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,740
I know.

366
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:08,920
Hey, listen.

367
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,820
Has our son finished his homework?

368
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,080
Alright, alright.

369
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,340
Tell him

370
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,220
I'll buy him bubble tea after work.

371
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,520
Is that okay?

372
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,580
Alright, alright, let me check.

373
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,660
