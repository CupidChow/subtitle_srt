Lady, we are closing.

32
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,640
Fang Meng.

33
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,320
The appearance of these dishes

34
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,460
and their taste are both good.

35
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,080
- But...
- These dishes

36
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,100
are made by a three-star Michelin chef.

37
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,080
It doesn't matter.

38
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,400
I'm just curious

39
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,920
what kind of person

40
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,980
makes you go to such lengths
to prepare for.

41
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,480
Yin Miaolan, a master chef

42
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,600
and an expert on molecular gastronomy.

43
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,800
Her restaurant has received

44
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,000
a Michelin three-star rating abroad.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,560
To her, every dish is a piece of art.

46
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,660
She cannot tolerate any flaws
in a work of art.

47
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,480
So,

48
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,880
the selection of ingredients

49
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,060
and the final plating

50
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,660
should all be carefully selected.

51
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,200
Now that you mention it,

52
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,620
it reminds me of someone.

53
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,280
Who?

54
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,380
It's all in the past.

55
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,400
Let's not talk about it.

56
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,080
Anyway,

57
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,580
she's a very hard person to deal with.

58
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,280
But as our food consultant,

59
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,300
she will play a huge role in promoting

60
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,020
our SAGA Food Street brand.

61
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,080
Are you still running

62
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,340
this restaurant alone?

63
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,060
Do you have money to hire a chef?

64
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,260
I've heard about your dad.

65
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,520
I was really worried about you
when I heard.

66
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,360
That's why I came back to...

67
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,780
I don't have money to hire a chef.

68
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,620
But I can cook myself.

69
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,980
Your dad taught you to cook?

70
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,620
I learned it on my own.

71
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,060
If you really like cooking,

72
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,740
I can send you to the best chef school,

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,140
or you can intern at my restaurant.

74
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,880
If you keep doing

75
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,720
what you're doing now,

76
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,140
there will be no future.

77
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,640
To make a great dish,

78
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,780
everything is very meticulous

79
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,320
from selecting ingredients

80
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,740
to cooking techniques,

81
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,540
and the final plating.

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,260
Your dad's skills

83
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,380
can only support
a restaurant of this size.

84
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,060
You're right.

85
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,020
I can't even manage
such a small restaurant.

86
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,500
But how does that concern you?

87
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,040
Meng.

88
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,340
I know I owe you.

89
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,660
Because I'm your mother,

90
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,160
so I don't want you to waste time.

91
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,940
That's why I told you these.

92
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,200
Think over about the suggestions

93
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,300
I just gave you.

94
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,100
I will come to see you again.

95
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,780
Meng, who was that person?

96
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,080
Mr. Shu.

97
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,180
Ms. Yin has arrived.

98
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,760
It's her.

99
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,260
What are you doing?

100
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,500
You invited that woman?

101
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,480
This...

102
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,600
Are you sure about this?

103
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,900
Why her?

104
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,280
What do you mean?

105
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,340
What are you talking about?

106
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,020
She's my ex-wife, Fang Meng's mother.

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,660
So she's your ex-wife,
Fang Meng's mother...

108
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,600
What?

109
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,740
You must be Mr. Shu, right?

110
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,640
Ma'am.

111
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,640
Hello, Ms. Yin.

112
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,600
Hello.

113
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,940
I don't want to touch her.

114
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,580
Ms. Yin, please take a seat.

115
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,480
Mr. Shu.

116
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,000
Here.

117
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,600
Let's celebrate together

118
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,980
the return of Ms. Yin Miaolan.

119
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,440
She has officially joined Bo Fei Group

120
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,000
and become the consultant
to SAGA Food Street.

121
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,840
Ms. Yin.

122
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,200
On behalf of Bo Fei Group,

123
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,300
we'd like to extend our

124
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,660
warm welcome to you again.

125
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,200
Mr. Shu.

126
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,720
Ms. Yin.

127
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,160
At the moment,

128
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,600
all the stores in our food street

129
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,980
have already been acquired.

130
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,240
We will hold a competition

131
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,900
for introducing stores
to the food street.

132
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,040
All the stores in the city

133
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,340
can apply to participate.

134
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,340
We will select

135
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,500
the best restaurant

136
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,260
and grant it permission to enter SAGA.

137
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,940
Mr. Shu, why were you avoiding me today?

138
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,180
Ms. Yin, you misunderstood.

139
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,440
You've really helped a lot

140
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,420
to our Food Street Plan.

141
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,440
It's my honor to cooperate

142
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,540
with Bo Fei Group.

143
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,100
You should rest early tonight.

144
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,600
I will have Lin Chuxiao

145
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,180
arrange your upcoming schedule.

146
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,100
Good night, Ms. Yin.

147
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,160
Good night.

148
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,980
What's wrong, Ms. Yin?

149
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,700
Yin Xiaohua.

150
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,940
This was Yin Miaolan's former name?

151
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,020
Yeah, why would I lie to you?

152
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,020
Let's not talk about this for now.

153
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,380
I need to cooperate with her now.

154
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,860
Consider it's for me, for Hua Su,

155
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,840
could you suppress your emotions?

156
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,420
Don't mention her.

157
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,900
Just thinking about her makes me angry.

158
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,380
It's just a divorce.

159
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,900
What deep hatred could there be?

160
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,100
Do you know why I don't
teach Fang Meng to cook?

161
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,220
Because Fang Meng
has a poor sense of taste.

162
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,980
She doesn't have the talent to be a chef.

163
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,860
It's because of her.

164
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,540
What do you mean?

165
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,140
Actually, Xiaohua
was my first apprentice.

166
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,320
At that time,

167
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,940
I was working as a chef in a restaurant.

168
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,520
She loved the dishes I made

169
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,620
so she came to learn from me.

170
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,120
Slowly,

171
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,380
we ended up together.

172
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,180
I haven't even washed my hands.

173
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,340
Keep drinking.

174
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,780
Then Fang Meng came along.

175
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,340
And then,

176
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,940
she became more and more
obsessed with cooking.

177
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,920
She had to study

178
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,100
formal cooking abroad

179
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,740
and become a certified chef.

180
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,320
Slowly,

181
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,580
she began to look down
on the dishes I made.

182
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,500
I think,

183
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,660
cooking is a very casual thing.

184
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,120
As long as it tastes good, right?

185
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,100
What's the point of
all those unnecessary details?

186
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,400
- So I tried to stop her.
- What's the point of

187
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,980
plating the tomatoes?

188
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,920
Mom.

189
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,980
Fang Meng was very young when

190
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,100
we separated.

191
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,580
It's not Fang Meng's fault

192
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,460
that I don't teach her to cook.

193
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,560
Xiaohua hurt me too deeply.

194
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,220
I don't dare to teach others to cook.

195
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,420
What you're doing

196
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,100
is a bit selfish.

197
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,420
I later understood.

198
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,140
People are different.

199
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,440
Everyone

200
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,020
has the right to choose their own path.

201
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,440
I was selfish

202
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,580
in stopping Xiaohua.

203
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,400
Every time I see Fang Meng

204
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,820
so passionate about cooking,

205
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,180
I always think of her.

206
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,580
It's not fair to Fang Meng.

207
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,400
But she abandoned both of us.

208
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,380
This is the truth.

209
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,940
So over the years,

210
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,620
you haven't contacted each other?

211
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,800
We're not in the same boat anymore.

212
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,180
What's the point of contacting her?

213
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,220
Let's not mention her.

214
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,840
When does your food street

215
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,820
assessment start?

216
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,600
Tomorrow.

217
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,140
Does Fang Meng know?

218
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,660
I've already told her.

219
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,620
I wonder how she's preparing.

220
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,520
By the way,

221
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,820
your surname is Pi.

222
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,740
Yin Miaolan's surname is Yin.

223
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,300
Then why does Fang Meng
have the surname Fang?

224
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,140
How could she have the surname Fang?

225
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,740
She shares the same surname as me.

226
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,540
She didn't like the sound of it

227
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,620
and stopped me from calling her that.

228
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,220
So she's called Pi Fangmeng?

229
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,760
Doesn't it sound nice?

230
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,780

Tomorrow is the initial review.

232
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,380
Good luck, love you.

233
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,480
Pi Fangmeng.

234
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,300
How does he know my name is Pi Fangmeng?

235
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,080
This is Master Pi's outfit.

236
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,920
Wear it.

237
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,740
I believe it will bring you good luck.

238
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,800
If you have this great thing,

239
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,120
why didn't you give it to me earlier?

240
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,780
I thought it wouldn't suit you before.

241
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,000
But now it seems

242
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,020
you deserve it.

244

What are you doing?

247

Shu Zhengyan has
completely become the CEO.

248

I'm out of the game.

During his time of neglecting work,

250
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,740
I was the one running around.

251
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,000
Why? Why?

252
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,820
He gets all the benefits!

254
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,520
I saw Hua Su signed up

255

for the assessment competition.

256
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,900
Is it possible that

Shu Zhengyan

258
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,100
wants to manipulate behind the scenes

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,420
to help Hua Su
pass the assessment smoothly?

260
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,580
Then he can become the CEO,

261
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,900
and Hua Su can stay in the food street.

262
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,180

get what they want.

really amazing.

You're no worse than them.

283

Just do it.

the rules of this initial review.

Each of you needs to prepare
three signature dishes.

As long as the judges
give unanimous approval,

raise the sign on your table.

who can do this job

the competition rules.

00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,160
Please cook three signature dishes.

343
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,200
Only if all three judges approve

344
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,460
can you enter the next round.

345
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,760
After you finish cooking,

346
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,160
raise the sign on your table

347
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,720
and let our three judges

348
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,040
taste it again.

349
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,440
Alright, let's get straight

350
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,020
into the competition today.

352
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,500
Let's move into the judging session.

353
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,040
Alright, let's take a look first

354
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,100
at how the first group
of contestants are doing.

355
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,520
It seems that the three judges

356
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,420
are not satisfied with
the performance of this group.

357
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,040
Now let's see

358
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,820
if the next group of contestants
will surprise us.

359
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,640
I didn't expect the judges to be so strict.

360
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,940
The second group didn't get a vote.

361
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,300
The next group is Fang Meng
from Hua Su Restaurant.

362
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,560
The head chef of
Hua Su Restaurant, Fang Meng,

363
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,640
is a somewhat controversial contestant.

364
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,800
Hua Su Restaurant went viral online

365
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,300
because of its unpalatable dishes.

366
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,640
I wonder if they came prepared this time

367
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,740
or if they have other plans.

368
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,820
Let's just pray
for the three judges for now.

369
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,700

- This...
- What's going on here?

372
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,720
The three judges are actually

373
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,600
fighting over Hua Su's food.

374
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,440
This...

375
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,960
Where's the security?

376
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,480
Get the judges out!

377
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,940
- Is it serious?
- Give it to me!

378
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,960
This is too exaggerated!

379
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,060
Yeah.

380
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:44,900
- Let go!
- Don't take it from me!

381
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,800
Give it to me!

382
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,540
I'll make an exception

383
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,220
and let you hug this time.

384
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,900
Cheers!

385
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,220
Fang Meng, I knew you'd make it.

386
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,620
Of course.

387
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,260
Fang Meng is exceptionally talented.

388
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,560
Or I wouldn't have followed her.

389
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,640
Stop it.

390
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,620
- You're the talker now.
- Dazui.

391
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,940
What do you mean by that?

392
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,820
Would she have succeeded

393
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,180
without Mr. Shu?

394
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,280
Fang Meng,

395
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,320
thought you can't taste

396
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,300
this food,

397
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,120
can you feel

398
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,460
the taste of love?

399
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,260
Here, Meng, love is here.

400
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,780
What about me?

401
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,140
Is no one taking care of me?

402
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,820
Aren't you in love?

403
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,060
Who's in love?

404
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,700
Mr. Shu, I'll toast to you.

405
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,080
- Here, your love.
- Mr. Shu, I'll toast to you.

406
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,100
Let's go! Let's go!

407
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,360
Surprise!

408
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,340
Fang Meng.

409
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,440
Congratulations, you passed
the initial review.

410
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,220
Thank you, thank you.

411
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,820
Zhengyan, long time no see!

412
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,860
Fang Meng, congratulations.

413
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,020
- An'an.
- Thank you.

414
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,660
What's happening? Tell me about it.

415
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,640
Let me make it clear.

416
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,780

What?

427
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,860
Getting married?

Doctor Xie.

434
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,260
What exactly have you two
gone through?

435
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,980
Seems like Doctor Xie is sick too.

436
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,600
I just casually told my friend

437
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,900
I want to have a destination wedding.

438
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,040
And he remembered, so...

439
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,900
We're going to this place.

440
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,060
Isn't this one on the list too?

441
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,840
Then we should go to this one too.

442
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,800
Didn't you tell me last time

443
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,940
we need to go to these two first?

444
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,280
Alright, alright.

445
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,380
I'll listen to you, baby.

446
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,900
No, you said last time

447
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,680
we'd go to this one.

448
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,140
Should I go back to work first?

449
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,900
I'll go back to work!

450
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,020
Right, these two.

451
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,220
And this one too.

452
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,860
- No, no, no.
- Why are you looking at me?

453
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,500
I just think it's more interesting

454
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,420
to watch others in love.

455
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,260
I can do it too, okay?

456
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,000
Tell me, where do you want to go?

457
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,100
We'll go tomorrow.

458
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,180
No more competition?

459
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,540
You are the most important.

460
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,800
How about the movie? It's too late!

461
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,300
Where's Sweetie?

462
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,600
An'an, I've already put Sweetie
in the trunk.

463
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,720
We can leave right away.

464
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,500

- Let's go.

465
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,120

466
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,380

I'm so happy today.

471
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,940
- I don't want to go back.
- Alright, alright.

472
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,900
- I want to drink more.
- We're here. Let's go.

473
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,940
- Are we really home?
- Yes, we're home.

474
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,620
- We're home.
- Be careful.

475
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,320
Should we drink a little more?

476
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,500
Sit down first.

478
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,020
I'm so happy today.

479
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,980
Hug me.

480
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,460
I'm happy too.

481
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,820
Do you know?

482
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,740
Today, Xie Jun, An'an,

483
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,680
Gao Ying, and Dazui,

484
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,300
they all came.

485
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,220
I won the competition.

486
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,700
Aren't I here too?

487
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,460
I like you the most.

488
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,620
I really like you.

489
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:11,260
I like you very, very much.

490
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,180
It's so good to have you here.

491
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,300
Do you know what I like about you?

492
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,440
What?

493
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,980
I like the way you look

494
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,900
when you teach me how to cook.

495
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,900
You look super cool.

496
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,590
At that time,

497
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,540
you look different from usual.

498
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,580
Especially cool.

499
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,140
I really like you.

500
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,680
You need to keep teaching me

501
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,260
and keep staying with me.

502
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,920
Okay.

503
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,560
Alright.

504
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,740
Let me take you upstairs.

505
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,040
- Be good.
- I can go up myself.

506
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,660
Go, I'll take you upstairs.

507
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,070
- Be careful.
- I'm fine by myself.

508
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,900
Are you okay?

509
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,900
Do you think

510
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,820
I'm your girlfriend?

511
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,920
Of course you are.

512
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,180
Did you drink too much?

513
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,900
I just feel so frustrated.

514
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,900
Why don't you want to make it public?

515
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,100
I want to take you
to meet my friends too.

516
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,260
I want to take you to meet my family.

517
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,900
I want to travel with you too.

518
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,180
- I also want to...
- I want to keep trying.

519
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,120
I want you to prove to your family

520
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,200
and your friends

521
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,860
how excellent your boyfriend is.

522
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,000
I don't want people to think
I rely on you, you know?

523
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,380
I don't need you to be that excellent.

524
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,620
I just need to know
how much you like me.

525
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,220
Isn't that Assistant Lin?

526
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,260
You guys are here too?

527
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,300
Is that your girlfriend?

528
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,820
Just a friend. I'm looking after her.

529
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,120
Okay, you guys enjoy yourselves.

530
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,220

This Fang Meng

541
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,500
is the girlfriend
of the organizer, Mr. Shu.

542
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,260
The judges on stage have

543
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,180
probably been bought off already.

544
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,560
The three judges yesterday

545
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,660
really worked hard.

546
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,420
Their acting skills were lame.

547
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,840
Don't take this competition
too seriously.

548
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,820
Just treat it as a game.

Please, go ahead.

552
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,920
- Please go ahead.
- You go first.

Come, please.

Okay, okay.

00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,260
Can the three judges show your scores?

556
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,980
Alright, I announce,

00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,820
Chef Fang Meng
from Hua Su Restaurant

558
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,380
