(Fang Meng)

37
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,060
I'll be waiting for you
at Taihu Restaurant.

38
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,520
What are you wearing?

39
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,220
Don't you have something looser?

40
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,100
What are you doing?

41
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,400
You control what I eat,
and now you're controlling what I wear?

42
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,440
It's uncomfortable.

43
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,540
Come on, change your clothes.

44
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,500
Where are you taking me?

45
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,680
It's your first date.

46
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,140
You're probably nervous.

47
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,600
Just relax.

48
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,440
It'll be fine.

49
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,940
I told you

50
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,180
you should've come with me.

51
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,160
Are you kidding me?

52
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,440
If I go with you,

53
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,880
this isn't gonna end well for me

54
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,340
when Mr. Shu resumes his post.

55
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,100
He's already 5 minutes late.

56
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,300
Isn't that too much?

57
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,820
Don't overthink it.

58
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,380
He must care about this date,

59
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,500
so he's probably dressing up

60
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,580
to surprise you.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,840
Fang Meng.

62
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,860
What are we doing today?

63
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,460
Don't you have any plans?

64
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,940
Let me think.

65
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,620
What's with your outfit?

66
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,020
Even my Dad wouldn't wear that.

67
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,100
You're overestimating him.

68
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,640
Let's go.

69
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,660
Where to go?

70
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,540
Let's go watch a movie.

71
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,630
I want to play basketball.

72
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,950
I want to be as strong as my idol.

73
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,120
Well,

74
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,180
I didn't expect

75
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,060
you to prefer children's movies.

76
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,880
It's fine.

77
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,260
It's pretty good.

78
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,360
We'll win
the Grassland Basketball Game.

- What?

I'm sorry.

96
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,540
Sorry?

97
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,320
This is our first date!

98
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,920
Look at what you've done!

99
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,780
You were late,

100
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,780
fell asleep at the movie,

101
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,660
and dressed like this!

102
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,420
What are you wearing?

103
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,680
You dressed better

104
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,060
for rowing in Peach Blossom Town.

105
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,780
I really didn't mean to.

106
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,880
Forget it.

107
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,500
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

108
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,020
Believe you?

109
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,640
Believe what?

110
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,480
I…

111
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,840
Fang Meng, are you okay?

112
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,060
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

113
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,680
Fang Meng,

114
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,940
I really care

115
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,500
about this date.

116
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,260
So,

117
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,660
please forgive me.

118
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,420
Don't be mad, okay?

119
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,220
Just this once.

120
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,560
Nothing.

121
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,560
Come on.

122
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,980
Would you give me a break?

123
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,740
You're all set, beautiful!

124
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,500
What's wrong? You seem upset.

125
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,140
You have a bad date?

126
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,380
Let me ask you.

127
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,220
Am I pretty?

128
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,820
Of course you are.

129
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,500
Then why do I have no charm

130
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,420
in Shu Zhengyan's eyes?

131
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,180
What did he do?

132
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,340
I'm his girlfriend, right?

133
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,840
Yes.

134
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,420
But it seems like

135
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,580
he doesn't want to touch me.

136
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,580
It's as if I'm a picara.

137
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,660
He's not manly at all!

138
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,980
Seriously?

139
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,820
Why would I lie?

140
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,200
Could it be because

141
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,060
this is his first relationship,

142
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,420
and he's clueless?

143
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,980
He reads so many CEO romance novels.

144
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,060
Shouldn't he have learned something?

145
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,180
CEO romance novels?

146
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,900
I just had a wild thought.

147
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,160
Go on.

148
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,000
Shu Zhengyan has

149
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,300
never dated before.

150
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,040
Do you think he might be…

151
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,900
might be…

152
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,900
No way.

153
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,340
We've kissed before.

154
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,140
But that was before.

155
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,420
Now you say he avoids you.

156
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,980
So, what should I do?

157
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,940
Why don't you test it out?

158
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,680
How?

159
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,740
Why are you so mad?

160
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,760
Yes, you're her Dad,

161
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,020
so I can't get to do anything now?

162
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,820
Take things step by step.

163
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,000
It's your first date,

164
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,120
and you want to get physical.

165
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,280
What are you trying to do?

166
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,600
I'm trying to date her!

167
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,440
You…

168
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm inside you.

169
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,960
How can you date her?

170
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,040
It's like I'm dating her!

171
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,300
But you can't get in the way
of her happiness.

172
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,180
It's not about that.

173
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,880
I just can't accept

174
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,820
I'm dating her.

175
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,040
Think about it.

176
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,760
You hold her left hand,

177
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,420
which means I hold her left hand.

178
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,180
You put your arm around her,

179
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,040
which means I put my arm around her.

180
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,460
Who can accept this?

181
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,060
But this is my body.

182
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,420
And I'm still inside it.

183
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,100
So you're saying

184
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,280
as long as you're here,

185
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,260
I can't date Fang Meng?

186
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,500
Exactly.

187
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,220
You want to date my daughter,

188
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,180
and take advantage of her.

189
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,340
What are you thinking?

190
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,100
Fang Meng,

191
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,460
you must hold on for me.

192
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,140
You're still up?

193
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,180
Today during the day,

194
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,740
I was a bit too impatient.

195
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,020
So,

196
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,740
I wanted to apologize.

197
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,740
It's… it's okay.

198
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,820
It's… it's my fault.

199
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,940
Do you think

200
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,420
it's a bit hot

201
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,500
in here?

202
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,240
Hot?

203
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,380
I feel it's a bit hot.

204
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,900
So… hug me.

205
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,800
Hug me.

206
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,240
Hug me!

207
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,540
Are you turning into a butterfly
and wanna fly away?

208
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,720
No.

209
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,600
Then hug me.

210
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,220
Sorry.

211
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,500
Shu Zhengyan!

212
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,020
What's wrong with you?

213
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
I must be crazy!

214
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,660
What am I doing?

215
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,100
So embarrassing!

216
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,860
- Mark, long time no see.
- Shu.

217
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,460
It's been a while.

218
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,140
I missed you so much.

219
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,560
Did you miss me?

220
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,180
Alright, alright. Put me down.

221
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,180
Come on, let's get started.

222
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,360
Okay.

223
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,840
Take it slow.

224
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,540
Why are you in such a hurry?

225
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,760
I can't help it.

226
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,220
I just want to make my move!

227
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,960
You captured my pawn with your cannon.

228
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,880
However,

229
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,700
I can take your cannon with my knight.

230
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,520
By the way,

231
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,900
when are you heading back?

232
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,660
In a couple of days.

233
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,340
I almost forgot the main thing.

234
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,000
I've submitted your medical report

235
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,600
to your Company.

236
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,700
You have no mental issues.

237
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,460
Looks like you'll be back
to work soon.

238
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,100
Alright. Focus on the game.

239
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,580
Your king

240
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,420
is about to be checkmated.

241
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,020
Oh no, Gao Ying!

242
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,020
I really hit the jackpot.

243
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,300
Oh my! No way!

244
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,900
Fang Meng, come down.

245
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,260
I'll introduce you to a friend.

246
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,820
He also wants to introduce us.

247
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,860
Are you two done?

248
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,920
Yes.

249
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,900
We just finished.

250
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,300
Mark, this is Fang Meng.

251
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,520
Fang Meng,

252
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,580
let me introduce you.

253
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,100
This is my best buddy, Mark.

254
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,580
Nice to finally meet you.

255
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,220
No need for a handshake.

256
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,780
Wh-what's with the attitude?

257
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,220
Your girlfriend seems

258
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,940
a little short-tempered.

259
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,900
I upset her last night.

260
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,140
Don't mind her.

261
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,020
Come on. I'll see you off.

262
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,000
Your medical report

263
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,460
has been submitted
to the Board of Directors.

264
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,380
Return to work on Monday.

265
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,860
Okay, Dad.

266
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,000
By the way,

267
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,620
there's one more important thing.

268
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,160
Dad, I've finished the assignments.

269
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,140
You don't have to remind me.

270
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,400
Assignments?

271
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,700
What assignments?

272
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,020
You know how important

273
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,760
the SAGA Food Street Plan is

274
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,500
for Bo Fei Group.

275
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,980
But look at you now.

276
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,500
You can't even finish the first step:

277
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,220
acquiring existing shops.

278
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,780
Hua Su's landlady has
such a bad reputation,

279
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,680
yet you kept her home
as your private chef.

280
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,780
What were you thinking?

281
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,240
Well,

282
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,140
look at your outfit.

283
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,820
Is this her aesthetic or yours?

284
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,400
Do you know

285
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,240
everyone laughs behind your back?

286
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,200
Do you know

287
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,440
how this affects your image

288
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,340
in the Company?

289
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,240
Do you know

290
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,080
how to get
through your CEO qualifying period?

291
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,100
Think about it carefully.

292
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,060
Oh, there's another important thing.

293
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,200
What is it?

294
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,860
Finish the assignments.

295
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,380
Don't let your mom
cut my allowance again.

296
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,100
Gently, gently.

297
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,020
If it breaks, I'll have to pay for it.

298
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,540
I've been meaning
to talk to you about something.

299
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,340
Something serious.

300
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,520
Go ahead.

301
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,640
Shu Zhengyan's father, Shu Bojian,

302
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,480
asked Shu Zhengyan
to fix things with you

303
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,580
before returning to work on Monday.

304
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,740
Things with me?

305
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,180
Aren't you now his private chef?

306
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,420
Shu Bojian has a significant problem
with this.

307
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,840
Plus,

308
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,860
you refused Hua Su's acquisition before.

309
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,380
So, the Company's upset with him.

310
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,480
Additionally,
the Board of Directors previously thought

311
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,660
Shu Zhengyan had mental issues.

312
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,740
Wasn't that to speak up for you?

313
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,180
I get it.

314
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,260
Was his attitude to me before

315
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,060
because of his father?

316
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,700
I think he will listen to his father.

317
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,760
There's no way

318
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,860
that Shu Bojian would let him
give up Bo Fei Group for you.

319
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,700
After all, this Group was built
by Shu Bojian himself.

320
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,480
Fine.

321
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,000
Now,

322
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,160
name your price

323
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,740
to leave my son.

324
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,620
Uncle Shu,

325
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,020
we are truly in love!

326
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,240
Shu Zhengyan,

327
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,500
tell your Papi.

328
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,620
I'd never abandon my Papi for you.

329
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,580
Stop dreaming!

330
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,740
Shu Zhengyan,

331
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,200
you're so cruel!

332
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,100
It's fate.

333
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,340
We were never meant to be

334
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,660
since we were born.

335
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,260
Am I right, Papi?

336
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,220
Don't overthink it.

337
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,380
He hasn't said anything yet.

338
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,640
But

339
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,280
if his father was pressuring him

340
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,580
so much,

341
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,720
he could've told me directly

342
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,260
instead of avoiding me.

343
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,880
That's true.

344
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,380
I'll leave myself

345
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,700
rather than wait for him
to push me away.

346
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,240
You…

347
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,540
Don't go. Wait for me!

348
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,640
Fang Meng,

349
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,840
you don't have to cook today.

350
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,780
I'll handle it.

351
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,400
Fang Meng?

352
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,700
Fang Meng.

353
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,520
Fang Meng!

354
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,800
Fang Meng?

355
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,040
Xu,

356
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,020
where's Doctor Xie?

357
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,700
He's on leave.

358
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,260
Long time no see, Miss Shen.

359
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,660
He has taken leave.

360
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,060
On leave…

361
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,820
(Bread is the Staff of Life)

362
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,260
Why did you leave suddenly?

363
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,260
You seem to be well.

364
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,020
You don't need me to cook for you.

365
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,960
Moreover, I've saved enough money

366
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,540
to reopen Hua Su.

367
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,120
But we haven't recreated

368
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,380
all the six dishes.

369
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,420
I can figure it out myself.

370
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,040
Plus,

371
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,060
it's almost been a month, right?

372
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,020
Focus on your work
after resuming your post.

373
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,820
Don't let others down.

374
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,740
Who told you
that I'm about to resume my post?

375
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,740
It doesn't matter.

376
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,860
Anyway,

377
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,280
I'll try to recreate my Dad's dishes

378
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,740
at Hua Su,

379
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,100
and you focus on your work as a CEO.

380
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,280
