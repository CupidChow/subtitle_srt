31
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,800
I can't hear you speaking.

32
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,100
See?

33
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,980
It's what happens if you don't listen.

34
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,820
Shut up.

35
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,740
Mr. Shu, it's not what you want...

36
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,580
Get out.

37
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,180
Mr. Shu.

38
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,700
Awful.

39
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,660
I've checked it out.

40
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,460
Hua Su is one of the stubborn tenants

41
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,920
in the SAGA Food Street.

42
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,260
But now, for some reason,

43
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,760
it suddenly became very popular.

44
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,320
They're very likely to raise the price.

45
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,060
So I have two options.

46
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,900
First,

47
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,680
we hire online supporters

48
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,740
to exert public pressure,

49
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,480
suppressing their value.

50
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,780
Second, be straightforward.

51
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,900
We simply

52
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,440
increase our purchase price.

53
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,720
I wonder which of these two options

54
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,520
you prefer?

55
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,240
(Mustn't let him find out my problem.)

56
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,200
(What did he say?)

57
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,300
Hello.

58
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,740
Hello, Mr. Shu.

59
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,200
Are you listening to me?

60
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,020
Okay.

61
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,380
Okay, huh?

62
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,460
What does that mean?

63
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,600
I ask you about these two plans,

64
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,940
which one do you think is more suitable?

65
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,800
(An Zhijiang can't find me for good,)

66
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,280
(probably worrying about my body again.)

67
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,700
Mr. Shu?

68
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,680
Manager An,

69
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,600
no need to worry about my health.

70
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,680
You should focus on your own duties.

71
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,240
Don't meddle in other matters.

72
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,560
What?

73
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,140
I…

74
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,220
No.

75
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,180
Mr. Shu,

76
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,220
you assigned this task to me.

77
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,760
Now you're telling me to stay out of it.

78
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,380
Mr. Shu,

79
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,520
do you have any issues with me?

80
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:58,940
(Awful.)

81
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,200
(Look at this reaction.)

82
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,920
(Didn't he ask this?)

83
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,960
(Forget it, I'll make another guess.)

84
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,760
Manager An,

85
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,400
you've been working hard lately.

86
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,920
Just follow my original plan.

87
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,660
I just asked you for a while.

88
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,820
I mentioned two options.

89
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,300
Which one do you prefer?

90
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,680
You haven't given me an answer.

91
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,360
Manager An,

92
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,720
Mr. Shu is feeling a bit unwell today.

93
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,600
Perhaps you could come another day.

94
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,020
Really?

95
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,000
Then I will

96
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,560
come another day.

97
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,440
Are you okay, Mr. Shu?

98
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,540
Don't talk to me now.

99
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,400
I can't hear you.

100
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,200
I have something to tell you.

101
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,800
The me you see

102
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,160
is like this.

103
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,840
But the real me

104
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,120
is like this.

105
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,600
Every time my stomach growls,

106
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,100
a voice in my head starts talking to me.

107
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,780
Whatever it tells me to eat, I have to.

108
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,580
It even controls my body.

109
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,020
If I try to resist,

110
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,160
there will be a headache

111
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,440
or other problems.

112
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,200
I can't hear because of his mischief.

113
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,560
Oh no, something's wrong with his mind.

114
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,560
I suspect this is related to Fang Meng.

115
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,280
Judging by your expression,

116
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,000
you must be wondering too, right?

117
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,900
Every time I have a physical problem,

118
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,300
as long as I eat her food, I get better.

119
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,400
That sound will also
disappear immediately.

120
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,560
Remember the legend of the Gemini Comet?

121
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,280
That's when it all started.

122
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,300
Mr. Shu,

123
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,480
are you really okay?

124
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,060
Don't talk to me,

125
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:15,960
I can't hear you.

126
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,020
Let's go to Hua Su.

127
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,840
I need to figure this out immediately.

128
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,260
Fang Meng,

129
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,040
your business is doing so well now.

130
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,520
Congratulations to you.

131
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,060
Actually, they are not all here

132
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,360
for my skills.

133
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,120
I know it myself.

134
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,580
By the way,

135
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,600
I brought a gift.

136
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,940
This is a cookbook

137
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,580
I had someone bring from abroad.

138
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,480
Take a look.

139
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,800
Hope it helps you.

140
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,800
Thank you, Xie Jun.

141
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,450
But I still need to figure out my dad's

142
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,080
six signature dishes.

143
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,640
I will keep your gift.

144
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:03,940
You're welcome.

145
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,020
By the way,

146
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,560
the Calm Milk Volcano Noodles,

147
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,660
I've actually improved it a few times.

148
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,260
The latest version is in the kitchen.

149
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,180
I'll bring it for you.

150
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,240
Actually, no need...

151
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,480
Try it, how does it taste this time?

152
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,600
Is it delicious?

153
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,360
It's very tasty!

154
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,760
Bro, you're tough.

155
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,480
But I'm a bit confused.

156
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,760
Why do others say it's not tasty?

157
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,580
Fang Meng,

158
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,240
remember what you said when little?

159
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,560
Everyone has different tastes.

160
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,120
So don't listen to others.

161
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,440
I believe in you.

162
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,720
You can do even better.

163
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,760
Thank you.

164
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,340
By the way,

165
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,060
I have one more dish.

166
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,240
Could you try it for me?

167
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,590
- No need.
- Please try it for me.

168
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,840
- Thank you for your gift.
- I…

169
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,060
(Hua Su)

170
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,540
Thank you for your gift.

171
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,160
Today, you enjoyed your meal.

172
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,780
If I recreate another dish,

173
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,360
I'll definitely invite you to try it.

174
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,220
Alright.

175
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,360
It's a deal then.

176
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,160
It's a deal.

177
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,460
Bye-bye.

178
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,500
Bye.

179
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,920
Doctor Xie is here, Mr. Shu.

180
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,940
I think the dish Fang Meng made

181
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,320
must be poisonous.

182
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,920
Dazui,

183
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,200
go and calculate today's bill.

184
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,600
It's almost time to close.

185
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,220
Alright.

186
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,500
You're here.

187
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,480
Where is Gao Ying?

188
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,480
Don't mention knowing me or Gao Ying.

189
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,000
Why are you pretending?

190
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,440
That's my boss.

191
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,560
Your boss…

192
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,500
What's wrong with knowing me?

193
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,680
You wouldn't understand.

194
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,640
Why are you here?

195
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,080
Can I order food?

196
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,080
Didn't you look down on the food I made?

197
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,540
Fang Meng,

198
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,380
just make a dish.

199
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,440
Anything is fine.

200
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,120
I'm sorry.

201
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,880
We've finished work for today.

202
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,380
Just make one.

203
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,880
My boss can't hear right now.

204
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,960
So I don't have time to explain to you.

205
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,490
Just make one.

206
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,160
He can't hear?

207
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,920
So young and already deaf.

208
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,660
I'll give you five times the price.

209
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,180
Hurry up, five times the price.

210
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,160
Five times?

211
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,780
Do you call the shots?

212
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,800
I do.

213
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:46,900
Go, hurry up.

214
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,880
It's a deal.

215
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,020
Then…

216
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,100
Okay.

217
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,040
Go take a look.

218
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,480
This kitchen is not open for visits.

219
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,320
Haven't there always been visitors?

220
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,820
What?

221
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,400
Just okay.

222
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,900
Move aside, Dazui.

223
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,740
No, I won't.

224
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,780
Did you grow up eating glass
so you can't talk?

225
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,280
I grew up eating landmines.

226
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,860
No, I won't.

227
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,420
Mr. Shu.

228
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,920
What is that smell? So unpleasant.

229
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,920
Don't you like this?

230
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,000
Who said I like that?

231
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,280
It's quite unpleasant,

232
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,640
however,

233
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,800
you can't resist eating it, right?

234
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,380
If I eat it,

235
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,800
will my hearing be restored?

236
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,680
How's it?

237
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,580
We must agree in advance.

238
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,120
Even if it's not good, don't back out.

239
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,120
Not a penny less.

240
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,400
Who taught you to cook?

241
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,200
Mr. Shu, can you hear me?

242
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,920
I learned it myself.

243
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,260
No wonder

244
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,440
you don't have a mentor
with dishes like this.

245
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,140
I really can't understand.

246
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,080
You look down on my cooking.

247
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,480
Why did you come here to eat today?

248
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,480
What for?

249
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,040
Let's make a deal.

250
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,680
I can meet your conditions.

251
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,440
But don't threaten me with my body.

252
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,640
I can choose not to threaten you.

253
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,000
However,

254
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,220
every time I smell this scent,

255
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,640
I must eat it immediately,

256
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,240
or my head will hurt.

257
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,000
I can't control that.

258
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,720
Be my private chef.

259
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,500
What?

260
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,920
I'm inviting you to be my private chef.

261
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,040
I don't want to.

262
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,540
Why?

263
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,520
First, it seems like
you're playing with me.

264
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,500
Second, I don't want to cook for you.

265
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,380
I wouldn't be happy.

266
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,720
You wouldn't be satisfied either.

267
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,160
So I think

268
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,040
you should find someone more capable.

269
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,560
What are you looking at?

270
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,800
What if I'm looking at you?

271
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,900
Stop that. If you keep bumping,

272
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,760
you'll become a fool.

273
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,660
If I weren't foolish,

274
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,940
would I refuse such a lucrative job?

275
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,880
You righteously refused it yourself.

276
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,420
I really felt great when I said it.

277
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,700
Who knows why Mr. Shu

278
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,220
didn't even stop me

279
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,980
and let me go directly.

280
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,880
Alright, it's all his fault

281
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,580
for not giving you a way out.

282
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,840
More than that,

283
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,860
he insulted my cooking.

284
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,760
Tell me

285
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,320
why he hired me as a private chef.

286
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,360
Is it to humiliate me?

287
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,960
Alright, don't be angry anymore.

288
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,640
How could it be?

289
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,440
That's a lot of money.

290
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,420
Mr. Shu,

291
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,720
I heard you wanted to see me.

292
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,020
I asked you to resolve

293
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,000
the food street contract.

294
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,340
Are you making any progress?

295
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,880
Why is there no news at all?

296
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,860
The company is hiring all of you

297
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,400
just for nothing?

298
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,420
No, Mr. Shu.

299
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,340
Last time we came here…

300
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,700
Hua Su caused such a negative impact

301
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,780
through the short video platform.

302
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,480
You haven't even provided a plan.

303
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,720
Mr. Shu,

304
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,380
last time they came to see you,

305
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,680
it seemed to be about the plan.

306
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,560
I don't think your plan will work.

307
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,690
It's very unreasonable.

308
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,780
So

309
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,720
I offer you two options.

310
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,860
First,

311
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,460
utilize online public opinion

312
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,580
to create pressure on the restaurant.

313
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,620
Second, take a straightforward approach,

314
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,200
directly raising the price.

315
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,520
Right, Mr. Shu?

316
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,440
Mr. Shu, perhaps you should consider...

317
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,360
Take a good rest.

318
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,400
How does he know about my plan?

319
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,360
Did you tell him?

320
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,120
Mr. Shu.

321
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,460
You look absent-minded.

322
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,720
Are you still thinking about Fang Meng?

323
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,240
But I really don't understand.

324
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,320
You said you wanted to hire her

325
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,840
and she rejected it.

326
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,760
Are you or she crazy?

327
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,400
Or are you joking?

328
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,260
Do you remember what I told you?

329
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,420
There's often someone

330
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,680
talking to me in my mind.

331
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,040
Isn't this also a joke?

332
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,060
Could it be

333
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,480
that I really have a mental illness?

334
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:41,610
Shh,

335
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,450
don't say that carelessly.

336
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,710
What if An Zhijiang and others hear it?

337
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,940
That's why I asked Fang Meng

338
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,640
to be my private chef.

339
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,000
I can't possibly go to Hua Su every day.

340
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,340
Hua Su is now a stubborn tenant.

341
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,780
I cannot have any contact with it.

342
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,980
But having her as your private chef

343
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,400
is a good strategy.

344
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,380
Think about it.

345
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,440
If she becomes your private chef,

346
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,120
she won't have time to manage Hua Su.

347
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,560
Then wouldn't Hua Su stop operating?

348
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,720
I never intended for it
to stop operating.

349
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,580
Even if there were an acquisition,

350
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,040
I would ensure the correct procedures.

351
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,440
Now I'm only concerned about my health.

352
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,280
Regarding my health condition,

353
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,400
you must not tell anyone,

354
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,800
including Gao Ying.

355
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,060
Gao Ying?

356
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,460
How could I possibly tell Gao Ying?

357
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,880
Why should I talk to her?

358
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,720
Gao Ying is your girlfriend, right?

359
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,640
Let's go to Hua Su.

360
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,400
Didn't she just reject you?

361
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,800
I guess she's waiting for a way out.

362
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,600
Then I'll give her a way out.

363
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,520
I'm not going.

364
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,480
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

365
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,780
Fang Meng,

366
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,820
Mr. Shu is a well-known culinary expert

367
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,800
and also a judge
in many cooking contests.

368
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,780
If you help him,

369
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,640
isn't that equivalent to helping Hua Su?

370
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,520
Even if he is a judge,

371
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,920
he is not a fair judge.

372
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,400
As for the last culinary competition,

373
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,040
it was my fault.

374
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,720
I apologize to you.

375
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,740
This time,

376
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,560
I sincerely invite you

377
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,320
to be my private chef.

378
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,660
Is that okay?

379
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,580
What are you hesitating about?

380
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,260
Actually, if you help Mr. Shu,

381
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,680
you'll earn much more than at Hua Su.

382
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,280
It's not about the money.

383
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,040
I apologize for everything in the past.

384
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,960
I do care about my pride.

385
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,400
Actually,

386
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,800
the meals you cook

387
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,300
are okay.

388
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,700
Really?

389
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,480
I don't believe it.

390
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,000
Really.

391
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,400
Okay.

392
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,760
I have two bowls
of freshly made noodles.

393
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,320
Try them.

394
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,340
I…

395
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,220
If you really like it,

396
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,560
then eat these noodles.

397
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,540
I had breakfast this morning.

398
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,800
I can't eat anymore.

399
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,160
Chuxiao, you try it.

400
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,320
What a coincidence, Mr. Shu.

401
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,640
I also had breakfast.

402
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,280
This is work.

403
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,700
Work?

404
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,680
Working meal.

405
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,960
It's working meal.

406
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,180
Hurry up.

407
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,180
Are you eating or not? If not, just go.

408
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,680
Eat, we'll eat.

409
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,520
Is it delicious?

410
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,960
It's delicious.

411
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,480
Then why do you have that expression?

412
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,040
Smile.

413
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,560
Thanks for your hard work.

414
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,480
Thank you.

415
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,560
Do you believe it now?

416
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,000
Believe what?

417
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,300
You hire the chef,

418
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,880
not him.

419
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,480
It's for you to eat.

420
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,900
I…

421
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,780
For me?

422
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:45,940
This…

423
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,040
How can I believe it if you don't eat?

424
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,000
But if you don't want to,

425
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,000
then drop it.

426
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,380
Go out.

427
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,160
I'll eat.

428
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,080
Is it delicious?

429
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,700
If you're not willing, then forget it.

430
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,280
You don't have to force yourself.

431
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,120
Otherwise, just drop it.

432
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,280
Delicious.

433
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,680
It's delicious.

434
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,180
You really agreed

435
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,160
to be Shu Zhengyan's private chef?

436
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,560
Yes, what's the matter?

437
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,720
Surprised?

438
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,080
I'm not surprised by this.

439
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,800
I'm surprised

440
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,120
that he has the nerve.

441
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,000
If he hadn't apologized to me,

442
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,200
I wouldn't have agreed.

443
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,920
What about Hua Su?

444
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,340
Actually, if you run it,

445
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,800
you can also earn enough money.

446
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,840
What is Hua Su like now?

447
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,520
You know very well.

448
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,220
People eat in Hua Su

449
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,540
out of curiosity,

450
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,100
not because my cooking

451
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,080
is good.

452
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,560
Besides, you don't need to worry

453
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,100
about Hua Su.

454
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,680
I've explained everything to Dazui.

455
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,480
Isn't Shu Zhengyan a gourmet expert?

456
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,360
I'm thinking,

457
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,480
maybe he can help me.

458
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,600
If I rely on myself,

459
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,400
I can't figure out those six dishes.

460
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,260
Do you really think

461
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,580
Shu Zhengyan invited you

462
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,260
because your cooking is good?

463
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,740
And if you go there,

464
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,260
will you have time for the restaurant?

465
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,580
Of course I will.

466
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,080
I'm not living at his place.

467
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,080
It better be like this.

00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,560
to bring your luggage?

492
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,160
Why should I bring luggage?

493
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,240
To live here.

494
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,800
Live here? Me?

495
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,140
You are my private chef.

496
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,480
I need you at any time.

497
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,420
You could call me in advance.

498
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,620
How far is your home from here?

499
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,860
- It takes just an hour.
- Do I have to wait for an hour?

500
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,080
What else can you do?

501
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,280
What do you want to do?

502
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,960
Quite inconvenient for just two of us.

503
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:29,920
Don't worry.

504
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,120
There are more than just two of us here.

505
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,320
You're very safe.

506
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,580
If I live here,

507
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,880
what about Hua Su?

508
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,200
That's why I offered such a high salary.

509
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,560
Can't you just hire a chef for Hua Su?

510
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,020
What?

511
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,020
Do you want to work part-time?

512
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,580
Do you know what a private chef is?

513
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,680
Alright.

514
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,520
I'll go pack my luggage in a while.

515
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,500
Am I responsible for your three meals

516
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,000
or plus a late-night snack?

517
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,880
If plus a late-night snack…

518
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,390
You're not responsible for those meals.

519
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,300
Just the late-night snack, right?

520
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,680
I never eat late-night snacks.

521
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,840
Then what should I do?

522
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,600
You just cook for me

523
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,160
when I need it.

524
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,000
As for the regular meals,

525
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,700
they are handled by Chef Li.

526
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,760
Chef Li?

527
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,200
Isn't this Chef Fang?

528
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,400
Without my permission,

529
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,680
you cannot cook any dish here.

530
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,160
If you're discovered once,

531
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,480
your salary will be halved.

532
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,180
You cannot eat foods with strong odors,

533
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,000
including but not limited

534
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,540
to spicy hot pot, barbecue, stinky tofu,

535
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,740
durian, snail rice noodles,

536
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,960
and various foods with spicy seasonings.

537
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:54,980
So

538
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,520
you called me over,

539
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,940
let me stay at your house,

540
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:58,950
but you won't let me cook.

541
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,060
What exactly do you want?

542
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,200
Shouldn't you be happy doing nothing?

543
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,580
I came to be a chef,

544
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,180
not a decoration.

545
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,880
You've already hired Chef Li.

546
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,720
And you insist on making me
the private chef.

547
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,000
Are you messing with me?

548
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,380
Shu Zhengyan, I'm telling you,

549
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,480
I'm not serving anymore.

550
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,960
The food street has been acquired.

551
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,600
Even if you go back,

552
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,000
Hua Su won't be able to open.

553
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,880
That's none of your business.

554
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,460
I will not sell Hua Su.

555
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,080
I won't be your chef either.

556
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,920
Are you really leaving?

557
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,660
Why are you so strange?

558
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,980
Even if I pay you for nothing.

559
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,960
Why should I take your money
for nothing?

560
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,560
Shu Zhengyan,

561
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,550
if you don't need me to cook for you,

562
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,420
there's no need for me

563
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,800
to stay here as a chef.

564
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,520
I didn't say you needn't to cook.

565
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,920
Just cook at special times.

566
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,940
Without the three meals

567
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,220
or a midnight snack,

568
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,280
how special can it be?

569
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,620
Speak up.

570
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,780
I remembered that taste again.

571
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,880
Stop thinking about it.

572
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,120
What are you doing?

573
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,920
The special time has come.

574
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,160
No, are you really sick?

575
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,620
I'll call the doctor for you.

576
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,180
Don't call the doctor.

577
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,400
I just want to eat the food you make.

578
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,020
Just want my dishes?

579
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,600
Didn't you just say you wouldn't?

580
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,040
Are you still pretending?

581
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,700
Beg me.

582
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,670
If you beg, I'll cook for you.

583
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:34,680
I'm begging you.

584
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,380
I just want to eat the food you make.

585
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,400
Go and cook quickly.

586
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,900
No, are you serious?

587
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,320
I really am. I'm begging you.

588
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,540
Hurry up.

589
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,240
The kitchen is just inside. Go quickly.

590
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,420
Just wait a moment, okay?

591
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,200
Hurry, go.

592
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,260
Is it ready?

593
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,580
Hurry up.

594
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,120
Who is this?

595
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,880
A special

596
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,280
relative family.

597
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,460
To cook the dish like this

598
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,560
and still be selected,

599
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,360
there must be
some other outstanding qualities.

600
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,060
Do you think
you can win that competition

601
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,680
without underhanded dealings?

602
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,500
You…

603
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,140
Okay.

604
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,280
If you're not convinced,

605
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,400
let's have a competition.

606
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,640
Shu Zhengyan!
