31
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,820
Why aren't you answering the phone,
Mr. Shu?

32
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,600
Be careful.

33
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,140
What are you doing?

34
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,140
Everyone's off work.
There's no one here.

35
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,780
Do I look good today?

36
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,980
You look good.

37
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,700
You're slacking off on me.

38
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,900
Say it again.

39
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,180
You look good.

40
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,900
Then kiss me.

41
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,940
Here?

42
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,220
Where else?

43
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,780
Better not.

44
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,040
What if someone sees us?

45
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,120
No one's here right now.

46
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,140
Come on, come on.

47
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,260
What are you two doing?

48
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,440
- Manager An.
- Manager An.

49
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,280
Manager An.

50
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,540
I think they're definitely

51
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,720
working overtime.

52
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,740
Exactly.

53
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,780
Working overtime.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,580
Isn't it obvious?

55
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,620
You two

56
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,220
didn't get ahold of a taxi.

57
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,600
Didn't get ahold of a taxi.

58
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,820
Well, Chuxiao,

59
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,220
how's Mr. Shu doing lately?

60
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,380
Have you heard from him?

61
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,180
He's been doing fine.

62
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,080
Alright.

63
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,940
Tell him from me

64
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,940
that I hope

65
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,260
he can come to the company

66
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,440
when he has time.

67
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,280
Got it?

68
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,320
Alright.

69
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,280
Understood, Manager An.

70
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,280
I'm leaving now.

71
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,540
You two head home safely.

72
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,640
Alright.

73
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,780
Didn't get ahold of a taxi.

74
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,380
What's really going on with Mr. Shu?

75
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,960
I want to know, too.

76
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,580
No word from him at all.

77
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,260
If I'd known, I'd have gone with him.

78
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,940
Are they still together?

79
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,460
I'm sorry, Uncle Niu.

80
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,260
I've caused you trouble.

81
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,360
(Organic Milk Farm)

82
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,560
It's such a small matter.

83
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,740
You could've just had Master Pi
to make a call.

84
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,020
My father…

85
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,700
passed away.

86
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,440
When…

87
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,420
when did this happen?

88
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,460
It's been a while.

89
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,040
Director, I just checked.

90
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,960
The batch of milk we delivered to Hua Su

91
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,220
was without any issues.

92
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,380
How can you prove
that there are no issues?

93
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,380
Do you have the records?

94
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,160
Please look here.

95
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,800
The milk we supply to Hua Su

96
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,520
has always been from the same batch

97
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,980
we use internally.

98
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,560
All recent batches

99
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,600
are logged here.

100
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,780
You can verify them.

101
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,420
This…

102
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,580
this is your boyfriend?

103
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,980
No, no, no.

104
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,160
Well,

105
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,540
why don't you introduce yourself?

106
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,060
Forget it, it's not important.

107
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,180
Director,

108
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,700
may I ask you a question?

109
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,740
Go ahead.

110
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,860
Do you recognize me?

111
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,260
Sorry, I don't.

112
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,540
Who are you?

113
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,200
We all know you are the CEO.

114
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,960
There's no need to mention it
to everyone.

115
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,060
I wasn't asking you.

116
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,600
Director,

117
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,300
what I meant was,

118
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,460
do I look familiar to you?

119
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,840
Are you tired?

120
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,340
Do you need a rest?

121
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,480
Hello, Mr. Shu.

122
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,380
You finally called back.

123
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,640
Where on earth are you?

124
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,080
Why didn't you reply to my messages?

125
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,300
I'm worried about you.

126
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,760
It's complicated.

127
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,140
I'll tell you when I get back.

128
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,260
For now, check for me

129
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,640
if I visited a milk farm

130
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,300
or met a boss

131
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,400
named Niu Yongtian before

132
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,660
on my recent trips.

133
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,760
Mr. Shu,

134
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,500
I told you before.

135
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,860
Yes, we have seen quite a few
milk-based foods

136
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,520
but have yet to visit

137
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,100
any production sites.

138
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,420
And among the people you've met,

139
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,020
there's a no Mr. Niu.

140
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,980
So what's this all about?

141
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,720
What about Fang Meng?

142
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,980
Are you still together?

143
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,260
Yes.

144
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,920
We're still here.

145
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,380
Gao Ying, let me tell you something.

146
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,680
I had a terrible day today.

147
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,860
I almost got arrested
for being mistaken as a thief.

148
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,640
What were you doing?

149
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,460
Weren't you investigating the milk farm?

150
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,260
You'd better ask your Mr. Shu.

151
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,340
Fortunately, I protected her in time,

152
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,620
or

153
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,660
there will be irreversible consequences.

154
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,920
How come your love story

155
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,580
suddenly turned into a drama?

156
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,260
So what else did you do?

157
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,220
You kissed Mr. Shu!

158
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,640
Yes.

159
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,560
You all know

160
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,980
he's pursuing me, don't you?

161
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,960
Yes, we know it.

162
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,980
Then tell me,

163
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,040
after a guy kisses a girl,

164
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,060
his first reaction is actually
to apologize.

165
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,820
Is he a jerk?

166
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,340
That was an accident.

167
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,700
Fang Meng is genuinely fearless.

168
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,180
Anything else?

169
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,620
Don't overthink it.

170
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,540
I just acted on impulse.

171
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,180
I thought it'd make us even.

172
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,500
I didn't think much of it.

173
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,900
You're not falling for Mr. Shu, are you?

174
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,120
You think so, too?

175
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,660
You're Bo Fei Group's CEO,

176
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,560
and are actively pursuing her.

177
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,940
How could she feel nothing?

178
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,620
How could I possibly like him?

179
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,980
I just don't understand

180
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,160
why we keep

181
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,700
getting tangled up like this.

182
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,700
Do you know what this is?

183
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,100
What?

184
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,140
The law of attraction.

185
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,800
Mr. Su and you

186
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,180
have an undeniable pull.

187
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,380
Woman, you can't escape it.

188
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,100
Fang Meng,

189
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,320
you need to learn
to support yourself from now on.

190
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,360
If you need anything,

191
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,600
just call me.

192
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,240
- Okay.
- These are local specialties

193
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,480
we grew ourselves.

194
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,760
Here, take them.

195
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,980
Thank you.

196
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm leaving now.

197
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,220
- Drive safely.
- Bye-bye.

198
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,540
I'm sorry, Mr. Shu.

199
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,560
Take this.

200
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,140
Wait, I'm not in the car yet, Mr. Shu.

201
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,940
Miss Shen.

202
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,700
Brother Xie Jun.

203
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,180
I'm not at the hospital.

204
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,300
Is something the matter?

205
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,980
It's nothing.

206
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,460
I just wanted
to show you my new toy.

207
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,780
I have work in the afternoon.

208
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,300
Maybe next time.

209
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,020
Wait, wait.

210
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,060
- Brother Xie Jun.
- Miss Shen.

211
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,040
I really can't…

212
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:09,900
Brother Xie Jun,

213
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,300
are you at the lakeside

214
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,860
wearing black?

215
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,560
How do you know?

216
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,460
Turn around, look back.

217
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,660
Brother Xie Jun.

218
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,520
Today, I'm invincible Sailor Shen An'an,

219
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,500
coming riding the waves for you!

220
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,440
Brother Xie Jun,

221
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,300
do you like it?

222
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,880
Go!

223
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,120
Brother Xie Jun, don't run!

224
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,060
Where are you going, Brother Xie Jun?

225
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,020
Guys, go!

226
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,520
Don't run!

227
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,860
Why are you avoiding me?

228
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:09,060
(Hua Su)

229
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,260
No. 12 trial
of Calm Milk Volcano Noodles,

230
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,560
begin!

231
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,720
Hey!

232
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,800
Didn't I already tell you?

233
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,300
Stay out of my kitchen!

234
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,980
I just want to learn.

235
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,840
Learn what?

236
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,260
I don't even know how to do it yet!

237
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,500
Then who taught you?

238
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,900
My Dad.

239
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,620
Was his cooking just as bad as yours?

240
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,060
♪Getting closer and closer♪

241
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,140
He's not like me.

242
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,980
He was a fantastic chef.

243
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,940
Since you have no taste,

244
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,140
why not just follow the recipe?

245
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,200
Just take a look at his recipe.

246
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,920
It's a total mess!

247
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,330
Probably only he could make sense of it.

248
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,590
♪I will be careful even when I'm sad♪

249
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,550
♪Treat you as a sensitive topic♪

♪Who knows when the clear sky

251
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,540
Meng, Fang Meng.

252
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,120
Look.

253
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,380
This is not our bucket.

254
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,920
Our buckets

255
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,920
always have dated labels,

256
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,200
but this one doesn't.

257
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,000
I clearly remember that

258
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,460
I personally attached the label.

259
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,500
This isn't ours.

260
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,820
Someone swapped our milk.

261
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,460
Who would do that?

262
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,280
If Hua Su fails,

263
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,300
who would benefit from it?

264
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,440
Besides Bo Fei Group…

265
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,180
Why exclude the Bo Fei Group?

266
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,700
We wouldn't use such malicious methods.

267
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,780
Could it be An Zhijiang?

268
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,240
Impossible.

269
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,760
If it were him,

270
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,840
this would only help me.

271
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,680
He won't do this.

272
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,820
I understand now.

273
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,440
Before acquiring Hua Su,

274
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,880
Bo Fei Group will only sign

275
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,360
intention agreements
with other vendors.

276
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,240
They only receive a deposit,

277
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,280
but not the full payment

278
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,620
until Food Street is settled

279
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,360
and the formal acquisition agreements
are signed.

280
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,500
Hua Su is their biggest obstacle.

281
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,100
They of all parties
should want Hua Su closed.

282
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,380
Is there any solution?

283
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,200
Of course there is.

284
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,800
Say it.

285
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,740
Sell Hua Su to Bo Fei Group,

286
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,500
and all problems will be solved.

287
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,440
Wait a moment.

288
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,940
There's another way.

289
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,280
This is Hua Su,

290
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,100
located at the center of Food Street.

291
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,560
Every morning at six o'clock,

292
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,920
the truck from the Original Milk Farm

293
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,600
(Original Milk Farm)
will arrive on time.

294
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,480
At that hour,

295
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,040
most shops are not yet open.

296
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,180
So, at this time, the milk is safe.

297
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,920
Every morning,

298
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,460
Dazui receives milk

299
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,780
and stores it in the storage room
in the kitchen.

300
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,820
At this point, the milk is still safe.

301
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,140
Wait a second.

302
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,540
Let me change it.

303
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,380
Okay, go on.

304
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,680
At 10 AM,

305
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,940
Hua Su officially opens.

306
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,060
Fang Meng will stay in the kitchen

307
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,640
unless something urgent

308
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,740
happens.

309
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,840
Dazui,

310
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,280
when did the guests
who got food poisoning

311
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,820
eat here?

312
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,220
How would I remember that?

313
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,800
Was it all day

314
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,920
from Hua Su opens

315
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,060
or during a specific time?

316
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,020
I remember.

317
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,560
These people

318
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,860
all came here for dinner.

319
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,380
Then, the milk was swapped
in the afternoon.

320
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,980
Why not at night?

321
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,740
Nights are busier.

322
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,100
Dazui moves between the front
and the kitchen.

323
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,060
That person won't get a chance
to swap it.

324
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,560
However, in the afternoon,

325
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,860
there are fewer guests.

326
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,320
Moreover, when I was here,

327
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,360
I saw

328
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,860
Dazui dozing off at the front desk
often in the afternoon.

329
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,360
So, it's the perfect opportunity

330
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,860
to swap the milk.

331
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,100
I don't nap.

332
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,800
So, we keep operating,

333
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,400
and wait in the kitchen.

334
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,720
I believe that person will

335
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,440
appear again

336
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,820
in the afternoon.

337
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,060
Insightful and brilliant!

338
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,660
- That's our Mr. Shu
- Enough.

339
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,120
How about it?

340
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,860
Stop bragging.

341
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,180
What if that person doesn't show up?

342
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,180
Wouldn't that be embarrassing?

343
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,380
We'll see.

344
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,420
Wait, you all get it?

345
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,260
Then why didn't I understand?

346
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,080
Mr. Shu, could you tell me again

347
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,060
what I should do?

348
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,100
Mr. Shu, Mr. Shu.

349
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,820
It's been hours.

350
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,660
Will that person even show?

351
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,500
Play your role.

352
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,140
Follow my lead.

353
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,960
Why are you here?

354
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,180
Go back to work.

355
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,360
I've been here for ages, okay?

356
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,100
Do you really think you're my boss?

357
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,560
Dazui,

358
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,260
grab me a bottle of water.

359
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,280
Dazui!

360
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,220
There's no one here.

361
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,140
You're really dedicated
to this roleplay.

362
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,540
Do you think that person will come?

363
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,460
He will.

364
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,620
He wants to ruin you,

365
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,780
so he won't back off.

366
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,620
Do you actually like my cooking?

367
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,360
Yes.

368
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,540
You hesitated.

369
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,720
I... I didn't.

370
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,820
Still lying.

371
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,800
You jerk.

372
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,740
Why am I a jerk?

373
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,080
Are you trying to say

374
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,080
liking my food is also an accident?

375
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,680
Everything's an accident with you!

376
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,860
I didn't say that.

377
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,860
(Kitchen)

378
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,180
What's with the attitude?

379
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
What attitude?

380
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,680
You're yelling at me!

381
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,000
If you're aggressive to me,
you can leave.

382
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,440
Aggressive? My voice is so soft.

383
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,360
How am I being aggressive?

384
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,880
I don't think that person will
come today.

385
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,700
Just leave. I'm giving you a way out.

386
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,300
Fine, I'll leave.

387
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,100
Stop right there!

388
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,100
Don't run.

389
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,440
Don't run.

390
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,040
Stop right there!

391
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,320
Stop!

392
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,550
Don't run.

393
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,400
Move aside.

394
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,800
Don't run.

395
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,040
Stop running.

396
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,360
Stop.

397
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,520
Stop.

398
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,200
Stop.

399
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,880
Stop.

400
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,140
- Stop!
- Don't run!

401
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,700
Thief!

402
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,960
Stop him!

403
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,380
- Stop!
- Don't run!

404
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,200
Stop!

405
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,920
You!

406
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,080
What are you doing?

407
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,540
Fang Meng, spray him!

408
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,560
Fang Meng,

409
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,540
spray him! Spray him!

410
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,680
Stop!

411
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,180
Are you okay, Shu Zhengyan?

412
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,800
Take him away.

413
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,400
Move.

414
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,540
Just because you refuse to sell,

415
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,640
actually, you've already offended
many people.

416
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,380
Watch out for their revenge.

417
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,980
So, Uncle Pang,

418
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,340
did I delay you from getting your money?

419
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,320
I'm sorry, so sorry.

420
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,500
- You…
- Don't touch me.

421
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,340
I'm really sorry.

422
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,560
I aimed at him,

423
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,380
but I didn't expect it to hit you.

424
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,160
Are your eyes okay?

425
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,200
Mr. Shu,

426
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,960
I have heard about your heroic battle

427
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,040
with the culprit.

428
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,900
Stop it.

429
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,100
Why's your eye so swollen?

430
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,600
Get out.

431
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,680
Let's go.

432
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,520
Leave, leave.

433
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,940
Don't be mad.

434
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,060
Do your eyes still burn?

435
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,660
Get me some ice.

436
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,960
Okay.

437
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,660
I've got two left.

438
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,360
I usually have more…

439
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,700
But can you make do
with the ice cream for now?

440
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,060
Ice can relieve spice.

441
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,460
I think of a dish my dad makes.

442
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,780
I'm not okay yet.

443
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,800
Do you remember the noodles
you had before?

444
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,600
It's actually one
of my dad's signature dishes.

445
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,760
I always can't get it right.

446
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,160
When adding too much seasoning,
it's too spicy.

447
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,620
When adding a little seasoning,
it's bland.

448
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,800
But ice helps relieve spice.

449
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,300
I think I finally figured it out.

450
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,340
Try it, and tell me if it tastes good.

451
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,460
I won't eat it.

452
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,160
I can't taste anything.

453
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,700
Do it for me.

454
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,840
Just on bite.

455
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,280
Please.

456
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,200
How is it?

457
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,500
Come on. It's so terrible!

458
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,420
What's wrong with it?

459
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,860
Maybe it's missing cheese.

460
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,140
How do you know?

461
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,220
Know what?

462
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,420
Did you forget the cheese?

463
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,940
Do you know how to make this dish?

464
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,660
Also, the ingredient order's wrong.

465
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,780
How do you even know that?

466
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,580
Are you hallucinating
from the spiciness?

467
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,360
Your seasoning order

468
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,500
is probably off, right?

469
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,400
Fine.

470
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,800
You prepare the ingredients,

471
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,860
and we'll make it again.

472
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,780

I'll give it a try.

00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,550
Serves you right for not teaching me!

00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,540
What's wrong?

513

Still not good?

this is the best bowl of noodles

Hey, leave me some.

536
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,320
- It's terrible. You shouldn't eat it.
- Why are you hogging it?

00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,180
