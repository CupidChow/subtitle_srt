This is the best bowl of noodles

I've ever had.

33
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,700
Why is there a key?

34
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,020
It actually opened.

35
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,540
Why do I feel like
I've seen Director before?

36
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,020
Could I really have

37
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,180
the ability to foresee the future?

38
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,300
(Do humans have superpowers,
like predicting the future?)

39
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,550
(Old Doctor: Yes, I can foresee
that the poster is an idiot.)

00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,620
(Hua Su)

00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,560
What are you doing?

42
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,860
Get up, get up, get up!

43
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,720
What are you filming here? Go home.

44
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,680
Go on!

45
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,720
Nothing to see here.

46
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,580
Move!

47
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,720
Move along!

48
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,700
You're finally here!

49
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,200
I don't know who posted it.

50
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,620
(Heartless boss! No conscience!
Authorities, please punish them!)

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
People online

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,200
hear a rumor and run wild with it.

53
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,900
Didn't we already resolve
the milk issue?

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,520
That guy was caught,
the money was refunded.

55
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,060
Why won't they just let it go?

56
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,160
(Give our money back!)
And they say our food tastes bad.

57
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,800
That part really ticks me off!

58
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,720
They were lining up,
begging to eat here before.

59
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,900
Did I drag them in?

60
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,160
Honestly,

61
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,300
Meng, you're too soft-hearted.

62
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,080
We should've called the cops.

63
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,850
Next time, let's see
who dares mess with us!

64
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,140
Hold it steady for me.

65
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,280
Where's Fang Meng?

66
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,160
Inside.

67
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,260
Bro, bro, bro,

68
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,600
give me a hand.

69
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,440
Thanks.

70
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,660
You dropped your key.

71
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,160
What?

72
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,580
Your key, you dropped it.

73
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,820
I'm telling you,

74
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,200
don't think just because
you work for Mr. Shu

75
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,400
that I wouldn't dare deal with you.

76
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,820
You're the one
who's gonna get dealt with!

77
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,100
You dropped the key.

78
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,500
The key?

79
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,400
Oh! Where's your accent from?

80
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,240
Well.

81
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,100
You don't need to worry about this.

82
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,400
You've already learned
how to make one dish, right?

83
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,220
Once you master six signature dishes,

84
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,250
Hua Su's reputation
will turn around in no time.

85
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,060
I don't have time anymore.

86
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,760
At this rate,

87
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,740
it won't be long
before Hua Su shuts down.

88
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,740
And I've got debts to pay out there.

89
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,060
Why don't you just
become my private chef?

90
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,040
What?

91
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,800
I mean,

92
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,440
if you don't mind,

93
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,060
you could work as my private chef.

94
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,300
Forget it.

95
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,300
I didn't mean anything by it.

96
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,200
It's not like I'm hoping for Hua Su
to go under

97
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,150
so I can buy it off you.

98
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,660
What's your problem?

99
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,260
You still don't trust me.

100
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,540
Aren't you hoping Hua Su to fail,

101
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,500
so I can sell it to you?

102
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,300
But now,

103
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,100
I have a new plan for Hua Su.

104
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,980
What?

105
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,660
Even though your cooking is terrible,

106
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,500
with the right guidance,

107
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,880
you could make something truly unique.

108
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,400
Once the Food Street Plan
is complete,

109
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,700
I might consider inviting you

110
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,220
and Hua Su to join.

111
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,760
Really?

112
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,240
You're not joking, are you?

113
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,080
Of course not.

114
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,200
But one dish alone

115
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,140
won't be enough.

116
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,100
If you want me as your private chef,

117
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,580
it's not impossible,

118
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,700
but I have conditions.

119
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,180
What conditions?

120
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,020
First,

121
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,540
I'll only work as
your private chef for one month.

122
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,980
Long-term?

123
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,380
Not happening.

124
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,460
Second,

125
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,340
I call the shots in the kitchen.

126
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,900
You can't stop me

127
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,180
from experimenting with any dish.

128
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,740
If you're at home,

129
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,860
I'm in charge of
your three meals a day.

130
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,980
Third,

131
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,220
I'm not living at your place.

132
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,260
That's not acceptable.

133
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,500
Why do I have to live at your house?

134
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,300
It's more convenient.

135
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,140
Convenient for what?

136
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,900
Convenient for you to cook for me.

137
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,540
What if you're not around,

138
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,060
and I have some kind of health issue?

139
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,700
Move aside!

140
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,420
Are you agreeing or not?

141
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,460
(Booming Business)

142
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,500
Are you

143
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,260
sure about this?

144
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,740
Well, Dazui,

145
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,780
don't worry.

146
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,820
I'm never giving up on Hua Su.

147
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,420
But Shu Zhengyan does have a point.

148
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,060
In this situation,

149
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,940
if I keep the restaurant open,

150
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,340
it's unlikely
anything good will come of it.

151
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,420
I'll take this time

152
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,500
to really study

153
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,060
my dad's six signature dishes.

154
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,140
Don't worry.

155
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,700
I'll bring back Hua Su's reputation

156
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,100
for sure.

157
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,300
Okay.

158
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,940
Wait a sec.

159
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:37,940
What are you doing?

160
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,940
This is all the money we have left.

161
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,380
I know it's not enough,

162
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,420
but once I finish this private chef job,
I'll have the money,

163
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,980
and we can pay off the debts.

164
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,300
- Take this. Take it.
- No, no.

165
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,180
No, Meng. No.

166
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,380
What's this supposed to mean?

167
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,540
I've already considered
this place my home.

168
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,940
You and Master Pi
are like family to me.

169
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,900
When everyone else
turned their back on me,

170
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,540
it was Master Pi who took me in.

171
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,200
Hua Su gave me a chance
when no one else would,

172
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,860
and I am sticking with Hua Su
through thick and thin.

173
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,460
Take the money back.

174
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,220
Dazui.

175
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,740
Whether it's a month, three months,

176
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,660
or five months,

177
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,880
I'll treat it like a vacation.

178
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,100
I'll wait for you to come back.

179
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,460
Okay.

180
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,100
- It's a deal.
- Deal.

181
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,540
But take this money with you.

182
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,580
Take it.

183
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,940
No more arguing.

184
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,140
Fine.

185
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,730
But Meng,

186
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,980
I have one little favor to ask.

187
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,220
- What is it?
- Well,

188
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,580
isn't Mr. Shu's company quite big?

189
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,140
See if there's any work I can do.

190
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,980
Security or something,

191
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,380
just part-time is fine.

192
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,300
But didn't you just say

193
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,460
you wanted a break?

194
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,900
Yes.

195
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,740
I can take a break
while working part-time.

196
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,860
Just in case.

197
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,980
You know...

198
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,100
You don't believe

199
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,060
I can bring Hua Su back, do you?

200
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,220
I do.

201
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,060
I absolutely believe in you.

202
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,500
I'm just working part-time

203
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,460
while waiting for you.

204
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,540
You don't trust me!

205
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,980
Take off that uniform right now!

206
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,700
(Hua Su)
I won't say anything anymore.

207
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,100
- I'm leaving.
- Dazui, you're annoying.

208
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,300
- I'm really going now.
- Still pretending.

209
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,550
- I'll go.
- Still pretending.

210
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,940
What's going on between you
and Shu Zhengyan?

211
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,580
Why are you suddenly
working as his private chef?

212
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,340
What choice do I have?

213
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,820
Since that tainted milk scandal,

214
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
Hua Su's reputation

215
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,740
has gone downhill.

216
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,580
I'm barely holding on.

217
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,580
And I owe so much money.

218
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,580
What else can I do

219
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,180
besides take this job?

220
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,940
I think

221
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,140
there's more to this.

222
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,460
I heard Lin Chuxiao say

223
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,500
you two have been

224
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,900
pretty close lately.

225
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,340
Don't listen to his nonsense.

226
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,180
So, you're telling me

227
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,860
you don't like him at all?

228
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,700
I don't!

229
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,300
Stubborn as ever, huh?

230
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,820
You think I don't know you?

231
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,260
Trying to fool me?

232
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,980
I really don't have the energy
for that right now.

233
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,700
All I want

234
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,820
is for Hua Su to reopen
as soon as possible.

235
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,860
At least now,

236
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,580
I've finally learned one of

237
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,780
my dad's signature dishes.

238
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,260
Lin Chuxiao told me.

239
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,060
You, with that blockhead of yours,

240
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,900
how did you suddenly get it?

241
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,980
Well,

242
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,660
I should thank Shu Zhengyan.

243
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,660
Thank him?

244
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,620
For what?

245
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:29,820
Well, for the first dish,

246
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,700
he did help me a lot, after all.

247
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,220
And

248
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,980
there's just something different

249
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,180
about him.

250
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,500
The feeling of love?

251
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,260
It's a heartbeat.

252
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,220
Stop teasing me.

253
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,420
Alright, alright.

254
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,300
It's just familiar, you know?

255
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,740
Even his snoring sounds unique.

256
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,540
Snoring?

257
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,980
You two slept together?

258
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,180
Don't make stuff up!

259
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,540
Well, you can go out first.

260
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,140
No, well...

261
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,540
When did this happen?

262
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,300
What are you thinking?

263
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,820
It's just that at the farm,

264
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,460
I accidentally overheard it.

265
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,300
Who would've thought

266
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,340
Shu Zhengyan snores!

267
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,980
I didn't mean it like that.

268
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,620
It's just like

269
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,980
I've heard his snoring before.

270
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,420
How do you even know how to cook?

271
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,340
Me? When did I ever say I could cook?

272
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,580
Before, when I was
watching Fang Meng cook,

273
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,100
wasn't it you who taught me?

274
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,340
Could I be a chef?

275
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,100
Do you remember
how to cook anything else?

276
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,180
No.

277
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,980
But wait,

278
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,980
if you were a chef,

279
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,060
why would you even care about

280
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,100
what Fang Meng's making?

281
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,700
It doesn't seem like

282
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,140
her dish was all that difficult.

283
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,260
Not difficult?

284
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,420
(Specialist Clinic, Doctor Xie Jun)

285
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,420
Miss, Miss,

286
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,820
we didn't find the target in Area A.

287
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,980
Copy that.

288
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,100
Miss.

289
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,700
What now?

290
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,700
Any luck?

291
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,700
Then keep looking.

292
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,540
Yes.

293
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,860
Where did Xie Jun run off to?

294
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,740
Hiding from me like this.

295
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,420
You...

296
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,420
You've worked hard.

297
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,500
Mr. Shu.

298
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,660
Are you familiar with Miss Shen?

299
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,060
She's a distant cousin of mine.

300
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,140
Why?

301
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:57,060
She's been coming to see me
almost every day,

302
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,780
always bringing people along.

303
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,100
It's seriously affecting my work.

304
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,500
Could you talk to her for me?

305
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,020
Leave us.

306
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,140
I can't really

307
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,740
control An'an.

308
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,460
I'll have to
figure something out myself.

309
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,500
Anyway,

310
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,060
how have you been?

311
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,700
I've been having

312
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,740
a strange thought lately.

313
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,100
Do you think

314
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,460
people could have superpowers?

315
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,540
Like, being able to see the future?

316
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,300
What are you getting at?

317
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,340
The other day, I went to a farm.

318
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,340
I walked up to this room

319
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,650
and realized I didn't have a key.

320
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,260
But at that moment,

321
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,940
I just knew the key

322
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,820
was under the stone near the door.

323
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,300
And guess what?

324
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,660
The key was really there?

325
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,540
Yes.

326
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,620
Isn't that incredible?

327
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,300
Well...

328
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,780
My grandparents lived
in the countryside.

329
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,580
It's pretty common to hide keys

330
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,180
under a rock or brick

331
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,580
near the door.

332
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,460
Could it have just been a coincidence?

333
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,860
But then,

334
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,260
I saw someone in my mind,

335
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,140
and that person actually appeared later,

336
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,380
exactly the same.

337
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,420
Maybe it's just a memory

338
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,780
you triggered somehow?

339
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,980
How could I have been
to a place like that?

340
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,300
And there's more.

341
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,860
When someone else is cooking,

342
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,260
it's like I know how to cook too.

343
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,620
When they follow my instructions,

344
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,820
it actually works.

345
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,060
Do you think this could be a superpower?

346
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,100
Like I've somehow opened my third eye?

347
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,620
- Doctor Xie.
- This...

348
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,940
Mr. Shu, tell her I'm not here.

349
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,500
Xie Jun. Xie...

350
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,100
Zhengyan, what are you doing here?

351
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,060
Where's Xie Jun?

352
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,500
He's not here.

353
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,180
Not here? You're lying.

355
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,980
What are you doing here?

356
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,100
I... I...

357
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,940
I...

358
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,340
I came in to think about something.

359
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,580
Think about what?

360
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,420
I sometimes like to meditate alone.

361
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,660
I'll meditate with you.

362
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,620
Like this?

363
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,260
You guys meditate.

364
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,380
I'll go now.

365
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,460
Bye, Zhengyan.

366
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,100
Do you have any slogans?

367
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,020
Is that it?

368
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,820
I'm done meditating.

369
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,660
If you're ready, let's eat.

370
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,060
I know a really good restaurant.

371
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,100
Come on, let's go, it's time.

372
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,820
The restaurant I mentioned
is really great.

373
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,540
You'll regret not eating there.

374
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,100
We're going for some good food.

376
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,820
(Recommended to transfer to Psychiatry
for further examination and treatment)

377
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,780
Mr. Shu, you're finally back at work.

378
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,220
I thought I wouldn't see you again

379
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,700
in this lifetime.

380
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,300
What brought you here?

381
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,580
Oh, right.

382
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,260
I heard Hua Su

383
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,580
had to shut down recently

384
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,660
due to food safety issues.

385
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,660
Then, Mr. Shu,

386
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,220
you should seize this opportunity

387
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,620
and take action quickly.

388
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,860
I have my own plans.

389
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,060
You don't need to worry.

390
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,740
If Yin Miaolan finds out

391
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,100
that Hua Su Restaurant

392
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,580
is still stubbornly staying there

393
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,180
on our Food Street,

394
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,100
it will ruin

395
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,740
our company's image.

396
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,180
Chairman.

397
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,620
What brings you here?

398
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,340
How's your health?

399
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,460
Zhengyan.

400
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,540
I heard Hua Su Restaurant closed down.

401
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,150
Does this mean the acquisition plan
has made progress?

402
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,340
I now have a new plan.

403
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,700
I think not only should we develop

404
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,940
our international cuisine,

405
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,820
we should also introduce
our local cuisine.

406
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,740
Rather than tussling
with stubborn restaurants,

407
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,740
it's better to cultivate them into

408
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,260
the best local restaurants.

409
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,820
Mr. Shu.

410
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,820
Are you referring to

411
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,020
Hua Su Restaurant?

412
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,540
That's right.

413
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,740
It's Hua Su.

414
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,180
Mr. Shu, are you joking?

415
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,980
First, its terrible food
went viral online.

416
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,420
Then, expired milk caused

417
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,380
food poisoning for over ten people.

418
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,820
I don't see how this

419
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,580
troubled, infamous restaurant

420
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,500
is worth cultivating or developing.

421
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,580
Mr. Shu.

422
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,540
Are you crazy, or am I?

423
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,300
The milk incident's responsibility

424
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,980
is not Hua Su's at all.

425
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,500
I admit the food was bad,

426
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,980
but every great dish

427
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,020
was achieved after repeated trials

428
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,450
to meet the standards of fine dining.

429
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,340
Does every dish turn out perfect

430
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,660
the first time it's made?

431
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,740
Let's not even discuss whether
we have time to nurture Hua Su.

432
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:31,980
Mr. Shu.

433
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,260
You are, after all,

434
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,660
the head of the SAGA Food Street Plan.

435
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,060
The acquisition of Hua Su

436
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,420
was a firm task you assigned back then.

437
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,820
But now, suddenly,
you've changed direction.

438
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,620
You're saying we should cultivate it?

439
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,260
Mr. Shu.

440
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,740
Is it

441
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,860
because

442
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,860
you didn't think it through initially

443
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,740
or because your relationship
with Fang Meng isn't ordinary?

444
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,220
Alright.

445
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,620
This matter will
not be considered for now.

446
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,940
Now that Hua Su has closed,

447
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,300
now is the best time

448
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,660
to negotiate an acquisition.

449
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,500
Proceed.

450
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,180
Chairman.

451
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,020
As the execution department,

452
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,620
Mr. Shu's actions

453
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,540
have indeed compromised

454
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,700
a large portion of our efficiency.

455
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,220
However,

456
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,100
I think it can be forgiven.

457
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,020
Because as far as I know,

458
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,340
Mr. Shu has recently

459
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,220
not been in the best of health.

460
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,860
Therefore, any mistakes at work

461
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,380
can be understandable.

462
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,540
What do you mean?

463
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,700
What do you mean?

464
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,020
(Disease Diagnosis Certificate

465
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,990
(Recommended to transfer to Psychiatry
for further examination and treatment)

466
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,850
(Possibility of split personality)
Frankly, I didn't believe it at first,

467
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,860
but Mr. Shu's recent actions

468
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,940
have truly shocked me.

469
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,020
Chairman,

470
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,180
I'm acting in the interest
of the company.

471
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,380
So I ask you for forgiveness.

472
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,740
Because, ultimately

473
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,940
there are things

474
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,630
that we must investigate thoroughly.

475
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,020
By the way,

476
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,700
there's another important matter.

477
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,780
I...

478
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,540
Zhengyan, hurry
and finish your homework!

479
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,260
If your mom finds out,
she'll dock my allowance again!

480
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,180
Show some ambition, you little rascal!

481
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,140
Like father, like son.

482
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,260
Fine.

483
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,140
Since you all think I'm ill,

484
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,340
I'm willing to temporarily step down

485
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,420
and undergo a medical evaluation.

486
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,820
What do you think was wrong
with that dish?

487
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,380
Why its flavor...

488
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,500
You couldn't...

489
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,100
Mom, are you tired of waiting?

490
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,780
My back...

491
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,140
I'll massage it for you.

492
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,420
Why are they here?

493
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,980
What's their deal this time?

494
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,340
They've been gone so long.

495
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,060
They didn't even show up
at Master Pi's funeral.

496
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,140
And now they're here pretending
to be all affectionate?

497
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,060
Do you even need to ask?

498
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,980
Didn't they stir up a storm before

499
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,420
with that whole inheritance dispute?

500
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,540
This time

501
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,340
it's also about money.

502
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,460
Mom.

503
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,300
Enough.

504
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,420
What do you want this time?

505
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,340
Watch your mouth, young lady.

506
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,340
No matter what, Master Pi and I

507
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,140
did share some time together.

508
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,860
Now that he's gone,

509
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,940
shouldn't we come and pay our respects?

510
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,580
Where were you before?

511
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,220
When we held the funeral,

512
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,900
neither you nor your money was there.

513
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,220
Why are you here now,

514
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,620
sobbing like this?

515
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,740
I was on vacation before

516
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,380
and wasn't checking my phone.

517
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,940
On vacation, not checking your phone?

518
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,580
I saw you posting actively
on social media.

519
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,140
I heard my husband

520
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,780
left Hua Su Restaurant to you.

521
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,740
That's not your husband,

522
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,620
it's your ex-husband.

523
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,780
Yes, yes.

524
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,380
We've been separated for a while,

525
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,900
but legally,

526
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,660
we haven't filed for divorce yet.

527
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,420
So I'm still Pi Zijie's wife.

528
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,060
Wait, why hasn't the divorce been filed?

529
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,740
Don't you know it yourself?

530
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,020
Have a little conscience, will you?

531
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,540
The house has already been left to you.

532
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,380
Hua Su is mine.

533
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,500
Don't even think about it.

534
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,500
Where does it say Hua Su belongs to you?

535
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,860
Legally speaking,

536
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,820
Hua Su

537
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,860
and even this place you're living in,

538
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,740
I'm entitled to half of it.

539
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,660
Fine.

540
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,340
Then let me tell you,

541
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,060
Hua Su is now closed.

542
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,660
It owes a lot of money.

543
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,420
If I give Hua Su to you,

544
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,420
can you repay the debts?

545
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,260
What?

546
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,700
It's closed?

547
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,220
Well, since it's closed,

548
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,460
why not just sell Hua Su?

549
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,820
We can split the money 50-50.

550
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,460
I dare you to sell it.

551
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,180
I dare you!

552
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,740
Wait, no need for this!

553
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,020
- I'll call the police!
- No, no.

554
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:51,860
Fang Meng, calm down.

555
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,020
I don't have my dad's patience.

556
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,820
He put up with you for long enough.

557
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,580
You two had bad intentions
when you approached my dad.

558
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,660
I remember clearly how you treated me

559
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,340
when you came to our house.

560
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,980
You'd better leave

561
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,980
while I'm still rational.

562
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:06,820
Get out!

563
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,660
That's not how you should put it.

564
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,020
When your dad was abandoned by your mom,

565
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,340
he was pathetic.

566
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,340
It was our presence

567
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,860
that helped him rebuild his life

568
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,300
and run Hua Su again.

569
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,880
If you want to blame someone,
blame your mom who abandoned you.

570
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,860
Say that again.

571
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,860
I'm just telling the truth.

572
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,260
Your mom abandoned you!

573
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:24,910
Go, go, go!

574
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,420
I've tolerated you for long enough.

575
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,260
Oh, my!

576
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:33,980
Mom.

577
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,420
She scared me!

578
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,740
Fang Meng's temper hasn't changed a bit.

579
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,700
Think she can beat me?

580
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,820
She's too naive for that.

581
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,940
I don't believe

582
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,580
that I can't get a piece of her.

583
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:52,780
- Go.
- Go.

584
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,540
Xie Jun, try this one.

585
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,900
Their cookies are well-baked too.

586
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,780
Try some!

587
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,760
These fries are freshly baked

588
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:08,620
and they're super delicious.

589
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,620
Try this one too!

590
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,700
Yes, yes, taste this one as well.

591
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,620
Miss Shen.

592
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:18,940
Miss Shen.

593
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,620
Are you here to pick up Sweetie today?

594
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,300
Recently,

595
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,820
Sweetie's condition

596
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,940
hasn't been very good.

597
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,460
It's so pitiful.

598
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,020
Xie Jun.

599
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,700
Could you help me
take care of it for a bit longer?

600
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,060
You agreed!

601
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,060
Try another one!

602
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,100
Miss Shen.

603
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,140
I'll go to the restroom first.

604
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,860
Go quickly!

605
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,140
Hurry back.

606
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,100
I'll wait for you.

607
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,940
Miss.

608
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,220
The check, please.

609
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,180
