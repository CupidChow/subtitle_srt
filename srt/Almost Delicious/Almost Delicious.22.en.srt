31
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,050
Ms. Yin,

32
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,510
there's something I need to tell you.

33
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,550
What is it?

34
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,310
Master Pi

35
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,470
has always been inside me.

36
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,150
It all started the day

37
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,110
the Reske Comet appeared,

38
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,150
the same day Master Pi passed away.

39
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,350
After the comet appeared,

40
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,710
I started hearing a voice in my head.

41
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,450
I thought it was just

42
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,150
a mental issue,

43
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:16,930
but the more time I spent

44
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,630
with Fang Meng,

45
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,050
the more frequent

46
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,230
that voice became.

47
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,510
And that voice is Master Pi.

48
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,230
Everything I'm saying is true.

49
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,230
Did you tell Fang Meng about this?

50
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,270
She thinks I'm joking about Master Pi.

51
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,710
I did hear Manager An mention

52
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,190
that you were once suspended

53
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,470
for a mental health check.

54
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,510
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

55
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,530
Forget it.

56
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,790
I'm not saying I don't believe you.

57
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,790
From what I know about Fang Meng,

58
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,730
she couldn't have recreated

59
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,030
Pi Zijie's dishes

60
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,710
on her own.

61
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,170
Besides,

62
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,950
Fang Meng also told me

63
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,990
that you taught her those dishes,

64
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,970
but there's no way

65
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,750
you would know Pi Zijie's recipes.

66
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,450
So

67
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,830
it was Pi Zijie inside you teaching her?

68
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,210
Right.

69
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,470
Finally, you understand.

70
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:19,930
Could I

71
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,430
speak with him for a moment?

72
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,750
Should I say,

73
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,510
"Long time no see"?

74
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,590
You're right.

75
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,590
Fang Meng couldn't have

76
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,290
made those dishes

77
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,550
on her own.

78
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,830
But about the sixth dish,

79
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,270
she didn't rely on me for that.

80
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,950
It was her own flavor.

81
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,030
Why are you doing this to her?

82
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,590
Cooking is like life.

83
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,410
Everyone should have the right

84
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,670
to choose their own flavor.

85
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,870
Not teaching Fang Meng

86
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,350
was because of my selfishness.

87
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,990
I didn't want to see your shadow.

88
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,630
Because, to me,

89
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,750
it once meant betrayal.

90
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,190
Now I see that

91
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,110
I was too selfish.

92
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,670
Looks like

93
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,030
Fang Meng has taught you a lot.

94
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,190
It's a shame

95
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,110
that it took me this long
to understand it.

96
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,750
I don't know if

97
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,190
there will be a chance
to explain to her.

98
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,150
Whether or not you explain

99
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,310
doesn't matter anymore.

100
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,190
I believe

101
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,630
my most important task
has been completed.

102
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,710
Now, Fang Meng

103
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,670
is in your hands.

104
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,150
You still have unfinished business.

105
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,990
Right now, Fang Meng

106
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,830
needs you more than ever.

107
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,050
And also,

108
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:09,870
you,

109
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:11,930
Zhengyan.

110
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,070
Chuxiao.

111
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,050
Everything here

112
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,310
is exactly the same
as when Shu Zhengyan left.

113
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,450
I must say,

114
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,070
you really are loyal.

115
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,770
Sorry, Manager An.
I'll take care of it right away.

116
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:09,750
I have

117
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,110
investigated you.

118
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,490
You're the only one in your village

119
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,990
who made it out.

120
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,770
Getting to this position

121
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:18,750
wasn't easy.

122
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,110
I know.

123
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,730
But once you enter society,

124
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,990
it's different.

125
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:25,930
Sometimes, just one

126
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,990
tiny mistake,

127
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,030
very tiny,

128
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,630
can make all the efforts you've put in

129
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,910
disappear like the dust

130
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,710
on this table.

131
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,410
I'm sorry, Manager An, I'll...

132
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,250
If you still want

133
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,070
to continue at Bo Fei,

134
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,430
then I think you should look ahead.

135
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,570
You've already made

136
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,750
one wrong choice.

137
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:57,610
But I have to admit,

138
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,330
luck is on your side.

139
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,310
You've been given
another chance to choose.

140
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,630
I just wonder

141
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,150
if you can grasp it this time.

142
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,750
I understand.

143
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,710
Tomorrow, I want a new office.

144
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,390
I can't stand being in
this unlucky place anymore.

145
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,930
Manager An, everyone is here.

146
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:35,870
We can start the meeting.

147
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,870
Today, I will only say one thing.

148
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,310
From today,

149
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,350
SAGA Food Street
will begin to be renovated.

150
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,190
Mr. An, does that include Hua Su?

151
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:49,710
Chen, let me ask you.

152
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,830
Did Hua Su sign a contract with us?

153
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,490
Yes,

154
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,050
but the owner...

155
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,350
Chen.

156
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,550
Chen.

157
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,910
I'll say it again,

158
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,430
and for the last time.

159
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,030
I, An Zhijiang, as the
General Manager of Bo Fei Group,

160
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,870
will say only one thing

161
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,710
in today's meeting.

162
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,450
The renovation of the Food Street

163
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,950
starts today.

164
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:15,730
All the shops

165
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,670
have signed contracts with us.

166
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,750
Those who didn't make it on the list

167
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,230
will be demolished immediately.

168
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,130
Hello, Fang Meng.

169
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,750
They've brought men to Hua Su.

170
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:47,560
What are you doing?

171
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,530
We are demolishing this place.

172
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,120
- What are you doing?
- We are demolishing this place.

173
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,980
Who told you to tear it down?

174
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,170
- Get out!
- Move aside.

175
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,750
- Get out!
- Excuse me.

176
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:54,810
- Get out!
- Move aside.

177
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:55,650
What's happening?

178
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,450
Fine.

179
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,530
Meng, they're tearing Hua Su down.

180
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,550
Who authorized you to do it?

181
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,950
Who authorized you to tear it down?

182
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,950
Long time no see, Miss Fang.

183
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,330
Well,

184
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,090
how are you doing?

185
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,270
What do you mean?

186
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,070
I've won the competition.

187
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,710
You promised me that

188
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,950
if I won, Hua Su would be safe.

189
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,790
Why are you bringing people
to tear it down now?

190
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,810
It seems like there's been
some misunderstanding,

191
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,650
Miss Fang.

192
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,350
It wasn't us who promised you.

193
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,150
It was Shu Zhengyan.

194
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,730
But he agreed...

195
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,910
It is legitimate,

196
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:35,990
written in black and white.

197
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,170
We've already paid you the money,

198
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,210
so the restaurant now

199
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,030
belongs to Bo Fei Group.

200
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,610
As for what

201
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:44,710
we do with it,

202
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,970
that's none of your business.

203
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:47,810
- You...
- Tear it down!

204
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,830
I dare you!

205
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:49,930
Stop!

206
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:53,650
An Zhijiang,

207
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,190
you know the result of the competition.

208
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,730
Before things are clear,

209
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,080
who gave you the right
to tear down Hua Su?

210
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:05,490
You're

211
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:07,470
questioning me?

212
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,310
Shu Zhengyan, have you forgotten?

213
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,710
You're not the president anymore.

214
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:22,990
I believe everyone

215
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,650
has had the pleasure of

216
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:29,550
tasting the dishes made
by Chef Fang Meng from Hua Su.

217
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,990
She won first place

218
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,510
in the culinary competition.

219
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,350
The first place.

220
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,390
Do you believe this result?

221
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,250
There's foul play.

222
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,250
They say the judge

223
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,290
was her mother,

224
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,450
and the organizer was her boyfriend.

225
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,330
It's a scam!

226
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,370
- Nonsense!
- It's a scam!

227
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,030
- It's a scam!
- That's nonsense!

228
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:56,510
It's a scam! It's a scam!

229
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,430
For such a restaurant involved in scams,

230
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,270
do we need it in our food street?

231
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,830
No!

232
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,650
Lin Chuxiao.

233
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,170
Come on.

234
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,670
Tell your former boss

235
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,530
whether

236
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,150
I'm qualified

237
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:28,790
to tear this restaurant down.

238
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,010
You are.

239
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,330
Louder.

240
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,610
You are.

241
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,950
It's written in black and white

242
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,810
that Bo Fei Group

243
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,110
can demolish Hua Su at any time.

244
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:48,950
Well said.

245
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,470
Tear it down!

246
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,750
Leave her alone for a while.

247
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:16,740
(People Live on Food)

248
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,310
Did you pick that one yesterday?

249
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,330
How old is she?

250
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:26,150
Let's congratulate Mr. An

251
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,310
for being promoted to President!

252
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:32,450
Congratulations, Mr. An.

253
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,710
Let's drink!

254
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,190
Are you okay, Chuxiao?

255
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:38,650
You don't look happy.

256
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,430
No, Mr. An.

257
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,030
Lin Chuxiao, you feel guilty
for betraying Shu Zhengyan,

258
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,030
don't you?

259
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:54,530
No, I don't.

260
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,510
Then drink it.

261
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,130
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

262
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,390
Come on.

263
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,550
- Let's drink a glass too.
- To Mr. An.

264
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:20,670
To Mr. An.

265
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:22,910
Congratulations, Mr. An.

266
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:23,930
Cheers.

267
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,090
Stick with me,

268
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,090
and I'll make sure
you live well and prosper.

269
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:27,930
- Okay.
- Thank you, Mr. An.

270
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,790
You'll take us to greater heights,

271
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,450
keep soaring, keep surpassing.

272
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:33,290
OK.

273
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,310
Cheers! Cheers.

274
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,290
Come on, let's drink.

275
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,190
Three sixes.

276
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,130
Four sixes.

277
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,170
- Four sixes.
- What? No, no, no, no.

278
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,830
Let's drink.

279
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,990
Cheers.

280
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,130
You haven't eaten all day,

281
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,410
don't you care about your health?

282
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,310
Eat something.

283
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,410
Fang Meng, if you're feeling bad,

284
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,850
just cry on me.

285
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:27,990
You can hold me if you want.

286
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:31,490
Mr. Shu,

287
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,590
you should talk to her.

288
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,150
Meng, don't cry.

289
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:41,950
Don't cry.

290
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,790
Based on what I know about her,

291
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,510
she won't blame you.

292
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,110
It's my own arrogance that caused this.

293
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,910
We never expected things

294
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,310
to turn out this way,

295
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,230
so we'll just have to accept it.

296
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,390
Hua Su is your life's work.

297
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,550
She feels like

298
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,070
she's ruined the brand you built.

299
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,910
After today,

300
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,070
she probably
won't want to cook anymore.

301
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,390
In the past,

302
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,370
I always stopped her

303
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,350
from cooking,

304
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:24,630
but now,

305
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:27,230
I hope she keeps going.

306
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,510
Honestly, with those six dishes,

307
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,430
if the people on the street
had tasted them,

308
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,470
no one would have thought
there was any foul play.

309
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:36,950
It's a shame

310
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,390
no one believes her now.

311
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,150
It's not about whether
others believe her anymore,

312
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:44,070
it's that Fang Meng
no longer believes in herself.

313
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,430
Tell me, what happened.

314
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,910
Lin Chuxiao, I'm asking you.

315
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,790
Shouldn't I ask you that?

316
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,160
What if An Zhijiang

317
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,550
sees you barging in like this?

318
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,030
Are you afraid of him this much?

319
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,310
Just tell me what it is.

320
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:16,610
Answer me,

321
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,830
did you bring people
to tear down Hua Su yesterday?

322
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,070
Let's talk about it at home, okay?

323
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,550
Lin Chuxiao,

324
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:26,710
good for you.

325
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,510
You're acting like you're someone else.

326
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:29,850
Fine,

327
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,510
even if you don't
treat Fang Meng as a friend,

328
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,250
what about Shu Zhengyan?

329
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,470
Can you face him?

330
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,380
(Bo Fei Group)

331
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,430
Why don't you tell me

332
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,030
what should I do from my position?

333
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:52,730
Your position?

334
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,610
As soon as An Zhijiang
took his position,

335
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,110
your position changed, right?

336
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,750
Now I don't want to talk about this,

337
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,330
I'm busy.

338
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,950
I know why you're doing this.

339
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,050
Everything you do

340
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,550
is for your own job.

341
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,070
You've betrayed Shu Zhengyan,

342
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,390
you've betrayed Fang Meng,

343
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,270
you've betrayed me.

344
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,170
Betray?

345
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,490
None of the things I'm doing

346
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:22,830
is beyond my responsibilities.

347
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,170
Yes,

348
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,630
you guys are happy.

349
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,190
You guys have a good father,

350
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,310
you can do whatever you like.

351
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:35,770
What about me?

352
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,790
I got this decent job.

353
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,990
Are you telling me to just give it up?

354
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:43,210
Miss Princess,

355
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:46,630
do you know how hard it is
to find a decent job?

356
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,810
Do you expect me
to be like Shu Zhengyan,

357
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,990
running errands at Hua Su every day,

358
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,790
just to be loyal?

359
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,150
I've told him so many times

360
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,770
not to bother with Hua Su,

361
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:58,950
not to care about Fang Meng.

362
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,790
Did he listen?

363
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,550
Did I do this for me?

364
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,310
Why don't you tell me

365
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,190
without this job,

366
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,670
how can I marry you?

367
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:13,670
Decency?

368
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,410
Decency.

369
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,710
You're talking about decency now?

370
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,270
So An Zhijiang gave you decency?

371
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,070
I'm telling you,

372
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,390
you don't need this decency,

373
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,230
and I don't need you to marry me.

374
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:45,710
What are you doing here?

375
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,630
You woke up?

376
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,110
I saw the door wasn't locked,
so I came in.

377
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,430
This place is so old.

378
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,350
Maybe it's time to move.

379
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,630
A new place

380
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,150
might bring new moods.

381
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,910
When one road is blocked,

382
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,430
you have to change paths.

383
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,250
I loved cooking back then,

384
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,510
so I kept pushing myself

385
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,550
to take different ratings and exams.

386
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,510
But over time,

387
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,830
cooking started to feel

388
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,230
like another kind of exam.

389
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,390
Now I see,

390
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,110
I was wrong.

391
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,950
Back then, I was so sure that

392
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,590
your dad's path wasn't working.

393
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,670
I thought Hua Su would close one day.

394
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:48,790
You weren't wrong.

395
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,230
It's true that this happened.

396
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,070
I didn't mean that.

397
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:01,370
When your dad was around,

398
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,670
Hua Su was always doing well.

399
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,670
What's the point
of talking about this now?

400
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:09,990
Hua Su is gone.

401
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:16,230
I didn't believe in your dad back then,

402
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:17,990
but now,

403
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:19,790
I believe in you.

404
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,710
When did you come in?

405
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:26,870
Just now.

406
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:27,890
Just now.

407
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,670
Did you hear everything?

408
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,430
I didn't hear it all.

409
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:34,930
Fang Meng.

410
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,670
This is my fault.

411
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,710
I shouldn't have agreed
to sign the contract.

412
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:41,310
I'm not blaming you.

413
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,270
I think your mom is right.

414
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,110
At worst, we can start over.

415
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,550
Plus, you've already learned
six signature dishes.

416
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,910
I believe you'll do better
and better in the future.

417
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,110
Did he hear that?

418
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,150
You know, you were wrong
not to trust me, right?

419
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,550
Starting over isn't that simple.

420
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,190
Now I don't even have a restaurant.

421
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,190
I'll find you one.

422
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,750
The good locations I could have found

423
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,810
are either bought by Bo Fei Group

424
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,230
or already taken.

425
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:18,830
How can you find a place now?

426
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,510
Although I'm not the president anymore,

427
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,550
I still have resources.

428
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,490
Believe me,

429
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,030
I'll find a good location for you.

430
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,940
(Today Happy, Day Day Happy)

431
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,670
This is the place you found?

432
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,150
It doesn't matter where the place is.

433
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,800
As long as we cook good food,

434
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,830
we'll have customers wherever we open.

435
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,230
Besides,

436
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,650
Bo Fei Group only bought our shop,

437
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:52,870
not our brand.

438
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,590
So we can still use the name Hua Su.

439
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,310
Seriously?

440
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:59,330
Meng.

441
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:01,930
I have a meeting today,

442
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:02,950
so I'm leaving.

443
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,550
You do your best.

444
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:16,150
I feel like she still doesn't believe me.

445
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,230
Not only your mom,

446
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,510
I don't believe you either.

447
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,510
We trust you.

448
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:26,630
What do you mean "we"?

449
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,190
I trust you.

450
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,270
I've decided,

451
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,910
from today on,

452
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,510
I'll make Hua Su bigger and stronger.

453
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,070
Do you have confidence?

454
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,470
Alright, Fang Meng,

455
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,010
don't worry.

456
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,570
I'm here,

457
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,210
Dazui is here,

458
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:51,910
we are all with you.

459
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:53,750
Everything will be fine.

460
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,980
(Jiangnan University
Affiliated Hospital)

461
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,870
He is still resting.

462
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,510
Should we leave now?

463
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:24,950
Dad, you're awake.

464
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,150
This is Fang Meng.

465
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,410
Hello, Uncle.

466
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,430
You're Fang Meng?

467
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:37,810
Zhengyan,

468
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,870
let me say a few words to her.

469
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,730
Dad, it's so late.

470
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:44,710
Just two words.

471
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:54,030
If he wants to eat a lollipop, tell me.

472
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:08,470
Fang Meng,

473
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,090
do you know that

474
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:13,510
you're not fit to be a chef?

475
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,090
Look at what you've done

476
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,710
to your father's restaurant.

477
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,390
Uncle, you might not know, but

478
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,690
I've already chosen a new location

479
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:26,160
for Hua Su.

480
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,470
If you have time,
you can come try the food.

481
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,490
I've heard that your Hua Su

482
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,350
has scared many people away.

483
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,070
Which street did you choose?

484
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,670
Should I hide from it?

485
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,740
That was in the past.

486
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,020
Now I've learned

487
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,620
my father's six signature dishes.

488
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,480
People won't be running away
after eating them. Don't worry.

489
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,380
You're still imitating your father.

490
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,740
Please, sit down.

491
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,100
Fang Meng,

492
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,580
do you know that

493
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,580
cooking is like

494
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,420
painting a picture,

495
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,220
writing a poem, or playing music?

496
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,620
It takes talent.

497
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,220
I know,

498
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,140
because my father often said so.

499
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,180
He said I didn't have talent

500
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,740
and wasn't suited to be a chef.

501
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,820
He never taught me to cook.

502
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,380
But actually, he's tasted

503
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,740
every dish I cooked.

504
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,180
He thought he was keeping it a secret,

505
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,500
but I just knew it.

506
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,540
But if it weren't for those times,

507
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,460
I wouldn't have kept going.

508
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,460
Not to mention

509
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,580
I don't even have a shop now.

510
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,300
But I know

511
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,580
he's always been there for me.

512
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,780
People now say

513
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,060
I'm successful,

514
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,260
a good chef.

515
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,540
So, it doesn't matter where Hua Su is.

516
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,500
I can do it on my own.

517
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,780
I think

518
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,980
if my dad knew

519
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,540
I was like this now,

520
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,900
he'd be happy.

521
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,820
You have a good father.

522
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,900
Where is the new location?

523
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,020
After I leave the hospital,

524
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,100
take me to try it.

525
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,140
Alright,

526
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,260
it's a deal.

527
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,380
Deal.

528
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,420
(Hua Su)
Hua Su's open today!

529
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,260
Well

530
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,280
- excuse me.
- No.

531
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,540
- Hello, we're open...
- Okay, let me see.

532
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,860
We just opened,

533
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,020
would you like to have some lunch?

534
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,020
Sir, would you like to take your wife...

535
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,460
Hua Su just opened.

536
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,420
It's fine.

537
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,540
Let's call it a day.

538
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,020
Wait, it's not yet time.

539
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,180
(Hua Su)
Anyway, no one is coming,

540
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,060
so let's just go home and rest.

541
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:38,940
Go home.

542
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:44,340
(Hua Su Restaurant, come inside.
Grand Opening)

543
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,180
Fang Meng,

544
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,620
you haven't even
made a single dish yet.

545
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,700
No one has ordered anything.

546
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,380
Well,

547
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,340
don't you know what presentation is?

548
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,820
Don't you know what presentation is?

549
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,740
What?

550
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,940
Just make a few dishes

551
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,460
and display them to people.

552
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,460
Maybe they'll want
to try them after seeing them.

553
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,660
But I don't want to cook.

554
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,060
Meng, why are you different now?

555
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,140
Before, you insisted on cooking
when you were not allowed to,

556
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,180
yet now you don't want to?

557
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,140
I'm really tired today.

558
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,300
I don't want to cook.

559
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,420
If you want to do it, go ahead.

560
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,900
Fine, I'll cook.

561
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,660
You're going to cook?

562
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,460
Who?

563
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,620
You're going to cook?

564
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,620
I...

565
