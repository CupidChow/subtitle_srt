=Episode 8=

31
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,780
Now everyone in the Company is saying

32
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,180
you're Mr. Shu's girlfriend.

33
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,000
What's really going on between you two?

34
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,500
Come on, who said I'm his girlfriend?

35
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,600
Can you all stop spreading rumors?

36
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,020
Tell me,

37
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,100
what do you want to eat?

38
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,440
I'll go to Hua Su right now.

39
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,520
I didn't call you just because
I wanted something to eat.

40
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,740
It's just that, these past two days,

41
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,050
I suddenly remembered that taste.

42
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,600
I have a question.

43
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,060
Why was that

44
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,660
taste so bad,

45
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,320
yet I'm so fascinated by it?

46
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,460
Last time, you said
that dish was almost right.

47
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,120
What do you mean by almost right?

48
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,320
It just felt like the taste

49
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,920
wasn't quite right.

50
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,760
Could it be that

51
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,040
you've eaten something she made?

52
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,480
Impossible.

53
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,660
How could anyone eat her food

54
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,000
and want to try it again?

55
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,420
Do you think that girl might

56
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,040
have put something special
in the food

57
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,880
that make people addicted?

58
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,520
I was thinking the same thing.

59
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,480
Now, Hua Su still has many customers.

60
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,120
Could they also be
under some kind of spell?

61
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,320
Just like us,

62
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,220
unable to resist

63
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,540
once they see or smell it?

64
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,760
Why don't you just go
see how she cooks?

65
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,800
Brother Zhengyan.

66
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,040
Brother Zhengyan!

67
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,680
Brother Zhengyan!

68
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,660
What are you thinking about?

69
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,600
I've been calling you for ages,
and you didn't respond.

70
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,700
Nothing.

71
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,840
What's up?

72
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,420
Which hospital does Doctor Xie

73
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,080
from yesterday work at?

74
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,960
He works at…

75
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,520
Why are you asking this?

76
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,280
I get business with him.

77
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,760
You have a new target already?

78
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,140
How could you say that?

79
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,400
What do you mean
by having a new target so soon?

80
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,920
I'd only been in one relationship, okay?

81
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,220
I wasn't planning to fall in love again.

82
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,100
However,

83
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,260
when love

84
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,180
comes,

85
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,080
you can't stop it.

86
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,220
You're one to talk.

87
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,880
Yesterday, you and Fang Meng…

88
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,120
That was an accident.

89
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,440
Talk about yourself.
Why are you talking about me?

90
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,520
So, is Fang Meng your girlfriend?

91
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,480
Yes, she is.

92
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,020
She's your girlfriend?

93
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,780
Then why is she trying
to steal Xie Jun from me?

94
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,840
What's her deal?

95
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,980
Steal Xie Jun from you?

96
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,820
Exactly.

97
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,440
She's trying to steal Xie Jun from you.

98
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,560
An'an,

99
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,080
do you want to pursue Xie Jun?

100
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,260
Why are you so direct?

101
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,280
It's so embarrassing.

102
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,800
I'll help you.

103
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,680
I'm late.

104
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,860
But it didn't stop you from eating!

105
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,900
It's already so late.

106
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,780
You are getting here

107
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,900
later and later.

108
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,940
Sorry, I was dragged into dancing
by Gao Ying yesterday.

109
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,950
My whole body hurt,
and I couldn't sleep all night.

110
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,980
Fine. Go on with your work.

111
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,920
Wait, you...

112
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,700
You went too, didn't you?

113
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,040
With Mr. Shu. I saw it all.

114
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,760
Get to work!

115
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,220
By the way,

116
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,440
I just passed by Uncle Pang's Bun Shop.

117
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,780
He said he's moving.

118
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,980
He asked us to see
if there's anything useful,

119
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,100
and we can go and take them.

120
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,960
He's moving?

121
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,760
But his business has always been good.

122
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,840
Bo Fei Group acquired it.

123
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,380
(Uncle Pang's Bun Shop)

124
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,460
Uncle Pang,

125
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,800
are you really going
to sell the shop like this?

126
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,340
About this matter,

127
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,000
you should look at this positively.

128
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,980
After Bo Fei acquires my shop,

129
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,060
it may become a great restaurant.

130
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,300
People who come here

131
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,280
will get to enjoy more gourmet food.

132
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,080
As for me,

133
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,600
I'll go back to my hometown,

134
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,740
use this money

135
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,920
to get a wife,

136
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,160
open a small shop

137
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,380
in the village,

138
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,760
and live a peaceful life.

139
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,660
How about you?

140
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,840
What's your plan?

141
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,820
Master Pi's gone.

142
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,220
Running Hua Su

143
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,360
must be tough, huh?

144
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,280
It is a bit tough,

145
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,380
but I still want to keep Hua Su

146
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,760
running.

147
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,160
Because of Master Pi?

148
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,660
If he were here,

149
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,300
I'm sure he would've sold the shop too.

150
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,500
And with his skills,

151
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,300
Bo Fei Group would definitely invite him

152
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,120
to join the food street.

153
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,320
That's why I feel like

154
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,760
I'm tarnishing Hua Su's reputation.

155
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,540
Have you thought about

156
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,260
selling your shop to the Bo Fei Group?

157
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,640
You could use money for something else.

158
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,100
I want to run Hua Su

159
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,040
like my father when he was here,

160
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,280
although it's really tough.

161
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,280
Don't you know?

162
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,680
Just because

163
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,040
you refuse to sell,

164
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,100
actually,

165
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,140
you've already offended many people.

166
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,920
Watch out for their revenge.

167
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,260
Why?

168
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,720
What does my not-selling Hua Su
have to do with them?

169
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,360
Because you doesn't sign the contract,

170
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,860
and many people on the food street

171
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,060
won't be able
to sign the real acquisition contract.

172
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,860
What they've signed now is
just an agreement of intent.

173
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,680
They will get only some of the money.

174
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,220
If Bo Fei Group backs out,

175
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,420
the money they gave

176
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,720
could be taken back.

177
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,020
So, Uncle Pang,

178
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,320
did I delay you from getting your money?

179
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,130
My shop…

180
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,300
(Uncle Pang's Bun Shop)

181
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,220
It's fine.

182
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,440
Bo Fei Group already paid me the deposit.

183
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,540
As for the rest,

184
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,700
to be honest,

185
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,700
I'm not in a rush to get it.

186
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,720
I understand you.

187
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,740
You!

188
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,120
I'm sorry, Uncle Pang.

189
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,360
I really can't sell Hua Su.

190
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,780
I understand.

191
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,840
I understand you.

192
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,380
Then let's talk later.

193
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,580
I've still got work to do.

194
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,760
I'll head back now.

195
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,980
- Okay.
- I'm leaving now.

196
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,820
Alright, sure.

197
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:07,920
Take care on your way.

198
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,560
If it were you,

199
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,920
would you really sell Hua Su?

200
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,040
Meng, I can't take it anymore.

201
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,380
Help me carry some quickly.

202
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,600
Hurry up and help me.

203
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,520
What did you need help with?

204
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,200
Help me call the doctor, please.

205
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,520
What's wrong, Meng?

206
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,640
Well, are you hurting anywhere else?

207
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,240
Anywhere else…

208
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,040
Everywhere else is fine.

209
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,920
No, there's something not right about you.

210
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,240
Why are you so upset after kissing?

211
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,180
I made a bowl

212
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,980
of Calming Milk Volcano Noodles.

213
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,080
Try it again.

214
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,980
Come on. Why are you cooking again?

215
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,160
I'll be right back.

216
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,240
Great,

217
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,560
I can't escape.

218
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,340
Quick, take a bit.

219
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,700
Well, I'm full already.

220
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,540
Just try a bite.

221
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,000
You don't have to eat it all.

222
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,600
Well, you...

223
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,980
Why don't you just go to Gao Ying?

224
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,420
Is it that hard?

225
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,320
I've seen you sneaking food
in the kitchen.

226
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,060
I swear,

227
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,380
what I eat is takeout
from the restaurant across the street.

228
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,200
We run a restaurant,

229
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,800
but you're ordering food
from across the street?

230
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,540
Busted.

231
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,280
I paid for it myself.

232
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:43,860
Eat it.

233
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,500
Fine, fine.

234
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,340
I'll eat it.

235
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,280
I'll eat.

236
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,460
What's wrong?

237
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,700
Meng,

238
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,360
this dish needs to be added to our menu.

239
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,620
Really?

240
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,240
I finally succeeded in making a dish.

241
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,360
I meant it's so bad,

242
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,640
maybe it'll make Hua Su more famous.

243
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,020
I clearly remember
my dad making this dish.

244
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,880
It looked just like this.

245
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,000
Why can't I get it right?

246
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,860
Gao Ying was right.

247
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,980
You rely solely on memory

248
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,500
to recreate those six dishes from Master Pi

249
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,100
is like trying to invent Cola

250
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,460
from the ingredient list.

251
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,660
How is that possible?

252
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,440
But how will you know it's impossible
if we don't try?

253
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,680
Look at Hua Su now. Isn't it doing fine?

254
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,680
With the current profit margin,

255
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,100
you'll definitely pay off the debt

256
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,460
in less than three months.

257
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,180
My dad wouldn't want Hua Su

258
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,000
to be like it is now.

259
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,800
If he had taught me earlier,

260
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,880
it wouldn't have come to this.

261
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,040
Meng,

262
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,700
what you've got going for you now
is that your cooking's bad.

263
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,300
If it were any better,

264
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,760
we'd lose half our customers.

265
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,620
Right now, everyone sees your food

266
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,060
as a challenge.

267
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,580
Look at how popular your videos are.

268
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,680
Don't overthink it.

269
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,260
By the way,

270
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,860
how's it going with Mr. Shu?

271
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,040
What's there to it?

272
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,660
Aren't you two dating?

273
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,080
You're the one dating.

274
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,700
I can tell.

275
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,340
He's been coming here so often,

276
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,700
almost as often as I get here to work.

277
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,800
Why does everyone keep saying that?

278
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,580
Aren't you his private chef now?

279
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,900
Why'd you come back?

280
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,120
He's got a split personality,
very terrifying.

281
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,040
Could it be from eating your food?

282
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:39,900
Alright.

283
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,880
I'll get back to work now.

284
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,780
Lady, what would you like to eat?

285
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,400
Eat? Where's your boss?

286
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,920
Over there.

287
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:52,960
Well,

288
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,480
hello,

289
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,720
is something wrong?

290
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,180
Chairman, when did you arrive?

291
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,380
How is your health?

292
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,480
I heard about the party

293
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,260
and about you

294
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,240
and Hua Su's landlady.

295
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,640
Explain it.

296
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,960
I don't know how to explain.

297
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,680
I've put everything on you.

298
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,440
Remember,

299
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,880
your task is to take over Bo Fei Group!

300
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,180
I've fought hard for a month
for this opportunity.

301
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,580
It's to prove yourself,

302
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,800
not for you to fall in love
with a nail house.

303
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,540
Dad, I really don't know

304
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,120
how to explain this.

305
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,580
Tell me. I'm listening.

306
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,140
I'm sure you won't believe it anyway.

307
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,120
Just tell me.

308
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,100
Okay.

309
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,600
I'll tell you.

310
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,300
On the day the Reske Comet arrived,

311
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,380
just like you know,

312
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,240
I

313
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,680
suddenly fainted.

314
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,340
After I woke up,

315
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,820
I started hearing a voice in my head.

316
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,220
It sounds like an old man.

317
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,060
But I couldn't see him.

318
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,260
That's not important.
The important thing is

319
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,580
he can control my actions.

320
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,500
He makes me do things

321
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,860
that aren't in line with my usual self,

322
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,720
like this,

323
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,280
this,

324
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,840
and this.

325
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,820
None of that matters.
What matters most is

326
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,580
he forces me
to eat extremely disgusting food.

327
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,740
And only Hua Su's landlady,

328
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,880
Fang Meng, can make those dishes.

329
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,620
Every time I don't please him,

330
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,700
my body starts

331
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,900
having sorts of issues.

332
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,140
Only after eating her food

333
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,320
can I go back to normal.

334
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,380
So, to stay healthy,

335
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,180
I have to go to Hua Su
to work every day.

336
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,420
However, considering the relationship

337
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,780
between the Company
and Hua Su,

338
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,540
I was afraid people would gossip
behind my back.

339
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,860
So I made up a reason,

340
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,860
saying I was pursuing her.

341
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,400
In fact, it's all a lie.

342
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,660
Then, did you understand,

343
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,500
Dad?

344
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,220
At…

345
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,860
at this point,

346
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,480
you're still joking with me.

347
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,660
I've told you,

348
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,680
but you won't believe it.

349
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,700
I don't care whether you are

350
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,400
really pursuing Fang Meng or not.

351
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,340
I've already made a pledge

352
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,520
to the Board of Directors.

353
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,180
If you can't complete

354
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,680
the SAGA Food Street Plan on time,

355
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,320
everything I've worked for
will be wasted.

356
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,520
It'll all go to someone else,
young master.

357
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,040
By then,

358
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,960
it won't be you with split personality.

359
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,160
It will be me.

360
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,750
Look!

361
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,000
Food poisoning!
You guys are to blame for this!

362
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,500
Auntie, is there some misunderstanding?

363
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,300
We only use the freshest ingredients.

364
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,780
How could it cause food poisoning?

365
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,780
Are you saying I'm lying?

366
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,300
My son ate your food

367
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,340
and got food poisoning.

368
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,800
If you don't believe it,
Son, show them your phone.

369
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,620
Well, what did you eat?

370
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,280
It was your so-called Signature Dish.

371
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,880
It must have been your expired milk.

372
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,040
Milk?

373
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,260
We use milk that is delivered fresh

374
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,680
from the nearby farm.

375
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,780
I've heard

376
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,240
of Hua Su.

377
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,580
Any average person

378
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,560
couldn't make something so disgusting.

379
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,600
You guys just want to get attention,

380
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,480
so you're using expired milk, right?

381
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,200
It's really not.

382
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,880
If you don't believe me,
you can check in the kitchen.

383
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,900
Let's go. We're going to check.

384
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,760
I'll get it.

385
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,380
Auntie, the milk is right here.

386
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,480
You can take a look.

387
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,020
And you say it has yet to expire?

388
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,240
Smell it yourself.

389
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,180
Go ahead, smell it!

390
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,800
Give it to me. I'll smell it.

391
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,040
Oh my! It's really sour.

392
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,760
This was the best seller yesterday.

393
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,940
- How is that possible?
- I've caught you in the act.

394
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,180
You're still trying to deny it?

395
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,660
You… you're harming people.

396
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,620
Compensate! Compensate!

397
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,350
- No, Auntie.
- It's not like that, Auntie.

398
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,140
You're heartless merchants,
You're cheating people!

399
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,180
- Really.
- You're cheating people.

400
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,020
No, no.

401
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,740
Miss,

402
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,060
given your situation,

403
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,380
I suggest you rest more,

404
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,280
exercise more,

405
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,840
and eat lighter foods,

406
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,760
like fruits and vegetables.

407
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,060
Avoid greasy

408
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,200
and spicy foods.

409
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,140
(Specialist Clinic, Doctor Xie Jun)

410
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,720
Sister,

411
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,080
I'm seriously sick.

412
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,480
Can I see the doctor first?

413
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,260
Everyone's waiting in line.

414
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,820
Why should you go ahead?

415
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,660
But…

416
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,280
but only Doctor Xie

417
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,120
can treat my condition.

418
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,760
My condition can only be cured
by Doctor Xie, too.

419
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,860
Exactly. And you're trying to cut in line.
What are you thinking?

420
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,700
You…

421
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,160
Blood!

422
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,080
Miss,

423
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,800
you're coughing up blood!

424
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,630
What's going on here?

425
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,150
Someone's dying?

426
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,360
This is too terrifying.

427
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:35,990
Wait for me!

428
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,360
Thank you, Doctor Xie.

429
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,680
Miss Shen?

430
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,320
It's me.

431
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,760
We must find a way
to get into the kitchen.

432
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,760
I need to see how she cooks.

433
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,040
You don't intend to learn it, do you,
Mr. Shu?

434
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,780
Compensate us!

435
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,040
Or I'll sue you!

436
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,580
- Compensate us!
- Look at it yourself!

437
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,440
Mr. Shu,
their business is really well today.

438
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,500
What are you talking about?
Clearly, something's gone wrong.

439
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,440
Go check it out quickly.

440
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,990
Hurry up
and give us the medical expenses.

441
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,040
Compensate us quickly.

442
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,000
Everyone, listen to me.

443
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,040
We didn't do this on purpose.

444
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,880
It was definitely an oversight,

445
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,220
but it wasn't intentional.

446
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,180
Stop talking nonsense.

447
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,900
The evidence is clear. Pay up!

448
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,860
- Right.
- Sorry.

449
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,140
It's fine that the food is terrible,

450
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,020
but you're using expired ingredients?

451
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,500
I...I didn't.
We really didn't use expired ingredients.

452
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,620
We all saw it with our own eyes.

453
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,780
The evidence is clear,

454
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,720
and you still claim
you didn't use expired items.

455
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,360
What are you doing here?

456
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,000
Is there some misunderstanding?

457
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,640
What happened, Fang Meng?

458
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,100
Aren't you that Black and White Darers?

459
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,220
Why are you siding with them?

460
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,700
Did they bribe you?

461
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,640
Wait a moment.
Brother, look who this is.

462
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,900
Isn't this the other one
of the Black and White Darers?

463
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,860
It's him.

464
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,980
I'm telling you two.

465
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,060
Don't get involved in this matter.

466
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,570
If you do, you'll end up like them,

467
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,460
paying compensation too.

468
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,340
Right, just pay the money,
and it's settled.

469
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,140
Yes, pay the money.

470
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:32,720
Compensate! Compensate!

471
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,560
Compensate! Compensate!

(Specialist Clinic, Doctor Xie Jun)

473
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:43,960
Miss Shen,

474
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,480
what seems to be the problem?

475
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,040
This may be a little uncomfortable.

476
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,900
Doctor Xie,

477
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,960
this may be a little uncomfortable, too.

478
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:09,480
This is also a little uncomfortable.

479
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,040
Doctor Xie.

480
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,520
Miss Shen,

481
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,260
what exactly seems to be the problem?

482
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,960
I don't feel well anywhere.

483
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,760
Miss Shen,

484
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,060
please listen to me.

485
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,550
You'd better get an examination first.

486
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,700
No.

487
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,960
Examinations are so scary.

488
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,040
Doctor Xie, please don't leave.

489
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,800
Doctor Xie,

490
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,600
please don't go.

491
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,760
Doctor Xie,

492
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,980
who do you think
between I and Fang Meng is…

493
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,880
Miss Shen,

494
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,800
please stick out your tongue.

495
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,160
Please stick it out.

496
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,320
Your tongue is coated white,

497
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,990
which shows that your body catches cold.

498
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,920
You're underdressed,

499
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,780
and the cold

500
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,150
can affect your spleen and stomach,

501
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,120
and even the uterus.

502
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,080
Your period isn't very regular, right?

503
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,220
By the way, Doctor Xie,

504
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,780
actually, I came here today

505
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,520
to tell you something very important.

506
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,220
I'm about to go abroad soon

507
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,760
to attend the Australian Music Festival
with friends.

508
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,380
So

509
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,960
I have something important to ask of you.

510
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,200
What is it?

511
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:39,440
Summoning Technique.

512
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,980
One, two, one.

513
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,100
One, two, one, two, one.

514
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,440
One, two, one, stand at attention.

515
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,920
Turn right.

516
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,700
One, two, one, one, two, one.

517
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,960
One, two, one.

518
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,960
Doctor Xie,

519
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,180
this is my treasure, called Sweetie.

520
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,580
While I'm abroad,

521
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,460
could you please take care of it for me?

522
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,380
I…

523
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,060
Take care of it? But I…

524
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,880
I can't trust anyone else.

525
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,300
Sweetie is really,

526
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,220
really important to me.

527
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,780
And recently, Sweetie told me

528
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,000
that it can get along well
with Doctor Xie.

529
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,100
Actually, you could take it to a pet shop…

530
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,820
Doctor Xie,
you know how to take care of Sweetie.

531
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,980
I'll leave that to you.

532
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,380
I'm really sorry,
but I have no other choice.

533
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,100
By the way, I have so much to pack.

534
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,620
You know, going abroad is such a hassle.

535
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,460
I'm leaving now.

536
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,080
Miss Shen,

537
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,660
you're okay?

538
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,300
Much better, nothing's wrong.

539
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,420
Doctor Xie, you're really amazing.

540
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,560
I'm leaving now.

541
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,240
Bye.

542
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,160
They all got paid

543
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,440
and left.

544
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,220
Dazui,

545
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,000
how could the milk have expired?

546
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,780
Couldn't you tell if the milk expired

547
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,400
when making the dish?

548
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,640
Mr. Shu,

549
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,520
her taste buds aren't very sensitive.

550
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,140
I see.

551
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,160
That makes sense now.

552
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,140
Please leave. Stop bothering me, okay?

553
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,060
No, no, no.

554
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,680
Meng, Meng, calm down.

555
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,200
Anyway, we've already compensated them.

556
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,180
Even though we basically lost

557
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,960
profits from this period,

558
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,240
the situation didn't escalate.

559
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,380
Why would the milk expire?

560
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,800
It was just delivered, wasn't it?

561
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,800
Exactly.

562
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,520
Unless…

563
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,240
Unless what?

564
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,720
Hurry up and tell me.

565
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,700
I don't know.

566
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,260
Then why did you say "unless"?

567
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,660
Well, I just thought
the atmosphere was building up,

568
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,920
so I wanted to say something.

569
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,280
Unless the milk had expired
when it was delivered.

570
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,400
I'll call the delivery person
and ask about it.

571
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,720
Hello?

572
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,900
Hello, Organic Dairy Farm.

573
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,420
This is Hua Su Restaurant.

574
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,340
I wanted to inform you

575
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,140
that the milk you delivered expired.

576
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,280
Hua Su Restaurant…

577
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,080
Expired? That's impossible.

578
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,820
Really? Many of our customers ended up

579
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,000
with food poisoning.

580
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,380
- I'll check on this.
- Check?

581
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,240
When will you have an update?

582
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,340
I…

583
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,160
How could they be so unreliable?
