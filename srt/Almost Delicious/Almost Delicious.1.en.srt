(Why is that?)

37
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,220
(An event that occurs every 666 years,)

(the Gemini Comet Miracle.)

42
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,460
Mr. Shu!

43
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,860
Stop filming
and call an ambulance quickly.

44
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,700
What's going on?

45
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,980
Hello, Emergency Services.
Someone fainted.

46
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,420
Are you alright, Mr. Shu? Wake up!

47
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,860
(Six hours earlier)

48
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,180
Hello, Mr. Shu.

49
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,700
Mr. Shu, this is our signature dish.

50
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,100
If we could join
your SAGA Food Street plan,

51
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,780
it would be a great honor for us.

52
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,420
Mr. Shu, please try this.

53
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,100
Bring another dish for Mr. Shu.

54
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,180
Please try this one.

55
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,870
It's a popular item in our restaurant.

56
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,700
Pink Swan.

57
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,020
Crispy and sweet.

58
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,700
Bring another dish.

59
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,300
Mr. Shu, you...

60
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,420
Mr. Shu...

61
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,780

(My father, due to mental illness,)

65
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,380
(had to step back from the frontline.)

66
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,100
(He placed everything on my shoulders.)

67
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,890
(I had no choice but to take it on,)

68
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,020
(in place of my father.)

69
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,980
(I have made all the preparations.)

70
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,900
Let's go.

71
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,260
Who are you?

72
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,900
Sorry, sir, sorry.

73
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,060
Mr. Shu, I sincerely apologize.

74
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,700
The license plate number is 174,

75
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,420
not 147.

76
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,340
Do I have to teach you Mandarin?

77
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,540
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

78
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,900
What did you have for lunch?

79
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,060
I'm asking what you had for lunch.

80
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,300
Takeout.

81
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,460
Snail rice noodles, super delicious.

82
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,320
As an assistant to the president

83
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,020
of a company developing a food street plan,

84
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,260
if your standard for food

85
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,340
is just like this,

86
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,700
I advise you to resign soon.

87
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,100
Moreover,

88
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,220
starting today,

89
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,100
all employees

90
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,570
should not order takeout.

91
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,540
Just eat in the staff canteen.

92
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,780
Alright.

93
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,540
By the way, Mr. Shu,

94
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,270
during your one-month trial
as president,

95
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,240
(SAGA Food Street Acquisition Plan)
the most important thing

96
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,060
is to acquire

97
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,260
(Food Street Restaurants Information)
all the restaurants on this food street.

98
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,100
At the same time,

99
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,780
introduce global top restaurants

100
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,140
to this place,

101
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,100
and then redevelop

102
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,940
a food street belonging to Bo Fei Group.

103
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,220
This is the information

104
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,630
I have organized

105
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,020
regarding the existing merchants.

106
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,340
(Hua Su Restaurant)

107
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,220
(Hua Su)

108
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,620
(First Place)

109
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,100
(First Place in Culinary Competition
for Food Street)

110
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,100
(No entry for non-staff and Fang Meng)

111
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,340
(Power Switch)

112
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,500
Fang Meng!

113
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,540
(This bald man is me, Pi Zijie,)

114
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,500
(top chef of Yucheng Food Street.)

115
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,500
(This little girl,)

116
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,140
(with an admiring gaze,)

117
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,260
(is my daughter)

118
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,340
(Fang Meng.)

119
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,900
(Under my influence,)

120
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,980
(the idea of being a chef)

121
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,860
(has slowly grown in her heart.)

122
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,740
(Hua Su)
(With the opening of Hua Su,)

123
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,180
(Fang Meng has stepped into my kitchen.)

124
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,180
(But when it comes to cooking,)

125
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,980
(she is nothing like me.)

126
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,660
(She really has no talent.)

127
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,500
(Whenever she picks up the utensil,)

128
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,580
(those around her are in trouble.)

129
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,260
(No matter how many times she fails,)

130
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,580
(it never extinguishes her passion.)

131
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,140
Oh, my goodness.

132
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,540
It's all ruined.

133
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,100
Don't cry.

134
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,780
(I wonder)

135
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,020
(how someone born with dull taste)

136
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,020
(can become a chef.)

137
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,180
(Thus,)

138
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,900
(for the good of Hua Su and my life,)

139
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,220
(I decided)

140
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,220
(to keep her away from the kitchen)

141
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,060
(and not teach her to cook.)

142
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,420
(No entry for non-staff and Fang Meng)

143
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,100
Why are you here again?

144
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,940
It's not business hours yet.

145
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,380
So I wanted to make a dish.

146
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,780
How many times have I told you?

147
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,090
You're not allowed in the kitchen.

148
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,980
What have you made here?

149
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,980
Isn't it because you didn't teach me?

150
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,220
If you had taught me,

151
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,700
I wouldn't have made it like this.

152
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,460
If I teach you, do you have the talent?

153
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,020
Look what you've made,

154
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,100
even dogs won't eat it.

155
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,140
You...

156
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,830
I'll just throw it away.

157
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,940
Master Pi,

158
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,620
since you always scold Fang Meng,

159
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,140
why do you eat up

160
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,460
what she makes every time?

161
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,020
And you just said,

162
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,540
even dogs wouldn't eat it.

163
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,500
What do you mean by every time?

164
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,170
This is the first time, isn't it?

165
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,260
Really?

166
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,820
I've seen it several times.

167
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,750
(Washroom)
I'm going to the washroom.

168
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,340
Do you want to teach her or not?

169
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,180
What did you say?

170
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,060
I'll teach you how to cook.

171
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,380
Isn't it a surprise?

172
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,500
Master Pi, are you crazy?

173
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,700
You're crazy.

174
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,140
What's going on here?

175
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,700
What did you just say?

176
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,740
I'll teach you how to cook.

177
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,380
Who's teaching who?

178
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,740
Make it clear.

179
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,140
Pi Zijie will teach Fang Meng
how to cook.

180
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,130
My daughter is quite something.

181
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,060
Keeping the evidence,

182
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,100
are you afraid I'll go back on my word?

183
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,940
I'm getting older.

184
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,020
I guess,

185
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,500
I won't be able to be a chef long.

186
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,780
After thinking it over,

187
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,900
I have to hand it over to you.

188
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,740
What did you mean by that?

189
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,500
Anyway, starting today,

190
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,550
I'll officially teach you how to cook.

191
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,100
Once you master
the six signature dishes,

192
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,460
even after I retire,

193
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,900
Hua Su will still run well.

194
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,380
I announce

195
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,620
that from now on,

196
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,140
we have two chefs.

197
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,740
Alright, alright.

198
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,220
The cake shop is about to close.

199
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,060
I'll go get you a cake.

200
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,420
The strawberry cake you love.

201
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,900
I'll go pick it up.

202
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,330
Going to change clothes.

203
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,140
Be back soon, Dad.

204
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,140
Alright.

205
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,700
Mr. Shu,

206
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,660
within one month,

207
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,820
just one month,

208
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,500
if you settle the SAGA plan,

209
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,300
you can openly and legitimately

210
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,020
become the president of Bo Fei Group.

211
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,540
An Zhijiang won't dare to cause trouble.

212
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,180
By then, the Chairman

213
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,380
can retire peacefully.

214
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,220
I have staked all my chips

215
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,260
to push you to your current position,

216
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,980
just to prevent Bo Fei Group

217
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,220
from being taken over by others.

218
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,980
Don't let me down.

219
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,700
Remember that?

220
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,260
(Miracle Radio)
Hello everyone,

221
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,500
this is Miracle Radio.

222
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,380
I am Lun.

223
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,740
Hello everyone, I am Li.

224
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,180
Li, do you know?

225
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,300
Today is going to be a special day.

226
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,540
Why is that?

227
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,180
An event that occurs every 666 years,

228
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,100
the Gemini Comet,

229
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,580
is set to appear today.

230
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,100
The Gemini Comet

231
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,220
actually refers to two comets,

232
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,980
the Reske Comet

233
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,180
and the Zelda Comet.

234
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,020
According to the legend,
in the two months

235
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,860
when the two comets arrive,

236
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,020
something magical will happen.

237
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,340
Mr. Shu, listen,

238
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,220
it's a good omen.

239
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,460
What happened?

240
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,020
Mr. Shu, there was a car accident.

241
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,700
It seems quite serious.

242
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,380
Hello, Emergency Services.
There was a car accident.

243
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,350
Car accident?

244
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,780
- Yes, someone was hit.
- So serious.

245
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,940
- Is it okay?
- Very serious.

246
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,980
Dear listeners,

247
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,700
the first one of the Gemini Comet,

248
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,740
the Reske Comet, is about to arrive.

249
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,190
There was a car accident.

250
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,350
How terrible!

251
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,140
(Where am I?)

252
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,540
(Who am I?)

253
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,220
Hurry up!

254
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,060
Check for life signs.

255
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,580
Come.

256
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,660
I'll go check.

257
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,180
It's very dangerous, don't go.

258
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,340
So beautiful.

259
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,180
Sure it is.

260
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,420
Take a photo, quick!

261
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,540
Hurry, take a photo!

262
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,860
Truly beautiful.

263
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,980
This is so beautiful.

264
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,580
Look.

265
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,820
Look there.

266
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,540
Take more photos.

267
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,180
It's really beautiful.

268
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,940
I don't wanna die yet.

269
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,580
I have no idea who I am.

270
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,300
I'm not ready to die.

271
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,380
Not yet.

272
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,740
Mr. Shu!

273
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,900
Mr. Shu.

274
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,380
Stop filming
and call an ambulance quickly.

275
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,750
- Hello, Emergency Services. Someone fainted.
- Mr. Shu.

276
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,860
Are you alright, Mr. Shu? Wake up!

277
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,860
Fang Meng!

278
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,100
Master Pi had an accident.

279
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,300
(One week later)

280
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,340
What's going on? Is there a fire?

281
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,140
What is that smell?

282
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,140
Was the toilet drain pipe broken?

283
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,540
Isn't this Master Pi's restaurant?

284
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,540
Yes, it is.

285
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,460
Didn't you know? Master Pi passed away.

286
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,420
We are police, over here.

287
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,200
- Everyone step back.
- Watch out.

288
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,300
- Disperse, everyone!
- Disperse.

289
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,140
Spread out, everyone!

290
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,300
Spread out.

291
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,340
What's happening?

292
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,540
Be careful, watch out.

293
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,540
Don't move.

294
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,820
Is the ventilator broken?

295
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,260
Why is the smell so strong?

296
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,420
I'm talking to you.

297
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,460
The smell.

298
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,100
Is it very strong?

299
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,260
You didn't notice such a strong smell?

300
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,660
Is it really a restaurant?

301
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,700
Leaving.

302
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,760
What did you just say? Pardon?

303
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,240
I'll teach you how to cook.

304
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,460
Who's teaching who?

305
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,500
Make it clear.

306
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,140
Pi Zijie will teach Fang Meng
how to cook.

307
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,660
Is that okay?

308
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,820
I can learn by myself.

309
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:15,900
Just watch.

310
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,860
(Jiangnan University Affiliated Hospital)

311
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,500
Hello, Mr. Shu.

312
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,700
I have reviewed your scans.

313
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,740
Your body is in good condition.

314
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,050
Just a minor injury
on the back of the head.

315
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,260
The fainting might be due to the stress

316
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,660
you've just taken the position.

317
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,620
With this food street project,

318
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,580
it's quite exhausting.

319
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,740
You should rest for a while.

320
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,780
How did he know about the project?

321
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,900
I didn't disclose it.

322
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,940
I'm leaving, Doctor.

323
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,740
Mr. Shu, aren't you staying?

324
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,990
- Hello, Mr. Shu.
- Hello, Mr. Shu.

325
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,980
What's wrong, Mr. Shu?

326
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,220
I don't know why I feel

327
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,860
that something's wrong with my body.

328
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,500
Didn't the doctor say it was okay?

329
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,080
Please get me another doctor.

330
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,460
That doctor knows too much.

331
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,100
Understood.

332
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,660
Mr. Shu!

333
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,140
Mr. Shu.

334
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,220
I heard that a few days ago,

335
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,620
you fainted on the road

336
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,940
and went to the hospital.

337
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,260
How are you now?

338
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,200
Are you feeling better?

339
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,500
I'm in excellent health.

340
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,060
No need to worry.

341
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,420
Mr. Shu, you've worked so hard.

342
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,700
Be sure to take good care of yourself.

343
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,730
The veteran employees of Bo Fei Group

344
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,300
are counting on you to lead them

345
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,060
to keep striving

346
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,460
and making contributions.

347
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,700
Please be sure to take care of yourself.

348
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,900
Mr. Shu, your lunch is ready.

349
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,660
Try this dish, how is it?

350
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,020
Meng, I can't stand it anymore.

351
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,780
Take it to Gao Ying instead.

352
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,860
I've already taken it to Gao Ying

353
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:25,980
yesterday.

354
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,220
She said not anymore.

355
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,020
But she has no choice.

356
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,980
She's your best friend.

357
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,620
She doesn't have much to do at work.

358
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,780
And she can go to the washroom anytime.

359
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,700
I can't. If I leave, what about work?

360
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,220
This...

361
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,220
Forget it.

362
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,540
Anyway, you are not able to judge.

363
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,700
I'll let Gao Ying try it.

364
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,300
Just give it to her.

365
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,700
Haven't I told you

366
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,580
not to come over?

367
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,540
Why do you insist on making me try it?

368
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,060
Ask Dazui to do it.

369
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,060
He's so idle.

370
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,540
Recently,

371
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,060
I've been trying
to recreate the six dishes

372
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,140
for too many times.

373
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,260
My taste has never been sharp.

374
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,940
Now I can't taste anything at all.

375

Then why do you insist on being a chef?

Because I like it.
