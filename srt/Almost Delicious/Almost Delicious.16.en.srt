31
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,920
I remember now.

32
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,700
I am Pi Zijie,

33
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,260
Fang Meng's father.

34
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,100
Is it good?

35
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,300
Is it tasty or not?

36
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,740
I'll taste it myself.

37
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,740
I still can't taste anything.

38
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,380
No wonder my dad
didn't want me to be a chef.

39
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,420
I wonder if his cooking
tastes like this too.

40
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,660
I've actually made a...

41
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,260
Fang Meng.

42
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,180
I'm your father.

43
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,820
Shu Zhengyan.

44
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,420
Are you crazy?

45
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,640
Fang Meng,
I have something to tell you.

46
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,140
You have to believe me.

47
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,920
There's another person

48
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,860
inside my body.

49
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,480
There you go again.

50
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,480
It's true, Fang Meng.

51
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,040
Your dad is in my body right now.

52
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,460
Which means, I am your father.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,860
Shu Zhengyan.

54
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,140
Do you think this is funny?

55
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,440
Ask me about you.

56
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,320
I know everything.

57
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,220
That's enough.

58
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,920
I may not know about you,

59
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,480
but Master Pi
definitely knows everything.

60
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,800
Ask me, and I'll answer.

61
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,120
Then you'll have to believe me.

62
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,040
I'm telling the truth.

63
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,880
Enough!

64
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,420
I won't allow you
to joke about my father.

65
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,220
Fang Meng, Fang Meng!

66
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,140
It's not my fault.

67
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,460
Then, what should we do?

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,300
I can't keep hiding it from her.

69
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,140
She doesn't believe it, what can we do?

70
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,740
Don't rush.

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,100
And don't control me later.

72
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,780
Or I'll really seem like a lunatic.

73
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,080
Okay.

74
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,500
How do you plan to tell her?

75
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,540
Let's not tell her about this yet.

76
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,300
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,940
I was wrong.

78
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,580
I shouldn't have joked with you today.

79
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,460
I took the joke too far.

80
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,660
But I really,

81
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,260
really miss him.

82
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,940
He was right.

83
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,200
I'm just not cut out to be a chef.

84
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,680
I don't have the talent.

85
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,180
No one likes the food I make.

86
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,660
My dad managed Hua Su
for half his life.

87
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,100
And now, in my hands,

88
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,180
it's all ruined.

89
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,120
Nothing is left.

90
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,180
I can't do anything right.

91
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,700
It's not your fault.

92
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,580
Master Pi definitely won't blame you.

93
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,160
But...

94
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,540
But I blame him.

95
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,240
I really blame him.

96
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,100
He broke his promise. He lied to me.

97
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,760
He said he would teach me to cook.

98
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,780
But he left on his own.

99
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,740
He just left me here alone,

100
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,820
leaving Hua Su all to me.

101
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,100
I can't do it.

102
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,360
I really can't.

103
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,340
Haven't you seen it yourself?

104
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,420
Why didn't you teach her to cook?

105
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,220
Who says one can't cook
without a sense of taste?

106
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,700
Didn't you teach her those four dishes?

107
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,180
Didn't she learn them well?

108
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,420
Let's stop talking about this, okay?

109
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,400
Should we tell her about us?

110
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,340
Tell her what?

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,820
What else is there to tell her?

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,580
She's in there crying so much.

113
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,180
If you don't feel bad, I do.

114
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,000
How could I not feel bad for her?

115
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,400
She's my daughter,
my own flesh and blood.

116
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,480
Don't I feel worse than you?

117
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,220
But she's also my girlfriend.

118
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,060
Who's your girlfriend?

119
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,420
Fang Meng.

120
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,020
How did she become your girlfriend?

121
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,380
Did I agree?

122
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,460
I really like her.

123
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,580
You like her?

124
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,840
Does she like you?

125
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,860
Of course, she does.

126
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,260
Not necessarily.

127
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,760
She likes you

128
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,380
because you eat her food.

129
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,900
And you cook with her.

130
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,420
This was all my doing.

131
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,700
She thought it was you, but it was me.

132
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,680
She felt a father's love.

133
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,980
She mistakenly thought it was you.

134
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,640
If she knew I was inside your body,

135
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,500
would she still like you?

136
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,400
You need to recognize your place.

137
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,240
What?

138
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,700
What do you mean
by recognizing my place?

139
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,280
Right now, you're in my body.

140
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,500
And you're causing me trouble!

141
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,700
Here we go again.

142
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,620
Without me, could you two
even be in a relationship?

143
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,280
You two are completely
mismatched ingredients.

144
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,680
Forcing it together in one pot,

145
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,520
can it taste good?

146
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,700
If there's a choice, it's not you.

147
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,220
Without me, could you two
even be in a relationship?

148
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,000
You two are completely
mismatched ingredients.

149
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,300
Forcing it together in one pot,

150
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,280
can it taste good?

151
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,700
If there's a choice, it's not you.

152
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,580
You woke up?

153
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,280
What are you thinking about?

154
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,460
Why are you here again?

155
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,800
What do you mean, again?

156
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,900
I've always been here.

157
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,680
Didn't you only show up

158
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,640
when you smelled

159
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,840
Fang Meng's cooking?

160
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,140
That was before.

161
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,760
Now I remember everything.

162
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,060
I can come out whenever I want.

163
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,480
Does liking someone

164
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,900
have to be this complicated?

165
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,840
Xie Jun.

166
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,300
Would you like to be my boyfriend?

167
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,700
Doctor, does it work here too?

168
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,740
Sorry, sorry.

169
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,820
Sorry, sorry.

170
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,020
Sorry, sorry.

171
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,740
Sorry, sorry.

172
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,240
Doctor Xie.

173
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,020
What's wrong with you these days?

174
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,900
Are you feeling unwell?

175
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,920
Director.

176
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,960
Sorry.

177
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,620
This was a mistake in my work.

178
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,660
Didn't you just return from leave?

179
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,100
Why do you seem off?

180
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,200
Yes.

181
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,740
I will adjust my state quickly.

182
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,140
It won't affect work.

183
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,860
Let me know
if there are any difficulties.

184
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,240
Don't let it affect work.

185
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,460
Yes, Director.

186
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,500
Don't worry.

187
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,200
Doctor Xie, this is No. 13's case.

188
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,060
Please take a look.

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,400
Where did you go recently?

190
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,340
Was it fun?

191
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,380
Peach Blossom Town, it was quite fun.

192
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,460
By the way,
why hasn't Miss Shen come recently?

193
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,060
If you're free tomorrow,

194
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,660
let's have dinner together again.

196
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,740
Just drop me here.

197
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,740
I still have a lot of work
to do at the magazine.

198
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,020
I'll head up and get busy.

199
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,840
An'an.

200
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,140
Your hair is all messy.

201
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,960
Thanks.

202
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,660
Xie Jun.

203
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,020
Do you know him?

204
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,980
Xie Jun, are you here for me?

205
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,900
I've been busy at the hospital lately.

206
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,140
I'll return Sweetie to you first.

207
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,140
An'an, why not introduce us?

208
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,860
Just...

209
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,540
A friend.

210
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,340
He

211
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,260
has been helping me
take care of Sweetie.

212
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,560
Hello.

213
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,820
My name is Xie Jun, I'm a doctor.

214
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,660
A doctor?

215
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,060
Truly accomplished at a young age.

216
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,260
Hello, I'm Shi Kai,

217
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,900
An'an's boyfriend.

218
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,580
By the way, Doctor Xie,

219
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,980
where do you work?

220
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,500
I admire doctors the most.

221
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,140
Let's leave first.

222
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,940
Wait, An'an.

223
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,500
We should send him home.

224
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,720
Doctor Xie.

225
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,660
How about we both drive you home?

226
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,800
I have a car.

227
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,000
No need.

228
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,780
It's fine, don't bother.

229
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,820
Really, no need.

230
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,340
I have work at the hospital.

231
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,740
Then, we'll leave now.

232
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,400
Take care.

233
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,860
Goodbye.

235
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,440
I'll do it.

236
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,200
An'an.

237
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,860
About Sweetie,

238
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,220
leave it to me.

239
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,940
I noticed that recently,

240
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,700
it's not eating much.

241
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,840
Moreover,

242
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,340
its food is still with me.

243
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,700
Although it's mischievous,

244
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,980
luckily, I'm used to it.

245
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,860
I'll take good care of it.

246
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,760
It's fine.

247
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,300
Let's take Sweetie back with us.

249
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,840
Doctor Xie is so busy,

250
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,780
working overtime every day.

251
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,420

Today, following your instructions,

281
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,640
I didn't bring anyone else.

I'm your waitress Shen An'an.

284
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,220
Sorry.

285
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,200
I was making breakfast
for Shu Zhengyan this morning

286
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,580
and lost track of time.

287
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,420
It's okay.

288
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,860
How have you been lately?

289
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,680
Me?

290
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,540
I'm alright, not too exhausted.

291
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,520
No.

292
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,580
I meant, how are you and Mr. Shu?

293
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,300
I guess good.

294
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,340
Guess?

295
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,820
What's going on
between you and Mr. Shu?

296
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,420
It's just that he's always a bit peculiar.

297
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,020
He acts strange every day.

298
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,020
It's like he has multiple personalities.

299
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,980
Did he tell you?

300
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,440
What?

301
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,540
That there's another voice

302
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,300
in his body.

303
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,340
He told you too?

304
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,380
Then I understand.

305
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,660
Mr. Shu's condition is quite unique.

306
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,340
Judging by his demeanor,

307
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,540
he doesn't seem to be lying.

308
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,620
Moreover, his current state

309
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,740
is indeed a bit odd.

310
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,460
So, what can be done?

311
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,960
I heard

312
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,400
his company recently
arranged a new doctor

313
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,460
to examine him.

314
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,780
Just wait a bit longer.

315
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,100
That's all we can do.

316
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,260
Table No. 2, your coffee is ready.

317
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,380
I'll get it.

318
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,980
How are things going
between you and Shen An'an?

319
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,080
Have you already

320
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,380
fallen for her?

321
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,860
What's wrong?

322
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,680
If you don't like her,

323
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,980
you can tell her directly.

324
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,520
I also think

325
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,140
Shen An'an is a bit too lively.

326
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,180
That's not what I mean.

327
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,860
Then what is it?

328
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,260
Her ex-boyfriend is back.

329
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,940
Ex-boyfriend?

330
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,160
No.

331
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,120
She had a boyfriend?

332
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,900
With her tricks,
she could actually win boys over?

333
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,260
I heard her mention it before.

334
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,060
But she didn't say much.

335
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,120
I don't know what happened

336
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,100
between them.

337
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,860
So what does Shen An'an mean?

338
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,940
I don't know either.

339
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,260
Stop overthinking.

340
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,240
You don't even like her, right?

341
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,280
What's the big deal?

342
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,980
I thought I didn't like her.

343
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,340
At that time,
I wanted to avoid her every day.

344
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,340
But

345
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,460
she seems fine

346
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,060
except being a bit noisy.

347
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,340
- But...
- Congratulations.

348
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,660
You've started to fall for her.

349
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,440
Me?

350
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,720
Is it that obvious?

351
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,860
Way too obvious.

352
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,780
Look at you.

353
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,280
When she is proactive,

354
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,260
you avoid her.

355
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,780
Now she's not proactive anymore,

356
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,060
and you're anxious instead.

357
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,500
No wonder you're single.

358
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,020
I'm not exactly passive.

359
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,160
Before, I just

360
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,100
wasn't sure if she really liked me.

361
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,620
You have to help me.

362
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,100
I don't know what to do now.

363
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,380
Don't you just want to confirm

364
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,700
whether An'an truly likes you?

365
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,860
Let's test her.

366
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,500
How do we test?

367
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,960
Honestly,

368
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,900
since you regained your memory,

369
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,380
there are some benefits.

370
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,500
What benefits?

371
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,600
I don't have to eat

372
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,980
those awful dishes anymore.

373
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,200
Stop talking.

374
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,420
Thinking about it scares me.

375
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,620
But I can't resist

376
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,100
trying her cooking.

377
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,140
I really don't understand you now.

378
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,360
One moment,
you're interested in her cooking.

379
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,200
And the next, you're unwilling

380
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,200
to teach her.

381
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,340
What exactly are you thinking?

382
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,520
By the way,

383
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,540
there's one more important thing.

384
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,200
My...

385
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,900
- Let's go.
- Huh? What do you mean?

386
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,060
What are you doing?

387
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,660
Chairman, you're back.

388
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,580
Back?

389
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,780
Where exactly am I back to?

390
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,200
Go out. Wait for me outside.

391
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,040
Yes.

392
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,420
How did the examination go?

393
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,640
Dad,

394
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,300
I think An Zhijiang is behind all this.

395
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,020
He took advantage of my absence

396
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,460
to establish his authority.

397
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,680
Do you think I can't notice

398
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,820
the things you see?

399
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,060
Then what can be done about it?

400
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,820
Didn't you create all these
opportunities for him yourself?

401
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,380
I have never doubted your abilities.

402
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,060
But make me proud!

403
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,160
If within this month,

404
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,940
you can't prove yourself,

405
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,160
I'll have to transfer all my shares

406
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,740
to someone else.

407
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,800
The Bo Fei Group I built

408
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,120
will be someone else's.

409
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,080
Do you understand

410
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,060
the importance of this matter?

411
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,620
What about the tenant?

412
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,700
She went out.

413
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,240
Dad.

414
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,700
I believe Hua Su has its merits.

415
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,780
I have indeed tried her dishes.

416
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,620
You're really planning on this?

417
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,900
I'm not biased, son.

418
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,300
You know the reputation of Hua Su.

419
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,040
Besides, with your relationship
with Fang Meng,

420
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,760
if you force her to settle in now...

421
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,140
Dad, I didn't intend to force her in.

422
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,680
I think Fang Meng

423
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,220
can rely on her own merits...

424
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,500
It's not as easy as you think.

425
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,440
You think the conclusion

426
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,860
is something I can decide alone?

427
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,540
Those old guys are hard to deal with.

428
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,780
The priority now

429
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,120
is to take care of your own health.

430
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,320
Don't let anyone catch you again.

431
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,220
Got it?

432
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,180
I understand, Dad.

433
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,560
Is there really something wrong

434
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,180
with you mentally?

435
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,580
No.

436
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,140
There's nothing wrong at all.

437
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,380
I knew it.

438
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,260
Your mom and I are so healthy.

439
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,420
How could there be a problem?

440
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,620
Absurd.

441
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,780
Hurry up with your homework.

442
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,960
I don't want your mom
to keep docking my allowance

443
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,020
because you're being disobedient.

444
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,280
Mr. Shu.

445
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,260
Do you still have that condition?

446
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,820
What condition?

447
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,540
Didn't you say

448
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,700
there's another person in your head?

449
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,880
No.

450
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,740
He doesn't exist anymore.

451
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,860
Doesn't exist?

452
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,180
Maybe I was under a lot of pressure

453
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,820
and it was easy to hallucinate.

454
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,700
I've already passed
the mental evaluation.

455
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,980
Good that you're fine.

456
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,340
Why don't you tell him the truth?

457
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,220
I can't make people feel
I'm abnormal right now.

458
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,760
Mr. Shu.

459
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,140
Are you okay?

460
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,120
I'm fine.

461
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,940
But

462
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,180
did you call me here just for this?

463
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,300
It's actually about Shen An'an.

464
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,760
Thanks.

465
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,840
You're welcome.

466
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,900
Shi Kai actually came back.

467
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,900
You know him too?

468
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,620
Of course I know.

469
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,860
He's Anan's first love.

470
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,820
They were in love for three years.

471
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,820
An'an loved him passionately.

472
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,740
Later, he refused
to return to the country

473
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,500
and left without warning.

474
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,740
An'an was heartbroken for a long time.

475
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,540
It seems

476
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,420
An'an still can't forget him.

477
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,500
But

478
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,260
so much time has passed.

479
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,660
An'an must have
figured things out by now.

480
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,060
An'an

481
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,860
isn't the type
to leave without explaining.

482
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,660
Because she has suffered
such pain before.

483
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,200
An'an.

484
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,620
You're not happy that I'm back?

485
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,320
No.

486
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,500
Welcome back.

487
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,260
Here, An'an.

488
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,200
What's wrong?

489
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,280
I can do it myself.

490
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,300

I want to apologize to you.

I'm sorry that I didn't tell you

497
