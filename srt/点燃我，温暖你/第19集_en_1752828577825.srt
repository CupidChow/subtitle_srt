YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if the light is very bright

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will still watch over that vast vast land

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless atmosphere

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day, the lens is a little bit yellow

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast night?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I burn up the night just for you to remember

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How everything was in the beginning

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The wind and the color of the night are like wild grass

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The mountains are broken, but you are still by my side

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Everything is the original look

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The King of Blaze

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Episode 1

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I have been working on my major for three years

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He seemed to be very short-tempered in high school

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Then I found out that his mother had cancer and later died

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Don't don't don't

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
How did you get hurt?

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I just had a physical education class

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I hit the blue bar and there was a nail right behind it

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Doctor, am I going to break the wind?

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Can I dance? I don't want to lose my mind

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's okay. Just hit a broken wind

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You sit here and wait for me. I'll pay the bill

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Li Xun, Li Xun

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You have a wound too

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Let me see

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Li Xun

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Li Xun, my leg is injured

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The doctor said I would have to take a month off

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I have paid for your homework

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I want to borrow his money

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But I know it's not necessary

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
He is always arrogant

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
He is still the kind of person who can't find a reason

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Because he has suffered a lot

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But he never dared

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Later, he relied on the technology of hacking

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But he never stole other people's things

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He just helped others steal

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He just hacked back

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
He is quite a man

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
He said Liu Xiang ran fast

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Not for the sake of being a thief

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
He was so strong when he was a kid

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I was 17 years old

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I have been a partner of my partner

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Even the teacher said

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I don't want to dance anymore

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
At that time, I thought my world was going to collapse

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I didn't know how to fall

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But Li Xun found me at that time

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
He told me

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He said

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Idiot

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Do you need to say that?

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Why is the story so long?

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
He said idiot

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Idiot

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The way to victory is long

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We just started

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He scolded me many times

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But I only think that one time was sincere

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So from that time, I started to think

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
If we are real brothers

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I just want to be a good brother

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So after I was born

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I just called him by his name

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And I thought I was a friend

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
How about it?

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Quite reasonable

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Do me a favor

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Say thank you

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You two brothers are really alike

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It has nothing to do with my dad

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's all my own money

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I know he is capable

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
He has many ways to make money

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But he spends a lot of money

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Right?

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He wants to do something big

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
He wants to make it a big deal

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I know he won't accept my dad's kindness

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But he is not a good person

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I know

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
He is my dad's good man

93
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But he really lacks motivation

94
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
He is not like others

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Right?

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Anyway, I rely on dancing

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
To support my own chance

98
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Basically

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You just take me as an entry

100
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I won't care about you

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
If you don't believe

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We can start a contract now

103
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Zhu Yuanyuan

104
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I will never harm you

105
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Believe me

106
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I want to help you

107
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You know him

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
He still has no reason

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
He doesn't want to be treated like a fish

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
He is relieved

111
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Only when he earns every penny

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And he makes the decision himself

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Don't worry

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I will be with him

115
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
All his dreams will come true

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Come

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Ok

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I am leaving

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Zhu Yuanyuan

120
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Li Xun is very capable

121
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But he has some weaknesses

122
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Maybe it's related to his own experience

123
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Sometimes he is really extreme

124
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
He is very good at everything

125
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But he is not good at everything

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He is not good at everything

127
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
He is not good at everything

128
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He is not good at everything

129
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
He is not good at everything

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But he is very extreme

131
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Like walking steel

132
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I know

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
He didn't like to receive help from others

134
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
But now he has you

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Right?

136
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
University is the beginning of his life

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
He takes it as the beginning

138
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I will be with him

139
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
This is my new beginning

140
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Ok

141
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Bye bye

142
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Bye bye

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Bye bye

144
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,380
Your school's

145
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,000
Purchase list hasn't come down yet?

146
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Not yet

147
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I think our school has always been late

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's so late to make other choices

149
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
In the end, in case there is no Purchase

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's late again

151
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Choose a good school abroad

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
In the end, it's a two-way street

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yes

154
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I will call your teacher Zhang tomorrow

155
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Call and ask

156
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's useless to ask the class teacher

157
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
This kind of thing is managed by the college

158
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's useless to ask

159
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yesterday, Fang Shumiao asked you

160
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's not reliable

161
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You don't think about the students at all

162
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yes

163
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
If everyone is like you

164
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That's great

165
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That's true

166
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I tell you, Yunyun

167
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You must pay more attention to your own things

168
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
When there is news

169
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Tell me immediately

170
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
We will plan again

171
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I know

172
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Do you want to come back? I hang up first

173
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm back

174
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Your salt

175
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Are you still full?

176
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I haven't thought about it yet

177
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm so sweaty

178
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm so full

179
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm so hungry

180
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Miao Miao

181
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Is your salt-saving final grade enough?

182
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Don't be so straightforward

183
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You have to give the child some face

184
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But I advise you

185
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's about your future

186
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Graduation is like standing at a foggy road

187
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Can't see or touch anything

188
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Don't be emotional

189
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I am an example that was delayed by life

190
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm not emotional

191
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
This is the first time I really make a decision for myself

192
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Still many options

193
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Ye Lin

194
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Tata

195
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Hi

196
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,840
Brother, do you have time tonight?

197
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,640
I'll go first.

198
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,840
What did you say, dear?

199
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,400
I said, are you free tonight?

200
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,080
I want to have dinner with you.

201
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,840
Sure, sure.

202
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,880
What do you want to eat?

203
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,760
The restaurant you took me to last time.

204
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,640
I'll wait for you at eight tonight.

205
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,880
Miss Xu.

206
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,440
For me?

207
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,000
Yes.

208
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,080
Mr. Gao is waiting for you inside.

209
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,440
Please.

210
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,680
Thank you.

211
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,160
Nana.

212
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,160
Today is the 900th day we've known each other.

213
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,480
I have something to tell you.

214
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,720
The first time I met you in the department of gender science,

215
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,560
I thought

216
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,680
I've never seen such a beautiful girl.

217
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,640
When you looked at me and talked to me,

218
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,520
I even felt embarrassed to look at you.

219
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,680
Dear.

220
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,800
That night,

221
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,440
the first time you took me to this restaurant for dinner,

222
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,400
I didn't understand anything.

223
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,200
I didn't even know how to read the menu.

224
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,400
But you didn't laugh at me.

225
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,040
That night,

226
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,720
we talked about martial arts and love.

227
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,560
But at that time,

228
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,600
I didn't care how fast the future technology was developing.

229
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,840
I just hope

230
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,400
I can stay by your side

231
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,920
for the future.

232
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,560
You're beautiful and cute.

233
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,200
You're gentle and kind.

234
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,120
You're the most beautiful girl in the world.

235
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,760
No word can describe your beauty.

236
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,160
I...

237
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,480
I know

238
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,280
we're not from the same world.

239
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,480
But I'm willing to work hard

240
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,080
to get as close as possible to your world with all my strength.

241
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,240
I'm willing to work hard to get as close as possible to your world with all my strength.

242
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,720
Nuannuan.

243
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,200
Will you give me a chance

244
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,920
to stand by your side?

245
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,280
Let's meet again.

246
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,200
I've heard a lot of things

247
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,200
But no one is as sincere and sincere as you

248
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:55,200
I almost fell in love with you

249
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Actually, I'm like you

250
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:07,200
We all like to chase something we can't get

251
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:12,200
I had to learn programming when I was in college

252
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,200
But I still don't understand it now

253
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200
I'm about to graduate

254
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,200
I'd better give up at the beginning

255
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,200
I should learn my national dance

256
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:29,200
Maybe I'm on the stage of National Theater now

257
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,200
But I can't help it

258
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,200
I just like it

259
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,200
I can't control myself

260
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:45,200
I have to fall in love with someone who doesn't like me

261
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,200
I'm so tired

262
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
You can understand, right?

263
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,200
I can't wait

264
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,200
Na Na

265
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,200
I don't want you to promise me now

266
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:15,200
I just hope I can stay with you now

267
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,200
No

268
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,200
I'd rather not go the further you go

269
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,200
I can wait

270
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,200
I can wait for you

271
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,200
What are you talking about?

272
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,440
If I tell you

273
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,000
I treat Li Xun

274
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,920
the same as you treat me

275
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,720
I won't give up either

276
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,760
Will you wait for me?

277
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,960
But Li Xun and Zhu Yun

278
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,680
have been together for three years

279
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,880
Yes

280
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,960
No

281
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,120
I hope I can be more free than you

282
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,560
Gao

283
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,720
Thank you

284
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,840
for everything I prepared tonight

285
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,800
This is the best gift I have received

286
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,000
I believe you

287
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,360
can find a girl who likes you

288
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,040
and looks up to you

289
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,220
Great

290
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,200
Yifan ,

291
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,640
don't write, Mr. Chen Xu .

292
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,640
no more praise .

293
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,960
Let's do it another day.

294
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,640
sure .

295
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,840
let's go,

296
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,920
it's been so many occasions .

297
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,700
Come in.

298
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,640
Are these the four of you

299
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,660
from zero-m repentance group that

300
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,980
I saw somewhere on the street?

Feel very well

306
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,240
It's really an activity.

307
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,080
Is it expensive?

308
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,080
It's okay.

309
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,360
But the boss has worked hard all night.

310
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,920
I have to take care of the business.

311
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,480
It's 51 yuan.

312
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,840
51 yuan?

313
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,120
It's so expensive.

314
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,640
It's a deal.

315
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,920
I wish you happiness.

316
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,040
Thank you.

317
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,240
Thank you, Shao Ke.

318
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,040
It's expensive.

319
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,040
It's a deal.

320
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,280
You should pay attention to

321
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,480
investment and output.

322
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,560
You know that

323
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,040
there is no investment and output.

324
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,560
Let me tell you.

325
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,280
The meaning of this flower is different.

326
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,080
You can't measure it with money.

327
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,080
This is the first time I received a rose.

328
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:11,840
Really?

329
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,680
You are so silly.

330
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,360
This is a musical instrument.

331
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,400
You can't do it.

332
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,600
I don't care.

333
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,400
I said it's a rose.

334
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,240
It's a rose.

335
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,920
Boring.

336
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,120
You are boring.

337
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,280
Who is the most boring?

338
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:37,800
You.

339
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,440
Li Xun.

340
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,640
Look.

341
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,960
The car in the middle of the road never stops.

342
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,400
I lean on your shoulder.

343
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,320
Happy New Year.

344
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,680
Happy New Year.

345
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,360
Get out of the noisy world.

346
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,480
Accompany me.

347
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,960
You are the point of my palm.

348
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,000
I stand up and bravely face the fire.

349
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,920
Like the flames of the night.

350
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,920
Happy New Year.

351
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,360
Happy New Year.

352
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,880
Because I believe I love you.

353
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,360
True love will take its course.

354
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,840
I'm by your side.

355
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,520
I spend the long time with you.

356
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,000
Because I believe I want you.

357
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,520
True love will take its course.

358
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,080
The fiery fire.

359
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:07,800
You are always on my side.

360
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,800
You are the point of my palm.

361
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:23,680
Because I believe I love you.

362
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:31,760
True love will take its course.

363
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:39,280
I spend the long time with you.

364
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,280
Li Xun, you're not alone now.

365
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,280
With me around,

366
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:50,280
you don't need to go against the world again.

367
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,280
Just like this flower.

368
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,280
I know.

369
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,280
I gave up on Baoyang.

370
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,280
I'm still the same.

371
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,280
Do whatever you want.

372
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,280
I'm your brother.

373
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:44,280
The Long Ballad

374
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,280
Brother, come out and help.

375
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,280
Coming.

376
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,280
Coming.

377
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,280
Coming.

378
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,280
It's been a long time.

379
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,280
Drink more today.

380
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,280
Okay.

381
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,280
Drink more today.

382
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,280
Drink more today.

383
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,280
Drink more today.

384
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,280
It's good.

385
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,280
It's good.

386
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,280
How is it?

387
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,280
It looks good.

388
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,280
How to fry it?

389
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,280
I want to faint.

390
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,280
It's all cooked.

391
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,280
It's all cooked this morning.

392
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,280
All hard dishes.

393
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,280
Brother Liu cooked all different flavors.

394
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,280
Very good.

395
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,280
Thank you, Mr. Han.

396
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,280
The boss of the mud legs.

397
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,280
But the mud legs have the good taste of mud legs.

398
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,280
You don't have to look at the color, right?

399
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,280
Two feet per day,

400
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,280
step on the mud.

401
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,280
You are very reliable.

402
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,280
Is the fish ready?

403
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,280
Right away.

404
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,280
Let's not wait for him.

405
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,280
Let's eat first.

406
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,280
Drink first.

407
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,280
Congratulations, Mr. Han.

408
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,280
Business is in a hurry.

409
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,280
I really didn't expect

410
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,280
Mr. Han is now one of us.

411
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,280
You are the first one who has been successful in your creation.

412
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,280
Come on.

413
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,280
Congratulations.

414
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,280
Congratulations.

415
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,280
Congratulations.

416
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,280
Congratulations.

417
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,280
Congratulations.

418
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,280
How is our chat?

419
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,280
We are making contracts these days.

420
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,280
Li Xun, I have to thank you for the website you gave me.

421
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,280
Since the website was online,

422
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,280
our fish is selling very well.

423
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,280
And many fish farms in our village

424
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,280
want to go to our website.

425
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,280
Congratulations.

426
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,280
Eat more.

427
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,280
When did you make the website?

428
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,280
How come I don't know?

429
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,280
There are many things you don't know.

430
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,280
Really?

431
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,280
Coming.

432
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,280
Teng Jiao fish with water.

433
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,280
You are here.

434
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,280
Tell me.

435
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,280
Why are you so hot?

436
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,280
How can you say?

437
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,280
Yes.

438
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,280
What?

439
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,280
It's yours.

440
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,280
It's yours.

441
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,280
Eat.

442
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,280
What do you want to eat?

443
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,280
I will help you.

444
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,280
That one.

445
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,280
You are wrong.

446
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,280
Take it.

447
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,280
No.

448
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,280
That one.

449
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,280
You are like a chicken farm.

450
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,280
You eat like a fire-breakers.

451
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,280
Maybe when we are graduated,

452
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,280
we can't afford so many people.

453
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,280
I heard you gave up on the health care.

454
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,280
You really want to bet?

455
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,280
You are tied to Li Xun for the rest of your life?

456
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,280
You said that.

457
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,280
Don't forget.

458
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,280
I am not only Li Xun's girlfriend,

459
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,280
but also the first in our class.

460
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,280
I choose to be with her not only because of love.

461
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,280
Okay.

462
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,280
To be honest,

463
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,280
she is very capable.

464
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,280
But she is easily easily misled.

465
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,280
She is a little bit of a talent.

466
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,280
It's okay to cooperate with us.

467
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,280
The bigger the team, the easier it is to have problems.

468
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,280
So you must be with her.

469
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,280
Li Xun can have no one,

470
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,280
but she can't have you.

471
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,280
I can't be without you.

472
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,280
Lao Gao.

473
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,280
Thank you.

474
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,280
So,

475
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,280
Boss Li,

476
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,280
Mrs. Zhu,

477
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,280
what are you going to do?

478
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,280
I haven't thought about it deeply.

479
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,280
But I have a rough idea.

480
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,280
I want to do medical treatment.

481
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,280
Many people are interested in Internet medical treatment.

482
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,280
They hope to connect the Internet and medical treatment together.

483
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,280
Time will not come out of the house.

484
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,280
They can see patients at home.

485
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,280
But I think this direction is wrong.

486
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,280
They want to serve patients too much.

487
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,280
But medical treatment is a typical communist-oriented market.

488
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,280
There is no one who is not lacking in this world.

489
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,280
What is lacking is the quality medical resources.

490
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,280
What are you going to do?

491
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,280
I want to be a doctor.

492
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,280
What are you going to do?

493
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,280
My mother died of cancer.

494
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,280
Her hospital was not good.

495
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,280
Doctors had very few resources.

496
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,280
Different doctors could give different results.

497
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,280
It took a few months to confirm.

498
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,280
She died not long after.

499
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,280
I want to be a doctor.

500
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,280
The main reason for looking at the patient list now

501
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,280
is not because there are few doctors.

502
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,280
But because there are few experienced doctors.

503
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,280
So I think

504
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,280
how to make the doctor's experience use the most

505
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,280
is what we should consider first.

506
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,280
In the medical institutions now,

507
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,280
more than 90% of the data is stored in the warehouse.

508
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,280
If we can scientifically integrate these wasted clinical data

509
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,280
and design a way

510
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,280
to give those experienced doctors

511
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,280
who are not so rich

512
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,280
help them judge the decision.

513
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,280
Where do we get these data?

514
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,280
Can we share them with the hospital?

515
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,280
But their data format should be different.

516
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,280
If we want to integrate these resources,

517
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,280
we can do it with numbers or other materials.

518
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,280
But Gao should be good at this.

519
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,280
Calm down.

520
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,280
It's just a thought.

521
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,280
Indeed.

522
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,280
It's just a starting point.

523
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,280
And the medical field is more of a public health field.

524
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,280
It's difficult to find a real profit point.

525
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,280
But I think it's a worthwhile thing.

526
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,280
Just listening to this direction

527
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,280
will make you want to continue.

528
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,280
I hope

529
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,280
the rate of cancer storage will be increased by 1%.

530
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,280
Boss Li, you're so talkative.

531
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,280
You're so good at this.

532
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,280
I'm just a little bit nervous.

533
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,280
I'm just a little bit nervous.

534
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,280
I'm just a little bit nervous.

535
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,280
You're so talkative.

536
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,280
Dad,

537
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,280
are you coming?

538
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,280
I'll let you decide.

539
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,280
I know

540
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,280
you're doing something very meaningful.

541
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,280
It's something I can't even imagine.

542
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,280
I'm not sure about you.

543
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,280
But I've decided to go abroad.

544
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,280
I'm applying for an offer.

545
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,280
That's good.

546
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,280
You're not curious

547
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,280
and don't want to ask me why?

548
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,280
Why?

549
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,280
The day before the original bomb,

550
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,280
I went to see Xulina.

551
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,280
She came.

552
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,280
She rejected me.

553
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,280
She said

554
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,280
she liked a man who she admired

555
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,280
and looked up to.

556
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,280
So

557
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,280
she likes you.

558
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,280
I know

559
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,280
it's easy to succeed

560
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,280
if I follow you.

561
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,280
It's much easier

562
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,280
than going abroad.

563
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,280
But if it continues like this,

564
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,280
Gao Jianhong

565
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,280
will never be able to

566
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,280
live his own name.

567
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,280
Gao,

568
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,280
I'm sorry.

569
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,280
I'm sorry.

570
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,280
I can't say anything nice.

571
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,280
I wish you success.

572
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,280
I hope you can walk your own path.

573
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,280
I mean it.

574
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,280
We, L&P,

575
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,280
will always keep

576
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,280
a partner for you.

577
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,280
We, L&P,

578
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,280
will always have you.

579
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,280
We'll always be a team.

580
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,280
Thank you.

581
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,280
Li Xun.

582
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,280
Don't drink.

583
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,280
Where's Li Xun?

584
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,280
Li Xun.

585
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,280
Drink less.

586
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,280
Where's Li Xun?

587
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,280
Li Xun.

588
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,280
You're here just in time.

589
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,280
Li Xun, listen to me.

590
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,280
Listen.

591
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,280
I have to say

592
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,280
what I said today.

593
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,280
Otherwise, I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

594
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,280
Li Xun,

595
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,280
I like you.

596
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,280
Okay, okay.

597
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,280
Give me the wine first.

598
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,280
I've liked you since I entered college.

599
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,280
But you scolded me

600
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,280
in front of the whole base.

601
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,280
You bastard.

602
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,280
I hate you.

603
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,280
You're a good idea.

604
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,280
You're sweet and cute.

605
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,280
But these bad guys

606
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,280
have a lot of bad temper.

607
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,280
Bad guys.

608
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,280
I'm not good at this.

609
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,280
What's wrong?

610
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,280
Don't sit here.

611
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,280
Monitor, are you okay?

612
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,280
I'm fine.

613
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,280
Here, here.

614
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,280
Here, drink some warm water.

615
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,280
Thank you.

616
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,280
I'm fine.

617
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,280
Monitor,

618
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,280
I've always

619
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,280
wanted to tell you something.

620
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,280
Say it.

621
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,280
I...

622
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,280
I...

623
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,280
I...

624
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,280
I know how to use the toilet.

625
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,280
What?

626
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,280
I know how to use the toilet.

627
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,280
You won't have a new life in the future.

628
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,280
I learned it for you.

629
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,280
What?

630
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,280
I like you.

631
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,280
I...

632
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,280
I know.

633
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,280
You know?

634
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,280
I'm not stupid.

635
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,280
You're pretty stupid.

636
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,280
It's been three years.

637
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,280
Can't you see it?

638
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,280
I don't like you.

639
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,280
I don't like you.

640
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,280
I don't like you.

641
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,280
I don't like you.

642
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,280
I don't like you.

643
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,280
I don't like you.

644
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,280
I don't like you.

645
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,280
I don't like you.

646
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,280
Don't think too much.

647
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,280
I don't dislike you.

648
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,280
I think I'm very selfish.

649
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,280
I only like myself.

650
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,280
Once I like someone,

651
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,280
I just

652
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,280
satisfy my fantasy about him.

653
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,280
Once he's not on my side at all,

654
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,280
I don't like him immediately.

655
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,280
It's not a love-hate relationship.

656
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,280
It's a heart-hunting relationship.

657
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,280
Meng.

658
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,280
We're not a good match.

659
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,280
But I'll invite you to play the sona if I have a chance.

660
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,280
Sona is good.

661
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,280
It's a traditional musical instrument.

662
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:33,280
No one can't play it without sona.

663
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,280
It's a marriage that can't be sent away.

664
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,280
I just want you to know

665
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,280
that someone likes you.

666
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,280
If this thing

667
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,280
becomes your heart

668
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,280
and becomes a little warmth

669
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,280
when you're not happy,

670
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,280
that's enough.

671
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,280
That's good.

672
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,280
Thank you for being so beautiful.

673
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,280
I also know

674
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,280
that this is the feeling of liking someone.

675
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,280
I'm sorry.

676
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,280
I'm sorry.

677
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,280
Do you think they

678
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,280
are not in love?

679
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,280
What?

680
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,280
My face is getting bigger.

681
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,280
You just had a crush on me.

682
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,280
You're so big.

683
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,280
Why didn't you ask someone to help you?

684
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,280
What if you get hot?

685
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,280
Shut up.

686
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,280
This is called a crush.

687
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,280
This is called a man-on-man crush.

688
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,280
How could it be?

689
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,280
Me and him?

690
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,280
I tell you, don't deny it.

691
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,280
This is called a love-hate relationship.

692
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,280
My god.

693
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,280
You have experience.

694
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,280
You have walked a lot of bridges

695
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,280
but I haven't walked a lot of roads.

696
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,280
You can come over to sit on the bridge.

697
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,280
You can walk or drive.

698
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,280
Shut up.

699
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,280
I'm sorry.

700
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,280
I don't want to quit

701
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,280
as long as I can be by your side

702
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,280
It doesn't matter

703
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:45,280
just my heart is broken

704
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,280
but it's still floating

705
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,280
I had a good drink today.

706
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,240
Okay.

707
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,720
I'm leaving.

708
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,480
Hurry up.

709
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,240
Bye.

710
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,240
Bye.

711
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,160
See you next time.

712
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:04,840
Bye.

713
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,280
I have a car.

714
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,080
Okay.

715
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,880
Don't drink if you drive.

716
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,600
Don't drive if you drink.

717
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,320
I'll call a taxi.

718
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,000
Call a taxi.

719
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,080
Bye.

720
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,720
Okay.

721
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,440
Bye.

722
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,040
Bye.

723
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:12,960
Be careful.

724
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,560
What are you doing?

725
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,000
Be careful.

726
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,640
Bye.

727
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,000
Bye.

728
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,040
Be careful.

729
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,400
Bye.

730
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,680
You went the wrong way.

731
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,720
We're leaving, too.

732
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,760
You two

733
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,280
get along well.

734
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,800
We're going home.

735
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,520
Brother Liu.

736
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,400
Brother Liu.

737
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,360
Brother Liu.

738
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,600
Bye.

739
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,880
Be careful.

740
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,560
You sing well.

741
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,400
Why do you still sing

742
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,000
in Beijing?

743
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,240
There are many new songs.

744
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,320
But

745
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,560
I like this song.

746
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,720
So fast.

747
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,240
It's been three years.

748
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,840
Nanhu University, I love you.

749
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,640
I hate you.

750
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,760
I love you and hate you.

751
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,720
Fang Shu Miao.

752
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,240
You're a bad drinker.

753
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,520
You'll vomit and make noise

754
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,760
after drinking.

755
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,840
You see me?

756
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,320
I'll vomit on you.

757
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,280
What do you think

758
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,480
we'll be like after three years?

759
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,720
After three years,

760
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,640
the enemy will be angry.

761
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,280
Then, all the big sisters

762
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,920
will be singing the song of the long-term.

763
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,720
I'll be the one who

764
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,040
holds the flag of the Manchurian.

765
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,480
Li Xunzhu.

766
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,280
You two

767
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,960
will be the best

768
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,160
in the company.

769
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,840
At least, you'll be a bad drinker

770
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,680
after three years.

771
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,960
Bad.

772
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,600
Honey, what about you?

773
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,840
I just graduated from the graduate school.

774
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,600
I'm nothing.

775
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,080
I wish you can enter Google

776
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,960
and compete with Li Xun.

777
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,360
You two are the same.

778
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,080
You're different.

779
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,240
I'll be the same.

780
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,920
None of them is Google.

781
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,640
Right.

782
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,880
As for Wu Mengxin,

783
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,040
I'll give you

784
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,600
a hot head

785
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,560
and a

786
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,560
hot head.

787
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,480
I'll listen to you.

788
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,800
Why didn't anyone ask me

789
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,560
what I want?

790
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,000
What do you want?

791
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I want to make a fortune.

792
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,320
Okay.

793
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:34,600
And then?

794
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,040
What's that?

795
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,040
I'll be the one who

796
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,920
can't see the end of the world.

797
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,240
I don't know you.

798
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,000
Okay?

799
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,960
Let's wait and see.

800
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,480
After I make money,

801
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,280
I'll give you

802
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,720
a big pack of water

803
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,640
for the listeners.

804
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,040
Okay.

805
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,600
I'll do it.

806
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,520
Dear friend,

807
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,640
we still have dreams.

808
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,320
I wish we can

809
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,800
work hard and achieve them.

810
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,800
Dreams will come true.

811
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,240
We'll all become

812
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,600
the people we want.

813
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,080
The people we want.

814
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,800
Come true.

815
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,600
Chen.

816
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,600
The small voice

817
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,280
reminds me of

818
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:14,120
my past.

819
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:18,240
In every corner of my life,

820
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:22,400
it's always been there for me.

821
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,480
I thought I would

822
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,720
always be by her side.

823
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,800
Today we've already left

824
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,440
in the vast sea of people.

825
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,600
They're all old.

826
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:47,240
Where are they?

827
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:51,320
We're just like this.

828
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:55,480
We're all different.

829
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,600
La la la la la la la la la

830
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,760
La la la like her.

831
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,920
La la la la la la la la la

832
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,000
Is she still driving?

833
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,160
La la la la la la la la

834
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,960
La la la la la la la la

835
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,200
The city is beautiful and the scenery is beautiful.

836
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,520
The young people are always proud.

837
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,120
In front of the tomb,

838
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,000
I look down

839
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,920
and see the world in the corner.

840
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,520
If we had gone back a little bit,

841
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,560
had been more patient,

842
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,560
and had been more gentle,

843
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,520
would everything have been different?

844
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,320
But there's no if.

845
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,120
In those young times,

846
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,080
we were just like this,

847
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,440
being arrogant.

848
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,640
We're just like this.

849
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:02,640
We're all different.

850
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,320
You've already known

851
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,520
about Li Xun and me, right?

852
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,400
When are you going to stop us?

853
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,880
Where are you going?

854
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,720
Don't you think

855
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,840
our parents are more important than her?

856
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,400
What if I say they're not?

857
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,000
Li Xun said he'd keep an eye on you.

858
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,280
He'll definitely keep an eye on you.

859
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,880
When Li Xun's sister leaves,

860
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:32,880
he has a thousand ways

861
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,680
to make you feel uncomfortable.

862
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:38,040
It's the intuition of dreams

863
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:42,880
that breaks the boundaries.

864
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,920
A night of rain,

865
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,840
a night full of night.

866
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:53,560
Then it won the world for me.

867
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:59,280
The car in the middle of the city doesn't stop.

868
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,720
I lean on your shoulder.

869
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:10,760
We won't be different.

870
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,720
Get out of the noisy world.

871
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,880
Accompany me.

872
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:20,360
I'm your new index.

873
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,360
Raise me up and bravely move forward.

874
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:30,360
Like the flames of the night.

875
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:38,160
Because I believe I love you.

876
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,560
True love will take its course.

877
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:47,760
I'm by your side.

878
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,360
I spend a long time with you.

879
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:55,960
Because I believe I want you.

880
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:00,360
True love will take its course.

881
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:04,760
The blazing fire.

882
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:13,760
You're always the one who keeps me going.

883
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,360
It's the intuition of dreams

884
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:36,160
that breaks the boundaries.

885
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,160
A night of rain,

886
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,960
a night full of night.

887
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,560
Then it won the world for me.

888
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:49,960
The car in the middle of the city doesn't stop.

889
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:54,360
I lean on your shoulder.

890
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,560
Be brave.

891
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,160
Every dream I have

892
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:06,760
will never lose to the world again.

893
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:11,360
Because I believe I love you.

894
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:15,760
True love will take its course.

895
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,960
I'm by your side.

896
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,560
I spend a long time with you.

897
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:29,160
Because I believe I want you.

898
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:33,560
True love will take its course.

899
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:37,960
The blazing fire.

900
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:48,760
You're always the one who keeps me going.

901
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:53,560
Because I believe I love you.

902
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:57,960
True love will take its course.

903
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:03,160
I'm by your side.

904
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:06,760
I spend a long time with you.

905
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:11,360
Because I believe I want you.

906
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:15,760
True love will take its course.

907
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,160
The blazing fire.

908
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:29,160
You're always the one who keeps me going.

909
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:33,560
Ha ha ha.

910
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:38,160
I'm by your side.

911
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:48,160
You're always the one who keeps me going.
