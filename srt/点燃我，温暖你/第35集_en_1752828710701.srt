2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if the light is very bright

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will still watch over that vast vast land

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless atmosphere

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day, the lens is a little bit yellow

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast night?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I burn up the night just for you to remember

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How everything was in the beginning

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The wind is like a wild grass

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It is like the wind is blowing

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The wind is like a wind

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You are still by my side

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Everything is the original look

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I have thought about the title

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The boss of LOP is competing with the female high-ranking executive

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Use the beauty to get the game code

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
How about this title?

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Shulina is the Internet celebrity of millions of fans

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You know

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
If you use her Douyin account to post this video

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
To tell me to cheat Zhu Yun

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What do you think Zhu Yun will do?

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What is the word called?

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The death of society

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You go tell Li Xun

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Let her think about it

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I, Gao Jianhong, am about to die

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't care about the scandal at all

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But what about Zhu Yun?

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Does she want to let Zhu Yun's reputation be swept away?

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I am not afraid to be exposed again

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
How many times have I been beaten by Dongzi?

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But she doesn't believe it

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I always want to conquer my fate

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I always thought it was what I wanted to pursue

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
No

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I don't want to be a traitor

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I don't want to be a traitor

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I don't want to be a traitor

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
No

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What do you want?

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Hello, Miao Miao

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Zhu Yun, Li Xun decided to withdraw

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
When?

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Just now

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So suddenly

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The conditions are good

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Zhu Yun, you have to hold on

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I will send you a video

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Come in

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
President Gao

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The chief of the propaganda department, the PR department and the marketing department

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
All resigned

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The same thing is about resignation

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Isn't it just to hit my face?

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's okay

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Follow them

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Dongliang

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The development department must be in charge

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Several B&Bs can't be lost

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I am sorry

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I am sorry

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I am sorry

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You have to go too

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
President Gao

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I have been following you since I graduated

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I used to hear about the small companies that plagiarized and suppressed

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I told myself

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
This is the world

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
There is nothing wrong with being weak and strong

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But now I think

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You are too extreme

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It sounds good

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What do you think now?

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Isn't it just the company was sued?

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You are afraid and want to run away

85
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
If it's really so moral

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Why don't you leave when the company makes money?

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Isn't it just that the company can't get on?

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Is it inescapable?

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Now

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Each one of you finds it

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Go

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
All go

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Everyone goes

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I don't need you

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Li Xun can go up the mountain with a single gun

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I can also be Gao Jianhong

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I have to fight him

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Let me go

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,700
This Prudence Madam

100
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,960
Lu сист b

101
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,560
Whats wrong with you?

102
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,560
I still don't understand

103
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,340
What actually happened?

104
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,000
My sister is sick

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Something wrong with her?

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
들어오ot

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,060
A beauty with

108
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,060
What do you want to drink?

109
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,060
No need.

110
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,060
Then coffee.

111
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,060
Just say it.

112
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,060
You can't beat me.

113
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,060
You want to persuade us to give up?

114
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,060
No.

115
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,060
It's a collaboration.

116
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,060
The person you should persuade is Gao Jianhong.

117
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,060
Not us.

118
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,060
Let's go.

119
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,060
Sorry.

120
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,060
I have new clothes.

121
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,060
Do you want to wear mine?

122
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,060
No.

123
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,060
How can you go out like this?

124
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,060
You can wear mine and pay me back another day.

125
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,060
No.

126
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,060
Okay.

127
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,060
Bye.

128
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,060
Bye.

129
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,060
Bye.

130
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,060
Bye.

131
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,060
Who can prove that this video is real?

132
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,060
Do you think I will make such a low-level mistake?

133
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,060
You can prove

134
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,060
that this video has no signs of being edited at all.

135
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,640
Okay

136
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,660
Gao Jianhong

137
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,220
you're so despicable

138
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,180
What I learned from Li Xun

139
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,180
I'm afraid he has a backer.

140
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,180
Zhou Yue, after so many years,

141
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,180
you can see if Li Xun can't let himself or you go.

142
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,180
I, Gao Jianhong, want to see

143
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,180
if he really cares about someone.

144
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,180
To fight this battle,

145
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,180
you've left so many people behind.

146
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,180
I, Xilin, and yourself.

147
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,180
Is it worth it?

148
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,180
It's worth it.

149
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,180
Before I die,

150
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,180
I must defeat him once.

151
00:09:42,380 --> 00:10:06,980
Only you can force him to

152
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,180
get back at him.

153
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,100
I still look at the sky

154
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,100
Everything is different

155
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,620
The one I used to be

156
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,620
I'm not afraid of anyone

157
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,940
I don't think anyone can save anyone

158
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,140
Until you break into my world

159
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,420
Even if the world is broken into a dark

160
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:39,060
We are in the dark

161
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,940
Even if the world is broken into a dark

162
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,940
The one I used to be

163
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,940
I see the direction of the endless atmosphere

164
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,940
Every day there is a flash of light

165
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,940
Even if I'm the light

166
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,940
I'm fine

167
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,940
I can't break through, I'm just for you

168
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:12,900
This is the original appearance

169
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,320
AWP owner

170
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,780
Permeating affairs with rival company

171
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,780
High-ranking cashier

172
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,400
Not foreign

173
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,560
Oh my God

174
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,400
Are you all right?

175
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
OK.

176
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:41,880
OK, OK.

177
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,920
Come, come.

178
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,280
Here, check it out.

179
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,160
Now, can you see this?

180
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,640
What?

181
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,720
Isn't it?

182
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,840
and sent it to the police station.

183
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:08,840
Look.

184
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,000
The photo was taken.

185
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,480
It's so clear.

186
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,680
I didn't know that.

187
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,080
Qin Wenwen

188
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,880
was right before he was admitted.

189
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,280
They had a grudge.

190
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,880
Li Xun hit him.

191
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,280
Here. Here. Here.

192
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,720
They were bloodthirsty.

193
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,480
All three of them are my schoolmates.

194
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,960
The girl was with the man on the right.

195
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,200
The man on the right

196
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,360
hit someone's eye and got into the prison.

197
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,760
The girl was with L.P. Logan.

198
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,960
Li Wenwen.

199
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,560
Look at Weibo.

200
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,440
Li Wenwen

201
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:27,920
Li Xun.

202
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,320
Are you drunk?

203
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,040
Xia Zhuo

204
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,360
You're mixed.

205
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,680
What kind of blind love?

206
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,560
You just sacrificeр Kurong

207
00:13:47,360 --> 00:14:03,640
L ->

208
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,360
I don't care about the things you want to ask me.

209
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,360
Even if the whole world misunderstands me, I'm not afraid.

210
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,360
I'm willing.

211
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,360
I'm not willing.

212
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,360
I don't want to torture you for so long.

213
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,360
You can't bow down.

214
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,360
I won't allow it.

215
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,360
I won't allow it.

216
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,360
I won't allow it.

217
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,360
Why did you torture me for nothing?

218
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,360
I won you back.

219
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,360
It's not a loss.

220
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,360
What did you say?

221
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,360
It's been so long ago.

222
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,360
I've been gone so long.

223
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
You're awake.

224
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,360
There are things that can't be said after drinking.

225
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:01,360
There are things that can't be done after drinking.

226
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,360
Are you awake now?

227
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
I'm awake.

228
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,360
It's over now.

229
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,360
I'm awake.

230
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,360
Here.

231
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,360
I'm awake.

232
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,360
Is this a good thing?

233
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,360
It's good to be back.

234
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,360
It's good to be back.

235
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,360
But Li Xun is not a person who is so annoying.

236
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,360
That process is too unimportant.

237
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,360
Does what he said last night count?

238
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,360
Zhu Yu, don't think about those things about love.

239
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,360
You're just ordinary colleagues.

240
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,360
You can do it.

241
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,360
You're awake.

242
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,360
I'm awake.

243
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,360
After drinking the day before yesterday,

244
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,760
I finally understand whyrou記得嘴 backwards

245
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,960
by touching several times already.

246
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,360
What about your heartclean?

247
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,360
It's okay now.

248
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,360
It's okay.

249
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:56,360
I was just trying to find a way to take the initiative to find my own way.

250
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,360
I don't have that much energy now.

251
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,360
And we've known each other for a long time.

252
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,360
I just asked.

253
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,360
I used to do whatever I wanted.

254
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,360
From now on,

255
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,360
are you willing to be with me again?

256
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,360
I know it's not a good time to ask you now.

257
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,360
But if you ask me...

258
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,360
Yes.

259
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,360
Yes.

260
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,360
Li Yuchun, I want to be with you.

261
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,360
Let's make up.

262
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,360
Who?

263
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,360
Princess, can you be more reserved?

264
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,360
So this is what it feels like to be rejected.

265
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,360
It's so simple.

266
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,360
But I won't lose to you if I can win you back.

267
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,360
Did you think that your colleague's image of Ivan Fenton was particularly good?

268
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,360
Not bad.

269
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,360
Actually, I was already scared. You know that.

270
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,360
Really?

271
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,360
You don't have to be afraid.

272
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,360
I'm not afraid.

273
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,360
You're not going to be afraid that I can't even be your colleague if I reject you.

274
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,360
Right?

275
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,360
Actually, you don't have to be afraid.

276
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,360
You asked.

277
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
You said it.

278
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,360
I'll just say yes.

279
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,860
Yes.

280
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,360
Hello, Lawyer Fang.

281
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,520
I'm the

282
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,360
Last time we met we were in a hurry

283
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,440
There was a lot of detail not yet finished

284
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,940
So we want to talk to Mr. такую

285
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,940
Mr. Fang, what time do you think is convenient?

286
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:46,940
You talked very clearly last time, right? Mr. Li doesn't agree to a peace agreement.

287
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,640
Mr. Fang, it's like this.

288
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,940
We are willing to give out 50 million.

289
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,940
There are quite a few cases that Mr. Fang is handling.

290
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,940
If you want to know, you can't find this price anywhere.

291
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,940
Okay, I'll ask him.

292
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,940
You can meet him, but Mr. Li wants to talk to Director Gao alone.

293
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,940
Let's go.

294
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,940
Director Gao

295
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,940
Do you agree to a peace agreement?

296
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:03,940
If you agree, let's discuss a compensation amount.

297
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,940
I have to say,

298
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,940
It's the weak time of the LOP.

299
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:13,940
Can you add some more money?

300
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,940
Once the review period is over,

301
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,940
no matter what the result is,

302
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,940
I won't be able to reconcile with you.

303
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:28,940
If you really end up being in the dark,

304
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,940
you won't get any benefits.

305
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,940
I'm not the only one who's worried about you.

306
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,940
You can take it.

307
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,940
I'll take it.

308
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,940
I'll take it.

309
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,940
I'll take it.

310
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,940
I'll take it.

311
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,940
I'll take it.

312
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,940
I'll take it.

313
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,940
I'll take it.

314
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,940
I'll take it.

315
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,940
I'm asking if you agree.

316
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,940
Do you remember when we met last time?

317
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,940
Did you make a good decision?

318
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,940
Did you make a good decision?

319
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,940
You can take me as your windfall.

320
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,940
But people who climb mountains

321
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,940
can't forget how high the mountain is.

322
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,940
Since the day we met,

323
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,940
you've never won me.

324
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,940
You've never won me.

325
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,940
You've never won me.

326
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:40,940
No matter if it's the exam or the project,

327
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,940
the software or the game,

328
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,940
you've never won me.

329
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,940
You couldn't have won me before.

330
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,940
You couldn't have won me in the future.

331
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,940
I gave you a chance to make a choice.

332
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,940
But you still want to go against me.

333
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,940
You can make up with me.

334
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,940
Tell me now.

335
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,940
Do you regret it?

336
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,940
I'm asking if you regret it.

337
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,940
No!

338
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,940
No!

339
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,940
Fine.

340
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,940
You said you didn't regret it. I still look up to you.

341
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,940
Remember what you said to me?

342
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:45,940
I can't climb mountains by myself.

343
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,940
Remember it now.

344
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,940
I'm not climbing mountains alone.

345
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,940
I'm with you now.

346
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,940
I don't want to live alone.

347
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,940
I don't want to live alone.

348
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,940
I have to go.

349
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,940
I have to go.

350
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,940
I don't want to live alone.

351
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,940
I don't want to live alone.

352
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,940
Help!

353
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,940
Help!

354
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,940
Anyone there?

355
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,940
What should we do?

356
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,940
President Gao!

357
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,940
President Gao!

358
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,940
President Gao, are you okay?

359
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,940
President Gao!

360
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,940
Call an ambulance!

361
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,940
President Gao, are you okay?

362
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,940
President Gao!

363
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,940
What's going on?

364
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:57,940
Don't be so anxious.

365
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,940
Go back to work.

366
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,940
Hongning said you weren't home.

367
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,940
I guessed you were here.

368
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,940
Why doesn't she regret it?

369
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,940
Let me ask you.

370
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,940
Why doesn't she regret it?

371
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,940
She hates me so much.

372
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,940
She wants to win me even if she dies.

373
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,940
She's so stupid.

374
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,940
How could she win?

375
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,940
She knew it.

376
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,940
She knew it all.

377
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,940
She knew my strength better than anyone.

378
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,940
Why did she force herself to this?

379
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,940
It's not your fault.

380
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,940
Isn't it?

381
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:01,940
I suddenly feel that I can understand Gao.

382
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,940
Maybe she had a life-or-death cycle like me.

383
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:13,940
We three were forced to go our separate ways.

384
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,940
You were isolated by a barbed wire fence.

385
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,940
We two were out there.

386
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,940
One chose to escape.

387
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,940
The other chose to go all the way to the dark.

388
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,940
What do you mean?

389
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,940
Tell me what you want to say.

390
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,940
Don't let me guess like before.

391
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,940
I don't want to guess now.

392
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,940
I don't want to guess.

393
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,940
Do you also stand by her side?

394
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,940
I don't want to guess.

395
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,940
I don't want to guess.

396
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,940
I don't want to guess.

397
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,940
I don't want to guess.

398
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,940
I don't want to guess.

399
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,940
I don't want to guess.

400
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,940
I don't want to guess.

401
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,940
I don't want to guess.

402
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,940
I don't want to guess.

403
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,940
I don't want to guess.

404
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,940
I don't want to guess.

405
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,940
I don't want to guess.

406
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,940
I don't want to guess.

407
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,940
I don't want to guess.

408
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,940
I don't want to guess.

409
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,940
I don't want to guess.

410
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,940
I don't want to guess.

411
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,940
I don't want to guess.

412
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,940
I don't want to guess.

413
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,940
I don't want to guess.

414
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,940
I don't want to guess.

415
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,940
I don't want to guess.

416
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,940
I don't want to guess.

417
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,940
I don't want to guess.

418
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,940
I don't want to guess.

419
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:08,940
I don't want to guess.

420
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,940
I don't want to guess.

421
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,940
I don't want to guess.

422
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,940
I don't want to guess.

423
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,940
I don't want to guess.

424
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:18,940
I don't want to guess.

425
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,940
I don't want to guess.

426
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,940
I don't want to guess.

427
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,940
I don't want to guess.

428
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,940
I don't want to guess.

429
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,940
I don't want to guess.

430
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,940
I don't want to guess.

431
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,940
I don't want to guess.

432
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,940
I don't want to guess.

433
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,940
I don't want to guess.

434
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,940
I don't want to guess.

435
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,940
I don't want to guess.

436
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,940
I don't want to guess.

437
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,940
I don't want to guess.

438
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,700
If you knew,

439
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,620
can you bring it back to us?

440
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,100
Try something first.

441
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,940
Have some porridge.

442
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,620
Next is porridge with preserved egg.

443
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,060
I made it.

444
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,000
Try it.

445
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:11,900
You…

446
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,700
Hurry up

447
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,980
I Am off pause

448
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,940
Stay home and do your operation

449
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,980
No need

450
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,900
I need someone to sign

451
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,140
Na Na

452
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,140
You have your own life and your own life.

453
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,140
Who said I pity you?

454
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:54,140
There's a saying when we got married.

455
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,140
Whether you're poor or rich,

456
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,140
whether you're sick or healthy,

457
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,140
I said I was willing.

458
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:11,140
I just don't want to go against my own promise.

459
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,140
I'm not going to marry you.

460
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,140
We're divorced.

461
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,140
Not yet.

462
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,140
I'm sorry.

463
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,140
The operation will be at 10 a.m. tomorrow.

464
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,140
These are the things to keep in mind.

465
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,140
Dr. Gao.

466
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,140
Is the success rate of this operation

467
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,140
high?

468
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,140
Mrs. Gao.

469
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,140
Mr. Gao has been dragging on

470
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,140
without surgery.

471
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,140
His condition deteriorated very quickly.

472
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,140
You have to be well prepared.

473
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,140
I'm sorry.

474
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:59,140
When you used to lead us to do things,

475
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:03,140
you always looked at the widest and most accurate way.

476
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:06,140
But now you only look at Gao Jianhong.

477
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,140
He doesn't deserve you.

478
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,140
Don't you want to knock him down?

479
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,140
I used to think that knocking him down was the most important thing.

480
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:20,140
But now I think your future and development are more important.

481
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,140
After I saw you get off work that day,

482
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,140
I was doing Oculus' VR report.

483
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:30,140
I saw you studying new search algorithm.

484
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:33,140
But you didn't go on.

485
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:36,140
Because you were so determined to do it.

486
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,140
Because you only wanted to deal with Gao Jianhong.

487
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,140
You didn't have time.

488
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,140
I hate Fang Zhijing.

489
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,140
I hate Gao Jianhong even more.

490
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,140
I hate them for taking the LP.

491
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:57,140
I hate them for betraying us.

492
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,140
I hate him to death.

493
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:04,140
But I'm more afraid that you're stuck in a place.

494
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,140
I'm afraid that you're stuck in a place.

495
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,140
I'm afraid that you're stuck in a place.

496
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,140
I'm afraid that you're stuck in a place.

497
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:18,140
I'm afraid that you're stuck in a place.

498
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:21,140
I'm afraid that you're stuck in a place.

499
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:24,140
I'm afraid that you're stuck in a place.

500
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:27,140
I'm afraid that you're stuck in a place.

501
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:30,140
I'm afraid that you're stuck in a place.

502
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,140
I'm afraid that you're stuck in a place.

503
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:36,140
I'm afraid that you're stuck in a place.

504
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:39,140
I'm afraid that you're stuck in a place.

505
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:42,140
I'm afraid that you're stuck in a place.

506
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:45,140
I'm afraid that you're stuck in a place.

507
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:48,140
I'm afraid that you're stuck in a place.

508
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:51,140
I'm afraid that you're stuck in a place.

509
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:54,140
I'm afraid that you're stuck in a place.

510
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:57,140
I'm afraid that you're stuck in a place.

511
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:00,140
I'm afraid that you're stuck in a place.

512
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:03,140
I'm afraid that...

513
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:06,140
I'm afraid that...

514
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:09,140
the pressure inside of me...

515
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:13,140
has made it harder for me to move forward.

516
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:17,140
Never.

517
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:21,120
Good night, fight until you die, and keep floatin'.

518
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,140
Ms.pei.

519
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,140
breviate for card for three tickets.

520
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,980
We should give up our relationships and live our life together in one another.

521
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:37,260
That way we can make the best work possible.

522
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,180
Ji Vaizing.

523
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,700
Are we good?

524
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,300
I think so.

525
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,860
What should we do?

526
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,140
Bobbito

527
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,640
I wish you a happy wedding

528
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,080
Nana

529
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,340
If I successfully do the surgery

530
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,840
Let's make up a honeymoon together

531
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:00,140
How about we just sell the house

532
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,140
and go abroad to study together?

533
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:06,140
We can apply for the Imperial University of Engineering together

534
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,140
and get the degree together.

535
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:14,140
Just like what you planned when you graduated from college.

536
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:20,140
Isn't GIC always your dream?

537
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,140
I've forgotten.

538
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:34,140
So this is my dream.

539
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,140
Li Xun,

540
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,140
Selena was right.

541
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:51,140
It's not worth to give up for so long.

542
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:55,140
The world is small and the circle is small.

543
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,140
We'll see.

544
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,140
Zhu Yan,

545
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:15,140
why did we become like this?

546
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:30,140
Do you remember what Li Xun said?

547
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,140
Everything

548
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:40,140
is just like what it was in the beginning.

549
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:45,140
The more you go, the more you'll be separated.

550
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,140
I'm sorry.

551
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:22,140
The patient Gao Jianhong is the surgeon of the two-part surgery, right?

552
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,140
Yes.

553
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:26,140
Is there any water in the room before the surgery?

554
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,140
Yes.

555
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,140
No food or water.

556
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,140
Okay.

557
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,140
Wait a moment.

558
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,140
We'll bring you later.

559
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,140
Okay, thank you.

560
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,140
Nana,

561
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,140
I want to see someone.

562
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,140
Zhu Yun,

563
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,140
how is Gao?

564
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,140
He said he wanted to see Li Xun.

565
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,140
Otherwise, he wouldn't have the surgery.

566
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,140
Please help me persuade him.

567
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,140
He still doesn't want to see me.

568
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,140
Don't think too much.

569
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,140
Just do the surgery.

570
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,140
We'll talk about the other things after he's recovered.

571
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:38,140
Even if I die,

572
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:41,140
he still doesn't want to see me.

573
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,140
Right?

574
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:56,140
I don't want to see him.

575
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,140
I don't want to see him.

576
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:22,140
We shouldn't have been like this.

577
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,020
Today you say I have no power

578
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,180
I don't agree with you guys

579
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,140
I don't want to be your friend

580
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,140
I don't want to be your friend

581
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,140
I don't want to be your friend

582
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:31,140
I don't want to be your friend

583
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,140
I don't want to be your friend

584
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:35,140
I don't want to be your friend

585
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,140
I don't want to be your friend

586
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,140
I don't want to be your friend

587
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,140
I don't want to be your friend

588
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,140
I don't want to be your friend

589
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,140
I don't want to be your friend

590
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:47,140
I don't want to be your friend

591
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:49,140
I don't want to be your friend

592
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,140
I don't want to be your friend

593
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:53,140
Like these clouds

594
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:57,140
That burning fire

595
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,140
It's always you

596
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:05,140
The two of us

597
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:07,140
vraiment

598
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:23,840
It's just my feeling of the dream

599
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:28,700
Luring myself into a Tuesday night

600
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,880
Exchanging the leaves of truffles

601
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,100
Chen Le's Mostarina

602
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:32,340
אתה

603
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:32,980
Chen Lei

604
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:33,340
Hush

605
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:40,340
I will never, never, never lose to the world again.

606
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:47,340
Because I believe I love you.

607
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:52,340
I believe I love you.

608
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:57,340
I believe I love you.

609
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:04,340
Because I believe I love you.

610
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:09,340
True love will take its course.

611
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:14,340
When I'm by your side,

612
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:18,340
I'll spend the long time with you.

613
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:22,340
Because I believe I want you.

614
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:26,340
True love will take its course.

615
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:31,340
The fire of love is always burning.

616
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:41,340
You always protect me.

617
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:46,340
Because I believe I love you.

618
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:51,340
True love will take its course.

619
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:56,340
When I'm by your side,

620
00:47:56,340 --> 00:48:00,340
I'll spend the long time with you.

621
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:04,340
Because I believe I want you.

622
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:09,340
True love will take its course.

623
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:13,340
The fire of love is always burning.

624
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:22,340
You always protect me.

625
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:26,340
Oh, my dear.

626
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:31,340
The fire of love is always burning.

627
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:42,340
You always protect me.
