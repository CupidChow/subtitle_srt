1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Everything is different

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,400
The me I used to be

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,400
I'm not wrong

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,600
I don't believe anyone can save anyone

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,800
Until you break into my world

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,200
Even if this world breaks into darkness

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,000
We will fight in the darkness

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Even if the light is bright

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I will still be there to protect you

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I see the direction of my heart

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Every year, I feel anxious at the end

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Even if I'm the light

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
How can I be the only one who can light up the night?

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm burning up just for you

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is how everything looks like

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
If I'm the light

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The wind and the moon are all hidden

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm burning up just for you

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You're still by my side

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Everything is how it looks like

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This is the biggest bounce of the summer

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hey, hey, hey

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
If you're coming then come down, play, play

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
If you feel too shy then watch for me

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Watch, watch for me

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Move it, move it, move it

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Again, move it, move it

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This is the biggest bounce of the summer

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This is the biggest bounce of the summer

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
If you have something to say then say it

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You don't have to be that sly

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
If you always think about it

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It is just anあぁ

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Let's wait for her to Integration

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Lair

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Iowa

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Come

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Come

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Weens

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
��

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Graczy

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You too

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Going to think about it

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
it's alright

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,800
He will keep saying that.

46
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,300
You don't have toù feel like эту?

47
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,900
Don't you worry.

48
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,300
I have too much stuff to do.

49
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,800
I don't have time to waste on him.

50
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,320
If you knew that, I wouldn't have picked volleyball lessons for you.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I know.

52
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,800
You want me to move around.

53
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,800
Your back is like embroidered.

54
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,200
It can't be opened.

55
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,200
You're knocking on the code everyday.

56
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,000
I just want to find a chance to make you move around more.

57
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,400
You're determined to do it?

58
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
I'm not.

59
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
I'm not.

60
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
I'm not.

61
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
I'm not.

62
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
I'm not.

63
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,200
But I got it.

64
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,000
Slowly, I'm on the long road.

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,600
Slowly, I'm on the forest road.

66
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,200
I'm lonely without you.

67
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,600
I see your white shirt.

68
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,400
Slowly, I'm warm and I like you.

69
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,000
Oh, every minute and every second.

70
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,000
The secrets I've hidden.

71
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,400
I want to be with you.

72
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,400
The autumn in the fairy tale.

73
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,400
The time we met.

74
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00,400
Let me feel your wish.

75
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,400
The time we spent together.

76
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,400
I'm not afraid of the world.

77
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,400
With you by my side.

78
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,400
Say good night to me.

79
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,400
The stars never change.

80
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,400
The autumn in the fairy tale.

81
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,400
The time we spent together.

82
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Let me feel your wish.

83
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,400
The time we spent together.

84
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,400
Let me feel your wish.

85
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,400
The time we spent together.

86
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,400
The time we spent together.

87
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Here.

88
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
Two.

89
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,400
Three.

90
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,400
Four.

91
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
Five.

92
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,400
Thirteen.

93
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Fifteen.

94
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,400
Seven.

95
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Eight.

96
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Chen Junzhi.

97
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
Almost done.

98
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,400
I can give him two hundred points.

99
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,400
Coach.

100
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
Thank you, coach.

101
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,400
Next.

102
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,400
Happy?

103
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,400
Not bad.

104
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,400
He's just a little better than you.

105
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,400
That's all.

106
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
Next.

107
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
Li Xun.

108
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Come on.

109
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,400
One.

110
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,400
Two.

111
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
Three.

112
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,400
Four.

113
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
Five.

114
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
Six.

115
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,400
Seven.

116
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,400
Eight.

117
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,400
Nine.

118
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
Ten.

119
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,400
Eleven.

120
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,400
Twelve.

121
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,400
Twelve.

122
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,400
Come on, Yang.

123
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
No need.

124
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
Eight points.

125
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Good.

126
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
This time is yours.

127
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
Give it to me.

128
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,400
Strong.

129
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,400
Thanks.

130
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,400
What's wrong with you?

131
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,400
Li Xun.

132
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
What's wrong with you?

133
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,800
Li Xun.

134
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,400
What's wrong with you?

135
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,400
Li Xun.

136
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
Li Xun.

137
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
This is an old problem.

138
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,400
It was not treated when it was 1 degree or 2 degree.

139
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
So it's getting worse now.

140
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
If we don't take care of it,

141
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
we can't even walk.

142
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
I'm sorry.

143
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,400
I'm sorry.

144
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
I'm sorry.

145
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
I'm sorry.

146
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,400
We can't even walk.

147
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Tomorrow morning,

148
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
at 9 o'clock,

149
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
you should go to see Director Wang.

150
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
Show him this video.

151
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,400
See if he needs surgery.

152
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,400
It's so serious.

153
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,400
If we have surgery now,

154
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,400
it will take half a year.

155
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,400
Let's talk for a while.

156
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
We'll talk while waiting.

157
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
If it works,

158
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
we don't need to get this surgery.

159
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
Okay.

160
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,400
I'll go to do this first.

161
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
Okay.

162
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,400
Doctor, do you know where my brother is?

163
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
What's your brother's name?

164
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,400
Li Xun.

165
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
Li Xun.

166
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
Don't you know him?

167
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,400
Who is his family member?

168
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,400
I'm his classmate.

169
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
You are?

170
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
I'm his sister.

171
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,400
Well,

172
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,400
sister,

173
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Li Xun is still in the emergency observation room.

174
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Let me take you there.

175
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
Okay.

176
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
Thank you, doctor.

177
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,400
It's okay.

178
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,400
I'll go.

179
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,400
Li Xun has a sister.

180
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
I never heard her mention her.

181
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,400
Don't worry.

182
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,400
She's fine now.

183
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Thank you, classmate.

184
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
I live in the suburbs.

185
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,400
I got a call from the teacher

186
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,400
and rushed here.

187
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
But it's far away.

188
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
Luckily, you took care of her.

189
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,400
It's okay.

190
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
She fainted in the PE class.

191
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
I was just beside her.

192
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,400
Don't worry.

193
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
The doctor just gave her a pain medicine.

194
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,400
She'll wake up soon.

195
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,400
Have you eaten?

196
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,400
How about we go downstairs to buy some?

197
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
Okay.

198
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
I'll go.

199
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
Okay.

200
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
I'll go.

201
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
I'll go.

202
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
I'll go.

203
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
I'll go.

204
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
I'll go.

205
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
Happy people don't stop.

206
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,400
The snack is delicious.

207
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,400
The snack is Wang Xiaoluhu's fur-wrap.

208
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
Thank you, classmate.

209
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,400
You're welcome.

210
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,400
Classmate,

211
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,400
I'm so sorry.

212
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,400
Let me give it to you.

213
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,400
No, no.

214
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,400
I'll do it.

215
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,400
I don't know what you like to eat.

216
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,400
Did you come here from Lin Yang?

217
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,400
I'm married.

218
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,400
My family is poor.

219
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,400
My mom is ill.

220
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,400
I just want to work.

221
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
I didn't make much money.

222
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,400
My brother wanted to make money to support his family.

223
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,400
I think he must be tired of taking this medicine.

224
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,400
The doctor said Li Qun's spine was injured.

225
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,400
What's going on?

226
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,400
What's going on?

227
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
It's my fault.

228
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
It's all my fault.

229
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,400
I'm still young.

230
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
What should I do?

231
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,400
Don't worry, sister.

232
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,400
We'll force him to do the surgery this time.

233
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,400
It's useless.

234
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,400
He won't listen to us.

235
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,400
He never listens to us.

236
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,400
He's lying in the hospital now.

237
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,400
It's the flesh on the board.

238
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
How can he talk?

239
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,400
You are a family.

240
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
You have the right to sign.

241
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,400
It's really hard to think.

242
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,400
We can give him a anesthetic.

243
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Push him to the operating room.

244
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
See how he shouts.

245
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,400
The doctor said he would take his CD to the department store tomorrow.

246
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,400
I'll come to you tomorrow morning.

247
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,400
Let's go together.

248
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,400
Okay.

249
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,400
What's your name?

250
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,400
My name is Zhu Yun.

251
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,400
Thank you, Zhu Yun.

252
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,400
Thank you so much.

253
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,400
It's okay.

254
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
Sister, eat more.

255
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,400
I think Li Xun will wake up soon.

256
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,400
I can go to see him.

257
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,400
If he wakes up,

258
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,400
I won't go up.

259
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,400
I'll go first.

260
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,400
Li Xun, please take care of me.

261
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
Thank you.

262
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,400
You are here.

263
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,400
You are missing.

264
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,400
Is there anything difficult?

265
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
He doesn't want to see us.

266
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,400
He doesn't want to see us.

267
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,400
It's also necessary.

268
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,400
Why?

269
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,400
You really want to know about Li Xun's past?

270
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,400
When he was in high school,

271
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,400
my mother was ill.

272
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,400
To cure my mother,

273
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,400
Li Xun started to make money.

274
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,400
You don't believe it?

275
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
Of course I don't believe it.

276
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,400
Do you think I have a vegetarian in my general?

277
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
How much is this?

278
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,400
This set of magic makeup

279
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
must be more than ten thousand.

280
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,400
It's like you.

281
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,400
We are one percent.

282
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,400
One thousand dollars.

283
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,400
I don't believe it.

284
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
If you can put my number in front of me,

285
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,400
from now on, you are my father.

286
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,400
You are not a loser.

287
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,400
Look here.

288
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,400
Is it Li Hao?

289
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
Yes.

290
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,400
How did you know?

291
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,400
I was the one who sold you the equipment on QQ.

292
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,400
What's this?

293
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,400
I haven't heard of the strange website.

294
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,400
Don't mess with me.

295
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
The website just now is a wooden horse virus.

296
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,400
I'll write it down right away when you input it.

297
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,400
Be careful later.

298
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,400
Can you help me

299
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,400
get the equipment here?

300
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,400
No.

301
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
I'll give you money.

302
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,400
Three thousand, five thousand.

303
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,400
You count it.

304
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
One thousand is one thousand.

305
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
You count it.

306
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
I'm a man of my word.

307
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,400
I have such a good technique.

308
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
You even helped me.

309
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,400
You're here.

310
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
I'm here.

311
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,400
How is mom?

312
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,400
The doctor just got a horse fever.

313
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,400
She fell asleep.

314
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
She used to get it once a day.

315
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,400
Now,

316
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,400
she gets it once a day.

317
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
This money...

318
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,400
Don't worry.

319
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,400
It's a labor mistake.

320
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,400
I'm sorry.

321
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,400
I'm sorry.

322
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,400
Can you stop dancing?

323
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
Who are you?

324
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Let me dance the last dance.

325
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,400
After this,

326
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,400
I can't dance anymore.

327
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,400
You have a terminal disease?

328
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
I can't pass the exam this time.

329
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,400
My dad won't let me dance again.

330
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,400
It's not good if you don't dance.

331
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,400
You're like a stick.

332
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,400
Can you dance well?

333
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,400
Don't let me hear music again.

334
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,400
You know that

335
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,400
I have all my skills

336
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,400
on Latin dance.

337
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,400
I'm really bad at studying.

338
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,400
After the meeting,

339
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
I got a bunch of answers.

340
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,400
I can't pass it.

341
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,400
My dad said

342
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,400
this time,

343
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,400
I can only pass the exam.

344
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,400
I can't pass it.

345
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
This time,

346
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
I only passed the exam.

347
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,400
I got a high school graduation certificate.

348
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,400
He agreed to let me continue to learn dance.

349
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,400
Otherwise,

350
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,400
he would send me to England to study business.

351
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,400
My favorite Latin dance.

352
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,400
Are you done?

353
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,400
I heard

354
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
that our grades

355
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,400
are in the computer of the Education Department.

356
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,400
How about...

357
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,400
Don't think about it.

358
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
I won't do anything

359
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
that violates the school rules.

360
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,400
Let's talk about it.

361
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
I have my mom and uncle.

362
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,400
Do you

363
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
need money to stay in the hospital?

364
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
As long as I pass the exam,

365
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
my dad will definitely give me money.

366
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,400
Don't mention my mom.

367
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
Okay, okay, okay.

368
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,400
I know.

369
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,400
I want to run fast.

370
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
I don't want to be a thief.

371
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,400
You don't need to earn money.

372
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,400
Mom.

373
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,400
There is the sun.

374
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
It's so nice.

375
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,400
Let's go.

376
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
Let's go.

377
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,400
A treatment costs a thousand dollars.

378
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
What are you doing?

379
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,400
Stealing money?

380
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,400
Don't tell me those useless things.

381
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,400
I tell you.

382
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,400
No money.

383
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,400
Sister.

384
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
Why are you back?

385
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,400
Dr. Zhao said

386
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,400
that now in Japan,

387
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,400
a new drug has been developed.

388
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
It's specifically for treating

389
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,400
patients with late-stage cancer like us.

390
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,400
It's called...

391
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,400
It's called...

392
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,400
What is it called?

393
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,400
Rufa Tini.

394
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,400
Yes, yes, yes.

395
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,400
It's this kind of medicine.

396
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
Dr. Zhao said that

397
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
this kind of medicine may be helpful

398
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,400
to our mother's illness.

399
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,400
It's a very good medicine.

400
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,400
It's very good.

401
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,400
It's very good.

402
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,400
It's very good.

403
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,400
It's very good.

404
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,400
It may be helpful

405
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,400
to extend the survival period of three months in the future.

406
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,400
It's okay.

407
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
Don't worry about it.

408
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,400
I'll figure out the money.

409
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,400
It's in. It's in.

410
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,400
Please change it yourself.

411
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
You...

412
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
Four hundred thousand.

413
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,400
Four thousand and three.

414
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,400
The more, the better.

415
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
No problem.

416
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,400
Once the result comes down,

417
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,400
let alone four hundred thousand,

418
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,400
my father can afford it.

419
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,400
Is it cold, mom?

420
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,400
It's good that the sun is warm.

421
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,400
It's good.

422
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,400
Yixun.

423
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,400
Yixun.

424
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,400
Why are you here?

425
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,400
Auntie looks really good today.

426
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,400
Mom.

427
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,400
Are you still here?

428
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Let's go back.

429
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
Okay.

430
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,400
Come here.

431
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,400
Say it.

432
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
The school knows about the change of grades.

433
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,400
The Education Bureau also sent a new director,

434
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,400
who specifically investigated this matter.

435
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,400
It's been a long time,

436
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
but it's on our heads.

437
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,400
How much did you change?

438
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,400
Ninety-five.

439
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,400
Ninety-five without a door.

440
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,400
There are also ninety.

441
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,400
Is there something wrong with your brain?

442
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,400
You usually get sixty points.

443
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,400
Now you change to ninety-five.

444
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,400
Isn't my dad more likely to get more points?

445
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,400
Isn't my dad more likely to get more points?

446
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,400
Is he the one who sent the education bureau?

447
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,400
Liu Ailun.

448
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,400
Yes, that's him.

449
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,400
I saw him enter the principal's office.

450
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,400
Due to severely breaking the school rules,

451
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,400
I decided to give the high school class two, Li Xun and Fu Yizhuo,

452
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,400
a school-level punishment.

453
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,400
Don't worry.

454
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,400
I'm going to find Director Liu.

455
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,400
I said yes, I can do it alone.

456
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,400
You're a teacher, you're a judge.

457
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,400
Tell me,

458
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,400
what's the 21st grade of the computer?

459
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
What grade?

460
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
Mom.

461
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
Mom.

462
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
Mom.

463
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,400
Mom.

464
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,400
Mom.

465
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,400
Mom.

466
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,400
Mom.

467
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,400
Mom.

468
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,400
Mom.

469
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,400
Mom.

470
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,400
Mom.

471
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
Mom, I'm sorry.

472
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,400
I'm sorry.

473
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,400
Mom.

474
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,400
Mom.

475
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,400
Li Xun was fired.

476
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,400
But he didn't have time to get the money

477
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,400
and pay for my mom's treatment.

478
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,400
He didn't even have time to see my mom for the last time.

479
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,400
Mom, sit down.

480
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,400
Mom, sit down.

481
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,400
Mom, sit down.

482
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,400
Come on.

483
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
Let me tell you.

484
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,400
When you choose the stocks and bonds later,

485
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,400
don't listen to those people.

486
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,400
Buy a few thousand or ten thousand.

487
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,400
That bunch of grandsons are so dark-hearted.

488
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,400
Just buy a few hundred dollars.

489
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,400
It's enough to use it.

490
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,400
I'm afraid I'm gone.

491
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,400
Your mom is sick and she wants to die.

492
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,400
The result is good.

493
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,400
If you don't throw in hundreds of thousands, the rest will be destroyed.

494
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,400
Don't hit me.

495
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Don't hit me.

496
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,400
What are you doing?

497
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,400
I'm not hitting you.

498
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
Don't hit me.

499
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,400
Li Xun.

500
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,400
Are you okay?

501
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,400
Maybe the wound is on the spine.

502
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Let's do a CT first.

503
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,400
See the situation.

504
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,400
If it doesn't work, we may have to do an operation.

505
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,400
How much does it cost?

506
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,400
If we do an operation, it's about 30,000.

507
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,400
Be careful.

508
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,400
Let's go.

509
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
Let's do a CT.

510
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,400
Let's go.

511
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,400
Let's go.

512
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,400
What if the wound is on the spine?

513
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Mom is very worried.

514
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,400
I can save her.

515
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,400
What do I know?

516
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,400
I'm sorry.

517
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,400
The waist of Li Xun

518
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,400
was hit by my man

519
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,400
on the day my mom died.

520
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,400
She was so angry.

521
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,400
She was so angry.

522
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,400
She was a year old

523
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,400
and had a high school entrance exam.

524
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,400
Then she didn't come home.

525
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,400
How long

526
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,400
haven't you seen Li Xun?

527
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,400
It's been a long time.

528
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,400
I haven't seen him.

529
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,400
I haven't seen him.

530
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,400
I haven't seen him.

531
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,400
I haven't seen him.

532
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,400
I haven't seen him.

533
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,400
I haven't seen him.

534
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,400
I haven't seen him.

535
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,400
I haven't seen him.

536
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,400
I haven't seen him.

537
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,400
I haven't seen him.

538
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,400
I haven't seen him.

539
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,400
I haven't seen him.

540
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,400
I haven't seen him.

541
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,400
I haven't seen him.

542
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,400
I haven't seen him.

543
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,400
I haven't seen him.

544
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,400
I haven't seen him.

545
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,400
I haven't seen him.

546
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,400
I haven't seen him.

547
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,400
I haven't seen him.

548
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
I haven't seen him.

549
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,400
I haven't seen him.

550
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
I haven't seen him.

551
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
I haven't seen him.

552
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,400
I haven't seen him.

553
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,400
I haven't seen him.

554
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,400
I haven't seen him.

555
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,520
I haven't seen him.

556
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,400
When did you come back?

557
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,540
Who made you leave the hospital?

558
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,400
What's the rush?

559
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,400
I've finished writing the

560
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,400
service for you last night.

561
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,400
I saw it.

562
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,400
It's written well.

563
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,680
Li Xun, you have a bad spine. Why didn't you tell me?

564
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,280
With your condition, you can't play basketball.

565
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,960
You can't sit and sit for a long time.

566
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,280
Your current posture is the worst for your spine.

567
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,480
It's already like this.

568
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,120
The doctor said your head is very bad. It's best to have surgery.

569
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,080
I won't.

570
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,320
Why not?

571
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,520
I don't have time.

572
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,920
Where do you have time? You're busy with the interrogation.

573
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,200
Why do you like to be so nosy?

574
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,120
Is it related to you?

575
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,200
I checked yesterday.

576
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,720
The risk of surgery is very low.

577
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,200
Even if there's a chance, I don't want it.

578
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,800
I'd rather die than be greedy.

579
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,520
Is this the crow behind you?

580
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,520
Are we going to the office tomorrow?

581
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,480
Yes.

582
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,240
Why are we going to the office today?

583
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,360
We're just going to look around.

584
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,920
See if there's anywhere else to look.

585
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,000
Of course.

586
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,200
Take a look.

587
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,400
This room looks like this.

588
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,600
From up here?

589
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,760
Yes.

590
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,080
Thank you.

591
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,320
I will bring them back.

592
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,760
I will bring the books back later.

593
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,760
Cheng Xinqian.

594
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,140
Dr. Chi, do you have a

595
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,140
medical record?

596
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,140
Who put this here?

597
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,140
It's not a person.

598
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,140
Send it over as soon as possible.

599
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,140
Don't be late.

600
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,140
He knows that

601
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,140
Li Lan went to the hospital yesterday.

602
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,140
This is a low-level.

603
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,140
I'm sorry to bother you, Zhou Yuan.

604
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,140
It's okay.

605
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,140
I like traditional music too.

606
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,140
My father and I used to listen to

607
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,140
traditional music together.

608
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,140
At that time, he said

609
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,140
that if I made money in the future,

610
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,140
he would invite me to listen to

611
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,140
traditional music's concert.

612
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,140
I'm sorry.

613
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,520
I'm sorry.

614
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,520
Thank you.

615
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,520
You're so sweet.

616
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,520
The concert is about to start.

617
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,520
Let's go in first.

618
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,220
Tang Life, Tang Life.

619
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,140
The song is about the love that we have for each other

620
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,140
The song is about the love that we have for each other

621
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,140
The song is about the love that we have for each other

622
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,140
The song is about the love that we have for each other

623
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,140
The song is about the love that we have for each other

624
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,140
The song is about the love that we have for each other

625
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,140
The song is about the love that we have for each other

626
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,140
The song is about the love that we have for each other

627
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,140
The song is about the love that we have for each other

628
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,140
The song is about the love that we have for each other

629
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,140
The song is about the love that we have for each other

630
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,140
The song is about the love that we have for each other

631
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,140
The song is about the love that we have for each other

632
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,140
The song is about the love that we have for each other

633
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,140
The story is not the same

634
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,140
The story is not the same

635
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,140
Let people bury it

636
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,140
Let people bury it

637
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,140
Just so young

638
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,140
Still so anxious

639
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,140
Two-faced

640
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,140
Unwilling to be noisy

641
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,140
The more you learn, the less you learn

642
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,140
You lose everything

643
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,140
You have to be beautiful

644
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,140
Just so young

645
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,140
Why did you tell me

646
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,140
Why did you tell me

647
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:06,140
I just want to let my mom see the sun again.

648
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:11,140
Even if it's just one more day, one more time.

649
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,140
I'm sorry.

650
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:29,140
In the end, this is our destiny.

651
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,140
But I have to endure it.

652
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,140
I don't want to.

653
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,140
You have to think about it.

654
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,140
If you get this, you won't be able to get up.

655
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:44,140
If you can't get into school, you will blame me.

656
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,140
Even if the whole world knows,

657
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,140
I will be different from them.

658
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,140
You can't hit me with anything.

659
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,140
I can't hit you with anything.

660
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,140
I don't admit it.

661
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,140
I only admit myself.

662
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,140
Hello, Miss.

663
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,140
Wait over there.

664
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:04,140
Although Li Xun will never say it,

665
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,140
I still thank you on his behalf.

666
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,140
He is like this.

667
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:13,140
He has everything in his heart, but he doesn't have medicine.

668
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,140
He obviously cares about it, but he doesn't care about the medicine.

669
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,140
It's true.

670
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,140
But I can see that he is different from you.

671
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,140
He is different from you.

672
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,140
He is different from you.

673
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,140
He asked you to come with me.

674
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,140
He believes you.

675
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,140
Really?

676
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,140
But you have to be careful.

677
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,140
Don't force him to die.

678
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,140
I know him.

679
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:52,140
You sometimes have to make him anxious.

680
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:56,140
You can't always pay for the two people's things.

681
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,140
I know.

682
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,140
The car is here.

683
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,140
Then I'm leaving.

684
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,140
Bye.

685
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,140
Thank you.

686
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,140
See you next time, Miss.

687
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,140
When did you come?

688
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,140
Sister Bilan just left.

689
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,140
I saw it.

690
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,140
You came and didn't see her off.

691
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,140
Sister Bilan was right.

692
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:33,140
You care about everything in your heart, but you pretend not to care.

693
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,140
You did it on purpose.

694
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,140
You are afraid of her.

695
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,140
I'm afraid that she will be angry.

696
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,140
I'm afraid that she will be angry.

697
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,140
I'm afraid that she will be angry.

698
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,140
I'm afraid that she will be angry.

699
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,140
I'm afraid that she will be angry.

700
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,140
You talk too much.

701
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,140
Sister Bilan is happy.

702
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,140
She said thank you.

703
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,140
What else?

704
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,140
And...

705
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,140
You have to be careful.

706
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,140
Don't force him to die.

707
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,140
I don't look like I want to die.

708
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,140
I'm so easy to die.

709
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,140
She said you were anxious.

710
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,140
I know.

711
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,140
Maybe it's not good to drag it down.

712
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,140
But I really don't want to do this surgery.

713
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,140
I'm so anxious.

714
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,140
That's right.

715
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:42,140
It's weird to think about Li Xun sitting on a wheelchair.

716
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,140
Don't do this again.

717
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,140
You have to do activities every half an hour.

718
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,140
You have to do the work every day.

719
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,140
The school can do the school's office.

720
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,140
I'll get it done for you tomorrow.

721
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,140
Whatever.

722
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,140
I can see that.

723
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:14,140
Li Xun is just like you.

724
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,140
Li Xun, I know this is your project.

725
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,140
I don't have the right to say anything.

726
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:25,140
But I don't want to waste time and energy.

727
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,140
Whatever.

728
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,140
I decided to quit the base.

729
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:52,140
I'm sorry.

730
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:53,140
I'm sorry.

731
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,140
I'm sorry.

732
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,140
I'm sorry.

733
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,140
I'm sorry.

734
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,140
I'm sorry.

735
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,140
I'm sorry.

736
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,140
I'm sorry.

737
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,140
I'm sorry.

738
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,140
I'm sorry.

739
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,140
I'm sorry.

740
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,140
I'm sorry.

741
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,140
I'm sorry.

742
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,140
I'm sorry.

743
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,140
I'm sorry.

744
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,140
I'm sorry.

745
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,140
I'm sorry.

746
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,140
I'm sorry.

747
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,140
I'm sorry.

748
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,140
I'm sorry.

749
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,140
I'm sorry.

750
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,140
I'm sorry.

751
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,140
I'm sorry.

752
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,140
I'm sorry.

753
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,140
I'm sorry.

754
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,140
I'm sorry.

755
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,140
I'm sorry.
