2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if the light is very bright

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will still watch over it

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the endless atmosphere

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every scene has a touch of gold

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am the light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast night?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I burn up the night just for you

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This is how everything was at the beginning

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am the light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The wind is like a wild grass

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I burn up the night just for you

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You are still by my side

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Everything is how it was at the beginning

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I did the revision of the exam

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It has nothing to do with others

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
If you want to fire me, fire me

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Retry of the exam

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This is a very serious act of betrayal

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You two can't run away

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
There is nothing to discuss about this

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Director Liu

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It was him

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But it's all in the past

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The cheating may be hidden

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's impossible for a high-ranking student to cheat

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He is really amazing

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Teacher Lin said he was a genius

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't care what reason he has

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's wrong

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Let me tell you

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
If a person is talented

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But it's useless in the right place

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This is actually more terrible

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What is this called

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
This is called talented

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's a little person

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It has been like this since ancient times

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I heard from Teacher Zhang

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Your practice base

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Is used to get

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Second class

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You are in the first grade

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Don't worry

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I think

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You have to set a good foundation in the first grade

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Practice can be done later

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Otherwise, it's not an airway

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
No root

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Don't go to the practice base

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I will try to go as little as possible

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Didn't Teacher Lin say

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The most important thing in the selection of the programming is the practice

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
How to be a good programmer

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
If you don't break a few keyboards

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Mom, get in the car

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That practice base

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You can continue to participate

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Thank you mom

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But the boy called Li Xun

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Stay away

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
He is not suitable for you

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Try to get as little contact with him as possible

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Then i'll go first

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Li Xun

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Li Xun

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Guess what I just ate

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Old dry? dragon fruit

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
My mom is shocked

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You ate my bread

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Remember to continue to buy tomorrow

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Li Xun

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Are you from Linyang?

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Were you from Ba Zhou?

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I cheated in the college entrance examination when I was in the third grade

84
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Your mother punished me personally

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I didn't know

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm not a fool

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm a fool

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm a fool

89
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm a fool

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You really cheated

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Why

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Is it important

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Of course

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You must have a reason

95
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
what

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You have to re-evaluate

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Restore my review results

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Some things you never understand

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I don't understand

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Princess

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Do you think everyone is the same as you?

102
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What's the difference?

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
How did you get the app from Zhang Xiaobei?

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Han Jiakang in Zhang Xiaobei

105
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Zhang Xiaobei has been in the belly for so many years

106
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Nothing got

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But you can let Zhang Xiaobei apologize to you

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
why

109
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Your mother told you to stay away from me, right?

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yes

111
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Then why don't you ask me how to answer

112
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
She's right

113
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
We are totally different

114
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm sorry

115
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Why do you call me princess?

116
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Hello, where can I help you?

117
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Happy birthday to you

118
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Happy birthday to you

119
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Happy birthday to you

120
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Happy birthday to you

121
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Happy birthday to you

122
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What's the matter with you?

123
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm from the Eight Middle School of Linyang

124
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
My name is Li Xun

125
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I know you

126
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I did the re-evaluation

127
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It has nothing to do with others

128
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You can fire me if you want

129
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I've never seen a student like you

130
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So rational after making a mistake

131
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You think this is a bargain in the market, right?

132
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
A person makes a mistake

133
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
He must be punished

134
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Not to mention you young people

135
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You must be guilty

136
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You must be guilty

137
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So you can grow healthy

138
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's my fault

139
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm willing to be punished

140
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
But it has nothing to do with Fu Yizhou

141
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
He can't be fired

142
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Director Liu

143
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I can be punished however you want

144
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Don't you understand what I said?

145
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The cheating is a very serious act of fraud

146
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You can't escape

147
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
There's nothing to discuss

148
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You should go back

149
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Director Liu

150
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm sorry

151
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You should go back

152
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Director Liu

153
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Student

154
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Student

155
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Take the umbrella

156
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Go

157
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Director Liu

158
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You're leaving again, right?

159
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
To Beijing

160
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What about your band?

161
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Don't worry, Boss Li

162
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Even if the band is really disbanded

163
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'll return you a lot of your investment

164
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I didn't mean that

165
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Don't be so nice

166
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Since it's impossible

167
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Let's end it earlier

168
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Others are nice

169
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm right

170
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm not suitable to fall in love

171
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Love is too easy to be a person's weakness

172
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But it can also be the most solid armor

173
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's not a bad armor

174
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I think love is the most worth trying in this world

175
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The most worth nothing

176
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Why are you so sour today?

177
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Let's go

178
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Where are you going in such a heavy rain?

179
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Don't you think about love?

180
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
No

181
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I don't have weakness

182
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I don't need armor

183
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'll help you cut it

184
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Wu Mingxuan, help me cut it

185
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's okay, I'll go cut it

186
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Here

187
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Thanks

188
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Do you want some hot water?

189
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Thank you

190
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Thank you

191
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You're welcome

192
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You're welcome

193
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm sorry

194
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I didn't mean that

195
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's impossible

196
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
He never told me those two words

197
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
What's wrong with him today?

198
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
What does he want?

199
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Gao

200
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I sent you a document

201
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
There are all the health products of Lan Gong

202
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And every product's detailed description

203
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Including formula and treatment direction

204
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Ask me if you have any questions

205
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I see

206
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm back now

207
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I can do the application

208
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Enough

209
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
In the previous class

210
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
We talked about the definition of the limit of the function

211
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But usually

212
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
We don't use definition to ask for the limit of the function

213
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Because it's very troublesome to use definition to ask for the limit of the function

214
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Li Xun

215
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
The more contact you have, the more difficult it is to figure out

216
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Sometimes you think the distance is close

217
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
But you find it's further away from him

218
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Do you know what this means?

219
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Zhu Ying

220
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Zhu Ying

221
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You really don't want to know the answer?

222
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I don't

223
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
My mom asked me to stay away from you

224
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
My answer is no

225
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
The app of Lan Guan

226
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I don't need you

227
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Are you going to drive me away?

228
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I said I don't need you

229
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Don't you understand?

230
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
What's wrong with me or you?

231
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I have to work

232
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You can go

233
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Li Xun

234
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You asked me to go to the base

235
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm not the kind of person you are so eager to go to

236
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Don't you want to drive me away?

237
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Come

238
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Li Xun

239
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,280
I've been absent from school several times.

240
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,720
I'll be suspended if I don't go to school.

241
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:03,920
Excuse me.

242
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,360
Which school are you from?

243
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,640
Calculation School.

244
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,720
If I hadn't been suspended,

245
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,040
I wouldn't have played volleyball.

246
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,600
What about you?

247
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,120
I've been suspended, too.

248
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,080
Come on, everyone.

249
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,320
Class is about to start.

250
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,440
Let's do some preparation.

251
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,480
Shake your hands and feet.

252
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,520
Who is this?

253
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,280
That one.

254
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:33,920
Jiang Xingchi.

255
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,640
Second Class Sports Specialist.

256
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,520
National Second Class Sports Specialist.

257
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,480
He's the head coach of our volleyball team.

258
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,360
He's still in volleyball class?

259
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,760
He's just a casual student.

260
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,000
Turn around.

261
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,840
Attention, everyone.

262
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,480
We have a new student joining us today.

263
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,320
So I'll teach you how to play volleyball.

264
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,960
There are many ways to play volleyball.

265
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,480
And you need to know the most basic

266
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,840
and the simplest way

267
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,680
to play volleyball from the side.

268
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,280
Now I'll let Jiang Xingchi

269
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,280
demonstrate it to you.

270
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,160
First, use your side to face the net.

271
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,520
Stand with your feet slightly wider than the shoulder.

272
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,440
Bend slightly.

273
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,960
Hold the ball with your left hand

274
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,280
and throw the ball

275
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,800
straight up before your chest.

276
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,880
At the same time,

277
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,880
turn your right hand to the side and throw the ball backwards.

278
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,280
When the ball is in the right area,

279
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,960
use your palm to the heel to stimulate the ball.

280
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,360
Come on, Jiang Xingchi.

281
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:42,920
Let's go.

282
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,760
Do you understand?

283
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,840
Yes.

284
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,520
Start practicing if you understand.

285
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,680
Try your hands first.

286
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,200
If you have any questions,

287
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,080
you can come to me

288
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,680
or to Jiang Xingchi.

289
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,000
If you haven't practiced,

290
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,920
go find someone who has practiced.

291
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,040
Go.

292
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,480
Good.

293
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,000
Be more serious.

294
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,240
Zhu Yue.

295
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,120
Thank you.

296
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,280
Zhu Yue.

297
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,560
Try to hit the big one

298
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,760
with this one.

299
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,120
Try it.

300
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:32,960
Yes.

301
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,760
Actually, you need to make sure that

302
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,360
the tension in the arm

303
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,200
is hit with this one.

304
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,160
What's wrong with you?

305
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,840
Let me see.

306
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,160
This...

307
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,600
Why is it so red?

308
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,520
What's wrong?

309
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:56,840
Is she hurt?

310
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,360
Yes.

311
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,440
Let me see.

312
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,840
Can you move your wrist?

313
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,040
Yes.

314
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,960
Do you feel pain in your wrist?

315
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,040
A little.

316
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,960
It shouldn't be a big problem.

317
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,320
But you can't be careless.

318
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,440
How about I take her to the infirmary?

319
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,040
Yes.

320
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,680
I can go by myself.

321
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,360
Take her to the infirmary.

322
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,200
No, I'll take you there.

323
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,120
I'm familiar with that place.

324
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,800
Okay?

325
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:13,800
Yes.

326
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,240
Jiang, take her to the infirmary.

327
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:15,760
Go.

328
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,680
Actually, you used the wrong place.

329
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,840
If you're not careful,

330
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,120
if you're not careful,

331
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:22,480
you'll...

332
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,120
Okay, everyone.

333
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,440
Keep practicing.

334
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,920
Pay attention to me.

335
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,160
If you don't get used to it,

336
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,160
don't use too much force.

337
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,040
Be careful.

338
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,040
Okay.

339
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,920
It's nothing.

340
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,040
Just apply it with a bandage.

341
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,720
Okay.

342
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,440
Don't worry.

343
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,120
Thank you.

344
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,320
I'll do it myself.

345
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:43,880
Let me do it.

346
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,520
It's good that I do it.

347
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,120
Let me do it.

348
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,680
Does it hurt?

349
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,720
You're from the computer class, right?

350
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,920
I saw your performance

351
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,400
at the school's arts and arts meeting.

352
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,040
Little Piggy, right?

353
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,960
Piggy, you...

354
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,680
I'll do it myself.

355
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,240
No need to be so polite.

356
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,200
It's not time yet.

357
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,160
You need to apply it again.

358
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,600
You don't usually exercise, right?

359
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,680
In fact,

360
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,680
a person who has no experience like you

361
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,680
is the easiest to get hurt.

362
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,320
That volleyball is too hard.

363
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,040
It's hard?

364
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,120
We used soft volleyball in class.

365
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,520
We used hard volleyball

366
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,920
in training and competitions.

367
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,920
If you want to play that,

368
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,920
you have to die on the field.

369
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,120
No way.

370
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,920
You don't believe me?

371
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,920
I'm not lying.

372
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,920
I'm not lying.

373
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,920
You don't believe me?

374
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,520
I'll ask you to go to the next training.

375
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,520
I'll show you my basketball.

376
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,520
You're from our school's volleyball team?

377
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,520
Yes.

378
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,920
You don't know?

379
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,920
Let me tell you.

380
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,920
Before we came here,

381
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,920
the school and the school team

382
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,720
could go to any step

383
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,720
by drawing lots.

384
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,520
But since we came here,

385
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,520
we've been in the top six.

386
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,520
And I'm still the MVP of our school.

387
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,920
No, the boys in your class

388
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,320
are too extreme.

389
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,920
They're all like paper foxes.

390
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,120
Especially the one who went to the class.

391
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,320
Like a flower rack.

392
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,720
You know what?

393
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,120
A woman's dream

394
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,440
is to be able to

395
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,120
be in the world of flower rack

396
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,320
peacefully.

397
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,120
Okay, I'm leaving.

398
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,120
I'm leaving.

399
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,320
Can we add each other on WeChat?

400
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,120
If there's anything,

401
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,920
we can contact each other.

402
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,920
No need.

403
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,720
Hey, hey.

404
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,720
Let's add each other on WeChat.

405
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,320
No need.

406
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,520
We can contact each other.

407
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,120
You got hurt in the volleyball class.

408
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,720
Coach Tang asked me to follow you.

409
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,120
If you can't go to the volleyball class,

410
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,320
I can ask for leave for you.

411
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,920
Okay.

412
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,920
You can hit me.

413
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,120
Okay.

414
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,120
I'll go.

415
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,120
What are you doing?

416
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,720
Did you do it on purpose?

417
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,520
Sorry.

418
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,120
If your phone is broken, you can ask for help.

419
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,720
Take out your camera.

420
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,320
The application technology is average.

421
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,520
No need.

422
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,120
You're still driving me away.

423
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,320
You're so stubborn.

424
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,920
Thank you all.

425
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,320
I can use my time

426
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,320
to sit here today

427
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,320
and listen to some knowledge

428
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,320
from our Chinese medicine.

429
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,320
The meridians

430
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,320
are not all over the body.

431
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,320
It's a main passage

432
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,120
of human body blood circulation.

433
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,320
It's also

434
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,320
a main path

435
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,920
for meridians in various parts of the body.

436
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,920
In life,

437
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,120
there are many headaches,

438
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,120
and some common small and big diseases.

439
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,120
I hope you can all

440
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,120
understand it.

441
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,320
Let's make an analogy.

442
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,720
You're a map maker.

443
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,720
You play with your phone.

444
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,720
The cervical spine is uncomfortable.

445
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,720
Where is the blood vessel?

446
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,920
The big blood vessel.

447
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,520
It's here.

448
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,720
When you feel uncomfortable,

449
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,720
use your hand to rub it.

450
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,720
Turn it around.

451
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,720
Yes.

452
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,720
Yes.

453
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,720
The power supply and the Internet connection

454
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,720
are all in the same place.

455
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,720
The ink.

456
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,720
Next time,

457
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,720
we'll take that one.

458
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,320
The release time is here.

459
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,320
If you don't do it now,

460
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,320
you'll have to wait for a while.

461
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,320
Didn't we say

462
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,120
the interface system is too repetitive?

463
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:06,920
Why don't we

464
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,920
use the human body ink directly?

465
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,920
This is good.

466
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,320
Look.

467
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
If this is our interface,

468
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,320
the user can choose

469
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,320
the position of his discomfort

470
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,320
on the human body model.

471
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,320
We'll design

472
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,320
the selection and description

473
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,320
of the disease symptoms

474
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,320
to make it more leading.

475
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,320
We can model the human body

476
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,320
according to this model

477
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,320
to make it into several parts.

478
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,320
For example,

479
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,320
the head, the limbs,

480
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,320
the waist, the back, etc.

481
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,320
This way,

482
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,320
the system will be more uniform.

483
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,320
This is good.

484
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,720
This is good.

485
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,720
Is it okay, Team Leader Li?

486
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,720
How is it, Team Leader Li?

487
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,720
Do you need it?

488
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,320
If you don't reject it,

489
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,320
then I'll agree.

490
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,920
I don't want to teach you how to use an umbrella.

491
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,920
You can't do it without me.

492
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,520
Lemme show you.

493
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,520
tapped your hand

494
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,520
on the soil

495
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,520
I'll ask them,

496
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,520
can you tell us

497
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,020
how to use the umbrella?

498
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,920
Let's go.

499
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,520
Baby.

500
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,320
Is it okay for you to swim

501
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,320
with your baby?

502
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,120
Feels good, right?

503
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,720
Your real identity

504
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,120
and från what you'd dragged

505
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,120
Let's sit.

506
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Zhu Yun, how about we leave?

507
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,120
We're too different in strength.

508
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,240
It's okay. I can teach you and protect you.

509
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,620
What do you think?

510
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,120
You're done already?

511
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,240
Okay, tell me your group name.

512
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Li Xun, Jiang Xingchi.

513
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,620
Who wants to be in your group?

514
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,740
Don't you want to compete?

515
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,120
You asked for this.

516
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,120
Are you still coming?

517
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,240
I am.

518
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,120
Jiang Xingchi, I'll be in your group.

519
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,120
Come on.

520
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,240
Who told you to come here?

521
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,360
I'm here.

522
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,360
This...

523
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,500
No, it's not that.

524
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,620
I'm here to help you.

525
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,740
I'm here to help you.

526
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,860
I'm here to help you.

527
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,860
Really?

528
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,860
You don't have to compete with Jiang Xingchi.

529
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,980
He's a national level athlete.

530
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,100
He's the main player of our school's volleyball team.

531
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,240
Who can beat him?

532
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,360
It seems you admire him.

533
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,480
No, but he's talented enough to beat me here.

534
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,600
Where? Where?

535
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,740
Where?

536
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,860
I'm here to help you.

537
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,980
I'm here to help you.

538
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,100
I'm here to help you.

539
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,240
I'm here to help you.

540
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,360
I'm here to help you.

541
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,740
Where is it?

542
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,860
It's full of people.

543
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,980
Do you accept it?

544
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,120
Let go.

545
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,240
Do you accept it?

546
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,360
I'll beat you.

547
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,660
Try to flirt next time.

548
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,780
I'm not flirting with you.

549
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,440
Come back to work.

550
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,580
Aren't you going to fire me?

551
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,700
Fang Shumiao, you're so greedy.

552
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,820
You're back at the right time.

553
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,940
Are you free this weekend?

554
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,060
Why? Are you dating me?

555
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,200
You're dating your senior.

556
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,200
I don't think it's good to have three people.

557
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:08,340
What if I'm not dating my senior?

558
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,120
You rejected him?

559
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,240
Please think about your words.

560
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,380
Why did you reject him?

561
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,500
My senior and I are the most popular date.

562
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,620
We don't have a real relationship.

563
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,740
We're both free.

564
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,880
Right.

565
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,420
Look, it's him.

566
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,260
Superman.

567
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,380
He's so vulgar.

568
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,500
He's an online celebrity.

569
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,640
We've never met before.

570
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,760
But we're in a good relationship.

571
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,880
We're in good shape.

572
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Aren't you afraid of being exposed?

573
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,140
But it's good to meet him.

574
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,260
If it's not appropriate, break up with him.

575
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,680
Zhuyu, I think the door to the first world...

576
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,800
...is about to open.

577
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:02,420
I think it's better to have two of these.

578
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,300
Don't be fooled by the seller.

579
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,420
Is it that obvious?

580
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,560
The blue one is better. Don't put it in your pants.

581
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,680
I'll try.

582
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,800
Are you going on a date?

583
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,920
Yes.

584
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,060
To avoid a car accident...

585
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,180
...I specially invited a guest.

586
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,300
Who?

587
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,420
You.

588
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,420
I'm not going.

589
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,560
You're just going to watch me do my own thing?

590
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,680
You're not allowed to wash your hair, put on makeup...

591
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,800
...or wear high heels on weekends.

592
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,920
Then I'll just stay in bed and be with you.

593
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,060
That's right.

594
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,180
To avoid you being embarrassed...

595
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,300
...I even found someone to be with.

596
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,420
Who?

597
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,560
Meng Xin.

598
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,680
Fang Shumiao has organized a little date.

599
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,800
We'll go out and have fun on weekends.

600
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,560
But I'm afraid I can't.

601
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,820
I don't know if there are any other people.

602
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,740
I'll go with my cousin.

603
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,980
What kind of relationship?

604
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,120
I'm not sure. There are other guys in the same department.

605
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,320
Do you think the blue one will work?

606
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,440
Come here.

607
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,440
Do you know why Fang Shumiao wants you to go?

608
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,560
It's okay. Put on a nice outfit.

609
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,320
But I don't know how to drive a truck.

610
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,440
It's okay. I'll teach you.

611
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,560
You can do it?

612
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,700
Of course. I've seen it many times.

613
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,820
I can't tell.

614
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,940
It seems to be this truck.

615
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,020
Is it her?

616
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,140
I think so.

617
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,280
Hello, I'm Fang Shumiao.

618
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,400
Superman?

619
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,520
Yes.

620
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,200
Zhu Yu, we haven't met yet.

621
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,520
So why did you call me?

622
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,640
I have a roommate.

623
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,020
You know each other?

624
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,760
I have something to do. You guys play first. I'll go first.

625
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,900
Don't, Zhu Yu.

626
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,020
Superman, the customer service table.

627
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,820
Hurry up.

628
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,320
You called Li Xun?

629
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,440
I was going to ask you.

630
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,640
Well, Li Xun is not in the base this year.

631
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,640
Anyway, it's a company meeting.

632
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,760
It's a bit crowded. Don't you mind?

633
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,480
Li Xun is a professional player in our class.

634
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,600
This year's science and technology champion.

635
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,720
Let's do it together.

636
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,860
Okay.

637
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,980
Everyone is busy.

638
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,100
Let's go together.

639
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,100
Zhu Yu, get in the car.

640
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,820
Who drives?

641
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,100
You drive so fast.

642
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,240
Are you a bit anxious?

643
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,360
Or you can lean over a little.

644
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,480
No.

645
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,600
I'm not.

646
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,740
You're not?

647
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,860
I'm not.

648
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,980
You're not?

649
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,980
Lean over a little.

650
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,120
No.

651
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,240
Does your hand still hurt? Do you want me to check it for you?

652
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,360
No, it's not painful at all.

653
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,240
Actually, the post-traumatic stress after exercise is quite serious.

654
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,360
I'd better check it.

655
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,480
It's okay.

656
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,600
Really?

657
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,740
Yes.

658
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,980
It's starting.

659
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,120
They drive so fast.

660
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,240
They're turning into a supercar.

661
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,360
Miao Miao, come on.

662
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,480
Three, come on.

663
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,600
Go.

664
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,720
How does it work?

665
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,980
How does it work?

666
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,120
It's so cool.

667
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,240
What's wrong?

668
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,360
What's wrong? Are you okay?

669
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,480
Let me do it.

670
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,620
I'm fine.

671
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,740
I'm fine.

672
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,860
I'm fine.

673
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,980
I'm fine.

674
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,120
I'm fine.

675
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,240
I'm fine.

676
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,360
I'm fine.

677
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,480
I'm fine.

678
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,620
I'm fine.

679
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,680
I'm fine.

680
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,800
I'm fine.

681
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,920
I'm fine.

682
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,040
Are you okay?

683
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,160
Are you a little dizzy?

684
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,300
Can you use this lighter for a few years?

685
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,420
We can do it later.

686
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,540
How about you sit down?

687
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,880
Sit down quickly.

688
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,620
I'll get you some water.

689
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,620
Are you okay?

690
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,620
Are you feeling unwell?

691
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,620
Don't drink this.

692
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,620
It's worse.

693
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,620
I'll get you some water.

694
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,620
Did you bring paper?

695
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,620
No.

696
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,620
I'll get you a pack of paper.

697
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,620
I'll go get some water.

698
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,620
Here.

699
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,620
Get some water.

700
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,620
Just put it on.

701
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,620
Get some water.

702
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,620
Don't you want to compete?

703
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,620
You asked for this.

704
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,620
Lin Xi, fighting!

705
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,620
Li Xun, fighting!

706
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,620
Sign, completed.

707
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,620
Squad leader.

708
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,620
못 Manufactured.

709
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:35,680
You made such a great

00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,620
blows.

711
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,660
Divorce from the B&B team.

712
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,340
Let stay.

713
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,620
Fix some.

714
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,340
Thank you for sending me home.

715
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,880
He should be very unhappy today.

716
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:11,020
Return the clothes to Jiang Jingchi and let him do it himself.

717
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,820
Ohh, I spit on him after all.

718
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:22,040
Your

719
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,240

00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,420
Fine

You

00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,020
What's this?

724
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:40,800
I you needn't

725
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,000
class all the time

726
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,380
Don't be shy.

727
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:45,380
I'm not.

728
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,940
Don't you bother too much about me just pretending to be me?

729
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,020
You're not gonna call me anymore.

730
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,020
You're reading aEMD certificate.

731
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,100
I read it to you from the hospital after

732
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,880

It was dazzling.

735
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,300
This certificate.

736
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:11,520
Last time, you Fantasy Hip-Hop

737
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,520
didn't hold on to the dance assistant exam

738
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,280
tall, handsome and talented.

739
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,720
His body is better than a model.

740
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,360
His IQ is above Einstein.

741
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:31,840
It's normal to do the

The school knows

00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,400
There is something wrong with your brain

751
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,520
Then high scores

00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,520
Is it related to you

I believe I love you.

761
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:33,120
True love will take its course.

762
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:38,120
I'm by your side.

The first night

779
00:47:54,120 --> 00:48:01,120
will never lose to the world.

780
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:06,120
