2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if the light is very bright

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will still watch over that vast vast land

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless atmosphere

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day, the lens is a little bit yellow

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast night?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I burn up the night just for you to remember

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How everything was in the beginning

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The wind is like a wild grass

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The mountain is broken, but you are still by my side

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Everything is the original look

Episode 16

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Where is Li Xun?

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And who are you?

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Let go

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I am waiting for you over there

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Be careful

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He has practiced before

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I am here

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You are here

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What are you doing?

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I am here

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You are here

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I am here

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You are here

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
When did you come out?

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,200
Where do you live now?

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,200
I'm back to get married.

36
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,880
You two are a good match.

37
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,000
Do you know what you're talking about?

38
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,200
Zhu Yun.

39
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,200
I've become like this today.

40
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,800
It's none of your business.

41
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
You don't have to feel sorry for me.

42
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,800
I've made it clear three years ago.

43
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm not going to be like this anymore.

44
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,400
Who are you with in the future?

45
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,400
It has nothing to do with me.

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Do you understand?

47
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,000
What did I do that you have to do this to me?

48
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,400
I used to think you were just cruel.

49
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,200
But I realized today

50
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,800
that you're really a jerk.

51
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
You're thinking too much.

52
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
I'm not.

53
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,200
Everyone has time.

54
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
I'll go first.

55
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,400
Li Xun.

56
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
That woman just now.

57
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Sorry, big buddy.

58
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,200
Goodbye.

59
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,220
I'm interested!

60
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,400
Li Xun.

61
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,420
Was the lady...

62
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,420
the one you mentioned to me in the clinic?

63
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,480
She looks pretty.

64
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,400
But she's fierce.

65
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,880
Has she ever practiced taekwondo?

66
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,080
Don't stand there.

67
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,680
Are you afraid of...

68
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,740
Fine.

69
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,680
Hurry up.

70
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,000
I can't rely on you.

71
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:30,840
Zhu Yu,

72
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,840
where are you going in such a hurry?

73
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,680
I'm going back to the hotel.

74
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,680
It's not impossible.

75
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,800
It's only ten kilometers.

76
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,360
How about this?

77
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,760
It's not convenient for you to walk in high heels.

78
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,600
Let's call a car to go back to the hotel.

79
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,200
If you really want to walk,

80
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,560
change your shoes.

81
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,720
I'll walk with you.

82
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,520
Okay.

83
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,200
Okay.

84
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,160
The female star is quite generous.

85
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,680
Here it is.

86
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,960
It's an unexpected surprise.

87
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,360
Sorry, my friend.

88
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,560
You can't change your bad habit.

89
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,080
Don't blame others for looking at you.

90
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,800
Give me my wallet back.

91
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,480
Okay.

92
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,440
What's this?

93
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,360
You have to put the key in your wallet this year.

94
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,200
Here.

95
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,560
기도

96
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,440
Zhu Yu.

97
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,800
I just need two days

98
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,600
and I'll be fine

99
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,840
Last night

100
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,380
when you saw her

101
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,940
I might not be act like

102
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,440
I know nothing

103
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,480
Actually you still love her

104
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,960
I was a bastard.

105
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,160
It's been three years.

106
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,280
I remember when I just came back from abroad,

107
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,720
I couldn't even mention his name.

108
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,280
I was sad whenever I thought of him.

109
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,920
So I studied hard

110
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,560
and tried to find many things

111
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,960
to keep myself from stopping.

112
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,360
I thought that

113
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,120
as long as I had no strength,

114
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,680
I would have no strength to be sad.

115
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,880
But slowly,

116
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,800
I realized that I wouldn't cry all the time

117
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,920
and I wouldn't be able to sleep all night.

118
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,560
But actually, I didn't do anything special.

119
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,360
I just lived my life.

120
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,040
Do you still hate him?

121
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,440
This house has just been renovated.

122
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,520
The lighting is good, right?

123
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,920
Okay, we'll rent this house.

124
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,800
You're renting it now?

125
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,200
Sign the contract.

126
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,240
We'll rent it for three months.

127
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,920
What do you do for a living?

128
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,360
What does it have to do with you?

129
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,360
You should know

130
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,040
who I rent this house to.

131
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,560
We're a computer engineer.

132
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,480
We're programmers.

133
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,600
Programmers?

134
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,160
They're not like you.

135
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,120
What do you think we're doing?

136
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,520
I can't rent this house

137
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,400
to a bad guy.

138
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:29,960
Come on.

139
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,640
Who said that?

140
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,000
Who is this?

141
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,760
What are you doing?

142
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,200
Aren't you curious?

143
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,280
He's a murderer.

144
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,720
I'm helping him with his job.

145
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,800
You two just got out of the prison.

146
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,600
What else do you want to know?

147
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,920
What kind of people

148
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,200
did you introduce to me?

149
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,560
You're so stubborn.

150
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,760
I'm telling you,

151
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,800
don't introduce me

152
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,840
to people like you.

153
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,520
You're so stubborn.

154
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,680
How can I tell you?

155
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,040
You're all the same.

156
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,640
When I first came out,

157
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,200
I wanted to be normal.

158
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,800
But you saw it.

159
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,480
We were prisoners.

160
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,360
We were abandoned by society.

161
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,640
No one treats us like human beings.

162
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,560
You either listen to me

163
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,560
or go abroad with me.

164
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,720
It's a nice place abroad.

165
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,680
No one knows us.

166
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,480
Don't say that I'm a coward.

167
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,680
Can't you forget your ex-girlfriend?

168
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,560
Guining.

169
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,520
I won't keep you if you want to go.

170
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,280
As long as you follow me,

171
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,600
I'll let you be a human being.

172
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,080
Choose for yourself.

173
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,800
What are you talking about?

174
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,440
Stop.

175
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,400
There are many people around here.

176
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,680
Don't make trouble

177
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,480
when you live well.

178
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,440
Pay the rent on the 20th of every month.

179
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,680
You all have the card number.

180
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,640
Remember to call on time.

181
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,600
The key.

182
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,840
I'll go now.

183
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,840
Call me if you need anything.

184
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:20,800
Hey.

185
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,560
Well.

186
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,120
We pay money

187
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,160
and live in a small room?

188
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,600
If you don't want to live here,

189
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,160
you can rent it out yourself.

190
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,440
You can do it.

191
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,800
Let me show you around.

192
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,520
I'll do it alone.

193
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,520
Uncle.

194
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,840
It must be my fault.

195
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,080
Please tell me.

196
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,640
I don't know whether I should use it or not.

197
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,560
The

198
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,120
over the top

199
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,080
for this

200
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,280
should be

201
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,200
around three?

202
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,800
Red or white?

203
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,920
Rope or extra?

204
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,880
隨性?

205
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,920
stratification.

206
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,920
It should be

207
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,040
around slices residence or屋頂?

208
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,360
Black or silky?

209
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,080
Black.

210
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,960
White and silver.

211
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,800
Single size?

212
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,600
Single size.

213
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
It's from my brother.

214
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,240
What?

215
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,440
Did you lose something?

216
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,480
An old object.

217
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,480
I lost it long ago.

218
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,520
Are you leaving?

219
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,400
I've done my things.

220
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,600
I'll go back to Lin Yang tomorrow.

221
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,040
Are you going with the gardener?

222
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,440
I went over there at dawn tonight.

223
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,600
I mentioned that when I was cooking the references,

224
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,120
I want to stop by the garden.

225
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,520
You said that you like tailoring.

226
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,960
Yes.

227
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,320
That's nice.

228
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,000
They'd later paint a story

229
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,280
that is unusual.

230
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,480
I've got things to do.

231
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,600
Go. Bye.

232
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,440
No problem.

233
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,080
Why so serious?

234
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,580
What's the matter?

235
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,680
Give one to me.

236
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,440
springs?

237
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,620
Okay, I'll give one to you.

238
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,620
I think it's fine.

239
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,620
That part can be improved.

240
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,620
I think it's fine.

241
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,620
I think it's fine.

242
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,620
But the skylight is here.

243
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,620
Where is it?

244
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,620
Where is it?

245
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,620
Misunderstood.

246
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,620
Say it again.

247
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,620
Misunderstood.

248
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,620
Say it.

249
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,620
Misunderstood.

250
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,620
What do you mean?

251
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,620
I'm leaving.

252
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,620
I'm leaving.

253
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,620
I can do it myself.

254
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,620
I'm leaving.

255
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,620

I'm leaving.

316
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,620
Why is it so hard to pick the flowers?

317
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,620
It's so hot.

318
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,180
It's so hot.

319
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,700
Students, calm down.

320
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,540
The senior and senior are still in the classroom.

321
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,420
It's our turn soon.

322
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,780
Please wait for a while.

323
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,020
Fang Shumiao, you're the class monitor.

324
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,100
Go and urge them.

325
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,540
Yes.

326
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,420
We just entered the school.

327
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,700
Please don't leave such a bad impression

328
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,300
to the senior and senior.

329
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,140

Thank you.

332
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,660
You can't just ignore us.

333
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,340
We've been here for an hour.

334
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,260
Please wait for a while.

335
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:53,780
It's our turn soon.

336
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,780
Hold on.

337
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,500
Hold on.

338
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,820
We're so thirsty.

339
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,260
Come on.

340
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,420
Move forward.

341
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,900
Be careful.

342
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,860
Move aside.

343
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,060
Come on.

344
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,500
Why are you so late?

345
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,060
I'm already thirsty.

346
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,100
Give me the water.

347
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:09,980
Come on.

348
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,940
Give me the water.

349
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,980
Excuse me.

350
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,660
Excuse me.

351
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,540
Here comes the water.

352
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,700
Here comes the water.

353
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,020
I'll buy you water.

354
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,820
Come on.

355
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,820
I'll buy you water.

356
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,140
Excuse me.

357
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:19,660
It's okay.

358
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,260
Take your time.

359
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:20,900
We have water.

360
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,580
Come on.

361
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,380
We have water.

362
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,100
We have water.

363
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,020
You didn't give it to the senior and senior.

364
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,660
You gave me a chance.

365
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,260
I can do it.

366
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,220
It's just water.

367
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,380
I'll give you some later.

368
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,380
You drank it, right?

369
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,300
Why did you drink it?

370
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,540
I drank it when I came here.

371
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,660
Thank you.

372
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,620
Wait.

373
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,420
Give me the water.

374
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,620
Zhu Wei, let's go.

375
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,420
What?

376
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,980
Hello, senior.

377
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,540
Which class are you in?

378
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,500
Wait outside.

379
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,460
No, senior.

380
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,780
I think it's too hot.

381
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,820
I want to give some water to senior and senior.

382
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,380
Senior, have some water.

383
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,660
Senior, thank you.

384
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,940

Computer application technology class.

386
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,060
Where have you been?

387
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,380
The monitor took me to the bathroom.

388
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,180
Nonsense.

389
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,340
Gao,

390
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,460
all the boys are here.

391
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,180
Don't make any trouble later.

392
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,420
One more.

393
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,460
Who?

394
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,180
Li Xun, right?

395
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,620
Who else?

396
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,620
Who is this Li Xun?

397
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,700
He didn't come to the class meeting

398
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,060
and didn't go to the dorm.

399
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,260
Is he sick?

400
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,740
You haven't seen him?

401
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,740
No.

402
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,740
Computer application technology class.

403
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,620
It's us.

404
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,340
Okay.

405
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,380
Now,

406
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,180
I'll call the students by their names.

407
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,180
When you call them,

408
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,940
you'll go in and get the materials.

409
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,380
Please be quiet.

410
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,100
Can you do it?

411
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,220
Yes.

412
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,500
No. 1,

413
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,380
Li Xun.

414
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,580
Is he here?

415
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,740
Take my photo.

416
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,380
Take my photo.

417
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,580
Is Li Xun here?

418
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,780
He's cool.

419
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,780
So cool, right?

420
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,580
Li Xun.

421
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,060
Li Xun.

422
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:54,780
Let's go.

423
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,460
This is yours.

424
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,340
He's so...

425
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,580
Arrogant.

426
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,180
To be honest,

427
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,180
there's a strange guy in our class.

428
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,780
I don't know if he's a good student.

429
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,780
You're just an agent.

430
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,860
Why are you so worried?

431
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,140
Tomorrow is the final election.

432
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,660
I'll be the agent.

433
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,460
I guess no one in our class

434
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,340
is interested in the monitor except you.

435
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,580
Not interested.

436
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,300
I'm just a proud student

437
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,860
who's been working for you.

438
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,700
I got it.

439
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,900
What?

440
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,740
Only you can

441
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,300
make the star of Guai Ming

442
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,140
so clear.

443
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,020
Is that lady making music again?

444
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,300
I guess so.

445
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,180
She doesn't even know the lyrics.

446
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,820
I'll have to learn it from her.

447
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,980
We're all in the same dorm.

448
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,100
Just get used to it.

449
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,740
My arms are so sore.

450
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,100
The air conditioner is my favorite.

451
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,900
Rendie.

452
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,740
Your food is here.

453
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:09,900
Thank you.

454
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:18,780
Here.

455
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,580
What do you want for dinner?

456
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:21,820
Anything.

457
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,380
What's that?

458
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,940
It's the hardest part.

459
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,940
You have to do the math too?

460
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,700
You should take a break.

461
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,340
The fun of university is exploring.

462
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,380
How about we start from

463
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,660
the back door of the street?

464
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,060
Let's eat the canteen.

465
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,660
The textbook says

466
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,620
the canteen is an important experience

467
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,900
of university life.

468
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,020
Here, have a seat.

469
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,620
Here, have a seat.

470
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,620
I want a bowl of rice.

471
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,220
Rice, rice, chicken, meat.

472
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,060
I'll go first.

473
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,540
Okay.

474
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,220
This is good.

475
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,900
Why don't you eat?

476
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,060
I ordered a spicy soup.

477
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,780
There are more than 20 people in line.

478
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,860
I can't eat it in one bite.

479
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,260
Where should we sit?

480
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,140
Sit there.

481
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:03,860
Come here.

482
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,700
I swear.

483
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,580
I only had a drink with He Meiyuan yesterday.

484
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,020
I had a double-eaten dinner.

485
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:10,980
Why didn't you come?

486
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,220
I had a double-eaten dinner.

487
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,340
You can't leave.

488
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,340
You don't believe me?

489
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,500
I called them all.

490
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,500
I believe you.

491
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:17,900
I...

492
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,340
Hey.

493
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,020
Wait for me.

494
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,020
Come here.

495
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,020
Sit here.

496
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,580
How do you know they're leaving?

497
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,300
When I just came in,

498
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,860
I noticed they were arguing.

499
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:37,900
So,

500
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,100
you have to learn to observe life

501
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,500
no matter what you do.

502
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,900
You're right.

503
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:44,780
Do you want soup?

504
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,540
I'll get you a bowl of rice.

505
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,540
Spicy soup has soup.

506
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,460
I'll go change.

507
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,260
You should say hi to bulrush.

508
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,460
You can come back for some.

509
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,340
It's time to go.

510
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,060
Hello.

511
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,740
Mr. Zhang?

512
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,420
I'm not busy.

513
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,420
Classmate, someone is in this seat.

514
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,420
This seat belongs to Fang Shumiao.

515
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,420
Fang Shumiao is the class's class representative. Do you know that?

516
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,420
Is it delicious?

517
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,420
It's okay.

518
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,420
If you want to sit here, I can help you stand here first.

519
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,420
Continue eating.

520
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,420
No, you can sit there.

521
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,420
Who are you?

522
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,420
Zhu Yu, whose meal are you eating?

523
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,420
Mine.

524
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:38,420
I was too idle just now. I put your meal there.

525
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,420
Sorry.

526
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,420
We have the same dish.

527
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,420
How about you eat mine?

528
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,420
Or you can eat the other dishes. I'll treat you.

529
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,420
You just took a job of talking.

530
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,420
Who knows that you made such a big trouble.

531
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,420
You're still laughing.

532
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,420
I'm not laughing.

533
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,420
You can talk. I'll give you this water.

534
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,420
Slow down. Don't choke.

535
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,420
This person is really stubborn.

536
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,420
I eat your meal among the classmates. What's wrong with you eating mine?

537
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,420
At worst, I'll give him the meal first.

538
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,420
Fang Shumiao.

539
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,420
Sit.

540
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,420
Sit.

541
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,420
Li Xun.

542
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,420
Li Xun.

543
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,420
I'm Gao Jianhong.

544
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,420
Everyone calls me Lao Gao.

545
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,420
I'm also from Class One.

546
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,420
We live next door. I live in Class 205.

547
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,420
Li Xun.

548
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,420
Our school's school number is arranged according to the admission score.

549
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,420
I'm No. 2. You're No. 1.

550
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,420
I'm No. 6 in the whole province.

551
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,420
What's your grade?

552
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,420
I'm No. 3.

553
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,420
You're No. 4.

554
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,420
I'm No. 5.

555
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,420
I'm No. 6.

556
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,420
Li Xun.

557
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,420
Li Xun.

558
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,420
Li Xun.

559
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,420
Li Xun.

560
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,420
Li Xun.

561
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,420
Well...

562
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,420
Take your time.

563
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,420
I'll wait outside for you to go back.

564
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,420
I'll wait for you.

565
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,420
I've taken a shower.

566
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,420
You've taken a shower?

567
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,420
I think you like programming.

568
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,420
Me too.

569
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,420
I liked playing computer when I was in middle school.

570
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,420
I joined the programming association in high school.

571
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,420
We can communicate more in the future.

572
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,420
You seem to be not very talkative.

573
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,420
The programming method is developing too fast now.

574
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,420
Like Java and PHP.

575
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,420
They're all a little bit confusing.

576
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,420
I think it's hard to get through so many languages

577
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,420
no matter how capable a person is.

578
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,420
So I decided to set up a programming interest group.

579
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,420
Are you interested?

580
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,420
No.

581
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,420
Li Xun, just give us a chance to learn from you.

582
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,420
The best way to learn is to keep learning.

583
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,420
I...

584
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,420
Am I short?

585
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,420
Hello?

586
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,420
Hello?

587
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,420
Hello?

588
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,420
Hello?

589
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,420
Hello?

590
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,420
Hello?

591
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,420
Hello?

592
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,420
Hello?

593
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,420
Hello?

594
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,420
He's in the hospital?

595
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,420
Is it that serious?

596
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,420
Wait a minute. I'll be there soon.

597
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,420
Li Xun.

598
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,420
Oh, right.

599
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,420
A friend's parents are here.

600
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:44,420
They asked me to help them with the construction of the house in Nanmen Hotel.

601
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,420
312.

602
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,420
I'll ask them to get the house card later.

603
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,420
My buddy has acute gastritis.

604
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,420
I have to go to the hospital to see him.

605
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,420
I'll leave my card with you.

606
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,420
Remember to give it to him.

607
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,420
Gao Jinghong.

608
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,420
Li Xun.

609
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,420
Here's the money.

610
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,420
Why is it you?

611
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,420
Nanmen 312.

612
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,420
What's this?

613
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,420
Look for yourself.

614
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,420
He gave you this house card?

615
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,420
Li Xun is so proactive.

616
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,420
Not bad, Zhu Yu.

617
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,420
What's with your attitude?

618
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,420
Right. You have to have an attitude.

619
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,420
You're not going to open the house right away.

620
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,420
Isn't this a bit of a joke?

621
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,420
Enough.

622
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,420
Everyone's an adult.

623
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,420
Is that necessary?

624
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,420
Did he say anything else?

625
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,420
He only said 312.

626
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,420
You're not going to open the house?

627
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,420
I'm not going to open the house.

628
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,420
I'm going to open the house.

629
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,420
You don't think the new students' manual

630
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,420
will still say everything about your life, do you?

631
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,420
I'm looking at the map.

632
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,420
What if the boys ask you to go to school?

633
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,420
There's really a hotel outside our school.

634
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,420
You're exposed.

635
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,420
You want to go, aren't you?

636
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,420
Here you go.

637
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,420
Take it.

638
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,420
It's okay.

639
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,420
This is your battle gift.

640
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,420
That's right.

641
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,420
Counting our grade.

642
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,420
No.

643
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:30,420
Counting the first grade of the new students.

644
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,420
Show me your hand.

645
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,420
What?

646
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,420
Right hand.

647
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:39,420
I have to see how your love line grows.

648
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,420
According to your pattern.

649
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,420
A brain is a pig.

650
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,420
Wu Mengqing.

651
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,420
You know my name?

652
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,420
Jiang Xiren.

653
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,420
Yes.

654
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,420
My hometown is in the Jianshi Taihe County, Yangling Town, Baihu Gou Village.

655
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,420
And I have a sister.

656
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,420
Okay.

657
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,420
I know you.

658
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,420
When I write codes,

659
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,420
I don't like to be disturbed.

660
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,420
Then you go ahead.

661
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,420
That...

662
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,420
Anything else?

663
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,420
Our class is in the hospital.

664
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,420
She asked me to give you this.

665
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,420
She has a word.

666
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,420
She said, please be careful.

667
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,420
Why don't you urge me?

668
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,420
Sister.

669
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,420
You are not dignified.

670
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,420
You are not generous.

671
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,420
I know you are going to the selection committee.

672
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,420
I didn't know you thought you were going to the blind date.

673
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,420
It's almost ten minutes late.

674
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,420
If I can't be the class monitor because I'm late,

675
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,420
I will do nothing in front of me.

676
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,420
Okay.

677
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,420
Fang Shiming.

678
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,420
You are late for the selection committee.

679
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,420
Don't you want to change the government?

680
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,420
Sorry, Miss Zhang.

681
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,420
She overslept.

682
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,420
Find a seat.

683
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,420
Sit down.

684
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,420
What are you doing?

685
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,420
Sit down.

686
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,420
Sit down.

687
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,420
Miss Zhang is angry.

688
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,420
We are here for a meeting.

689
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,420
The main purpose of the meeting today

690
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,420
is the selection committee.

691
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,420
But before the selection committee,

692
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,420
I want to introduce a classmate to you.

693
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,420
He is not qualified to attend the military training.

694
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,420
Li Xun.

695
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,420
Introduce yourself.

696
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,420
Li Xun.

697
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,420
My name is Li Xun.

698
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,420
I'm the top of the class this year.

699
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,420
You don't know yet.

700
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:36,420
Li Xun is the top of the science this year in our province.

701
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,420
It's him.

702
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,420
He is the top of the class this year in our province.

703
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,420
He chose our profession

704
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,420
to fully show

705
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,420
the prospects of our profession.

706
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,420
It's a piece of cake.

707
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,420
I hope all of you

708
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,420
can cherish this opportunity

709
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,420
and work hard.

710
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,420
You can become a useful talent

711
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,420
in the future.

712
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,420
Okay.

713
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,420
Next, we will select the class.

714
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,420
Fang Shu Miao.

715
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,420
Fang Shu Miao.

716
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,420
Wang Ting.

717
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,420
Fang Shu Miao.

718
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,420
Congratulations, Fang Shu Miao.

719
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,420
You are officially the class monitor

720
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,420
of the first class of the application technology class.

721
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,420
Please rest assured, Mr. Zhang.

722
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,420
Please rest assured, students.

723
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,420
I will continue to work hard

724
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,420
to complete the task given by the department

725
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,420
and serve the students well.

726
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,420
Okay.

727
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,420
Okay.

728
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,420
Fang Shu Miao.

729
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,420
Change the blackboard.

730
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,420
Next,

731
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:50,420
we will select the student committee.

732
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,420
If we want to select

733
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,420
a group of class leaders

734
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:57,420
to be the master and apprentice of the Western Tourism.

735
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,420
The class monitor is

736
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,420
Tang Sanzang.

737
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,420
The student committee is

738
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,420
Sun Wukong.

739
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,420
The life committee is

740
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,420
Sha Sen.

741
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,420
Which class leader is Zhu Bajie?

742
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,420
Please introduce yourself.

743
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,420
Zhu Bajie.

744
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,420
Please introduce yourself.

745
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,420
Bajie.

746
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,420
Zhu Yun.

747
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,420
My name is Zhu Yun.

748
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,420
I graduated from high school from the first grade of Linyang.

749
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,420
Ms. Zhu Yun.

750
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,420
Are you going to see yourself?

751
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,420
Of course.

752
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,420
I won't be late tomorrow.

753
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,420
So strict.

754
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,420
Of course.

755
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,420
Otherwise, I will be deducted from my grades.

756
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:59,420
Our class's

757
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,420
looks like a bad relationship.

758
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,420
It's a big deal.

759
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,420
Zhu Bajie is also named Zhu.

760
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,420
You didn't suffer any loss.

761
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,420
Stop looking.

762
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,420
If you keep looking at him,

763
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,420
you will fall into a dream.

764
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,420
I'm hungry, too.

765
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,420
Good morning.

766
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,420
Good morning.

767
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,420
Why are there two people left?

768
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,420
They didn't come back last night.

769
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,420
It's only been a few days since the school opened.

770
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,420
Why are you so unruly?

771
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,420
Where is Li Xun?

772
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,420
Why didn't he come?

773
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:36,420
He got up early and left.

774
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,420
I didn't see him.

775
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,420
I didn't see him.

776
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,420
I didn't see him.

777
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,420
I didn't see him.

778
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,420
I didn't see him.

779
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,420
He got up early and left.

780
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,420
I thought he was in class.

781
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,420
It's almost five minutes to seven o'clock.

782
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,420
Why hasn't he come yet?

783
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,420
As far as I know,

784
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,420
Li Xun's personality

785
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,420
won't come to the morning self-study.

786
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,420
How can that be?

787
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,420
The students will come to call.

788
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,420
The morning self-study is lacking in love.

789
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,420
You will be deducted from your grade.

790
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,420
I have to call him.

791
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,420
No one answers.

792
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,420
Why didn't he reply to WeChat?

793
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,420
It's normal.

794
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,420
I sent him a lot of messages.

795
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,420
He never replied.

796
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,420
He didn't reply to mine.

797
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,420
He is like a horse.

798
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,420
He replied.

799
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:31,420
Why?

800
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,420
None of your business.

801
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,420
How can he talk?

802
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,420
Not bad.

803
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,420
At least he replied to you.

804
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,420
He didn't reply to me.

805
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,420
You still sent him messages?

806
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,420
I think he is trying to steal my message.

807
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,420
The morning self-study is lacking in love.

808
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,420
You will be deducted from your grade.

809
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,420
Come here.

810
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,420
What's my business?

811
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,420
What's my business?

812
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,420
What's your business?

813
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,420
What's my business?

814
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,420
Li Xun's words

815
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,420
are like a philosopher.

816
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,420
I think he is a philosopher.

817
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,420
He is a philosopher.

818
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,420
He is a philosopher.

819
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,420
Why did you send me messages?

820
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,420
No.

821
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,420
Someone.

822
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,420
Give me your phone.

823
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,420
I don't have his WeChat.

824
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,420
Gao.

825
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,420
He didn't reply to Gao's messages.

826
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,420
He didn't reply to our messages.

827
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,420
He is not normal.

828
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,420
Is he coming to the morning self-study?

829
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,420
I think it's too late.

830
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,420
Hello, senior.

831
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,420
Everyone is here.

832
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,420
Start to make a name.

833
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,420
I hope that we students will follow the school rules

834
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,420
to maintain the honor of the class.

835
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,420
Li Xun.

836
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,420
Li Xun, No.1.

837
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,420
Ren Di, No.2.

838
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,420
What?

839
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,420
Pick one.

840
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,420
There are only two morning self-study and self-study.

841
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,420
We are responsible for one person.

842
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,420
We are responsible for one person.

843
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,420
What should I choose?

844
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,420
I am not the monitor.

845
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,420
I am the one who takes the first step.

846
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,420
There is no hurry.

847
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:18,420
I will treat you to the barbecue.

848
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,420
You can eat it.

849
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,420
It's expensive.

850
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,420
I don't want to eat it.

851
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,420
You don't want to eat Tanggong, do you?

852
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,420
I will eat it if you don't.

853
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,420
I will eat it.

854
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,420
I will eat Ren Di.

855
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,420
I will take care of Ren Di.

856
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,420
I will give you Li Xun's morning self-study.

857
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,420
Senior said that

858
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,420
if you lack affection,

859
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,420
you will get a minus point every day.

860
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,420
What does it have to do with me?

861
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,420
You don't want to

862
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,420
interact with Li Xun

863
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,420
and eliminate misunderstandings.

864
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,420
What does it have to do with you?

865
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,420
Can you bear to see my national award,

866
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,420
my scholarship,

867
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,420
my insurance and my name on it?

868
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,420
Don't even think about it.

869
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,420
I will never say a word to this person.

870
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,420
I will never say a word to this person.

871
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,420
I will take care of it.

872
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:03,420
We won't be separated

873
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:07,420
Escape from the noisy world

874
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,420
Accompany me

875
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:14,420
Is your new destination

876
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:17,420
Raise me up bravely

877
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:21,420
Like the flame of the night

878
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:32,420
Cause I believe I love you

879
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:36,420
True love will take its course

880
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:41,420
I am by your side

881
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:45,420
Spending a long time with you

882
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:50,420
Cause I believe I want you

883
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:54,420
True love will take its course

884
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:58,420
That burning fire

885
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:07,420
You are always the one to watch over it

886
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:12,420
It's the sense of dream

887
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:17,420
Breaking through the barrier

888
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:22,420
A night of first love

889
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:25,420
Then it's a night of nightfall

890
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:30,420
Then it's a night of nightfall

891
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:34,420
Then it's a night of nightfall

892
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:37,480
Irezawa

893
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,420
Justís Harry

894
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:41,420
Irregardless of how many years

895
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:46,420
I lost the world for myself

896
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,480
Always hostile

897
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,920
Unstopped

898
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,420
I also

899
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:55,420
When I sat next to you

900
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,420
Only in the learn

901
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:59,420
Every time I had

902
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:00,420
a dream

903
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:05,420
Because I believe I love you

904
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:09,420
True love will take its course

905
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:14,420
I'm by your side

906
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:18,420
Spending a long time with you

907
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:23,420
Because I believe I want you

908
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:27,420
True love will take its course

909
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:32,420
Even the hottest fireworks

910
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:42,420
You are always there for me

911
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:47,420
Because I believe I love you

912
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:52,420
True love will take its course

913
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:57,420
I'm by your side

914
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:01,420
Spending a long time with you

915
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:05,420
Because I believe I want you

916
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:10,420
True love will take its course

917
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:14,420
Even the hottest fireworks

918
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:23,420
You are always there for me

919
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:27,420
Oh oh oh

920
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:32,420
Even the hottest fireworks

921
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:39,420
You are always there for me
