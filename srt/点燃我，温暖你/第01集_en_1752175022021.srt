YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't believe anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if the world breaks into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Even if the light is very white

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I want to be there

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless emotion

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day, the end is a little bit yellow

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am the light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast world?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I burn up the night just for you

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This is how everything looks like at first

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am the light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The wind and the color of the sky are like a wild grass

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The most ancient cliff in the mountain

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You are still by my side

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Everything is how it looks at first

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The King of Blaze

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Episode 1

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The first class of application technology for computer engineering

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Li Xun

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Is Li Xun here?

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Li Xun

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Dream

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Dream

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The person who betrays is in hell

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Just take it as I betrayed you

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Anyway, this kind of thing is nothing to me

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It doesn't matter if it's really in hell

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I am experienced

32
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I have never loved you

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Nothing

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,680
I'm going in

35
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,040
You can just count on me

36
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,480
Great

37
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,280
icing on the cake

38
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,920
I want my cat

39
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,180
I didn't think sumi will mouth

40
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:27,700
Look so much

41
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,900
What's the matter

42
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,760
I dreamed

43
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
in two hours

44
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's expected to arrive in two hours

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We're almost home

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Be happy

47
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Be careful

48
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Xiu Zhu

49
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Why are you free this time?

50
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I came back this time

51
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'll be back with Zhu Yu

52
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
after I've done something

53
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
By the way, aunt and uncle

54
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
My parents

55
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
asked me to bring you

56
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
some gifts

57
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Why are you so polite?

58
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'll sign the visa

59
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
with your uncle

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Go and see them

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
No problem

63
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Okay, get in the car

64
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Last year

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
from Shanghai to Linyang

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I drove another high speed

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So I'm going back soon

68
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It will arrive in two hours

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The country has changed a lot

70
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I haven't been back for two or three years

71
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I feel like I don't know

72
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
many places

73
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yes

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
No

75
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yue Yue, look

76
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
There

77
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
we will build a playground

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Okay

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Okay

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
See?

81
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's great

82
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's really thoughtful

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Great

84
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yue Yue

85
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's not washed

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's okay to eat a bad stomach

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So many dishes

88
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What's the situation

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
between you two?

90
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Friends

91
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What kind of friends?

92
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Ordinary

93
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
can't be ordinary friends

94
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What do you think?

95
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What do you think?

96
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Brother Xiu Zhu always

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
runs in different countries

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I've been busy

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
with my work all year

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I haven't seen him for several times

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You're not young

102
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You're already 25

103
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
People

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
at every stage

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
have to do things at every stage

106
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You have to study hard

107
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
when you go to school

108
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
After graduation

109
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
you will find a job

110
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You can't live in a family

111
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm relieved

112
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
about your job

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You should focus on your strategy

114
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I think

115
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Xiu Zhu has good conditions

116
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You think

117
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
he has bad grades

118
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
He was a kid

119
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I think Xiu Zhu

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
is kind and considerate

121
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
This kind of considerate

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
is not something

123
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
anyone can do

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Take this

125
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
and go to the police station

126
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
to get your certificate

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Your stuff

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Keep it safe

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Let's go

130
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I don't know how you've been there

131
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't know how I've been there

132
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
This feels so okay

133
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I've been gone so long

134
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm sorry

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm sorry

136
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000

00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,560
Thanks Get some rest

221
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,840
stubborn

222
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,120
the iron is yeah

223
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,160
but

224
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,360
everything

225
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,480
young

226
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,480
no

227
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,760
understanding

228
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,960
in my audience

229
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,960
I've been to this company.

230
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,280
It was only in the city center

231
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,080
that it was renovated.

232
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,680
It's very good.

233
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,520
When are we going?

234
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,040
Tomorrow.

235
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,520
What do you need me for?

236
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,280
The well-known game company in China,

237
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,960
LP, is about to be launched.

238
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,120
We have interviewed

239
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,320
the chairman of LP, Gao Jianhong.

240
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,240
At this point,

241
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,240
our LP has always been a target.

242
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,160
It keeps increasing

243
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,360
its innovative competitiveness.

244
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,880
The game market in China

245
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,880
is very competitive.

246
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,880
It's very competitive.

247
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,680
The game market in China

248
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,520
will not change

249
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,000
in the next few years.

250
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,320
The head of the team

251
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,440
has already taken the lead.

252
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,320
Many new teams and companies

253
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,240
want to get into the game.

254
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,240
It's a bit more difficult.

255
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
I'll go to Gao Jianhong.

256
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,480
Okay, wait a minute.

257
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,480
Okay, okay.

258
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,680

259
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,520
no

260
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:34,960
Break

00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:36,960

262

open

263
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,520
We've already

264
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,720
talked to two candle ranners.

265
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,440
The price has raised to the highest.

266
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,880
They still don't sell it.

267
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,560
We'll talk about it later.

268
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,720
What about the price?

269
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,520
Whatever they say,

270
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,720
cannot make

271
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,720
Add the sauce

272
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
Add the sauce

273
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
Add the sauce

274
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,720
Add the sauce

275
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,720

277
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,720
Add the sauce

278
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,720
Add the sauce

279
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,720
Add the sauce

280
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,720
Add the sauce

281
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,720
Add the sauce

282
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,720
Add the sauce

283
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,720
Add the sauce

284
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
Add the sauce

285
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,720
The Best Cooking in the World

286
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,720
Episode 15

287
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
Here we are. This is it.

288
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,720
I'll take you in.

289
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,720
I can go by myself.

290
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,720
Yuan Di?

291
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,720
Yuan Di?

292
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,720
Yuan Di?

293
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,720
Yuan Di?

294
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,720
Yuan Di?

295
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,720
Yuan Di?

296
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,720
Yuan Di?

297
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,720
Dad, I'm here.

298
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,720
Dad.

299
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,720
Why are you so loud?

300
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,720
Why are you so loud?

301
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,720
The door is not locked.

302
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,720
You can't be a little safe.

303
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,720
I don't even remember how I came back yesterday.

304
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,720
I don't even remember how I came back yesterday.

305
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,720
Don't run. Don't run.

306
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,720
What?

307
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,720
I said you forgot the new water. I saw it.

308
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,720
Then you get up and take a bath.

309
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,720
I came back this time.

310
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,720
My mom only gave me three days. I only gave you one day.

311
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
I'll wait for you outside.

312
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,720
Okay.

313
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720
Did you see the LP building when you came?

314
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
It's so cool.

315
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
Now LP is also

316
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
the top game in China.

317
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,720
They're all monopolizing the industry.

318
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
They have several games in their company.

319
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,720
They all copy foreign games.

320
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,720
They copy everything. One after another.

321
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
And they sell better than others.

322
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,720
You don't even know these?

323
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
I don't care about these since I went abroad.

324
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
I don't care about these since I went abroad.

325
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
Zhu Yun,

326
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,720
LP is also your hard work.

327
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
It's okay if men don't want it.

328
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,720
You can also put down this company.

329
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,720
You can also put down this company.

330
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,720
It's not related to me.

331
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,720
I want to drink.

332
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,720
Okay.

333
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
Just pick whatever you want.

334
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,720
Okay.

335
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,720
When did you come out?

336
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,720
Did you cut it?

337
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
What's your plan in the future?

338
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,720
Since you're out,

339
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,720
live a good life.

340
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,720
Don't make the same mistakes again.

341
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
You're doing well in the company.

342
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,720
You're doing well in the company.

343
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,720
President Gao.

344
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,720
I'm sorry.

345
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,720
I'll talk to you later.

346
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,720
I'll talk to you later.

347
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,720
I'll talk to you later.

348
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,720
You're here today

349
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,720
to find me, right?

350
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,720
I don't like to go around.

351
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
I don't like to go around.

352
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
Just say it.

353
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,720
If Li Xun didn't go in,

354
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
LP wouldn't

355
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,720
be in this situation.

356
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,720
In this situation?

357
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,720
Isn't it good now?

358
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,720
I remember what you said.

359
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
LP's vision is

360
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,720
to increase the probability of cancer.

361
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,720
Listen.

362
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,720
It's all his ideal.

363
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,720
But the reality is

364
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,720
as long as you're shameless,

365
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,720
you can do it.

366
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
When Li Xun comes out,

367
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,720
he'll get what he wants.

368
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
Maybe like he said,

369
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720
he's the kind of person.

370
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,720
He may not have a choice.

371
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,720
Think about it.

372
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,720
When Li Xun went in,

373
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,720
he could only entrust the company to Gao Jianhong.

374
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,720
When you were in school,

375
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,720
you were the top three.

376
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,720
You trusted him the most.

377
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,720
I advise you to seize this opportunity.

378
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,720
After all, we won't have

379
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,720
too many opportunities to meet in the future.

380
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
I'll ask you one last time.

381
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
What do you want?

382
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,720
What's going to happen in the future

383
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,720
is your own business.

384
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,720
We've been friends for so many years.

385
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,720
We'll have a deal today

386
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,720
to make you

387
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,720
have a serious day.

388
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
Tell me.

389
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,720
I'll never return the money.

390
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,720
Gao Jianhong,

391
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,720
listen to me.

392
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,720
Listen.

393
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,720
The betrayer

394
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,720
has to pay a price.

395
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,720
What's up?

396
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,720
Okay.

397
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,720
Let's eat first.

398
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,720
I can guess a miracle

399
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
even if you don't say it.

400
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,720
You can't blame anyone for this.

401
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,720
The whole world is the same.

402
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,720
You know, when I first came out,

403
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,720
my parents didn't recognize me.

404
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,720
Your old classmate is nothing.

405
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,720
All friends are bullshit.

406
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,720
The more you call, the more you sell.

407
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,720
Why don't you go with me?

408
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,720
We've lived in the same building.

409
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,720
I've been out for more than a month.

410
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
I've been waiting for you.

411
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,720
I can help you

412
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,720
with whatever you want.

413
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,720
I'm willing to follow you

414
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,720
because I recognize you.

415
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,720
With our technology,

416
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,720
as long as there's a keyboard and a network,

417
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
we can make a lot of money.

418
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,720
I don't want this.

419
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,720
What do you want?

420
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,720
It's not worth it to be with this kind of person.

421
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,720
We're in the same boat.

422
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,720
Do you still deserve it?

423
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,720
I just realized that

424
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,720
if we go abroad, we can still get revenge for you.

425
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
The key problem now is

426
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
you've been out of this industry for so long.

427
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,720
You want to use the right means to take down

428
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,720
such a big company.

429
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,720
There's a simpler way.

430
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,720
Why don't you try it?

431
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,720
Stop eating.

432
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,720
These people are not worth my hiding.

433
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
I'm not used to being simple.

434
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,720
It doesn't matter if it's hard or not.

435
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
What matters is that I have to let these people know

436
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,720
what they have to pay for.

437
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,820
Zanti.

438
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,900
I've always Medical Student's

439
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,500
One scare

440
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,180
you

441
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,780
me

442
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,720
Yea

443
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,620
What are you mini

444
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,300
since

445
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,720
I was in쳤

446
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,380
fundamentals

447
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,840
He hascial

448
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,500
okay

449
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,100
He doesn't eat

450
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:08,700
Take a bath

451
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,620
Take care, bye

452
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,060
the

453
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,820
I'm not kidding

454
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,060
I'm talking

455
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:22,760
you know

456
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,940
What does this thing look like

457
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,340
A repeater

458
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,780
While you are planning

459
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,140
some tricks

460
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,980
you can act on

461
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,260
Get out of here

462
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,540
What's up?

463
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,300
Something

464
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,180
you forgot to bring back?

465
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:31,060
to be able to travel around and through that world.

466
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,200
Transenas that can still be seen

467
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,900
что он nonsense о ей от regeneration

468
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:42,160
again and again.

469
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,300
So how is it?

470
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,820
What do you mean by that?

471
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,880
The important thing is that

472
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,720
no matter how powerful pressing he gets,

473
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,080
to run this management system

474
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,840
You run the system and control yourself?

475
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,320
Good

476
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,800
You're really something

477
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,320
Are you still used to it?

478
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,480
Zhu Yun knows...

479
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,480
Zhu Yun just left me

480
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,480
He probably doesn't know

481
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,200
You don't want to see him?

482
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:18,840
No

483
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,120
I'm here to see you today

484
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,720
for something else

485
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,480
What is it?

486
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,000
Do you remember what we said

487
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,240
at the bar?

488
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,440
Xin Xin

489
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,560
Thank you, everyone

490
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,080
We are the Qinghong band

491
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,920
Do you invest in us?

492
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,120
You invested in us

493
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,400
You're our boss

494
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,920
You'll have your shares after the band

495
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,680
After the band has the profit

496
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,240
we'll return the back rate to you

497
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,560
You're here for money

498
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,560
You're here for money

499
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,720
You're here for money

500
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,880
to ask me for money?

501
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,520
Yes

502
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,760
Li Xun

503
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,880
Gao Jianhong and you

504
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,280
are going to be listed

505
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,800
You'll be listed on the financial list

506
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,560
You care about my money?

507
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,920
Who doesn't want the money?

508
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,640
Fine

509
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,680
I'll give you all

510
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,400
to make up for it

511
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,360
a few times

512
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,280
Is that enough?

513
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,760
I didn't expect that

514
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,360
we only have money

515
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,280
Zhu Yunqin is right

516
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,880
You're always like this

517
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,160
But you can't tell Zhu Yun

518
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,280
Don't disturb his happiness

519
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,080
Do you remember

520
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,360
the group of all-time stars?

521
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,440
He came back with Zhu Yun

522
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,200
You don't believe it?

523
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,440
They came back

524
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,320
for the wedding

525
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,200
Are you done?

526
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,440
I don't have my money

527
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,600
Give me a number

528
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,600
I'll transfer it to you tomorrow

529
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,200
See you

530
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,640
Mr. Tian Xiuzhu

531
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,480
Mr. Tian Xiuzhu

532
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,440
as an outstanding local artist

533
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,440
has added his most representative work

534
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,480
Li Xun to the museum

535
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,560
It's a great addition and addition

536
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,120
to the long-term system of the museum

537
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,000
It also reflects

538
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,440
the attention and deep participation

539
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,840
of the modern art of China

540
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,160
to all kinds of styles

541
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,760
This is all thanks to you

542
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,320
Congratulations

543
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:10,800
moi

544
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:11,840
state

545
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,720
connect

546
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:13,920
to live

547
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,000
Congratulations

548
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,680
Forget my name

549
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,360
Song Yun

550
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,680
Mr. Tian too

551
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,600
Congratulations

552
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,920
Hey voya

553
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,360
Got it

554
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,240
Congratulations

555
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:45,400
it

556
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,680
Six years ago

557
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,160
I went back to the stage

558
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,880
That time

559
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,080
I remember that you at the time

560
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,080
Also before this painting

561
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,000
Stuck

562
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,360
I was thinking

563
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,320
you didn't even reach the storm

564
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,460
In Erqiao

565
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,200
Not cheap

566
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,600
Can actually be

567
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,480
In my picture

568
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,380
stand so quietly

569
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,040
What does that prove

570
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:06,920
Prove what

571
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,920
Lin Xun.

572
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,320
Xun.

573
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,920
Come on, don't look.

574
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,520
Look.

575
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,120
What are you doing?

576
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,720
Keep looking.

577
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,520
Get lost.

578
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,920
Come on, keep looking.

579
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,520
Closer.

580
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,120
Finished?

581
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,920
You can do it abroad.

582
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,720
Don't come back.

583
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:42,920
Your phone in your bag

584
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,920
has been ringing.

585
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,520
It's rare that you got up so early today.

586
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,720
Zhu Yu.

587
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,320
After returning to the other side,

588
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,920
will you come back?

589
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,920
In a short time,

590
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,120
I don't think I will.

591
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,120
Do you have something to do today?

592
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,320
No.

593
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,120
What's wrong?

594
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,120
You bring your artist Tian Da

595
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,120
to help me.

596
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,920
I found a design company

597
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,320
to help me draw album cover.

598
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,720
You let the artist Tian Da

599
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,720
to help me check the goods.

600
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,120
If there is no problem,

601
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,720
just help people to pay the money.

602
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:22,920
This is a hand to pay money.

603
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,120
A hand to pay the goods.

604
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,320
You'd better do it yourself.

605
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,920
I'm a star.

606
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,120
I won't stop

607
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,720
this kind of thing.

608
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,720
Don't talk nonsense.

609
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,320
I'll write a cheque later

610
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,520
and send it to you.

611
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,320
What age is it now?

612
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,520
Can't you transfer the money directly?

613
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,920
No.

614
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,320
Then I have to ask him.

615
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,920
I don't care.

616
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,720
I'm going to

617
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,720
make you two suffer today.

618
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,920
Then please help me

619
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,920
with Tian Da's drawing.

620
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,520
Zhu Yu.

621
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,320
Dress up.

622
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,720
Don't embarrass our band.

623
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,520
I know.

624
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,820
I already paid the money.

625
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,620
I'll withdraw the money.

626
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,620
Please send me the letter.

627
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,120
Let's try the hands.

628
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,820
OK, I'm not interested.

629
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,020
I'm still in this era.

630
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,020
I don't know this story.

631
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,520
But I want to ask you...

632
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,620
are you poor enough

633
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,780
to experience it?

634
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,320
No.

635
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,520
I don't have any type of debt.

636
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,620
I feel quite...

637
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,320
The people in the blue mountains are gone.

638
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,320
You are in the firework.

639
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,320
Li Xun, what kind of person do you think

640
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,320
can be called a princess?

641
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,320
A princess?

642
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,320
Breaking through the border.

643
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,320
First,

644
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,320
A pair of high-pitched eyes.

645
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,320
Then,

646
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,320
A heart that is fragile and fragile.

647
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,320
Look at the stars.

648
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,680
Because I believe I love you

649
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:12,220
To love will take its course

650
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:16,280
By your side, it's me

651
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:20,180
Spending a long time with you

652
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,820
Because I believe I'll be with you

653
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,840
Now every celebrity

654
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,300
Now every celebrity

655
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,040
is paid the Mighty Fine

656
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,440
I told him to transfer money

657
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,880
But he said she has experience

658
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,120
performance

659
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:32,920
performance

660
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,560
The blazing fireworks

661
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,520
You always

662
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,120
For me

663
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,080
Can I try it?

664
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,520
For me

665
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,880
How much is it to draw a copy of your album in China?

666
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,760
It seems to be quite a lot

667
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,280
How about you come back to do this?

668
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,560
I think you are a brilliant person

669
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,160
Very good

670
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,040
I can consider it

671
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,520
Then you eat this

672
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,080
Thank you

673
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,000
Sister, how much is it?

674
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,800
Do you want to see?

675
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,200
No

676
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,720
Look at you

677
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,280
Is it delicious?

678
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,080
delicious

679
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,480
You go to the bathroom

680
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:13,960
it is good

681
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,640
To love will take its course

682
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,880
The blazing fireworks

683
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,640
You always

684
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,400
For me

685
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,760
Can I try it?

686
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,720
The blazing fireworks

687
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,520
You always

688
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,040
For me

689
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,840
Can I try it?

690
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,640
Looking for Li Xun?

691
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,960
Who are you?

692
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,840
Where is Li Xun?

693
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,480
You are his

694
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,440
Friend of the music team?

695
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,560
Thank you

696
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,800
I'm here to get the money

697
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,040
This money is for Li Xun

698
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,160
Little friend

699
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,360
You have to say clearly

700
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,520
Who are you Li Xun?

701
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,880
You are the one who is laughing at me

702
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,480
If you don't want to give the money, just say it directly

703
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,800
I found Li Xun's people

704
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,880
One by one

705
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,600
Where is he?

706
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,360
Mind your own business

707
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:38,920
Li Xun

708
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,800
Little friend

709
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:29,520
What happen?

710
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,480
I

711
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,120
What exactly is Li Xun?

712
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,080
Who are you?

713
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:54,800
Let go

714
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,720
If love is a little bit of a temperature

715
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,720
This dream will automatically come out

716
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,720
After waking up, I'll leave you alone

717
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,720
Don't go

718
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,720
Fate is not a journey

719
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,720
Hold on to my arms

720
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,720
The soul is deep

721
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,720
Let me sink

722
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,720
What is Li Xun?

723
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,720
What is he doing?

724
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,720
What is he doing?

725
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,720
What is he doing?

726
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,720
What is he doing?

727
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,720
What is he doing?

728
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,720
What is Li Xun?

729
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,720
Li Xun's high school entrance examination

730
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,720
is ranked first in our province

731
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,720
This person is too

732
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,720
arrogant

733
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,720
What is this?

734
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,720
South Gate 312

735
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,720
Don't open the door when you come up

736
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,720
I will never say a word to this person

737
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,720
I'm sorry

738
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,720
I'm sorry

739
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,720
I'm sorry

740
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,720
I'm sorry

741
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,720
I'm sorry

742
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,720
I'm sorry

743
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,720
I'm sorry

744
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,720
I'm sorry

745
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,720
I'm sorry

746
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,720
I'm sorry

747
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,720
I'm sorry

748
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,720
I'm sorry

749
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,720
I'm sorry

750
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,720
I'm sorry

751
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,720
I'm sorry

752
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,720
I'm sorry

753
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,720
I'm sorry

754
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,720
I'm sorry

755
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,720
I'm sorry

756
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,720
I'm sorry

757
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,720
I'm sorry

758
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,720
I'm sorry

759
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,720
I'm sorry

760
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,720
I'm sorry

761
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,720
I'm sorry

762
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,720
I'm sorry

763
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,720
I'm sorry

764
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,720
I'm sorry

765
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,720
I'm sorry

766
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,720
I'm sorry

767
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,720
I'm sorry

768
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,720
I'm sorry

769
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,720
I'm sorry

770
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,720
I'm sorry

771
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,720
I'm sorry

772
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,720
I'm sorry

773
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,720
I'm sorry

774
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,720
I'm sorry

775
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,720
I'm sorry

776
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,720
I'm sorry

777
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,720
I'm sorry

778
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,720
I'm sorry

779
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,720
If love is just a cold

780
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,720
This dream will

781
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,720
automatically leave

782
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,720
After coming in, I'll leave you

783
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,720
Don't go

784
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,720
It's not a journey

785
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,720
Grab onto the end of the road

786
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,720
The soul is deep

787
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,720
You are my everything

788
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,720
I can't see

789
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,720
You are my everything

790
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,720
I can't see

791
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,720
You are my everything

792
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,720
I can't see

793
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,720
I care too much about you

794
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,720
The soul is deep

795
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,720
You are my everything

796
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,720
I can't see

797
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,720
You are my everything

798
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,720
I care too much about you
