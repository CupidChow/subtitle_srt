1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Everything is different

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,600
I was once a little shadowless

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,600
I don't believe anyone can save anyone

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,800
Until you break into my world

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,200
Even if the world breaks into darkness

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,000
We will fight in the darkness

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Even if the light is bright

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I will still be there to protect you

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I see the direction of my heart

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Every day, I feel anxious at the end

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Even if I'm blinded by time

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
How can I be alone in this endless night?

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm burning up just for you

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is how everything looks like

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
If I'm the light, the wind and the sun will shine

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The most ancient of the mountains, you're still by my side

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Everything is how it looks like

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The Long Ballad

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You're so good now, aren't you?

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You're so capable

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Zhu Yue, you think you're pretty good?

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm asking you

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I don't understand what you mean

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You don't understand?

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You don't understand what I mean?

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I've been in charge of cooperating with all the universities for so many years

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This is the first time I've seen a bad student like you

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You're good, you're capable, you know everything

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You think I'm a fool?

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I really don't know that students nowadays are so evil

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
They deliberately write about me and make me look bad

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You're still so shameless to be a student

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You're trying to humiliate your seniors

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You dare to do this in school

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You're always good at it

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Zhu Yue, let me tell you

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Your behavior is extremely evil

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It will destroy the school-school cooperation

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Wait and see

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Dean Jia, how old is this student?

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
He can do such a bad thing

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
He must be responsible

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Dean Jia, Zhu Yue is my student

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I can testify for him

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He can't do this kind of thing

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's definitely not a temporary destruction

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm really sorry

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm sorry

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I can't do this kind of thing

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's definitely not a temporary destruction

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The evidence is here

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's not intentional

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You can go back

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Xiaobei

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll investigate this matter

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and give Xin Chuang an explanation

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Thank you, Dean Jia

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Please take care of it

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I can handle Xin Chuang

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's just a punishment

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm not responsible for it

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But this behavior

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
not only ruins our school-school cooperation

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
but also affects the reputation of Nanhu University

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This will have a very bad impact on our school-school cooperation

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It must be severely punished

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Zhang Xiaobei, you're too much

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Zhu Yue just got into the first grade

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You want him to be punished

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Are you going to ruin him forever?

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
He did it on his own

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm not his enemy

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You're the one who stole their project

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Teacher Zhang, don't talk nonsense

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I gave them the opportunity, resources

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
and media coverage

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You said I stole their project

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Where's the evidence?

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You're blackmailing me

80
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Do you want to ruin the school-school cooperation?

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I advise you not to meddle in other people's business

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's not worth it to put yourself in

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
to protect the students

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Hello

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Speak

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What's the situation now?

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Zhang Xiaobei reported to the college

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
that Zhu Yun deliberately wrote the program like that

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
to ruin the school-school cooperation

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
He said he did it on purpose

91
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Zhang Xiaobei has long left a song

92
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
He asked Han Jiakang to memorize

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
every version of Zhu Yun

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Han Jiakang also wrote the name and signed the pressure

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm leaving

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What are you going to do?

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Zhu Yun, how are you?

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What did Zhang Xiaobei promise you?

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Money, project, paper, and national qualification

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Which one?

101
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
He promised to transfer me

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's cheaper than I thought

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Why do you say that?

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Why do you say that?

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm not a man

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Why do you say that?

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Why do you blame me?

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Zhu Yun did it wrong

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Why don't I

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
lie to him in front of him?

111
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What is he?

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I want to apologize to Zhu Yun

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm sorry

114
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Wait for me

115
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Be quick

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You gave it to me so easily

117
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You don't sell it?

118
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
OK

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'll give it to you

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'll give it to you

121
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'll give it to you

122
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'll give it to you

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
OK

124
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I don't care about Zhu Yun

125
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
If I knew you would start from him

126
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I would have saved money

127
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
He came to me to cause trouble

128
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
for you

129
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Look

130
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You young people

131
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You are all ungrateful

132
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You really take yourself as a hero

133
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Who can protect who?

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You are not a hero

135
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You are a hero

136
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You are a hero

137
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What?

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You will regret it

139
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm sorry

140
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm sorry

141
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm sorry

142
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm sorry

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm sorry

144
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm sorry

145
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm sorry

146
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm sorry

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm sorry

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm sorry

149
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm sorry

150
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm sorry

151
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm sorry

152
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm sorry

153
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm sorry

154
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm sorry

155
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm sorry

156
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm sorry

157
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm sorry

158
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm sorry

159
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm sorry

160
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm sorry

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm sorry

162
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm sorry

163
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm sorry

164
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm sorry

165
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm sorry

166
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm sorry

167
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm sorry

168
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Li Xun

169
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Li Xun

170
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Turn around

171
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Turn around

172
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Why are you sitting here?

173
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Take a break

174
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You give the app to Zhang Xiaobei

175
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You were there that day

176
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You heard it

177
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
on the day Zhang Xiaobei was captured

178
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Actually, when you went to her

179
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I already guessed

180
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I just don't want you to know

181
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
that someone heard you

182
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
talking like that

183
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
and saw that scene

184
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Princess

185
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You think I'm a tofu maker

186
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
What are you doing?

187
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Silly

188
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Wasting so much time

189
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
in her place

190
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You're so idle

191
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I don't care

192
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You're the silly one

193
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
How much money do you have

194
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
to sell Zhang Xiaobei?

195
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
That kind of thing

196
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You can't explain it

197
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Ugly

198
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'll tell you

199
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You don't have to

200
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'll tell you

201
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'll tell you

202
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'll tell you

203
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'll tell you

204
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You don't have to

205
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Li Xun

206
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm not a princess

207
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But I'm not a fool

208
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Let's wait and see

209
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:32,100
You don't have to

210
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Gao

211
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Why are you sitting here?

212
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Li Xun

213
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
What's wrong?

214
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Before you make a decision

215
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
can you ask me?

216
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Will you disagree?

217
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Can't you think of other ways?

218
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Have you thought of other ways?

219
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Since the result won't change

220
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
is there any difference between asking or not?

221
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Li Xun

222
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You're not the only one who has this app

223
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I've been working hard for a long time

224
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I just want a word of respect

225
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Is it difficult?

226
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I understand

227
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But this is a emergency

228
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I can't care about it

229
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Honey

230
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
We face people like Zhang Xiaobai

231
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You know

232
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The more you drag us down, the more we are not good

233
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Instead, it's us

234
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
No need to explain to him

235
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Am I right?

236
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm sorry

237
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
This is the last time

238
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
for the sake of saving Zhuyun

239
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You've been here for half an hour

240
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Can he grow a orchid?

241
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Hello

242
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Mom

243
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yanyun

244
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Why did you call so late?

245
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Mom, what are you doing?

246
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Me?

247
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm reading the file

248
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What's wrong?

249
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Nothing

250
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I miss you

251
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I miss you too

252
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
How are you recently?

253
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm fine

254
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm fine

255
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm fine

256
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm fine

257
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm fine

258
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yanyun

259
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Are you busy?

260
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Nothing

261
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I've been working in education for a lifetime

262
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I can tell if you are busy

263
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Tell me what's wrong

264
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Mom

265
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
One of our project's person is responsible

266
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's too strict for students

267
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That's normal

268
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Your base is for projects

269
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You can't be patient like teachers

270
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
like students

271
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
But that's good

272
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You can think about your ability

273
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
If the project is so easy

274
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
how can the next person improve?

275
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Mom, I've dropped very fast

276
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I was the fourth in the class

277
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I dropped to the ninth last time

278
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Why?

279
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Is it difficult?

280
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
No

281
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Why?

282
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Our research institute

283
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
and the school's corporate cooperation center

284
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
an external project director

285
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
asked me to help with the project

286
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I didn't do it well

287
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
because of the time

288
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
He was so angry

289
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Nonsense

290
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
The school's corporate cooperation center

291
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
has nothing to do with your major

292
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's just a burden on the labor

293
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It's a burden on the new students

294
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's too much

295
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
No

296
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
He is a good person too

297
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
He said he would let us have more time

298
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
and exercise

299
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Okay, I see

300
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Don't worry about it

301
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'll let your dad handle it

302
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Tell me

303
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
What's the name of the person in charge?

304
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Zhang Xiaobei

305
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Hello, this way please

306
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Look, Zhu Yingdu has grown so much

307
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
When I was working with your dad

308
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I even hugged you

309
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Yes

310
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You are so small

311
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
How fast

312
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
This way please

313
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Where is your son?

314
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
In the UK

315
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Mr. Qian

316
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Long time no see

317
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Long time no see

318
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Come

319
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's not good to be late

320
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'll drink three cups of wine later

321
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What are you doing here?

322
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Come in

323
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Mr. Wang

324
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Do you remember Zhu?

325
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Of course I remember

326
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Last year, Mr. Zhu helped our company

327
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's a big deal

328
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Mr. Zhu, thank you

329
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's not worth mentioning

330
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I and Zhu are old friends

331
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It's been two or three years

332
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So

333
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
While everyone is free

334
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Let's talk about feelings

335
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
By the way

336
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Also deal with some misunderstandings

337
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Okay, okay

338
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Let's talk while eating

339
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Mr. Qian, Mr. Wang

340
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Mr. Zhu, Mr. Liu

341
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I have something to say

342
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
If you don't say it

343
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I can't eat this

344
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
In that case

345
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Just say it

346
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
First of all

347
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I have to admit my mistake

348
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I was too young

349
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Too impatient

350
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Too impatient

351
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Too eager to make a grade

352
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I made such a mistake

353
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But please believe me

354
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I have no malice

355
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
My original intention is good

356
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Zhu Yun participated in before

357
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
The project of Lan Guan Company

358
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
His level got everyone's approval

359
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I was too anxious

360
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And bad temper

361
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
So with him

362
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
In communication

363
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
There was a big problem

364
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Zhu Yun sister

365
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I sincerely apologize to you

366
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I was too much

367
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Really very sorry

368
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I am engaged in education

369
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I know there are many universities now

370
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Like to cooperate with enterprises

371
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Originally

372
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
This is a good thing

373
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Can provide these students

374
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Some social practice opportunities

375
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
But

376
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Some corporate staff

377
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Not to mention business ability

378
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
This moral quality

379
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It's also quite low

380
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
In their eyes

381
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Students have become cheap labor

382
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
They rely on the miracle of life

383
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Permanent welfare

384
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Press students

385
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
For the benefit

386
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Nothing is more than a miracle

387
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Not to mention the impact on children's graduation

388
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
There are even individuals

389
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Will use work

390
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Insult students' personality

391
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
This is too much

392
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I know now

393
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
The school is under great pressure

394
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
The pressure of the enterprise is also great

395
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
So, Mr. Wang

396
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You are also a big company

397
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Business is very important

398
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
If you say because of this

399
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
If affected

400
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Don't know

401
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Mr. Zhu is right

402
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
After going back

403
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I will let them check

404
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Must be checked

405
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Xiao Zhang

406
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Mr. Zhang

407
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Anyway

408
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
In front of so many people

409
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Pour a little girl

410
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And the water is poured on the face

411
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
This behavior itself

412
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Not very civilized

413
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Yes Yes Yes

414
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So

415
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I

416
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Express my attitude

417
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
This matter

418
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It's true that I'm not monitoring enough

419
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I have direct responsibility

420
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
This cup

421
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I will punish myself

422
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
it is good

423
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
it is good

424
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Zhu Yu sister

425
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I give you a gift

426
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
disgust

427
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Must be someone bullied you

428
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
What if I bully others

429
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
That's good

430
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Not bad

431
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Won't be

432
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Jia Datian

433
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I exchange it

434
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I have enough

435
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Every situation

436
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Every performance

437
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I really like

438
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Every extreme

439
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I like

440
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,200
I'm not guilty.

441
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,640
I just think

442
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,560
if I win with my own ability,

443
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,080
I'll feel better.

444
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,120
Everyone is his family,

445
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,360
birth,

446
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,240
and the collection of human resources.

447
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,760
These are all the skills you talk about.

448
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,080
He's also used by the company to suppress you.

449
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,400
But I don't want to be like him.

450
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,280
Sometimes,

451
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,640
you suddenly look down on yourself.

452
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,960
Never.

453
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,840
You're just too high-profile.

454
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,640
The bad guys have their own bad guys.

455
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,640
Look at Han Jiakang.

456
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,040
He's bullied like that.

457
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,440
Just take it as a warning.

458
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
心情 Early

459
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,080
I've promised.

460
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,040
Yes.

461
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,800
I'm coming.

462
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,720
Her Highness is really good.

463
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,240
Doesn't he work?

464
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,000
Yes.

465
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm sorry.

466
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,480
Tell me first if you need anything.

467
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,120
Don't make trouble.

468
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,840
You too.

469
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,480
Tell me first if you need anything.

470
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,520
Don't make trouble.

471
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Your Highness.

472
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,960
Why do you call me Your Highness?

473
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,520
What should I call you then?

474
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,320
Honey.

475
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,680
Honey.

476
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,000
That Sun Suolan is not good.

477
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,320
You can go to her next afternoon.

478
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,000
I got it.

479
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,920
The app is not selling.

480
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,400
Sell it.

481
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,000
It's back.

482
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,880
What do you mean?

483
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,600
Ask the princess.

484
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,600
You're crazy.

485
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,200
Send me the progress.

486
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,120
I'm too worried.

487
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,240
I have to hurry up.

488
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,880
Don't worry, childe...

489
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,440
If you don't hurry up,

490
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,560
you won't be safe.

491
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,840
The king soon comes,

492
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,480
and has you to be his man.

493
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,680
I 천Changerin make myself angry.

494
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,840
I watched Gao gloss through the efforts

495
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,520
in the long-at-叙 app 우리는

496
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,740
lynnovamente

497
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,880
And he has monsters in arable?

498
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,440
But it has become

499
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,800
a tool for us to break the trust you keep.

500
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,600
Can you stop rubbishing me?

501
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,120
Li Xun can sell it.

502
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,760
I also apologized to Gao.

503
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,840
He said he was just angry.

504
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,840
But these days at the base,

505
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,360
I can clearly feel that he is not so enthusiastic about the project.

506
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,800
Li Xun does whatever he wants.

507
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,440
He doesn't say a word.

508
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,720
To be honest,

509
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,840
I also have this factor when I quit the base.

510
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,840
Li Xun is powerful.

511
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,000
But with him,

512
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,840
you have to put down all self-esteem.

513
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,040
I can't wait to be humble and fall into the dust.

514
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,120
Is it worth it?

515
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,960
He's not so inhuman, is he?

516
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,040
That's for you.

517
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,120
Let's put it this way.

518
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,200
Li Xun usually wants to scan the software.

519
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,960
He will never show mercy to anyone.

520
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,480
Only if he lets you go,

521
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,960
you are Li Xun's bug.

522
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,920
What are you doing?

523
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,760
The princess is still walking to school by herself.

524
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,440
By the way,

525
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,040
the school just sent a notice that

526
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,440
the dance classroom outside is forced to be renovated.

527
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,640
The gym and dance that was previously on the inside

528
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,840
can't be on it.

529
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,240
What do you want to learn?

530
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,240
Whatever.

531
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,440
Then I'll help you choose.

532
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,120
Junior.

533
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,760
I'm here to apologize to you.

534
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,880
You still think about that?

535
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,400
I've said it's okay.

536
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,320
I didn't plan to hide it from Xiaobei.

537
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,800
It's two different things.

538
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,240
I don't think I'm a man.

539
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,840
I look down on myself.

540
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,280
I'm sorry.

541
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,680
I shouldn't frame my friend

542
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,880
with my conscience.

543
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,800
If you still think I'm your friend...

544
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,240
Then I'll be your friend.

545
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,240
I'll be your friend.

546
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,680
Of course.

547
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,120
I'm going back to my hometown.

548
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,600
Senior.

549
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,400
You're so good at it.

550
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,080
Are you really leaving?

551
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,160
I want to change my life style.

552
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,800
Actually, I don't like Biancheng at all.

553
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,320
My parents are not in good health.

554
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,880
The fish pond in my family is also half dead.

555
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,440
Actually,

556
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,960
I started to choose computer science as a major.

557
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,840
I just think Biancheng has a high income.

558
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,120
I want to make more money and help my family.

559
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,120
It's been so many years.

560
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,560
I don't have money.

561
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,160
I'm not happy at all.

562
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,400
I'm just wasting my life.

563
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,520
I'd rather go back to my hometown

564
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,640
and help my parents run the fish pond.

565
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,680
I booked the ticket for noon.

566
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,480
I should go.

567
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,080
Old Han.

568
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,120
What can I do for you?

569
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,000
Thank you.

570
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,720
Zhao Xiaobei's case is over.

571
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,080
Xingchuang took the initiative to expose him to the media.

572
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,600
Zhao Xiaobei turned his back on Li Lezhi.

573
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,000
He became the back-up of the famous Zhao Zhu.

574
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,680
The research institute finally closed its chapter.

575
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:26,640
I didn't think Esper would do that.

576
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,320
I think it's good that

577
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

578
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

579
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

580
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

581
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

582
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

583
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

584
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

585
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

586
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

587
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

588
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

589
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

590
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

591
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

592
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

593
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

594
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

595
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

596
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

597
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

598
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

599
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

600
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

601
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,320
I hear the most exciting heartbeat

602
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,320
and the only remaining sun

603
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,320
Brother Six, you cut your hair?

604
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,320
Yes, it's too inconvenient.

605
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,320
And someone said it's not good-looking.

606
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,320
What?

607
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,320
The boss asked you to sing again?

608
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,320
Someone ordered a order.

609
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,320
Let's welcome it.

610
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,320
This thing.

611
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,320
OK, OK, OK.

612
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,320
No problem.

613
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,320
OK.

614
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,320
The toilet is blocked. Go and have a look.

615
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,320
OK.

616
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,320
Why is the toilet blocked?

617
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,320
I'll go and have a look.

618
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,320
Shut up.

619
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,320
Brother Wang.

620
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,320
Little Six is from my band.

621
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,320
He came here to perform with me.

622
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,320
He didn't sweep the floor and go to the toilet.

623
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,320
You don't look at it.

624
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,320
Is there anyone watching your show?

625
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,320
Didn't he promise to come back for free

626
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,320
to be a cleaner and go to the toilet?

627
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,320
Can you come back?

628
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,320
Besides, your broken band

629
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,320
can't even sell tickets.

630
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,320
And you wasted my position.

631
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,320
You're so shy.

632
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,320
Come out.

633
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,320
Listen to me.

634
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,320
Come out.

635
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,320
Are you crazy?

636
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,320
I...

637
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,320
I did this

638
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
to make our band perform here.

639
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,320
Who do you want to touch?

640
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,320
You touched yourself.

641
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,320
I just think you're a bitch.

642
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,320
I didn't.

643
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,320
I just want to be nice to you.

644
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,320
I don't need it.

645
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,320
Do I need you to be nice to me?

646
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,320
I tell you.

647
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,320
If you can't focus on being a band

648
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,320
and do this disgusting thing again,

649
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,320
get out of here.

650
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,320
My band doesn't need a cleaner.

651
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,320
I worked hard to perform.

652
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,320
It's just the money for you to sweep the toilet, right?

653
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,320
I like you, Ren Di.

654
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,320
But I don't like you.

655
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,320
I tell you.

656
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,320
I can never fall in love with a man

657
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,320
because of my feelings.

658
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,320
I won't like you no matter how you change.

659
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,320
Don't say you cut your hair.

660
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,320
It's useless to cut your hair.

661
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,320
Do you understand?

662
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,320
Do you understand?

663
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,320
I don't.

664
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,320
Don't ever change yourself for others.

665
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,320
It's not worth it.

666
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,320
I just want to be with you.

667
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,320
I don't know what to do.

668
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,320
I don't want to be with you.

669
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,320
I don't want to be with you.

670
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,320
Jun Yan.

671
00:32:50,320 --> 00:33:20,320
I'm

672
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,240
like others?

673
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,640
Not really.

674
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,440
But it's not the same thing.

675
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,360
Don't you want to eat?

676
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,480
I don't deserve it.

677
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,200
The relationship between productivity and production

678
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,400
is two aspects

679
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,600
that social production cannot be separated.

680
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,640
Mr. Zhang,

681
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,240
I'm Zhu Yun's mother.

682
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,960
Are you in the office?

683
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:50,960
Yes.

684
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,240
Zhu Yun's mother, don't worry.

685
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,560
Zhu Yun did very well

686
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,000
in school.

687
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,480
He's very smart.

688
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,920
But the class representative is also very responsible.

689
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,840
His grades have always been the top of the class.

690
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,240
Actually, I'm not worried about his studies.

691
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,080
As long as he doesn't skip the class,

692
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,760
he should be fine

693
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,720
in the future,

694
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,320
whether he's in the health care or abroad.

695
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,680
You have a good vision.

696
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,880
He's a freshman.

697
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,360
You should help him plan, okay?

698
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,920
As a parent,

699
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,680
you should know your direction.

700
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,560
You should help him adjust the direction at any time.

701
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,160
Have you asked Zhu Yun's plan?

702
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,200
He's still young.

703
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,080
It's too simple to ask a question.

704
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,800
Of course,

705
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,920
our parents should be the ones to take care of these big things.

706
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,160
Mr. Zhang,

707
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,240
is there any boy

708
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,520
who is closer to you

709
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,120
in school recently?

710
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,080
The university is not like high school.

711
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,320
The class director

712
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,000
doesn't stay with the students every day.

713
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,160
Besides, they've been together for a long time.

714
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,800
I think some things

715
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,320
are normal.

716
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,800
You're a grown-up,

717
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,200
but you're still immature.

718
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,480
I don't actually

719
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,000
object to children's love.

720
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,080
But love should be beautiful.

721
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,960
Our Zhu Yun is simple.

722
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,680
I'm afraid he might lose to someone.

723
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,120
But the child has grown up.

724
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,160
He has to walk on his own.

725
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,000
As parents,

726
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,320
we should

727
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,320
trust and respect them.

728
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,520
Okay, Mr. Zhang.

729
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,120
I won't bother you then.

730
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,920
I'll go to the classroom.

731
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,720
Okay, I'll take you there.

732
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,160
He should be at the base.

733
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,680
Okay, thank you.

734
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,400
The basis of exchange value.

735
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,320
Exchange value is the form of value.

736
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,120
The proportion of the goods

737
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,920
is determined by the exchange.

738
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,760
It's not the value of the goods,

739
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,760
but the value.

740
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,200
The value is the basis of exchange value.

741
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,880
Exchange value is the form of value.

742
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,960
This is the exchange value.

743
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,720
Let's eat.

744
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,280
You can't say that in front of me.

745
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,720
The value is the exchange value.

746
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,720
The exchange value is the exchange value.

747
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,040
The exchange value is the exchange value.

748
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,360
I'm sorry.

749
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,440
The exchange value is the exchange value.

750
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,320
It's getting cold.

751
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,760
Stay warm.

752
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,920
I'm sorry.

753
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,540
The reason why the products of the practical value group...

754
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,340
...can be exchanged according to a certain proportion...

755
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,760
...is that they have value.

756
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,340
The value of the product is in the specified order.

757
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:45,700
Do you have one that has an adequate model to

758
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,500
....

759
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,320
...spend 3,000 yuan on?

760
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,600
Ha tattooing.

761
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,880
You struck me first.

762
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,120
I've been reviewing Ma Yuan. You always interrupt me.

763
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,560
Only recently, I've guruk great on переж lanlike.

764
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,880
The whole quiet learning competition I've done.

765
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,760
I even failed any Ma Yuan classes.

766
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,580
I probably will clamp down when you study.

767
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,580
You have to tell me your reason, big brother

768
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,580
What are you looking at

769
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,580
I have dirty things on my face

770
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,580
Don't move

771
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,580
I am sorry

772
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,580
I am sorry

773
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,580
I am sorry

774
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,580
I am sorry

775
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,580
I am sorry

776
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,580
Zhu Yu

777
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,580
Mom

778
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,580
Zhu Yu, come here

779
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,580
Teacher Zhang

780
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,580
Mom, why are you here

781
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,580
The bureau asked me to come to the meeting temporarily

782
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,580
I have nothing to do at noon

783
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,580
I just said I would come to see you

784
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,580
My mom finally came to see you

785
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,580
Don't bother

786
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,580
Go to eat with your mom

787
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,580
Mom, let's go

788
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,580
You don't take things

789
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,580
Mom

790
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,580
Dad, mom

791
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,580
The canteen will be gone soon

792
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,580
Mom

793
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,580
Yueyue

794
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,580
Your canteen is good

795
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,580
The vegetables are organic

796
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,580
The price is cheap

797
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,580
You should go to the small restaurants

798
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,580
at the door less

799
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,580
I know

800
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,580
I have many classes

801
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,580
I don't have time

802
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,580
to go out

803
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,580
Although you have many classes

804
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,580
it's the easiest period

805
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,580
Once you are in the second or third grade

806
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,580
you should consider your graduation

807
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,580
So I suggest you

808
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,580
to attend more school activities

809
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,580
during the first grade

810
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,580
and gain some experience

811
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,580
Yes

812
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,580
That's your base

813
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,580
Yes

814
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,580
Our base is great

815
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,580
We can make money

816
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,580
in the project

817
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,580
before the first grade

818
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,580
You are in the first grade

819
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,580
Why are you in such a hurry?

820
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,580
No, I mean

821
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,580
we are at the same level

822
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,580
as the outside companies

823
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,580
That boy just now

824
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,580
His name is Li Xun

825
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,580
He is the top professional

826
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,580
He applied for the base

827
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,580
with the school

828
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,580
Are you two close?

829
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,580
Not bad

830
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,580
We were just playing

831
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,580
But Li Xun

832
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,580
you may not know him

833
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,580
I once punished a student

834
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,580
I remember him very well

835
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,580
Do you remember

836
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,580
your 17th birthday?

837
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,580
Who is it?

838
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,580
Are you Director Liu?

839
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,580
What's the matter?

840
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,580
I'm from Lianyang Bazhong

841
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,580
My name is Li Xun

842
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,580
I know you

843
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,580
I did the revision

844
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,580
of the exam

845
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,580
It has nothing to do with others

846
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,580
If you want to fire me

847
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,580
just fire me

848
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,580
The cheating of the exam

849
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,580
is a very serious

850
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,580
misconduct

851
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,580
Neither of you can run away

852
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,580
There is nothing to discuss about this

853
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,580
You should go back

854
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,580
Li Xun

855
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,580
Are you going to drive me away?

856
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,580
I said I didn't need you

857
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,580
Don't you understand?

858
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,580
I'm sorry

859
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,580
Li Xun

860
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,580
Let's add Wei Xin

861
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,580
I'm sorry

862
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,580
Why are you like this?

863
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:14,580
I'm sorry

864
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,580
I'm sorry

865
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:16,580
