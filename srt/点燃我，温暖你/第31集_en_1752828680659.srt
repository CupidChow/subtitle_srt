2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if the light is very bright

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will still watch over that vast vast land

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless atmosphere

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day, the lens is a little bit yellow

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast night?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I burn up the night just for you to remember

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How everything was in the beginning

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The wildness of the wild grass is like a wind

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The mountain is broken but you are still by my side

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Everything is the original look

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The Legend of Chusen

Episode 2

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Wake up

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What time is it?

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What time? It's more than ten o'clock

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's not easy to let me sleep in the weekend

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Why are you lazy to sleep?

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Guests are still treated at noon

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Why don't you go out to eat?

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You haven't eaten enough outside

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Get up

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Did you call Xiu Zhu?

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
No

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Why don't you call her?

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
This is our own family eating

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Why do you call her?

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What is her identity?

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
When you went abroad, she took care of you so much

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Now she is alone in China

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Of course we have to take care of her

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Then you don't have to call her home

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's the New Year

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We have to eat together

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I still owe her a bowl of duck soup

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I knew you didn't call

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So I called

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The child is getting older

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's been a long time

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You are uncle

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yes

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Aunt

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You are

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Aunt

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Look

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We Chinese

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We are most concerned about family

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We are most concerned about family

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
This big family sits together for a meal

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
How nice

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Mom, why do you say this?

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What does it have to do with others?

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Sit together is a family

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If you make a mistake, you will make a joke in the future

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
When is this a family?

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yes, of course it's a family

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Xiu Zhu, we didn't treat her as an outsider since childhood

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Right

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Come come come

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Come come

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Cheers

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Happy happy

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Xiu Zhu

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I heard you are going to have a painting exhibition in France next year

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Take Yueyue with you

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I have invited her

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What, do you agree?

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Go together

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I answer the phone

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This child

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
shy

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Hello

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Hey, Zhu Yue

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Where are you?

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Something big happened

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Don't panic, Zhang Fang

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You make it clear

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Our project is invincible

87
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The backstage is blackened

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Hello

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What's the situation now?

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The armed forces

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Don't worry

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You go home and stay

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I will deal with it

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Hey

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Come here

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You said no problem

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You are going to work

98
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,400
This is the NEST DAT order.

99
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,920
You can read it?

100
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,800
I only know that NEST DAT

101
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,640
is a program that

102
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,480
visits the Internet

103
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,000
and related information in the internal core.

104
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,680
It can provide TCP and UDP monitoring

105
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,120
and related reports

106
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,120
of internal storage management.

107
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,800
This is not just a piece of cake.

108
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,840
You want to track down the attack?

109
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,720
Can you track it down?

110
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,560
No.

111
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,680
It can only show the current connection.

112
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,080
If the other party doesn't attack,

113
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,920
they won't find it.

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,840
What if we make a daily schedule?

115
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,640
The system will automatically send orders

116
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,840
every once in a while.

117
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,800
What if the other party runs into it?

118
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,920
That's not how it works.

119
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,840
You know it?

120
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,960
You know it too?

121
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,600
Hou Ning.

122
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,200
I'll call the police.

123
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,200
Don't call the police.

124
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,040
I only have this.

125
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,240
Just give me a moment.

126
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,440
Why is Hou Ning

127
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,800
still so rude?

128
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,600
Do you think I'm rude?

129
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,560
I'm just talking about the situation,

130
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,760
not to lure you.

131
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,040
I understand your opinion of her.

132
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,480
But you two are different.

133
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
What's the difference?

134
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,080
You've been in the prison for a year.

135
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,600
And you're very strong.

136
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,080
You're much stronger than you.

137
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,080
Then it's best to be strong.

138
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,160
You can lure her into the trap.

139
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,800
You two are like Dong Siyang.

140
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,560
Our company will change

141
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,680
the name of the company.

142
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,920
I know she's your friend.

143
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,800
But I'm just a little star.

144
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,600
I don't want to admit it.

145
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,720
Like those people in prison.

146
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,960
I was

147
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,160
fooled by my mom

148
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,040
when I started to learn computing.

149
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,800
But I really like Biancheng

150
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,600
because of you.

151
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,800
I have to admit

152
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,720
that you made me interested in Biancheng.

153
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,160
You made me believe

154
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,120
that technology can bring prosperity to society.

155
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,240
So I look down on those

156
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,880
who use technology to do evil.

157
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,160
I look down on those

158
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,200
who are still happy

159
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,320
after the smart dog.

160
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,080
Really.

161
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,580
There's a reason

162
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,800
why Hongying went into prison.

163
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,560
Her personality is lonely.

164
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,160
She was teased very hard

165
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,160
He was in the security guard for six months.

166
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,720
After he came out, his friend came to him again.

167
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,840
He trusted him again.

168
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,640
And he was caught again.

169
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,240
That's a good technique.

170
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,440
He was caught twice in total.

171
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,560
The first time, he was too greedy.

172
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,400
He left a lot of clues.

173
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,440
The second time, his friend was too greedy.

174
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,160
He asked Hou Ning to steal important information from the company.

175
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,440
He sold a lot of money.

176
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,760
Later, the boss of the company

177
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,680
chose to catch the hacker.

178
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,160
His friend was caught again.

179
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,000
He sold Hou Ning.

180
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,280
Don't always defend him.

181
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,480
He has been there once.

182
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,680
He doesn't know how to repent.

183
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,160
He is unlucky.

184
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,560
It's not that he is unlucky.

185
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,200
He knows what he is doing.

186
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,360
I said he is unlucky.

187
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,160
I mean,

188
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,400
there is no one who can pull him down.

189
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,160
I'm awake.

190
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,520
Drink some water.

191
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,440
My legs are numb.

192
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,560
You don't feel well?

193
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,240
I'm fine.

194
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,160
I'm fine.

195
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,920
How many nights have you been up?

196
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,560
You were like this in the bread truck last time.

197
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,240
You should go to the hospital.

198
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,040
You got up so early.

199
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,920
It's good for your health.

200
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,640
I didn't ask you to go to bed early.

201
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,600
Do birds eat worms when they get up early?

202
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
I'll go out to buy breakfast.

203
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,440
What kind of worms do you want?

204
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,920
Eat salted cabbage bread worms.

205
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,040
I got over it last night.

206
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,480
I have to make up for it today.

207
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
Let's go.

208
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,280
Let's go eat.

209
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,160
You live on the light and the sun.

210
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,520
You don't eat anything.

211
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,360
Do you want braised beef

212
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,920
or chicken?

213
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,960
You are so good at cooking.

214
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,960
You are so good at cooking.

215
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,840
You don't eat anything except braised beef.

216
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
I'll eat it if you cook it.

217
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,000
I'll cook it if you dare to eat it.

218
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,480
I'll eat it if you dare to cook it.

219
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,360
Hello, you ordered the food.

220
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,440
Thank you.

221
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,880
What are you looking at?

222
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,960
You've lost the meat.

223
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,040
You do it.

224
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,840
I can't.

225
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,920
Then shut up.

226
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,760
How do you deal with these guys?

227
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,880
What do you put in now?

228
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,080
Onions.

229
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,880
Onions?

230
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,640
Onions and ginger.

231
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,480
Are you sure?

232
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,960
How did you live before?

233
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,600
You don't know how to do it either.

234
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,880
I don't know how to do it.

235
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,480
I live in the prison.

236
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,440
Hong Ning did all these things.

237
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,560
Do you think she can handle it with some money?

238
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,960
Do you think she did it for money?

239
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,560
You are so crazy.

240
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,440
Besides,

241
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,800
what money do you have in your game?

242
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,360
Don't take advantage of it to play my game.

243
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,360
I don't care about her.

244
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,760
She's not a kid.

245
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,640
She...

246
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,480
She does look like a kid.

247
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,680
What should we do?

248
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,160
I'll try to contact her.

249
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,960
Does she have a lot of data in the background?

250
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,880
Our system is like a tofu in front of her.

251
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,280
When she's in the family,

252
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,760
how much damage it can cause,

253
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,920
it all depends on your mood.

254
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,360
My identity.

255
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,520
What is identity?

256
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,600
How would I know?

257
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,480
I'll let you know when you're in the family.

258
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,960
I'll let you know when you're in the family.

259
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,200
Before she got off the stove,

260
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:52,760
I...

261
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,440
Now...

262
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,840
No, she's about to explode.

263
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,320
She's coming.

264
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,200
Let me see.

265
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,640
She didn't open it.

266
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:48,740
Man's

267
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,920
How is it?

268
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,360
Delicious.

269
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,320
Braised beef or stewed chicken with mushrooms?

270
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,040
It's a problem.

271
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,440
Have you thought about how to deal with it?

272
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,680
No.

273
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,720
Then think about it again.

274
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,160
I've thought about it.

275
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,160
I have no choice.

276
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:30,920
Then don't eat it.

277
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,160
Eating it is also a waste of food.

278
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,600
What Zhang Feng said is right.

279
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,640
You are a foodie.

280
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,360
Which one do you want to eat?

281
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,960
Are you not picky about me?

282
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,640
I'm not picky about you.

283
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,640
Why don't you eat a little?

284
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,120
I'm so full.

285
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,640
I still want to eat some.

286
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,760
Hou Nian.

287
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,360
You're being tracked by him? That's normal.

288
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,560
Then he even translated it for me.

289
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,160
He thinks I don't understand English.

290
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,160
It's just a user experience.

291
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,160
You're doing your download game again? You're not looking for Hong Ning anymore?

292
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,360
No.

293
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,760
No?

294
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,760
You can't find her. You're wasting time.

295
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,360
What if she attacks again?

296
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,960
Then come. What are you afraid of?

297
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,160
This isn't my project.

298
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,160
You didn't even touch me.

299
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,760
I'm in charge of my project. You don't care about me.

300
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,360
I don't believe I can't find her.

301
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,360
Good luck.

302
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,360
Then give me a rough direction.

303
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,960
You can still recognize me?

304
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,960
You were the one who came looking for me.

305
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,160
I found that you've changed a lot.

306
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,560
You were so brave to talk to me.

307
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,560
Then the rabbit will bite you too?

308
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,160
Yes. The dog will jump over the wall if it's anxious.

309
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,160
Anyway, you're nice to everyone.

310
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,960
You just hate me.

311
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,960
Then can you respect the facts?

312
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,160
Who did this to you? Who cleaned the place?

313
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,560
How many days can you live without me?

314
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,960
You're feeding me with your burnt fish?

315
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,960
That's the me you're affecting.

316
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,760
I said I'd do it. You won't listen.

317
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,960
Can you do it?

318
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,960
Fine. I'll take you downstairs.

319
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,760
I haven't paid my salary yet.

320
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,960
You haven't paid your salary yet? You still want your salary?

321
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,360
Yes.

322
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,960
How much do you want?

323
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,760
How much for an hour? 50 yuan is enough?

324
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,560
Almost.

325
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,360
Let's go.

326
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,560
Let's go.

327
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,160
You forgot your clothes. Come back.

328
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,960
You forgot your clothes.

329
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,360
You recorded my clothes.

330
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,160
Which shoes should I choose?

331
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,480
Can it be?

332
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,960
It's snowing.

333
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,240
Why did you stop talking?

334
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,200
Didn't you hear me?

335
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,080
And why don't I would appreciate that?

336
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,800
After a long conversation

337
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,040
and studying,

338
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,680
I saw that you've tasted a lot of chicken soup since you were 9 years old.

339
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,600
You've already started to have a taste of government.

340
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,400
So fooling around

341
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,040
is simple and thankless.

342
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,280
But you're88 next year.

343
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,840
Of course.

344
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,640
This year.

345
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,240
I can't forgive.

346
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,720
I was just 접 to die once.

347
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,920
Then I just loved you and used you for nothing.

348
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,600
I live in the Generation A Natural Eight thousand years.

349
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,720
All of these years, I had so many memories of you.

350
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,640
Even now, I really like you.

351
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,640
I love you.

352
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,760
I'm leaving.

353
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,360
Princess.

354
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,560
Let me make an announcement.

355
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,960
This is the princess I've invited.

356
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,560
Why are you here?

357
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
I'm here to see you.

358
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,360
I'm here to see you.

359
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,760
I'm here to see you.

360
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,960
I'm here to see you.

361
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,160
I'm here to see you.

362
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,960
Why did you call me princess?

363
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,360
What did I call you?

364
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,960
Li Xun.

365
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,560
What kind of person do you think

366
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,760
can be called a princess?

367
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,960
First,

368
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,760
you need to have high-pitched eyes.

369
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,760
Then,

370
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,560
you need to have a innocent and fragile heart.

371
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,360
Tell me when you get home.

372
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,360
It is upside down.

373
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,360
Because I'm so in love with you.

374
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,960
And you

375
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,160
love me through.

376
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,160
Did you find the man in black?

377
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,360
It's not that easy.

378
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,360
I heard you know Li Xun.

379
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,360
Don't ask.

380
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,560
Li Xun.

381
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,760
What's going on?

382
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,560
Look.

383
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,960
They're even friends.

384
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,960
What are they studying?

385
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,360
It's hard to guess.

386
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,960
Think about it.

387
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,560
What's the most popular thing in the company now?

388
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,160
Hacker.

389
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,160
Li Xun will go to find someone.

390
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,360
If he finds Mr. Dong,

391
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,160
the hacker can't run away.

392
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,560
Mr. Dong won't be able to

393
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,560
get him.

394
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,760
You

395
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,160
are just a brainwashed.

396
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,560
Think about who Mr. Dong is.

397
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,760
As long as you give him a phone call and a photo,

398
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,760
no one in this city can't find him.

399
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,560
Then,

400
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,960
why didn't Li Xun start looking for Mr. Dong?

401
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,560
He might be afraid

402
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,760
that if Mr. Dong is really found,

403
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,760
he doesn't know how to deal with it.

404
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,960
What do you mean?

405
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,160
Mr. Dong is always playing around with us.

406
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,560
If he really finds someone,

407
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
what will happen?

408
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,360
He is Mr. Dong.

409
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,960
What to do?

410
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,460
Are you okay?

411
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,860
There's nothing to worry about.

412
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,340
Dong Siyang is more nervous than us.

413
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,540
No matter how many times we fail, we can start over.

414
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,060
He doesn't have the money.

415
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,740
He has all the bets on Fei Yang.

416
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,100
If he wins, he'll be in danger.

417
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,460
If he loses, he'll be killed by L.P.

418
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,380
Understand?

419
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,900
But if it weren't for us, Fang Zhijing and Gao Jinghong

420
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,300
wouldn't have targeted Fei Yang.

421
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,660
What do you mean?

422
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,580
If you have a weak neck, you won't die.

423
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,780
Remember.

424
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:12,300
There are two ways in this world.

425
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,100
One is waiting to die.

426
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,420
The other is looking for death.

427
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,300
Dong Siyang isn't waiting to die.

428
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,100
We aren't either.

429
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,220
So don't worry.

430
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,900
He'll find a way to get you.

431
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,820
That's what I'm most worried about.

432
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,780
Zhang Fang said that if Dong Siyang is really angry...

433
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,380
Stop listening to that nonsense.

434
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,740
Dong Siyang has his own plans.

435
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,140
Don't do anything stupid.

436
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,740
Mind your own business. Don't think too much.

437
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,180
Isn't this my business?

438
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,500
I'm sorry.

439
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,380
I'm sorry.

440
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,380
I'm sorry.

441
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,380
I'm sorry.

442
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,380
I'm sorry.

443
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,380
I'm sorry.

444
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,380
I'm sorry.

445
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,380
I'm sorry.

446
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,380
I'm sorry.

447
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,380
I'm sorry.

448
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,380
I'm sorry.

449
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,380
I'm sorry.

450
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,380
I'm sorry.

451
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,380
I'm sorry.

452
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,380
I'm sorry.

453
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,380
I'm sorry.

454
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,540
No!

455
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,020
You're being too risk!

456
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,460
You're Barns.

457
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,460
Huixin isn't running.

458
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,460
We don't have any risk left yet.

459
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,060
But I don't need you to do anything right now.

460
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,220
You can't be the one It's not my business!

461
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:21,100
redeemed

462
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,860
What are you up to?

463
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,580
Nothing!

464
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,300
Why don't you contact Dong Siyang?

465
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,140
I can't reach him.

466
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,260
You didn't even try.

467
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,820
Why are you here again?

468
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,100
Are you done?

469
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,020
You want to know, you ask.

470
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,700
I can't find him.

471
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,300
Go back to your position.

472
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,580
You have nothing to do, right?

473
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,780
We have to solve this today.

474
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,980
It's no use delaying it all day.

475
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,420
Why is it useless?

476
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,700
I'll warn you one last time.

477
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,340
The love blind is in the final stage.

478
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,500
You can make trouble,

479
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:08,980
but not now.

480
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,020
If you don't solve this today,

481
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,380
you won't enjoy anything.

482
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,900
You were like this last time.

483
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,180
You're not a good person.

484
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,380
You're not a good person.

485
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,380
You're not a good person.

486
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,380
You're not a good person.

487
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,380
You're not a good person.

488
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,380
You're not a good person.

489
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,380
You're not a good person.

490
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,380
You're not a good person.

491
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,380
You're not a good person.

492
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,380
You're not a good person.

493
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,380
You're not a good person.

494
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,380
You're not a good person.

495
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,380
You're not a good person.

496
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,380
You're not a good person.

497
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,380
You're not a good person.

498
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,380
You're not a good person.

499
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,380
You're not a good person.

500
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,380
You're not a good person.

501
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,380
You're not a good person.

502
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,380
You're not a good person.

503
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,380
You're not a good person.

504
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,380
You're not a good person.

505
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,380
You're not a good person.

506
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,380
You're not a good person.

507
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,380
Get out.

508
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,620
Zhiyun

509
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,020
Three years ago, here was what you did.

510
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,180
You have to be honest.

511
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,060
There are other better solutions.

512
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,540
We can do it anytime.

513
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,300
We can't do this.

514
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,260
We can do the next one.

515
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,660
But it's too late to make a mistake.

516
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,460
Do you remember what Mr. Ling said to you?

517
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,460
It's true.

518
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,780
Dong Siyang said he would have a sense of propriety.

519
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,100
Can his sense of propriety be the same as that of the normal sense of propriety?

520
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,300
I'm not afraid of him.

521
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,300
I'm afraid of him.

522
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,700
You started to look for him yourself.

523
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,700
You didn't hand the matter over to Dong Siyang.

524
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,500
Are you afraid that he would do something too cruel?

525
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,900
I just want to be a little bit cruel to him.

526
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,300
What do you mean?

527
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,500
I should be a little bit more careful.

528
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,900
I want to use him.

529
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,700
But he's a little bit skillful now.

530
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,300
I don't think Dong Siyang is a good player.

531
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,100
I don't think so.

532
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,300
What do you mean by that?

533
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,700
No, you have to follow him.

534
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,100
Don't be afraid of being late if you're not afraid of being late.

535
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,500
Call him now.

536
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,700
Okay.

537
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,300
Hello.

538
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,900
How is it? Did you find him?

539
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,500
You found him?

540
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,300
Give me the address. I'll go there now.

541
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,300
Why are there two van?

542
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,700
Did something happen?

543
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,700
I'll go and have a look.

544
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,100
Wait here.

545
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,100
I'll go in and have a look. You wait in the van.

546
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,500
Close the window and lock the van.

547
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,500
Okay.

548
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,300
Let go of me!

549
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,500
Let me tell you. I know you.

550
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,100
I'm the boss of the company.

551
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,500
You're a bastard. You're in jail.

552
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,100
You're in jail?

553
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,100
Let me go.

554
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,100
You're...

555
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,100
You're a bastard!

556
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,300
You're trying to get me.

557
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,700
Why are you talking so much?

558
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,100
Trying to get you?

559
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,100
Why are you trying to blackmail me?

560
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:49,900
You deserve it.

561
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,700
Say it again.

562
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:52,900
Let me go.

563
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,100
You two will handle your own business.

564
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,900
Don't be polite to this guy.

565
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,900
Do you hear me?

566
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,100
Go away.

567
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,700
He Ning.

568
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,100
Turn around.

569
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,300
You're like a man.

570
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,100
Who's a man?

571
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,500
You're trying to get...

572
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,100
I'll tell you.

573
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,300
You just left and put it there.

574
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,900
You dare not do it, okay?

575
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,100
I dare not.

576
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,100
You dare not?

577
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,100
Dare not?

578
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,100
You...

579
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:43,900
Let me tell you.

580
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,100
Your LOP is still on the company's website.

581
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,500
Your woman hasn't come back yet.

582
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,900
Don't do it.

583
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,100
I really dare not?

584
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,300
You dare not?

585
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,300
You dare?

586
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,300
Dare not?

587
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,300
Dare not?

588
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,300
You're a bastard.

589
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,300
You're a bastard.

590
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,300
You're a bastard.

591
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,300
You're a bastard.

592
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,300
You're a bastard.

593
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,300
I dare not.

594
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,300
You dare not?

595
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,300
You dare not?

596
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,300
You dare not?

597
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,300
He Ning.

598
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,300
If you do something wrong,

599
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,300
you have to be punished.

600
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,700
Yuexuan.

601
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,300
You're a bastard.

602
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,300
You dare not?

603
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,300
You dare not?

604
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,300
You dare not?

605
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,300
You dare not?

606
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,300
You dare not?

607
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,300
You dare not?

608
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,300
You dare not?

609
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,300
You dare not?

610
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,300
You dare not?

611
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,300
You dare not?

612
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,300
You dare not?

613
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,300
You dare not?

614
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,300
You dare not?

615
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,300
You dare not?

616
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,300
You dare not?

617
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,300
You dare not?

618
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,300
You dare not?

619
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,300
You dare not?

620
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,300
You dare not?

621
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,300
You dare not?

622
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,300
You dare not?

623
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,300
You dare not?

624
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,300
You dare not?

625
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,300
You dare not?

626
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,300
You dare not?

627
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,300
You dare not?

628
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,300
You dare not?

629
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,300
You dare not?

630
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,480
You dare not?

631
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,480
You dare not?

632
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,480
You dare not?

633
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,480
You dare not?

634
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,480
You dare not?

635
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,480
You dare not?

636
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,480
Stop saying so exaggerating.

637
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,480
It's just...

638
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,480
What really happened today?

639
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,480
We mechanic,

640
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,600
we looked closely

641
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,000
and saw nothing.

642
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,660
Except for a body.

643
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,660
What?

644
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,300
Let's go.

645
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,140
Look, Hou Ning.

646
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,140
Isn't he there?

647
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,100
If you do something wrong,

648
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,020
you have to take the punishment.

649
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,180
It's okay.

650
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,180
We're just the next ones.

651
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,260
You can go back to your room.

652
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,900
I've been regretting it.

653
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,340
I've been regretting it abroad.

654
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:17,900
I didn't stop you.

655
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,820
I was afraid that you would do something stupid again.

656
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:34,020
I believe I love you.

657
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:38,540
Your love will take its course.

658
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:42,300
I'm by your side.

659
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,460
I'll spend a long time with you.

660
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,340
I won't.

661
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:51,900
I believe I want you.

662
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,020
I know what I'm doing.

663
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,540
I believe I love you.

664
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,900
You said that there was no one

665
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,380
who could hold him by your side.

666
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,420
But I said that I didn't

667
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,620
hold you by your side.

668
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:05,140
You're always the only one who's the only one.

669
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,420
I said I was your lover.

670
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:12,140
But I'm the first one to leave.

671
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:12,940
I'm by your side.

672
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:16,140
I love you.

673
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:20,700
Please don't take its course.

674
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:24,700
I'm by your side.

675
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,420
I'll spend a long time with you.

676
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,180
It's not your fault.

677
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:33,980
Even if I want you,

678
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:37,420
your love will take its course.

679
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,460
I promise you.

680
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:42,300
I'll spend a long time with you.

681
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,740
I'll never regret it again.

682
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:51,860
You're the one who's by my side.

683
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:56,300
Oh my love.

684
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:00,780
Your passionate eyes

685
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:08,940
are always there for me.

686
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,300
You did something very bad.

687
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,060
Do you understand?

688
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,900
Yes.

689
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,500
But we were just playing around.

690
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,460
Playing around?

691
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,340
More importantly,

692
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,860
you kidnapped and threatened me.

693
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,740
If it weren't for your responsibility,

694
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,980
you would have been detained.

695
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,220
It was a bad situation.

696
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,820
We won't do it again.

697
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:38,940
But I was so angry.

698
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,100
You said Zhai Sun...

699
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,260
I was too impulsive.

700
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,220
You can't just break the law

701
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,380
because of others.

702
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,060
Hongning's illegal immigration is in the background.

703
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,540
Did we also detain him?

704
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,100
We didn't pursue him.

705
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,420
We just beat him.

706
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,300
He kept replying.

707
00:40:59,060 --> 00:40:59,660
Look.

708
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,700
Do I have anything

709
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,060
to add?

710
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,660
Why are they so bold?

711
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,100
It's normal.

712
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,740
You're not that bold.

713
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,940
When Li Xun came out,

714
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,540
you didn't know what was going on.

715
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,380
You were still a tough guy.

716
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,100
You were determined to help him.

717
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,500
It's different.

718
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,380
What's different?

719
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,580
Men do everything for their career.

720
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,860
Women do everything for love.

721
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,460
God is fair.

722
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,900
I was always afraid.

723
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,860
After he came out,

724
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,380
I was even more afraid.

725
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,260
I felt like a bird of prey.

726
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,100
I was afraid that he would be more serious

727
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,340
than failure.

728
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,100
Don't be afraid.

729
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:50,580
It's okay.

730
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,140
Because you're here,

731
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,900
he can't go to the room for now.

732
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,500
So I decided not to leave.

733
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,820
I won't leave again.

734
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,140
What's going on?

735
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:24,980
What's going on?

736
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:28,620
Who is he?

737
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,740
What are you doing here?

738
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,260
Who are you?

739
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,820
I'm a staff here.

740
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,340
What are you doing here?

741
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:40,940
Go to work.

742
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,860
Aren't you on vacation today?

743
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:55,540
What are you doing here?

744
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,220
Where's Hou Ning?

745
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,180
You even made illegal detention.

746
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:04,540
Don't talk nonsense.

747
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,020
What illegal detention?

748
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,260
I just came out from the police station

749
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,460
to receive education.

750
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,900
We brought him here

751
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,940
to treat him with good food and drink.

752
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,500
He can't come out anymore.

753
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:16,540
He's useless.

754
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:23,980
You're capable.

755
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:24,980
You can persuade him.

756
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:49,860
I don't want to see Li Xun turn over.

757
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,020
I don't want to see him

758
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,100
turn over.

759
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:53,780
Right?

760
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,580
Li Xun is useless.

761
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,700
He's going to be a loser.

762
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,860
What are you doing?

763
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,180
You used to copy others.

764
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,700
Now you even dare to steal Yuan Dama?

765
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,100
I'll give Yuan Dama to them directly.

766
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,180
A company like this

767
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,260
doesn't deserve to be our competition.

768
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:55,340
I'm your new index finger.

769
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:58,420
I'll bravely go forward

770
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:05,140
like the flame burning in the night.

771
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:13,220
Cause I believe I love you.

772
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:17,700
True love will take its course.

773
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:22,820
I'm by your side.

774
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:26,460
I'll spend the long time with you.

775
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:30,980
Cause I believe I want you.

776
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:35,500
True love will take its course.

777
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:39,860
The fiery fire

778
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:48,740
is always you who look up at the sky.

779
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:06,340
It's the intuition of the dream.

780
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:09,100
Break through the barrier.

781
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:14,100
The night of the first night.

782
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,060
The night.

783
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:19,700
Then it won the world for me.

784
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:24,940
It's always the same.

785
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:29,380
I'm by your side.

786
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,620
Be brave.

787
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:34,220
Every dream I have.

788
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:41,820
I won't, won't, won't lose to the world again.

789
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:46,460
Cause I believe I love you.

790
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:50,900
True love will take its course.

791
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:56,100
I'm by your side.

792
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:59,620
I'll spend the long time with you.

793
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:04,180
Cause I believe I want you.

794
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:08,660
True love will take its course.

795
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:13,100
The fiery fire

796
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:23,820
is always you who look up at the sky.

797
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:28,580
Cause I believe I love you.

798
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:33,060
True love will take its course.

799
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:38,260
I'm by your side.

800
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:41,820
I'll spend the long time with you.

801
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:46,340
Cause I believe I want you.

802
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:50,860
True love will take its course.

803
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:55,300
The fiery fire

804
00:47:55,340 --> 00:48:04,140
is always you who look up at the sky.

805
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:13,100
The fiery fire

806
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:24,660
is always you who look up at the sky.
