2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I no longer believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Even if the light is bright, I will still fight against the darkness

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless atmosphere

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day, there is a touch of panic

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am light

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be bright and strong alone?

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I am burning up just to save you

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This is how everything looks like at the beginning

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am light

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The wind is like a wild grass

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I am burning up just to save you

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You are still by my side

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This is how everything looks like at the beginning

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
After this incident, I also want to open

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I used to like Li Xun so cold and proud

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I was blinded

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
From now on, I solemnly announce

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I don't like him

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Take it away if you like

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I don't like him

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
is it

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Whoever likes him is sick

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yes, it's sick

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Then you don't go to the base

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Of course i go

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I didn't scold him before

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I let him go

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
If Li Xun dares to scold me again in the future

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I have to teach him how to do it

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Check this again

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
How is the website

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Reconciled

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Don't care

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The plastic sisterhood of your girl

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I really don't understand

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I guess Liu Sisi will never come again

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You really don't go

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Whoever likes him is a dog

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
How about it

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
How about YoYo

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We added a walking horse lamp here

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Add a video window here

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Use it to broadcast some promotional videos

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And here is a window

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Can hang some shopping website's external links

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And this

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We replaced the mouse with their logo

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Is it still a bit memorable

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Do you think the page is a bit fancy

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
There are a lot of hangings

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
If you take it to the bidding

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It still seems that the design is not mature enough

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I don't think the current websites are like this

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
If it's too fast

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It seems that I didn't pay attention

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
OK, just use yours

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Really

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Just like this

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I said no problem

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I think we are not that good

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You are not confident

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Li Xun didn't say anything

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That's definitely no problem

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Nothing but

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
In the future, we two

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Just like this time

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Hold on to your own distance

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We are not here to work for him

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We are all a team

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
He also has to learn to cooperate

79
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Listen to our opinion

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Always be as independent as him

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
There will be problems sooner or later

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
There is a medicine for the abnormal

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I think it's a little bit more

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I think it's a little bit more

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I think it's a little bit more

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I think it's a little bit more

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I think it's a little bit more

88
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
There is medicine for the abnormal

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I always feel this thing is strange

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I think you are strange

91
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Hurry up

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Honey

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It looks like

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I have to

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Can't lose face to the base

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Besides, my clothes

97
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I borrowed it from my brother last night

98
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
My tie

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I learned from this video this morning

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I almost strangled me to death

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I also thought about it for a long time

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Where is Li Xun

103
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Correct

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
He told me this morning

105
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
He has something

106
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
May not come

107
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What is he doing

108
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Anyway, it's the two of us

109
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It doesn't matter if he has him or not

110
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Are we really okay

111
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Why don't we go find him

112
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Why not

113
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Anyway, it's already in place

114
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Mr. He, be confident of us

115
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Let's go

116
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's still more than an hour on the road

117
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Come on, princess

118
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Please

119
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You take a break

120
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We have checked so many times

121
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
There must be no bug

122
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You should be dizzy later

123
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
This is the most important thing

124
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Relax relax

125
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Don't worry

126
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I've been here since I was a kid

127
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I won't get you

128
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Are you okay

129
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Stomach like this

130
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Lao Gao

131
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
We are both

132
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
No experience in this matter

133
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Or call

134
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Call Li Xun

135
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Are you so nervous

136
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Really okay

137
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
This standard

138
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
We can definitely win

139
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Moreover

140
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Everything is the first time

141
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Li Xun didn't vote

142
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I don't think so

143
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Li Xun didn't vote either

144
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Help me take the small pocket

145
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The water in the mouth is gone

146
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
How about this

147
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I will be on stage later

148
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You come to supplement

149
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
OK, I'll listen to you

150
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Hello

151
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We are here to bid

152
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You are here to bid

153
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Why are you so slow

154
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
They have arrived

155
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Which company are you from

156
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
We are from Nanhu University

157
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Computer Engineering

158
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Co-op Center

159
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We have a traffic jam on the way

160
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
OK, sign first

161
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Hello

162
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Isn't your bidder called Li Xun

163
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
This time it's my lead

164
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You have to sign his name

165
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Otherwise I will be in trouble

166
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm sorry

167
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm sorry

168
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I can't sign his name

169
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Otherwise I can't sign

170
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
OK

171
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Hello, leaders

172
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I am from

173
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
DEMO

174
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
A limited company

175
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
This time

176
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
We are on the Internet industry design

177
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The selection is

178
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Intermediate design

179
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
DEMO is here too

180
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yes

181
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I thought I wouldn't

182
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Come to such a big company

183
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It can reflect

184
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Our brand's youthfulness

185
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So it attracts more young people

186
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Where are you going

187
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm going to the store

188
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Different backgrounds

189
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Roll at different speeds

190
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So that a 3D 3D sports

191
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So our idea

192
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
is to highlight a new word

193
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So our company's design idea

194
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
is behind everyone

195
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
We only pursue one word

196
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That is soil

197
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Call Li Xun

198
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's closed

199
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
We are bidding

200
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What is he thinking

201
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
We were supposed to be our family

202
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So when designing the Internet industry

203
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Try to be as early as possible

204
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
This is better than the last one

205
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You see, they are so short-sighted

206
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It looks easy

207
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You know how difficult it is when you get started

208
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Especially the type card

209
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I saw it on the chase before

210
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Great blood flow

211
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's enough for us to learn for half a year

212
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
For example

213
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
One of our creative designs

214
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
is to change the mouse

215
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
into our company's logo

216
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So that we can leave a new memory for the client

217
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'll make another call

218
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Hello

219
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What are you doing

220
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Hello

221
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What's wrong

222
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I accidentally deleted a wrong code

223
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I wanted to add a dynamic insert on the guide

224
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
on the guide

225
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
At least it can attract people more at first sight

226
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's okay

227
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's copied from my computer

228
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The guide was changed when I last met the director

229
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You didn't

230
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The most suitable for user habits

231
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
is a good design

232
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's a good design

233
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's a good design

234
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's a good design

235
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The most suitable for user habits

236
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
is a good design

237
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm done

238
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Thank you

239
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Fourth

240
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Nanhu University Computer Science and Technology Cooperation Center

241
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Is Nanhu University coming

242
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Let's go

243
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Nanhu University Computer Science and Technology Cooperation Center

244
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
The bidder is Li Xun

245
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Is Li Xun coming

246
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
He's coming

247
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Brother

248
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Brother

249
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Hello

250
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm Gao Jianhong from Nanhu University Computer Science and Technology Cooperation Center

251
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Our website design concept this time is

252
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
youth and life

253
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Youth is that we hope to attract more young people

254
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
to care about the Blue Can

255
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
to care about the website of Blue Can

256
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Life is that we hope

257
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
to be more in line with user habits

258
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
We also changed the mouse to the Blue Can logo

259
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And we

260
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Wait a minute

261
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
What's wrong with this navigation bar

262
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
This was originally a dynamic component

263
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
The code seems to have some problems

264
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Didn't you test it before coming?

265
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Tested

266
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
We tested many times

267
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But I just wanted to make some changes

268
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But it seems that it's too late

269
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Young people

270
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You are a student

271
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
There is a gap between the completion of the Du Shen and others

272
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
We can understand this

273
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But

274
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You can't just come up with such a thing

275
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Our bid is very serious this time

276
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Have you ever respected us

277
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Have you ever respected your opponents

278
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Isn't your bid written well?

279
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
How can it be mixed?

280
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Which semi-finished product came up?

281
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Why is it different from the bid we submitted?

282
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
This is indeed a semi-finished product

283
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Sorry

284
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
What I just showed you

285
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Is the first draft we made

286
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
At that time, we argued for a long time

287
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
For a navigation bar

288
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
But later we found that

289
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Consumers don't care about the navigation bar at all

290
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
What they care about is

291
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
How to buy the product more conveniently

292
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The first draft I just showed you

293
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Just for the sake of the positive beauty

294
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I want you to see

295
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
If the direction is wrong

296
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
How terrible it will be

297
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So in the second draft

298
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
We completely abandoned the concept of website design

299
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
More is concerned about

300
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
How to make the user more simple

301
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Convenient

302
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And quickly buy the product of the company

303
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The main business of Lan Guan Company is snacks and health products

304
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
But for most consumers

305
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's not a must

306
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
We studied the consumer behavior analysis of major shopping sites

307
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And did a survey

308
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
We found that

309
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
For the purchase of this kind of product

310
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Usually it's done impulsively

311
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So

312
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
We need to make the process of choosing to pay

313
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
As short as possible

314
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Can't let the consumer have any obstacles

315
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Or trouble

316
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
In the process of purchasing a traditional shopping site

317
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
The consumer needs to register

318
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Log in

319
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Fill in address

320
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Tie in bank card

321
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Enter password and return

322
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
But for the five steps

323
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
For buying a non-necessary product

324
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Too complicated

325
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Too troublesome

326
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
The consumer may stop at any step

327
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
So

328
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Our suggestion is

329
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
No need to waste effort

330
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
To build a new payment system

331
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
But rely on a comprehensive

332
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
With user information

333
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
A mature payment website

334
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I dare to predict

335
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Such payment software

336
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Must be a big deal

337
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Thank you

338
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Did he listen to the tape?

339
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
When did he learn this?

340
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Gao

341
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
What's wrong?

342
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
He's angry

343
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Li Xun is too much

344
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
He's definitely not targeting you

345
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
He has his own plan

346
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Plan what?

347
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Plan to tease us

348
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Plan to make me like a fool

349
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
To be on stage to embarrass people

350
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Gao

351
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I understand

352
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Youth training

353
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Don't want to be treated like a person

354
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Let's investigate

355
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
This is my business card

356
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
If you need any support

357
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
In finance and technology

358
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Contact me anytime

359
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Our company is willing to support

360
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Young people with talent and ideas

361
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Hope we can cooperate

362
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Thank you

363
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Nice to meet you

364
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Nice to meet you

365
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Are you convinced?

366
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
What do you mean?

367
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
If you thought we couldn't do it

368
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
From the beginning

369
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Didn't plan to use our program

370
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Why didn't you make it clear?

371
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
We wasted so much time and energy

372
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
To spend so many hours

373
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I made four or five copies of the label of more than 40 pages

374
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Are you kidding us?

375
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Didn't I say that?

376
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
If you don't come on stage today

377
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
See the difference between you and others

378
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You will always be so naive

379
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
So stubborn

380
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
We are a team

381
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I take you as a brother and a comrade

382
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You give me a lesson today

383
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Put me on stage

384
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Let everyone laugh at me

385
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
What do you take me for?

386
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Li Xun

387
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
What can you say?

388
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
We can feel it

389
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
We are really bad at making websites

390
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What do you think?

391
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
If I didn't change the label

392
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You don't even have a chance to enter the game

393
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You are right

394
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
We are a team

395
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So what you have to do

396
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Is to listen to me

397
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Follow me

398
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I will take you to success

399
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Here

400
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Come on

401
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Help him

402
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Brother

403
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Take care of him

404
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Don't follow him

405
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Come on

406
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You are tied

407
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Hold on

408
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
OK

409
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I won't play anymore

410
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Are you OK?

411
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm fine

412
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Are you OK?

413
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm fine

414
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I won't play anymore

415
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Bye

416
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Bye

417
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Bye

418
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
The ball is heavy

419
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Thanks

420
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Li Xun asked you to come

421
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
How could Li Xun ask you to come?

422
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
She is not here

423
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You know Li Xun

424
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You don't know him for the first time

425
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
But Gao

426
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
If it wasn't Li Xun

427
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
We would be more embarrassed

428
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Zhu Yu

429
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You are so fast

430
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You are so fast

431
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I just do what I want

432
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Li Xun didn't do anything wrong

433
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
He just used his own way

434
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
No one knows who we are

435
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
After coming out of the blue

436
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I have something to say

437
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The blue can project is on the top

438
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
What do you mean?

439
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Did you win it?

440
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Really

441
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's on the top

442
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
We won such a big project

443
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's great

444
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Thank you

445
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Thank you

446
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Thank you

447
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Thank you

448
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Now our class monitor

449
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Please have some milk tea

450
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You can order anything

451
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Milk tea

452
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Milk tea

453
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Next

454
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Our base will be

455
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
The blue can project

456
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Most people follow me

457
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
The rest of you

458
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Check the data

459
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And go to the database

460
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I will arrange some tasks for you

461
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Although the profit of this project

462
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
In the end

463
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Most of it will be handed over to the school

464
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
But everyone

465
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Will get some rewards

466
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Can we make money?

467
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Of course

468
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And

469
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
After completing the project

470
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
We can get more points

471
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
When our class

472
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Is rated as an excellent class

473
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
There are three thousand dollars

474
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Reward can be taken

475
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Great

476
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Honey

477
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You are so great this time

478
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Honey, you are so good

479
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Thanks to you three

480
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Honey, you have to treat us to dinner

481
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Yes, we can

482
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Why don't you tell everyone?

483
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Tell everyone

484
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
That the bid is not related to me at all

485
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You hit me on the stage that day

486
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
But you saved my face today

487
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Li Xun

488
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Do you think you are so great?

489
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It's just a project

490
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Is it worth it?

491
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I came to the base

492
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Just to do the project well

493
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I don't want people to be stupid

494
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
To play around

495
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Honey

496
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I don't want to

497
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Be a fool

498
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
To play around

499
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I don't want to

500
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Be a fool

501
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
vine

502
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Getting實eri5

503
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Take off

504
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Okay

505
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The task time is tight

506
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Let's get to work

507
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,120
I won't do it.

508
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,600
Honey!

509
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,800
Wu Mengqing, Fang Shumiao.

510
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,600
There are some comments about Lan Guan's food and health products online.

511
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,400
You guys collect them. I want the best ones.

512
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,000
What's wrong again?

513
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,600
You can't just not say anything.

514
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,000
Li Xun.

515
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,600
When I was little, I loved to play with fire with a gas stove.

516
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:03,000
I always stole it when my mom and my sister weren't around.

517
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,400
My mom would scold me, but I just wouldn't listen.

518
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,200
I only knew once.

519
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,200
Later, I learned to be a good boy and never played again.

520
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,200
You can only tell me a story here,

521
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,200
but you can't just tell me a good story.

522
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,600
I have no obligation to coax you.

523
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,600
Then what do you think we are?

524
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
Am I not good to you?

525
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,200
Then try to persuade Gao not to leave.

526
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,600
Gao can tell right from wrong.

527
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,600
Don't worry.

528
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,600
He's not as cunning as you.

529
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,000
Come here.

530
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,500
ideological

531
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,820
Cheers.

532
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,280
Why did you ask me out?

533
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,660
Gao Jian Hong.

534
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,420
Do you want to dome something

535
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,120
that's just yours?

536
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,400
Pre MC

537
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,800
This is my first time to marry you

538
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:32,800
Hello

539
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,880
Let me show you around

540
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,560
Hi Uncle Gao

541
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,080
You are back

542
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,000
I need you so much

543
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,680
Youир so

544
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,520
Yeah

545
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,080
Gao

546
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:42,760
You are here

547
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,800
Yes

548
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,720
Morning

549
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,520
Morning

550
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,040
achine is fine

551
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,480
Li Xun is right.

552
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,120
I'll become stronger

553
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,560
if I follow him.

554
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,480
Let's go.

555
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,480
Gao.

556
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,320
Let's go.

557
00:26:59,320 --> 00:26:59,960
Let's go.

558
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,320
Slow down.

559
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,080
Are you sure about it?

560
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,440
I'm sure. Don't worry.

561
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,720
I'm sure.

562
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,280
I'm sure.

563
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,080
I'm sure.

564
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,720
I'm sure.

565
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,480
Let's go.

566
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,360
I'll send the post.

567
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,720
It will not hurt if someone else hooks in.

568
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,600
Then leave the night market to enjoy some quiet Initial D.

569
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,080
Hyping your edges up.

570
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,280
Dah pena tidak!

571
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,120
What is your name, Big Brother?

572
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,780
I am Xu야지, your cousin.

573
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,120
Nice to meet you at Wat idun.

574
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,460
I am Xiao maximize.

575
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,260
Hello.

576
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,160
Listen, after end of the expiry date,

577
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:18,760
they have to also make a山头

578
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,560
Where are you going?

579
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,760
I've been done with theseric Delete

580
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,200
Can I borrow a day off for a day!!

581
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,680
I haven't hope to see you

582
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,880
I didn't going back last week

583
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,800
I went back three days in 7 days

584
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,760
half of night

585
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,020
Look at this

586
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,320
I can grow a bean

587
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,300
and I am starving now

588
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,360
Kl naturel custody program

589
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,260
It stinks.

590
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,660
It's not smelly.

591
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,860
Why haven't you become the boss yet?

592
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,060
You should learn the capital's trick first.

593
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:56,860
I don't care.

594
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,060
I must go back today.

595
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,580
I'll give you half an hour.

596
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,180
Change your clothes early.

597
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,260
Come back and continue working.

598
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,060
It will take ten minutes for me to walk back.

599
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:06,780
Get in the car.

600
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,460
It's still twenty-nine minutes.

601
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,860
Can you sell it?

602
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,060
I'll change the time.

603
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:51,260
The white dust slowly melts and I slowly like it

604
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,860
One by one

605
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,060
I remember the secret

606
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:03,460
I want to be with you

607
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:08,460
In the moment, in the fairy tale, the autumn

608
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,460
Is actually the destined meeting of the princess

609
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:16,660
Let me feel your simple wish to protect you

610
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,660
A blink of an eye, the time of love

611
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,660
No longer afraid of the world

612
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:29,660
With you by my side, say good night to every life

613
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,860
The happiness has never changed

614
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:36,060
In the last few days, many students have come to ask me questions.

615
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,660
I understand very well.

616
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:41,060
Our class has just entered the stage of real operation.

617
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,060
Will encounter some doubts

618
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,660
Where is the person

619
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,660
This is normal

620
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,060
But I have to tell everyone

621
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,660
Don't think of this C language too complicated

622
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,660
I'll talk to Teacher Ling.

623
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,460
Teacher Ling

624
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,460
Zhang Xiaobai is here

625
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,060
Where is it

626
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:07,660
there

627
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,260
Ok

628
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:14,860
Wait for me

629
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,460
it is good

630
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,660
Share this document with your classmates later

631
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,660
I just came to find Lin Laotong's daughter

632
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,060
Called Zhang Xiaobai

633
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,460
Before it was automated

634
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,860
I don't know which leg is on

635
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,260
Entered the new creation as project director

636
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,660
Our school research institute

637
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,860
School-based cooperation center

638
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,260
Not cooperating with new creation

639
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,660
He is responsible

640
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,860
Why is he here?

641
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,460
You know

642
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,260
How much can we talk about this project?

643
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,860
How much

644
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,260
Six hundred thousand

645
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,660
So much money

646
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,260
Lao Gao, I have a bad feeling

647
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,060
I think that Zhang Xiaobai

648
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,460
It's for our project

649
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,060
And suspect

650
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,060
It's for the Lan Guan project

651
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,860
I'm so hungry

652
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,060
Add some chili

653
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,860
Too much effort

654
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,060
Lao Gao

655
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,460
The day we went to the bidding

656
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,260
I saw that tall and thin boy

657
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,260
Do you remember

658
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,860
I just remembered

659
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,060
He is the research institute

660
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,460
School-based cooperation center

661
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,460
Called Han Jiakang

662
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,260
So he is not

663
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,660
Zhang Xiaobai's subordinate

664
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,260
You said we went to the bidding

665
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,860
Meet the competitor of our school

666
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,660
This doesn't seem like a coincidence

667
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,860
This is not right

668
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,660
How to think so strange

669
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,260
Unless they have planned it long ago

670
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,260
Come to grab the project

671
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,860
You are responsible for the LIS

672
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,460
Time is strictly controlled

673
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,060
Li Xuan

674
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,660
Someone asked to grab the Lan Guan project

675
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,060
Gao Jianhong is here?

676
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,060
Here

677
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,460
What's up?

678
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,260
Meeting?

679
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,860
Wait a minute

680
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,460
All here

681
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,460
Director Zhang

682
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,660
Then I will introduce you briefly

683
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,660
This is Zhang Xiaobai

684
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,660
President Zhang

685
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,660
Is the new project manager of the new company

686
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,660
The new company

687
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,460
And our school

688
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,660
School Research Institute

689
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,660
And a school-based cooperation center

690
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,860
These are your senior sisters

691
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,460
Han Jiakang, Zhou Jingyang

692
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,060
Yu Feng, Ning Jiajia

693
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:06,460
Today call both sides together

694
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,460
I want to follow you

695
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,460
I want to follow you

696
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,660
I called them together

697
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,860
I want to tell you something

698
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,660
Didn't our base get one

699
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,660
The process of soft and soft

700
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,660
Coincidence

701
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,060
Xiaobai and Jiakang

702
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:23,860
Their cooperation center

703
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,260
Also applied for this project

704
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,260
We hit the road today

705
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,660
What to do

706
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,860
I think we can cooperate

707
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,460
Co-operate

708
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:36,860
Just

709
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,460
Also give you one

710
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,460
Like a senior

711
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,260
A good opportunity to learn from senior sister

712
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,460
As for the names

713
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,660
I think it's Xiaobai and them

714
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,660
Research Institute

715
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,060
More professional

716
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,860
Then this is

717
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,660
Lin's favorite student

718
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,460
I've heard about it

719
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,460
Lin's students

720
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,660
It's not ordinary at first glance

721
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,260
I dare not use the favorite student

722
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,460
What he made

723
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,460
I'm afraid

724
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,460
What do you have in the future

725
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,860
You can find my class representative

726
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,060
Zhu Yun

727
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,460
He is stable

728
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,060
Xiaobai

729
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,460
I have class in the afternoon

730
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,460
I'm leaving first

731
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,460
You communicate more

732
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,060
it is good

733
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:24,660
it is good

734
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,660
Lin Langchen, you have a hard time

735
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,260
Goodbye

736
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,060
Goodbye

737
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,060
Although you are all undergraduate students

738
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,860
But teacher Lin and teacher Zhang

739
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,460
You are all excellent

740
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,060
This time

741
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:39,660
I also want to take

742
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,860
Real opportunity

743
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,660
Let you exercise yourself

744
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,260
Any difficulties and problems

745
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,260
You can ask me anytime

746
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,660
Of course you can also contact your senior

747
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,060
it is good

748
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,060
Then do this first

749
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:00,860
Han Yangkang

750
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,260
You stay and communicate

751
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,060
it is good

752
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,460
Others have nothing to do

753
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,260
Go back to work

754
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,460
Go

755
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,260
Zhu Yun, you stay

756
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,060
Teacher's phone

757
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,860
138

758
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,660
Senior

759
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,460
When will you sign up

760
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,460
In the company that signed up before

761
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,660
There are no you

762
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,860
I knew there were undergraduate students

763
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,860
Teacher brought the team

764
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,460
We are not so hard

765
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,260
Light up and stay for so many days

766
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,060
Eat more

767
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,260
On the day of the speech

768
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,460
Although we didn't go on stage

769
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,260
I prepared

770
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,860
President Zhang means

771
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,260
Let's not consume it internally

772
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,460
Waste resources

773
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,260
That's right

774
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,460
That's all the resources

775
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,260
Zhu Yun

776
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,660
This cooperation is agreed by the students

777
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,260
You cooperate well

778
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,660
But this is ours

779
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,460
From start to finish

780
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,460
We are one big horse

781
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,460
Knocked out

782
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,860
But no one

783
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,460
Ask if we agree

784
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,460
I'll say it

785
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,460
Come on

786
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,460
The representative of Wento

787
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,660
After listening to the instructions

788
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,660
You come out

789
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,460
Work

790
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,660
You just agreed

791
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,060
Didn't Teacher Lin just say

792
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,460
Cooperation

793
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,460
What's next

794
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,060
The plan is sent to you

795
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:01,860
Do it

796
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,260
Can you not

797
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,660
Don't care about it

798
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,860
You really have to agree

799
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,260
What do you want me to do

800
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,260
What can you do

801
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,260
You are content

802
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,660
What do you mean

803
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,460
Teacher Lin is a professional in study

804
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,260
Never thought of these

805
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,660
Something that is crooked

806
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,860
But even if he doesn't know

807
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,860
You should know

808
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,660
What is that Zhang Xiaobei doing

809
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,060
Even the name is on him

810
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:30,660
Then we are not for nothing

811
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,660
Work for him

812
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,260
Like him

813
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,260
Backed by big companies

814
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,060
Suppress students

815
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,260
People with low labor

816
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,860
I have seen more since I was a kid

817
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,260
We can't just

818
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,060
Agree easily

819
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,260
There must be another way

820
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,860
And even without him

821
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,860
With our strength

822
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,660
It's no problem to make this website

823
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,660
Princess

824
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,260
Full of confidence

825
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,260
You are not angry at all

826
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,860
Why should I be angry

827
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,060
You usually look down on this

828
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,060
Can't afford that

829
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,260
Why touch a little harder

830
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:05,860
You dare not go

831
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,860
Is it useful to be angry

832
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,460
For this project

833
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,860
Who is the most dedicated

834
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,460
Who stays up all day

835
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,660
Who plans and plans

836
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,060
Who built the framework

837
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,460
How can you not be angry at all

838
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,660
Can you joke like this

839
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,060
You love me

840
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,860
I'm telling you seriously

841
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,260
Our whole base

842
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,060
For this project

843
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,060
I have paid for so long

844
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,060
Even if you are not angry at yourself

845
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,460
You should be angry at us

846
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,060
Princess

847
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,660
You are really

848
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,860
Protected too well

849
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,660
People like you

850
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,660
You will never understand many things

851
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,060
You don't want to be like a person

852
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,260
Here with me

853
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,260
Say something big and cruel

854
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,460
Zhu Yan

855
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,260
Have you ever seen a bad guy

856
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,460
What do you mean

857
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,060
What is Zhang Xiaobei

858
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,260
More than 110,000 times worse than Zhang Xiaobei

859
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,660
There will always be in this world

860
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,460
Dried you up

861
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,660
Even bones are not left

862
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,860
I can't live without you

863
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,460
I said

864
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,060
You will never understand some things

865
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,860
What I experienced

866
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,060
If you want to take revenge on everything

867
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,660
In the second half of my life

868
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:47,860
Just revenge

869
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,860
One thing is enough

870
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,860
You don't care at all

871
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,060
I have no time to care

872
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,660
Kill the enemy

873
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,860
Self-harm

874
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,660
He is not worth my self-destruction

875
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,060
Li Xun

876
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,460
For you

877
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,260
Is anyone worth it

878
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,460
I thought you took us as friends

879
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,660
Princess

880
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,260
You really love to be moved

881
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,860
The company where Zhang Xiaobei is located

882
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,060
Co-operate with the school

883
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,660
He has a joint project with the school

884
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,260
I am not a friend

885
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,260
I am not a friend

886
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,260
I am not a friend

887
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,260
I am not a friend

888
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,260
I am not a friend

889
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,860
It's useless to force a confrontation

890
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,060
Go back to work

891
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,260
Wait for me one day

892
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,460
Li Xun

893
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,860
The base is yours

894
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,460
The project of Lan Guan is also yours

895
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,260
You have the right to attack and defend

896
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,060
I also have the right to quit

897
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,260
I also have the right to quit

898
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,660
Who does Zhang Xiaobei think he is

899
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,060
It seems that we are playing a trick

900
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,860
Why should we give up

901
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,060
Li Xun

902
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,260
You will have a way, right

903
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,660
No wonder that website has expired

904
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,660
When Zhang Xiaobei finds that he is not good enough

905
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,260
I will never be easy to follow up

906
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,260
I am not a friend

907
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,260
I am not a friend

908
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,260
I am not a friend

909
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,260
I am not a friend

910
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,260
I am not a friend

911
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,260
I am not a friend

912
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,260
I am not a friend

913
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,260
I am not a friend

914
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,260
I am not a friend

915
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,260
I am not a friend

916
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,260
I am not a friend

917
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,260
I am not a friend

918
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:39,260
I am not a friend

919
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,260
I am not a friend

920
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,260
I am not a friend

921
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:42,260
I am not a friend

922
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,260
I am not a friend

923
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,260
I am not a friend

924
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,260
I am not a friend

925
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,260
I am not a friend

926
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,260
I am not a friend

927
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,260
I am not a friend

928
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,260
I am not a friend

929
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,260
I am not a friend

930
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,260
I am not a friend

931
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,260
I am not a friend

932
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,260
I am not a friend

933
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,260
I am not a friend

934
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,260
I am not a friend

935
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:56,460
I am not a friend

936
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,460
I am not a friend

937
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:58,460
I am not a friend

938
00:43:58,460 --> 00:43:59,460
I am not a friend

939
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,460
I am not a friend

940
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:01,460
I am not a friend

941
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,460

947
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:08,460
I am not a friend

948
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,460
I am not a friend

949
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:10,460
I am not a friend

950
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:11,460
I am not a friend

951
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:12,460
I am not a friend

952
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:13,460
I am not a friend

953
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,460
I am not a friend

954

I am not a friend

955
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,460
I am not a friend

956
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,460
I am not a friend

957
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,460
I am not a friend

958
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:19,460
I am not a friend

959
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:20,460

961
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:22,460
I am not a friend

962
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,460

963
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,460

965
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:26,460
I am not a friend

966
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:27,460
