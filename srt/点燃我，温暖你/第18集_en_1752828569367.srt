00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if the light is very bright

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will still watch over that vast vast land

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless atmosphere

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day, the lens is a little bit yellow

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast night?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I burn up the night just for you to remember

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How everything was in the beginning

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The wind is like a wild grass

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The mountain is broken, but you're still by my side

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Everything is the original look

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000

Yuxing

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Thank you for coming out for me today

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'll wait for you in Wenshan Lake at ten o'clock tomorrow morning

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You must come, I have something to tell you

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You really want to go

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Go back and rest, I'm tired all day

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Why don't you refuse

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Give me more time to refuse

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's go

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Li Xun, you did a good job, so handsome

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Li Xun, I love you, so handsome

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I love you

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Thanks for coming for me today

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll wait for you in Wenshan Lake at ten o'clock in the morning tomorrow

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You must come, I have something to tell you

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Hello

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Ellen, save me

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
No

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Is it related to Li Xun?

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Tell it

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
How do you know it was her

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,760
What?

43
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,080
Is it related to him?

44
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,520
Yes.

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,960
Tell me.

46
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,360
He was dumped, right?

47
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,560
What kind of person is she?

48
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,560
She's pretty.

49
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,360
What do you think now?

50
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,240
Zhen Di.

51
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,480
I have a question.

52
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,160
If a girl confesses first,

53
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,880
will she be looked down upon?

54
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,320
If it's Li Xun,

55
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,560
will she be looked down upon?

56
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,880
It's hard for you.

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,400
How does she look?

58
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,000
Compared to Liu Sisi?

59
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,760
She's pretty.

60
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,080
You're almost like

61
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,560
Li Xun's little tail.

62
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
How can you still have time

63
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,680
to make other girls have a chance?

64
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,360
I've been too busy these days.

65
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,560
I'm careless.

66
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,160
I'll give you ten words.

67
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,520
First, you hide.

68
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,840
Then you're single.

69
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,440
But what if I start with a firecracker?

70
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,880
I'll give you another word.

71
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,000
Men are like the dishes in the canteen.

72
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,520
They don't do much.

73
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,800
You'll be gone if you go late.

74
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,400
But I think that Xun

75
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,720
is not the type he likes.

76
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,600
What type does he like?

77
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
If you can know,

78
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,920
don't give yourself

79
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,920
any love questions or hotline.

80
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,520
Li Xun looks free.

81
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,760
It's not easy to accept others.

82
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,840
Love is his weakness.

83
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,720
So think about it.

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,120
If you confess,

85
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,560
don't betray him.

86
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,120
Ren Di,

87
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,760
do me a favor.

88
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,400
What kind of hairstyle do you want?

89
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,400
Try them all.

90
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,120
Okay.

91
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,440
Ready.

92
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,480
Do you think I look good?

93
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,600
Now look at me.

94
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,040
You can go to the auditorium

95
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,560
with your tea or veil.

96
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,440
Are you seeking for trouble?

97
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,360
I feel bad.

98
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,360
What brings you here so late?

99
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,520
I'll go help you bring something to eat out here.

100
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,080
You can work on this,

101
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,600
why are we all confessing this early?

102
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,040
Hurry.

103
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,160
Go!

104
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,120
Okay.

105
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,120
You think I'm a perfect match for him.

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Sorry, sorry.

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,760
Don't worry.

108
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,520
I'm in a hurry.

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,120
Sir, please have a drink first.

110
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,880
We're sorry.

111
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,720
Sorry.

112
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,040
Why did Zhao Tian do that?

113
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
Look at his face.

114
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,880
Take the car!

115
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,860
Let's go!

116
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,960
Mr. Zhao,

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,400
we...

118
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,960
We need to go.

119
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,800
You have a driver.

120
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,600
You need to go back.

121
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,280
Why does Zhao Tian go toWelcome realised location too?

122
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,200
I haven't talked with him.

123
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,920
He's啦.

124
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,600
He's вместе with Zhang Wanаю.

125
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,080
Then Connecticut will be back.

126
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,280
The end of the world is with you

127
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,800
Believe me, fate is clear

128
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,920
I'll stay behind you

129
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,960
Falling you

130
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,720
If love can be a little warmer

131
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,600
This dream will automatically come true

132
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,720
After you wake up, I'll leave you alone

133
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,600
Don't leave, it's not a journey

134
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,520
Catch the silence

135
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,520
Shimmering

136
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,360
Meixue

137
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,760
I care about you too much

138
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,080
It's over. He left with Xulina

139
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,280
Why don't you wait for me?

140
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,840
Zhuo Yin

141
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,680
Cause I believe I love you

142
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,640
True love will take its course

143
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,840
I'm by your side

144
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,360
Spending a long time with you

145
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,960
Cause I believe I want you

146
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,440
True love will take its course

147
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,920
That hot fire

148
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:39,840
You always stay with me

149
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,320
You choose me

150
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,920
I will never betray you

151
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,040
What did you say?

152
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,000
What do you want to do with me?

153
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,400
Yishun

154
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,240
You choose me

155
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,600
I will never betray you

156
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,240
Hug me

157
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,080
You hug me, you will die

158
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,520
Will die

159
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,040
Thank you

160
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,080
When are you going to tell my parents?

161
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,080
How do you do know

162
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,360
Really?

163
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,080
Wait

164
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,040
I don't know how you've been there.

165
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,040
Don't know how I've been there.

166
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,040
It's been so long ago.

167
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,040
I've been here so long.

168
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,040
Why are you smiling?

169
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,040
I'm anxious.

170
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,040
Who's anxious?

171
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,040
Who's anxious?

172
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,040
Who's anxious?

173
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,540
Who?

174
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,540
Who?

175
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,540
I have my king.

176
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,540
I'm his son.

177
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,540
I'm willing to shout for him.

178
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,540
I'm willing to fight for him.

179
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,540
Hurry up.

180
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,540
I understand your feelings.

181
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,540
But the retirement has ended.

182
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,540
Yes.

183
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,540
Chen Tao is a very good kid.

184
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,540
I believe he can get into the school's graduate school

185
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,540
with his own efforts.

186
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,540
Goodbye.

187
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,540
See you.

188
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,540
Teacher, you want to see me?

189
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,540
Have you seen the list of the students in the public room downstairs?

190
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,540
Not yet.

191
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,540
Why isn't Fang Shu Miao here?

192
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,540
Hello, Miao Miao.

193
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,540
Where are you?

194
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,540
I'll tell you when I get back.

195
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,540
I'm handling a blood case in the hospital.

196
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,540
Blood case?

197
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,540
Hu Meng Xin.

198
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,540
You're so smart.

199
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,540
You're about to graduate.

200
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,540
You should be punished.

201
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,540
I don't think you need to take the test.

202
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,540
He's so timid.

203
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,540
He even made a report about this.

204
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,540
You're the most timid one.

205
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,540
You've been beaten up like this.

206
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,540
I'm so angry.

207
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,540
Did I ask you to help me?

208
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,540
I just can't stand it.

209
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,540
You're so annoying.

210
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,540
You're the one who wrote the paper.

211
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,540
We're both in the school now.

212
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,540
Are you happy?

213
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,540
Please listen to the second window.

214
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,540
There's food and milk.

215
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,540
You can go back and watch the food.

216
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,540
You're leaving?

217
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,540
What else?

218
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,540
Your brain is broken and your legs are broken.

219
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,540
And I have to send you back to the dorm?

220
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,540
Okay.

221
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,540
You haven't come in yet?

222
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,540
Who's calling?

223
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,540
What's going on?

224
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,540
I think that scumbag broke up with me.

225
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,540
He removed my name

226
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,540
from the paper we wrote together.

227
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,540
Is it necessary?

228
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,540
At least he gave you a chance.

229
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,540
He did it on purpose.

230
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,540
He wanted me to be a local

231
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,540
when he was with me.

232
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,540
But he didn't get anything

233
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,540
when he was with me.

234
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,540
Don't go to the club.

235
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,540
The world is clear.

236
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,540
Zhang Zhicheng,

237
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,540
are you a man?

238
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,540
You're being a man now.

239
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,540
You're going too far.

240
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,540
Listen to me.

241
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,540
You go to the student office tomorrow morning

242
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,540
and get rid of Wu Mengxin's punishment.

243
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,540
But you said that

244
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,540
it's not necessary to be a man.

245
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,540
You're a man.

246
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,540
But you said that

247
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,540
people are really different.

248
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,540
Fang Zhongliang was in love

249
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,540
and became a half-teacher on the way to school.

250
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,540
Why did he go to Zhu Yun's place

251
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,540
and compare the two?

252
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,540
When are you and Li Xun

253
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,540
going to the health exam?

254
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,540
Tomorrow.

255
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,540
Come on.

256
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,540
Eat. Eat.

257
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,540
I'm starving.

258
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,540
I'm starving.

259
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,540
There are eggs.

260
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,540
I'm starving.

261
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,540
I'm starving.

262
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,540
I'm starving.

263
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,540
I'm starving.

264
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,540
I'm starving.

265
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,540
I'm starving.

266
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,540
I'm starving.

267
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,540
I'm starving.

268
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,540
I'm starving.

269
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,540
I'm starving.

270
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,540
I'm starving.

271
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,540
I'm starving.

272
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,540
I'm starving.

273
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,540
I'm starving.

274
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,540
I'm starving.

275
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,540
I'm starving.

276
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,540
I'm starving.

277
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,540
I'm starving.

278
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,540
I'm starving.

279
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,540
I'm starving.

280
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,540
I'm starving.

281
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,540
I'm starving.

282
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,540
I'm starving.

283
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,540
I'm starving.

284
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,540
I'm starving.

285
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,540
I'm starving.

286
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,540
I'm starving.

287
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,540
I'm starving.

288
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,540
I'm starving.

289
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,540
I'm starving.

290
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,540
I'm starving.

291
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,540
I'm starving.

292
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,540
I'm starving.

293
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,540
I'm starving.

294
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,540
I'm starving.

295
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,540
I'm starving.

296
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,540
I'm starving.

297
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,540
I'm starving.

298
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,540
I'm starving.

299
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,540
I'm starving.

300
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,540
I'm starving.

301
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,540
I'm starving.

302
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,540
I'm starving.

303
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,540
I'm starving.

304
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,540
I'm starving.

305
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,540
I'm starving.

306
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,540
I'm starving.

307
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,540
I'm starving.

308
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,540
I'm starving.

309
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,540
I'm starving.

310
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,540
I'm starving.

311
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,540
I'm starving.

312
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,540
I'm starving.

313
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,540
I'm starving.

314
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,540
I'm starving.

315
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,540
I'm starving.

316
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,540
I'm starving.

317
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,540
Hello, Ren Di.

318
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,540
Have you finished your exam?

319
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,540
Tell Li Zhao Yuan and I that

320
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,540
the house is booked.

321
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,540
I've paid for it.

322
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,540
What house?

323
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,540
The office.

324
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,540
He's going to the office?

325
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,540
Yes, he's going to start a company.

326
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,540
Don't you know?

327
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,540
You're here.

328
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,540
Why didn't you go to the exam?

329
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,540
Today?

330
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,540
You didn't plan to stay in the hospital, did you?

331
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,540
When did I say I was going to study?

332
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,540
I'm going to start a business.

333
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,540
Then you can go.

334
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,540
I'm going to start a business.

335
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,540
I'm going to start a business.

336
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,540
I'm going to start a business.

337
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,540
Then why didn't you plan to stay in the hospital?

338
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,540
To start a company.

339
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,540
Why didn't you tell me?

340
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,540
There's no one in the bus.

341
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,540
What did I say?

342
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,540
You even found a place.

343
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,540
Ren Di knows that you're going to the new office.

344
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,540
I don't know about it.

345
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,540
Isn't it ridiculous?

346
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,540
This is called the storm center, isn't it?

347
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,540
Didn't you want to arrange it so you could talk to you?

348
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,540
You've arranged it, then you'll tell my mom.

349
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,540
What's your logic?

350
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,540
Have you asked me?

351
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,540
Have you ever thought about if I give up the health insurance and start a business with you?

352
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,540
What would my mom do?

353
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,540
What would it be?

354
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,540
She would kill me.

355
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,540
Did you never plan to have me?

356
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,540
Li Xue.

357
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,540
I always feel that I'm very close to you.

358
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,540
But I still can't understand you.

359
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,540
I heard everything from others.

360
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,540
I'm just like a map.

361
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,540
I'm your girlfriend.

362
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,540
I want to stand in the same place in your future.

363
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,540
Is this too much?

364
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,540
Zhou Yue.

365
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,540
Zhou Yue.

366
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,540
I'm sorry.

367
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,540
I'm so sorry.

368
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,540
You're so kind.

369
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,540
You're so kind, Zhou Yue.

370
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,540
You said that you would shake my heart for her.

371
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,540
What's wrong?

372
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,540
Now you're afraid of the king?

373
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,540
Don't give me this.

374
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,540
Can you not follow me?

375
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,540
You have to roast the fish later.

376
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,540
It's none of your business.

377
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,540
Have a meal after the roast.

378
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,540
I'm not free.

379
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,540
What's wrong?

380
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,540
My waist is sore.

381
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,540
I'll pick you up after the roast.

382
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,540
What?

383
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,540
Eat some vegetables.

384
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,540
I'm not free.

385
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,540
Eat together.

386
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,540
I can't eat.

387
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,540
Eat together.

388
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,540
No.

389
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,540
Eat.

390
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,540
No.

391
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,540
Rock, paper, scissors.

392
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,540
Who said that?

393
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,540
Rock, paper, scissors.

394
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,540
Rock, paper, scissors.

395
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,540
Okay.

396
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,540
Let's go.

397
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,540
Okay.

398
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,540
You can't say that.

399
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,540
Be careful.

400
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,540
Hold me tight.

401
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,540
Be careful.

402
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,540
Be careful.

403
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,540
Stop.

404
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,540
Put your hands here.

405
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,540
Press.

406
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,540
Are you ready?

407
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,540
Really?

408
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,540
Really.

409
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,540
I'm ready.

410
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,540
You brought me here to eat?

411
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,540
This is our new company.

412
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,540
New company.

413
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,540
Really?

414
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,540
Really.

415
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,540
To make sure that you are the first person

416
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,540
to see the new company,

417
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,540
I moved here myself.

418
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,540
I think you just can't bear to move.

419
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,540
Now the company is established.

420
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,540
You have to pay all the shareholders

421
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,540
to invest in the new company.

422
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,540
Who is the other shareholder?

423
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,540
I won't tell you who the other shareholder is.

424
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,540
He is a big shareholder anyway.

425
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,540
Just like me.

426
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,540
50% of the shares.

427
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,540
I don't have money.

428
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,540
I can only count on you.

429
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,540
Cai Ming.

430
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,540
Don't be so rude.

431
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,540
You just started,

432
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,540
and you are already renting such a big place.

433
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,540
You are back.

434
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,540
All the people outside are from other companies.

435
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,540
This is the shared office.

436
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,540
Only this room is our company.

437
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,540
Cool.

438
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,540
I have a question.

439
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,540
Do you know how to install furniture?

440
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,540
Are you a person?

441
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,540
You are always looking for me everywhere.

442
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,540
There is a shared storage room.

443
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,540
Help me bring the tools box here.

444
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,540
I am leaving.

445
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,540
Don't disturb the other companies.

446
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,540
Turn right.

447
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,540
What is this?

448
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,540
This is

449
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,260
a

450
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,540
house

451
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,540
for

452
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,540
people

453
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,540
who are in need.

454
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,540
This is

455
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,540
a house

456
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,540
for people

457
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,540
who are in need.

458
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,540
This is

459
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,540
a house

460
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,540
for people

461
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,540
who are in need.

462
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,540
LMP.

463
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,540
I asked you

464
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,540
what these two letters mean.

465
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,540
This is the name I gave the company.

466
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,540
Did you ask the shareholders

467
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,540
and you gave the name yourself?

468
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,540
This name has a meaning.

469
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,540
What meaning?

470
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,540
Lucky and Power.

471
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,540
It means luck.

472
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,540
What the hell?

473
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,540
Isn't it

474
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,540
lighter and princess?

475
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,540
What does it mean?

476
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,540
Princess.

477
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,540
What does it mean?

478
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,540
Princess.

479
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,540
Translate it.

480
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,540
What does it mean?

481
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,540
A firework in a princess's dress.

482
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,540
So you mean this way?

483
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,540
Isn't it?

484
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,540
I mean princess.

485
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,540
We have to have a way

486
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,540
to love ourselves.

487
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,540
Right?

488
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,540
You have to listen to me

489
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,540
on such an important thing.

490
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,540
From now on,

491
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,540
the name of our company

492
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,540
and all the explanations

493
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,540
are mine.

494
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,540
You say yours is yours.

495
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,540
Why?

496
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,540
I also have

497
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,540
a common share.

498
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,540
I have a meaning

499
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,540
for your shareholding structure.

500
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,540
It's so poor.

501
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,540
If we don't agree

502
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,540
and listen to each other,

503
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,540
who will we listen to?

504
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,540
What do you want?

505
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,540
What do you want?

506
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,540
I have to...

507
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,540
What do you want?

508
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,540
What do you want?

509
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,540
I don't want to say.

510
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,540
What do you want?

511
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,540
I don't want to say.

512
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,540
I don't want to say.

513
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,540
What do you want?

514
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,540
Am I right?

515
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,540
Am I right?

516
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,540
Am I right?

517
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,540
Say it.

518
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,540
You want to

519
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,540
accept your shareholding?

520
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,540
Yes.

521
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,540
Do you accept it?

522
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,540
Do you?

523
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,540
Yes.

524
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,540
How many shares?

525
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,540
Around 50.

526
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,580
Who's your listener?

527
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,300
Mine.

528
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:38,860
Whose listener?

529
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,340
Mine.

530
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:39,820
Say it again.

531
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,380
Whose listener?

532
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:40,780
Mine.

533
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,260
Whose listener?

534
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:41,660
Mine.

535
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,300
Who are you?

536
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,980
I'm Zhu...

537
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,700
Really?

538
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,700
Who are you?

539
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,180
What about me going to school?

540
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,020
You can go to school as you like.

541
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,740
You can find another job.

542
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,060
If you're going abroad,

543
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,340
I'll wait for you here.

544
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,300
Do whatever you want.

545
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,460
I'm your bottom.

546
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,100
Yixuan,

547
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,660
I want to start a business with you.

548
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,980
From the beginning of L.P.

549
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,740
This guy is not from our school, right?

550
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,700
But he looks like Li Xun.

551
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,420
Hey, girl.

552
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,020
Totally different.

553
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,580
Are you free?

554
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,940
I'm here to ask you something.

555
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,500
No.

556
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,700
Hey, girl.

557
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,540
I'm here to ask you something.

558
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:30,860
Who?

559
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,940
Do you have

560
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,540
a guy with golden hair?

561
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,060
There are many guys with golden hair in our school.

562
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,340
Who are you talking about?

563
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,500
The most handsome one.

564
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,020
What about your order?

565
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,020
The most handsome one.

566
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,300
The most awesome one.

567
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,060
Is he called Li Xun?

568
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:53,900
Smart.

569
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,500
Okay, come with me.

570
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,380
Come with me.

571
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,380
Who is it?

572
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,700
I'm here to see you.

573
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,860
Why are you here?

574
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,180
Where's your hair?

575
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,460
Where's your hair?

576
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,780
Where's your hair?

577
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,900
What are you doing here?

578
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,220
Nothing.

579
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,500
I'm just here to see you.

580
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,980
Why is your hair dyed like this?

581
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,180
None of your business.

582
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,660
It's really good.

583
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,420
It's very good.

584
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:31,900
Have some water.

585
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:33,940
Thank you.

586
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,180
Is it your sister-in-law?

587
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,620
She's always like that.

588
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,900
When did she cry?

589
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:46,780
Come on.

590
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,340
You're really her brother?

591
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,900
Of course.

592
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,660
Why don't you believe Li?

593
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,660
You're her cousin.

594
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,460
If Ding Mei is willing,

595
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,300
you can ask me,

596
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,220
the doctor,

597
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,660
not to talk to Bai Zhi.

598
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,980
He'll admit it.

599
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,820
Who's Bai Zhi?

600
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,740
We haven't seen each other for so long.

601
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,100
I can't come and see you.

602
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:10,740
No.

603
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,220
Why not?

604
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,500
How about we go out and eat something?

605
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,340
I'm not hungry.

606
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,820
I can't just eat.

607
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:19,940
Why?

608
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,620
Do you know what I'm doing?

609
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,540
I can't even tell.

610
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,620
You're a singer.

611
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,700
I can't do that.

612
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,980
I have to show you some moves.

613
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,820
Watch carefully.

614
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,980
Six, seven, eight.

615
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,780
Six, seven, eight.

616
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,660
Six, seven, eight.

617
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,300
This is the first time

618
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,740
I've ever felt

619
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,940
my vocabulary is so poor.

620
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,580
Six, seven, eight.

621
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,180
Okay, okay.

622
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,860
Stop jumping.

623
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,140
What's wrong with you?

624
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,620
Can you see it?

625
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,540
Is it筋 21?

626
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,180
The VIA computerigger called notification.

627
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,660
It kind of looks like the seven-ature test we had.

628
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,540
You learnt it, don't you?

629
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,020
Of course.

630
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,420
I even learned something.

631
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,820
Why are you talking about Xiangya?

632
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,380
I'm so good at dancing.

633
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,380
They are really brothers.

634
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,820
What do you think?

635
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,620
Pretty good.

636
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:55,660
Which part is good?

637
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,620
You have a good figure.

638
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,620
How tall are you?

639
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,220
I'm 1.85 meters.

640
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:08,900
Really good.

641
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,180
Don't tell her.

642
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,260
She dances Latin dance.

643
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,820
She can't find a dance partner because of her bad skills.

644
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,940
She's still dancing alone.

645
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,460
Bad skills?

646
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,780
I'm not bad at dancing.

647
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,380
I've been dancing Latin dance for so many years.

648
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,420
You didn't see me recently.

649
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,580
What are you doing here?

650
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,380
I have something to talk to you.

651
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,100
No.

652
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,340
Think about it.

653
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,660
I can't even think about it.

654
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,500
Xu Yan.

655
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,060
I'm doing this for you.

656
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,700
Sheng Jingzhu.

657
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,740
Sheng Jingzhu.

658
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:57,260
앸

659
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:04,620
We haven't got in touch

660
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,300
since the school exiled us.

661
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,060
Do you understand?

662
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,460
I left with the door open.

663
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,140
What's going on?

664
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,300
Nothing.

665
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,540
What did he want to tell you?

666
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,860
You didn't listen to him.

667
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,020
Nothing.

668
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,620
What's your relationship with him?

669
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,060
Nothing.

670
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,420
Then why did he come to you?

671
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,540
Let's go.

672
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:41,900
What's wrong?

673
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:43,980
Why are you not leaving?

674
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,860
You're like this again.

675
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,500
Li Xue,

676
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,420
you're not alone now.

677
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,980
You have to communicate with me.

678
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,380
I understand.

679
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:00,660
Let's go.

680
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:02,980
Where are we going?

681
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,580
Communicate.

682
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,180
Let's go home and slowly communicate.

683
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,980
But you still treat him like a friend.

684
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,780
I'm not going.

685
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,740
But you still treat him like a friend.

686
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,740
I'm not going.

687
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,700
I have to go to work.

688
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,180
I need a person to talk to me.

689
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,100
Isn't that just right?

690
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,220
What did Fu Yizhou want to tell you?

691
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,060
What can I say?

692
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,140
His father wants to invest in

693
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,060
the technology industry.

694
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,260
He wants to invest in me.

695
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,260
But this is a good thing.

696
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,260
Why didn't he agree?

697
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,300
I'm now very happy.

698
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,180
Good night.

699
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,260
Good night.

700
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,540
carrots

701
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,540
Princess.

702
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:57,660
Do you know

703
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,100
where my favorite place is?

704
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:00,780
There.

705
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,340
Can you talk things out?

706
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,460
Look.

707
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,100
You always want to show up early.

708
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,780
You're always so busy.

709
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,900
It's like signing a contract with someone.

710
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,460
But you know what?

711
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,780
It's hard to do things

712
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,460
according to the contract.

713
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,020
You're quite like that Fei Zhuo.

714
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,420
Am I?

715
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,340
Yes.

716
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,780
We were more alike when we were kids.

717
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,340
The first big income in my life

718
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,460
was from his style.

719
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,540
I was in the third year of high school.

720
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,140
He had an important exam.

721
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,020
I went there for him.

722
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,620
I got full marks in the whole department.

723
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,700
He gave me 1,000 yuan.

724
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,020
That much?

725
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,300
But I didn't have enough experience.

726
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,460
I was caught.

727
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,860
When the high school exam was held,

728
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,340
his dad threatened him

729
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,700
to stop dancing

730
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,900
if he couldn't get a degree.

731
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,540
You know what happened after that.

732
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,500
I knew it.

733
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,660
Because I had a relationship

734
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,780
with your mom.

735
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,300
That was the first time I saw you.

736
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,860
Through your window,

737
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,300
I saw many balloons

738
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:23,780
and strips hanging in the room.

739
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,420
Everyone said it was effective.

740
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:30,820
It becomes one of them.

741
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,140
Fried bread another day

742
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,660
just to eat it.

743
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,580
It doesn't help being that exaggerate.

744
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:48,220
Andoteuram Tetử

745
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,860
Viennese of your generation

746
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,860
Xu Tian LI wanna belong to the company

747
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,340
Fuyuzhuo's father

748
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,040
He just developments

749
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,980
The business is quite big

750
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,260
But he might also be able to see

751
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,280
In the next few years, physical industry

752
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,820
concerted

753
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,340
It should be inmates

754
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,800
Compete a little

755
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,420
I heard he digs many

756
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,080
frames in IT industry

757
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,260
But he himself

758
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,140
totally不同

759
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,380
so why did he

760
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,440
come to you

761
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,700
Let the person who can control it

762
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,580
book a stall for him.

763
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,100
You'd better not go.

764
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,500
You're so cute.

765
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:51,980
Are you still angry?

766
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,020
You've said so much.

767
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,220
You've wasted time.

768
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,780
It's not wasting time.

769
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,900
It's communication.

770
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,380
Communication?

771
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,140
I won't send you back later.

772
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,660
I'm going out tonight.

773
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,460
What are you going to do?

774
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,540
I'm going to help that idiot.

775
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,460
I think he's not smart.

776
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,820
And he's not very self-reliant.

777
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:21,740
What?

778
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,780
Didn't you say communication?

779
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,460
You're here to be self-reliant?

780
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,140
I found a rule.

781
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,220
What rule?

782
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,940
Someone seems to be good to

783
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,060
his own brother.

784
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,260
I also found a rule.

785
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:46,940
What rule?

786
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,220
I have to be better to my brother.

787
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:51,780
Call one.

788
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:54,540
Call one.

789
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:54,980
No.

790
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:55,900
Call one.

791
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,340
Right?

792
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,100
Right?

793
00:37:59,100 --> 00:37:59,980
Right?

794
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,220
I'll never regret it,

795
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,860
even if what your dad friendship is,

796
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,740
it's still pretty.

797
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,420
I don't think she's reliable.

798
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,940
She hasn't made any friends.

799
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,660
You're close to me.

800
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,580
Hi, sister.

801
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,580
You're here.

802
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,140
I'm Zhu Yun.

803
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,420
You finally figured it out

804
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,100
and put the phone number in my bag.

805
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:18,820
Thanks.

806
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,940
You're the one who took the assistant.

807
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,620
I have no choice.

808
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,780
I have to go to the county to save the country.

809
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,740
I just saw you dancing there.

810
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,580
You really look like what your uncle said.

811
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,140
What?

812
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,140
Like a electric pole?

813
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,660
It's okay.

814
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,980
I'm used to it.

815
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,020
I came to see me yesterday.

816
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,420
And you told me a lot about

817
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,220
what happened between you two.

818
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,020
What?

819
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,580
She said you were after her.

820
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:55,820
And you were after her.

821
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,420
You worked so hard.

822
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:01,180
She didn't have any idea about this.

823
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,980
But she was so happy with you.

824
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,100
She couldn't get away with it.

825
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,740
So she agreed to it.

826
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,900
You're so stubborn.

827
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,740
Although I'm not that exaggerated,

828
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,260
I can probably guess

829
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,260
how she introduced me to you.

830
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,060
Like telling a story.

831
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,620
She only knows how to say the lines.

832
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,140
She never talks about details.

833
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:25,060
Because she never gets down.

834
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:28,860
Especially when she's in front of you.

835
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,140
But why do you always call her Xun?

836
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,020
Is this your special name?

837
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,460
Has she ever told you about us?

838
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,860
About what?

839
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,060
Sister.

840
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,260
My name is Zhu Yun.

841
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,860
Do you want to know

842
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,060
how we met?

843
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,340
We met on a trip when we were kids.

844
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,300
It's so cute.

845
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:51,980
How did we meet?

846
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,940
You have to promise me one thing.

847
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,900
You'd better not say it.

848
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,500
Who knows if you're telling the truth?

849
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,660
I'm sure it's true.

850
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,420
Who's the witness?

851
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,900
The bigger the heart,

852
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,500
the bigger the truth.

853
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,580
Li Xun is right.

854
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,220
Zhen Zhen is a fool.

855
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,020
Okay, okay, okay.

856
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:14,940
I believe you.

857
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,380
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.

858
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,740
Create a comment to lord Yan.

859
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,300
I'll give you a 맛있 salary.

860
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,940
How did she tell you

861
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,540
we knew each other?

862
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,340
Differently.

863
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,300
She's that close.

864
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,860
But she made it a deal.

865
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:39,420
It's close to the expectations.

866
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,460
Back then,

867
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:45,140
we graduated on the best high school in the city.

868
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,140
I met him.

869
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,460
Come on.

870
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:05,620
Wait.

871
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:06,900
Your bag.

872
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,420
Go get it.

873
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,100
Don't take it.

874
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,060
Your homework is in it.

875
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:11,660
You're a thief.

876
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:12,380
You're still doing homework.

877
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:12,940
What are you doing?

878
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:13,700
You sit down.

879
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,500
I'm writing homework.

880
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,140
Give me your bag.

881
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,780
I can help you.

882
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,340
21 pieces.

883
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,620
That's too expensive.

884
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,260
Too expensive?

885
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,100
50 yuan for one piece.

886
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,500
Plus a copy of the test.

887
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,340
How's that?

888
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:31,940
Chen Qiao.

889
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:32,580
I...

890
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:33,500
I don't have it.

891
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,340
Let me help you.

892
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:37,700
Hello.

893
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:38,860
What are you doing?

894
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:39,500
Where are you?

895
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,420
Nothing.

896
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:41,340
I'm taking a walk.

897
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:42,980
Later,

898
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:43,740
she kept helping me

899
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:44,780
to earn money by writing homework.

900
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,460
She seemed to be very short-tempered

901
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,460
in her senior year.

902
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,340
Then I found out

903
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,460
her mother was cancerous.

904
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:53,860
She was pregnant.

905
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:12,420
Happy New Year.

906
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:15,940
Happy New Year.

907
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,020
I've decided to go abroad.

908
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:19,700
I'm going to Xueli Na.

909
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,340
Le Le.

910
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,300
Will you give me a chance?

911
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:25,700
She said

912
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:27,580
she likes you.

913
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,180
I'm sorry.

914
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,060
I'm sorry.

915
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:13,980
I'm sorry.

916
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:14,980
I'm sorry.

917
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:15,980
I'm sorry.

918
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:16,980
I'm sorry.

919
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:17,980
I'm sorry.

920
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:18,980
I'm sorry.

921
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:19,980
I'm sorry.

922
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:20,980
I'm sorry.

923
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:21,980
I'm sorry.

924
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:22,980
I'm sorry.

925
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:23,980
I'm sorry.

926
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:24,980
I'm sorry.

927
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:25,980
I'm sorry.

928
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:26,980
I'm sorry.

929
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:27,980
I'm sorry.

930
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:28,980
I'm sorry.

931
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:29,980
I'm sorry.

932
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:30,980
I'm sorry.

933
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:31,980
I'm sorry.

934
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,980
I'm sorry.

935
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:33,980
I'm sorry.

936
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:34,980
I'm sorry.

937
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:35,980
I'm sorry.

938
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:36,980
I'm sorry.

939
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:37,980
I'm sorry.

940
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:38,980
I'm sorry.

941
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:39,980
I'm sorry.

942
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:40,980
I'm sorry.

943
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:41,980
I'm sorry.

944
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:42,980
I'm sorry.

945
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:43,980
I'm sorry.

946
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:44,980
I'm sorry.

947
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:45,980
I'm sorry.

948
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:46,980
I'm sorry.

949
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:47,980
I'm sorry.

950
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:48,980
I'm sorry.

951
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:49,980
I'm sorry.

952
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:50,980
I'm sorry.

953
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:51,980
I'm sorry.

954
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:52,980
I'm sorry.

955
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:53,980
I'm sorry.

956
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:54,980
I'm sorry.

957
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:55,980
