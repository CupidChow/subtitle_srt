2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if the light is very bright

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will still watch over that vast vast land

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless atmosphere

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day, the lens is a little bit yellow

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast night?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I burn up the night just for you to remember

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How everything was in the beginning

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The wind and the color of the night are like wild grass

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The mountains are broken, but you are still by my side

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Everything is how it was in the beginning

The King of Blaze

25
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Is your waist okay?

26
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It hurts

27
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Where? Here

28
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Don't touch

29

No

30
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000

Don't move

33
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Slow down

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What did you eat this morning?

35
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I ate buns

36
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll take you to the toilet

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Don't lock

38
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Okay

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Okay

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Don't move

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'll help you up

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Don't move

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'll do it myself

44
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Don't be angry

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You are also very young

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You are also very young

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Morning

48
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You continue

49
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Help me

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
No

51
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm sorry

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
No

53
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
No

54
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You slept at the company last night

55
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What are you thinking?

56
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
He slept in the company.

57
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000

He slept in the company.

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I want to sleep in the company.

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Sleep again.

61
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You didn't say a word.

62
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
They're right.

63
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He slept in the company.

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He slept in the company.

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Your shirt is still with me.

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
When will I return it to you?

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Don't think about the autumn in the fairy tale

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's a destined encounter

97
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Let me feel your care

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Your simple wish

99
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
A blink of an eye

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The time of the earth

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No longer afraid of falling into the world

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
With you by my side

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Put it on.

104
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Don't be afraid.

105
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
A little love

106
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Don't think about the autumn in the fairy tale

107
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's a destined encounter

108
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Let me feel your care

109
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Your simple wish

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
A blink of an eye

111
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The time of the earth

112
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
No longer afraid of falling into the world

113
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
With you by my side

114
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Put it on.

115
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Good night

116
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It turns out to be your ring

117
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Hello, master

118
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Ok, I'm at the door now.

119
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Hurry up, hurry up, this way.

120
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Hurry up.

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Be careful, don't touch people.

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Come, be careful.

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Come here, this position.

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Hurry up, hurry up, this way.

125
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Put it here, this way.

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yes, yes, yes.

127
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Ok, follow this bridge.

128
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Put it along this bridge.

129
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Ok.

130
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:15,460
Master, isn't this on the

131
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,460
How to dismantle

132
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,000
Who knows

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You are fast

134
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We have to change

135
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
No way

136
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Or you go over there

137
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Don't touch you

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
This one, this one, change

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Ok, come

140
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Be careful

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Put it right, put it right

142
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Come

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Look at the layout

144
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Come, be careful

145
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Give it to me

146
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Zhu Yue, it's really you.

147
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What's up

148
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
How about it

149
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Did our seven countries win and lose?

150
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Seven countries win and lose

151
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You don't say

152
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I thought it was our invincible

153
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The same type of game

154
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Anyone can develop

155
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But whether it can be successful

156
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It depends on fate

157
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
How about it

158
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Your game

159
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Is there any movement now?

160
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Do you know

161
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
We put a lot of publicity fees

162
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
To make this game

163
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Do you know

164
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
How many sound effects we have

165
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Play with me

166
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You and Li Xun

167
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Don't be naive

168
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Think I'm the same as I was in college

169
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Can only rely on ability

170
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Can only be out

171
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You know our two games

172
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The biggest difference is there

173
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You only have that

174
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
A little bit of small money

175
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That little weak mouth

176
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Once it's gone, everything is gone

177
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But we can still make money

178
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
As long as we

179
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Take a little bit of care

180
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Can make you

181
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Press it to the core

182
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
This is a joke

183
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I know

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You are not afraid of me

185
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I know

186
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You must be scolding me now

187
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Despicable and shameless

188
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Many people have been scolded

189
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Scolding LP

190
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Superb

191
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
No bottom line

192
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's okay

193
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Anyway, this world

194
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Is a failure in the end

195
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
People

196
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Have always been the winners

197
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Zhu Yue

198
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Do you think

199
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
This scene

200
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So familiar

201
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Are you done

202
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
gone

203
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm done

204
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Your car

205
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Half a year

206
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Ran more than 50,000 kilometers

207
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
A bit more

208
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What is this

209
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Watch the airwaves

210
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
OK OK OK

211
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Dong Zong knows to sell cars

212
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It seems to be

213
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
We just talked about it

214
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
In Jianghu

215
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I tell you

216
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You are a business man, you know

217
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I spent 48,000 yuan on this car

218
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Why does Tong Feng sell cars

219
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Why sell cars

220
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
why

221
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Company difficulties

222
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Tianhe Company

223
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Our company

224
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Already in this situation

225
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
What do you think

226
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Cherish the working days now

227
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I guess our company

228
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's going to be a mess

229
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
This LP

230
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
To promote this seven countries

231
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's simply not worth the cost

232
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Now open a website

233
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Can see this net red face

234
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
This is really going to kill me

235
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I played this seven countries carefully

236
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Their content and martial arts are like a book

237
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But their system

238
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
There is no martial arts skill at all

239
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yes

240
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But i think

241
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
LP didn't want

242
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Seven countries go far

243
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Just a wave

244
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
How much can you earn

245
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Just this kind of bad thing

246
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
They did it before

247
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Good skill

248
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It just happened to be able to kill us

249
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The key is

250
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Their game compatibility is too strong

251
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
LP

252
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
In the total number of users in the country

253
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Is twelve

254
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So their gold coins

255
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Can be used

256
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Even if you don't play seven countries

257
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
They can still play other things

258
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
How do we compare this

259
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's not comparable at all

260
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I see this company

261
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You really have to ask

262
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Look at this

263
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Just don't come

264
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
This Zhang Fang

265
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Really has a stock

266
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Just two

267
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
One for each of us

268
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But Zhao Teng

269
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That selection

270
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The fix is not very good

271
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The code quality is not enough

272
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You have to change it again

273
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
OK, team leader

274
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
In fact, since you came

275
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
From the first day

276
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I know you are not ordinary

277
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So

278
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Although I am older than you

279
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But I always call you team leader

280
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Because of respect

281
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
But the world has not been so far

282
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Still bug

283
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Do you think this is necessary

284
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
OK, sister

285
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Face reality

286
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Come, let's do it

287
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Just respect yourself

288
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
In fact, you can put

289
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The dead horse of the five generals

290
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
For now

291
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's a miracle

292
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So

293
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I think we really tried our best

294
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
No regrets

295
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But no matter what

296
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
First ensure the update of the day

297
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'll go find Li Xu

298
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Do you usually play games

299
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Play games

300
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I don't play games

301
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
What are you playing

302
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yes, I don't play games that much

303
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I recently have a game

304
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Played a lot

305
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's about anime

306
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Play games

307
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You should watch my videos

308
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's a pretty fun game

309
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Really

310
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yes, and the image design inside it

311
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Special anime image

312
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
That's pretty good

313
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What are you talking about

314
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
That game

315
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Just talk about

316
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
An anime character adventure

317
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Then

318
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Really

319
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Your friend

320
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
OK

321
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Then you talk first

322
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I have a few bye bye

323
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Dong Siyang car

324
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Dong Siyang car

325
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Dong Siyang car is sold

326
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
The company is almost gone

327
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Why are you still here

328
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Now the publicity of the Seven Kingdoms

329
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's all over

330
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What can I do

331
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What do you do now

332
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
The bullets are all out

333
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Can you turn the corner in the middle

334
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Let nature take its course

335
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
What is nature take its course

336
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Don't do it if you don't have money

337
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Anyway

338
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Can't compare with the water supply of LP

339
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Instant damage

340
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
That's it

341
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Of course not

342
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You and Zhao Teng continue to make games

343
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Update the day after tomorrow

344
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What about you

345
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Continue to drink coffee here

346
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
This is the personal privacy of the staff

347
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Director Zhu

348
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Anything else

349
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm going to the bathroom

350
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Don't help me wash

351
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You are so free

352
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I won't wash it myself

353
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
What are you doing

354
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
This company is not closed yet

355
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What are you doing

356
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What are you doing

357
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Open house

358
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
No, Dong Liu

359
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You know our character

360
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
We are not people who love money

361
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm not a person

362
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm not a person

363
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm not a person

364
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm not a person

365
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm so just

366
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So just

367
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,880
I'm the one who taught you

368
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I told you

369
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,080
I amista

370
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,120
Good

371
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Not very good

372
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,800
I felt

373
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Dis hooks

374
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
principal

375
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I think

376
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
We have to find him

377
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
and settle it

378
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:52,060
We got the

379
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,300
Where might it be

380
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,860
I would like to ask...

381
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,980
For tonight's surprise,

382
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,600
there will be only a huge festivity.

383
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,400
Okay.

384
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,000
But right now,

385
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,280
Monster radio is going first.

386
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,480
filtered XZ spawn.

387
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,040
When we notice and act cute,

388
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,040
If the weather is like this, it will kill people again.

389
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,040
This is the first time we have a big reunion.

390
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,040
It's good. Don't jump to the bottom.

391
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,040
At this time, the reunion is four meters.

392
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,040
You don't understand.

393
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,040
The more the end is, the more we get closer to the world.

394
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
Right.

395
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,040
For example, comrade Zhang Fang,

396
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,040
as the director of HR,

397
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,040
the first one to shout out the pre-competition,

398
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,040
lead the way to shake the heart.

399
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,040
I call it management.

400
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,040
At this time, we can see who will be the leader.

401
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,040
Okay. You are still fishing.

402
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,040
Anyway, I am working with the company of Fly-Joy.

403
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,040
Right, Dong?

404
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,040
Go away.

405
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,040
Li Xun didn't sleep last night.

406
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,040
He can't sleep in the cafe.

407
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,040
No. He is working overtime in the company.

408
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,040
Go.

409
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,040
How long will it take?

410
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,040
Soon.

411
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,040
Where will we go?

412
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,040
You'll know when you're there.

413
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,040
Hello, Boss.

414
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,040
Wow.

415
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,040
Welcome.

416
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,040
Boss,

417
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,040
the room is ready.

418
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,040
I'll go to work.

419
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,040
Okay, go ahead.

420
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,040
Okay.

421
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,040
Let's stay here tonight.

422
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,040
No one can work today.

423
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,040
He's going to soak me in hot spring.

424
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,040
He'll soak me back.

425
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,040
I've spent a lot of money.

426
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,040
One by one.

427
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,040
You should have stayed a night.

428
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,040
You didn't bring anything.

429
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,040
What did I bring?

430
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,040
There are toiletries and hotels.

431
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,040
I've never stayed in a hotel.

432
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,040
Make-up?

433
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,040
You look so good.

434
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,040
It's better without makeup.

435
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
Right.

436
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,040
Okay, I'm not going back to my room.

437
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,040
Go and have dinner with me.

438
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,040
Go.

439
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,040
Let's go.

440
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,040
Today,

441
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,040
we're going to meet in a group.

442
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,040
I'll say a few words.

443
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,040
I'm sorry.

444
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,040
It's okay.

445
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,040
Don't worry.

446
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,040
Just go and have dinner with me.

447
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,040
Okay.

448
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,040
I'll go.

449
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,040
Okay.

450
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,040
Bye.

451
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,040
See you.

452
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,040
Bye.

453
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,040
You're so good.

454
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,040
You know the difference between work and work.

455
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,040
You're a bitch.

456
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,040
You don't know what you're doing.

457
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,040
You're a bitch.

458
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,040
Why am I a bitch?

459
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,040
I'm a bitch.

460
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,040
I'm a bitch.

461
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,040
You're a bitch.

462
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,040
You're a bitch.

463
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,040
I'm a bitch.

464
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,040
Okay.

465
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,040
I'm a bitch.

466
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,040
I'm a bitch.

467
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,040
I'm a bitch.

468
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,040
I'm a bitch.

469
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,040
I'm a bitch.

470
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,040
I'm a bitch.

471
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,040
I'm a bitch.

472
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,440
Don't be so arrogant. Drink.

473
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,280
Come on.

474
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,360
You're really good.

475
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,880
You're a good sister.

476
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,600
You're amazing.

477
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,200
Yes.

478
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,760
I can see that.

479
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,840
You're waiting for a hero to save you.

480
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,000
Come on. Give me a pour.

481
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,520
Give me a pour.

482
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,560
Come on. Another one.

483
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,320
No.

484
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,920
I'll do it.

485
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,560
Okay.

486
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,040
Come on.

487
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,880
Listen.

488
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,560
If a woman wants to drink,

489
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,440
she's amazing.

490
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,160
Listen.

491
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,800
Amazing.

492
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,280
If a woman can't drink,

493
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,560
we can't drink either.

494
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,240
No more.

495
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,000
Let's drink three cups of wine.

496
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,720
Okay.

497
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,600
Come on. Pour it for me.

498
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,680
disciples

499
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:50,840
Never mind

500
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,880
Is the character anuman?

501
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,600
It's very good

502
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,160
Let's

503
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,040
get this right.

504
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,840
Any more createdFire fridge?

505
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,000
No, I'll get some free coffee.

506
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,200
My opinion should be

507
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:32,800
a heavy set of

508
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,360
cheap, cheap

509
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,480
and local ones.

510
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,280
The choice is made.

511
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,280
You're just no better.

512
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,880
There's order.

513
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,080
You're doing a good job.

514
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,560
I'm doing well.

515
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,680
You've said that

516
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,760
this is

517
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,760
I was thinking

518
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,760
The plan didn't change quickly

519
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,760
I haven't retired yet

520
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,760
The airport is closed

521
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,760
I'll go to drive a taxi

522
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,760
Later I was fighting because of a buddy

523
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,760
I went in for a few years

524
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,760
After coming out

525
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,760
I don't want to drive this taxi anymore

526
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,760
I want to do something good

527
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,760
Just walk on the street

528
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,760
I remember that was a summer

529
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,760
It was hot that day

530
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,760
Like a fire

531
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,760
This is hot for me

532
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,760
Pass by a what

533
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,760
At the door of the IT company

534
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,760
That electric glass door

535
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,760
Open the air conditioner

536
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,760
Blow to ten meters away from me

537
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,760
You know, it was cool for me

538
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,760
Cool

539
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,760
I sit at the door

540
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,760
I said I blow the wind

541
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,760
What happened

542
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,760
The security came over

543
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,760
I drove me away

544
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,760
I thought at that time

545
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,760
I know what I did

546
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,760
I want to open an IT company

547
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,760
I just blow the air conditioner

548
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,760
No one coax me

549
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,760
Come come come

550
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,760
Come come come

551
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,760
I just blow the air conditioner

552
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,760
No one coax me

553
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,760
Come

554
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,760
Cheers

555
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,760
To be honest

556
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,760
I'm in this industry

557
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,760
Also

558
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,760
Also ten years old

559
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,760
Actually I want to work

560
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,760
Yes, my company has changed four or five

561
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,760
But I still want to do it

562
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,760
Good game

563
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,760
I thought this time

564
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,760
Invincible

565
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,760
Invincible

566
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,760
Yes yes

567
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,760
Invincible

568
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,760
I thought this time

569
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,760
Invincible

570
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,760
Can make some noise

571
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,760
Pity

572
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,760
Actually, think about it

573
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,760
You see

574
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,760
It's quite sad

575
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,760
We are such a small game

576
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,760
It's not easy to make some money

577
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,760
Make this kind of thing

578
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,760
You said

579
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,760
Why do you always drag us

580
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,760
Don't let go

581
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,760
I can go to the flower

582
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,760
You drink first

583
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,760
I'm back

584
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,760
No, I haven't left yet

585
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,760
Play with it

586
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,760
Afraid

587
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,760
Can't drink

588
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,760
No, I'm still young

589
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,760
This can't be out

590
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,760
Let's drink

591
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,760
I'm back

592
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,760
Because of us

593
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,760
Because Li Xun and I

594
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,760
Have a private feud with that company

595
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,760
Which company

596
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,760
LP

597
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,760
Two bosses of LP

598
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,760
One of them should be

599
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,760
Our college classmate

600
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,760
We started a business together before

601
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,760
Just LP

602
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,760
Li Xun was the leader

603
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,760
But in the early stages of the business

604
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,760
Something came out

605
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,760
You all know he went in

606
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,760
The reason he went in

607
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,760
Is that he closed the eyes of another boss

608
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,760
Didn't you all ask me

609
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,760
Why are you here

610
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,760
After Li Xun was released

611
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,760
The choice of Yin Cha Liang Cu

612
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,760
Start here

613
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,760
And I always stand on his side

614
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,760
That's it

615
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,760
Wait a minute

616
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,760
Wait a minute

617
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,760
Wait a minute

618
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,760
Wait a minute

619
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,760
I'm a little confused

620
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,760
Li Xun

621
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,760
Stunned

622
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,760
Why did he hit her

623
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,760
This is Li Xun's private matter

624
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,760
I can't say

625
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,760
Li Jiecheng is enemies

626
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,760
You mean the one who started the business

627
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,760
Li Xun

628
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,760
Correct

629
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,760
I knew it a long time ago

630
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,760
I knew it was wrong

631
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,760
I also told him

632
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,760
I said, are you a kid

633
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,760
Hidden

634
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,760
You pretend here

635
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,760
I said these

636
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
Just want to tell everyone

637
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,760
Whether LP is blackening us

638
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,760
Hit the teeth

639
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,760
This project can't be done

640
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,760
We will do the next one

641
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,760
If it doesn't work, we won't give up

642
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,760
So we will be with LP

643
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,760
LP has always been a mess

644
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,760
Just remember

645
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,760
What else can I do

646
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,760
We are now

647
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,760
It's already a team

648
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,760
At the worst, let's finish it together

649
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,760
If they don't come

650
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,760
Our company

651
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,760
Dongdong, don't be angry

652
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,760
At most, it will be a year or two

653
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,760
Right, we all know

654
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,760
We are now barefoot

655
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,760
Not afraid of wearing shoes

656
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,760
Right

657
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,760
Yes, nothing to say

658
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,760
I love to listen to this

659
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,760
Just remember

660
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,760
What are you afraid of

661
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,760
Is it

662
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,760
Our new Feiyang company

663
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,760
Just do it

664
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,760
This big waste

665
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,760
And fart

666
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,760
Do it

667
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,760
Hit him

668
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,760
Hit

669
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,760
Dongdong

670
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,760
I want to apologize to you

671
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,760
I'm sorry

672
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,760
We hid so many things

673
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,760
I thought after coming in

674
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,760
At least a year

675
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,760
They will have a movement

676
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,760
I didn't expect it to be so fast

677
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,760
You think

678
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,760
I can't see it

679
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,760
You two had a story

680
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,760
When did you know

681
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,760
Come from Li Jun

682
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
He looked for you

683
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,760
You know he's looking for me

684
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,760
You think I will let one

685
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,760
Just got out of the prison

686
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,760
Even a resume

687
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,760
People who can't get it

688
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,760
Enter my company

689
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,760
What did he tell you

690
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,760
You want to know

691
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,760
How does he say himself

692
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,760
Or how do you say

693
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,760
This

694
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,760
Dong Siyang gave me a room card

695
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,760
We didn't go wrong

696
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,760
Didn't go wrong

697
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,760
There are two rooms

698
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,760
There is another one

699
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,760
Which one do you want to choose yourself

700
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,760
Where are you going

701
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,760
Or I will open another room

702
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,760
Whatever

703
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,760
Did you put our things

704
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,760
I told Dong Siyang a long time ago

705
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,760
Dong Siyang is a smart person

706
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,760
I guessed it all

707
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,760
Do you still have to tell me

708
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,760
This photo has always been with him

709
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,760
He told me

710
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,760
Zhou Yun thinks too much

711
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,760
Sometimes naive

712
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,760
Love to be stupid

713
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,760
But absolutely capable

714
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,760
Especially loyal

715
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,760
Especially determined

716
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,760
You said you two

717
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,760
This matter

718
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,760
Others see it clearly

719
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,760
What are you doing here

720
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,760
This is life

721
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,760
This love is not easy

722
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,760
Just like playing games

723
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,760
Only this knife and sword

724
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,760
No love and hatred

725
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,760
Who said it was fun

726
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,760
Right

727
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,760
This layer of window paper

728
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,760
It's so hard to read

729
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,760
Are you cold

730
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,760
Isn't it cold standing

731
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,760
Cold

732
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,760
Come down

733
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,760
Why did you drink for me today

734
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,760
Self-righteous

735
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,760
Then Dong Siyang let you drink

736
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,760
I don't drink anymore

737
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,760
I really drank too much

738
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,760
Can you still walk

739
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,760
I won't leave if I can't leave

740
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,760
I can't leave

741
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,760
I can't leave

742
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,760
I can't leave

743
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,760
I can't leave

744
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,760
I can't leave

745
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,760
I can't leave

746
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,760
Why is my photo with you

747
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,760
Then put it on

748
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,760
I will deal with my stuff

749
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,760
Why is it your stuff

750
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,760
Otherwise yours

751
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,760
It's mine

752
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,760
OK

753
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,760
Go back and take it away

754
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,760
I will deal with my stuff

755
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,760
I will deal with my stuff

756
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,760
Little fool

757
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,760
Look at you

758
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,760
I remember when I was in school

759
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,760
I went to find you for homework

760
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,760
You are on the rooftop

761
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,760
Lying on the broken bench

762
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,760
He looked at me

763
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,760
Like now

764
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,760
Li Xun

765
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,760
Have you ever thought of me

766
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,760
You are not my friend

767
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,760
I don't know

768
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,760
What if you don't

769
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,760
I don't believe

770
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,760
I don't believe

771
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,760
You are thinking about the company now

772
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,760
You don't mention

773
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,760
I don't mention

774
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,760
What happened before

775
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,760
We just ignore each other

776
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,760
What's wrong

777
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,760
I told you before

778
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,760
I'll suffer losses anyway.

779
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,760
These are the old days.

780
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,760
I've forgotten about them.

781
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Just eat.

782
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,240
Thanks.

783
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,360
Or about hot lap早泡

784
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,520
Other unhappy people.

785
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,820
AOA trip

786
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,600
is boring.

787
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,480
If I do something,

788
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,400
he will blame me.

789
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,680
No.

790
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,440
Let's talk with him.

791
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:06,920
Please think it over.

792
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,720
What if he was wrong?

793
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,360
No.

794
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:14,960
I think you should

795
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,840
take him in and talk with him.

796
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,560
I have to.

797
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,120
I'm not ready to talk with him.

798
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,720
Bow over your head if you like him.

799
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,360
I need to.

800
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:24,680
Well,

801
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,040
totally agree.

802
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,200
Liu course will be director Scott sl malaria

803
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,800
Liu and reser found

804
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,080
Isn't it

805
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,060
Do you have pickles

806
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,620
Which bread is good

807
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,760
I found that there is something

808
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,800
You compatama

809
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,900
All don't equilibrium

810
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,600
Now is the most expensive time

811
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,160
It takes us to consume

812
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,580
Call this your routine

813
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,580
There's a backer, right?

814
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,580
I met Fang Zhijin that day.

815
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,580
He said he was coming for us.

816
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,580
He said our game

817
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,580
only has no profit.

818
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,580
He can surpass us

819
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,580
as long as he can just take the lead.

820
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,580
I really hate him.

821
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,580
But I didn't even scold him.

822
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,580
You're afraid of him?

823
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,580
That's right.

824
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,580
I'm afraid of him.

825
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,580
I hate him.

826
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,580
But I've hated him for so many years.

827
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,580
But I didn't do anything.

828
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,580
I can only be angry.

829
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,580
He bullied Xiao Yan.

830
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,580
I can only watch.

831
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,580
Then he hurt you.

832
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,580
I can only watch.

833
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,580
You're not afraid of Fang Zhijin.

834
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,580
You're just afraid

835
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,580
that we can't win this time.

836
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,580
If it weren't for me,

837
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,580
you wouldn't have taken revenge on him.

838
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,580
If I hadn't dragged you to the game,

839
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,580
Li Lan would not have been in trouble.

840
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,580
Zhiyun.

841
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,580
You think too much.

842
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:06,580
You only think about the facts.

843
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,580
In the end, you will only fail.

844
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,580
Don't worry.

845
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,580
Your fear of him

846
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,580
is far less than their fear of me.

847
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,580
I'm afraid of everything.

848
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,580
You're afraid of him.

849
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,580
So you've been following him for so many years.

850
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,580
And they're afraid of me.

851
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,580
So they stared at me as soon as I came out.

852
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,580
You don't have to worry

853
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,580
about what they're doing to us.

854
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,580
If they really

855
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,580
do what they want,

856
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,580
maybe I can't do anything

857
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,580
about them in the short term.

858
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,580
But they have to stare at me

859
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,580
and try to step on me.

860
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,580
This is an opportunity.

861
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,580
So it's fair.

862
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,580
You're afraid of him.

863
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,580
They're afraid of me.

864
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,580
Then who are you afraid of?

865
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,580
I'm not afraid of anyone.

866
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:12,580
Silly.

867
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:14,580
You haven't changed.

868
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:20,580
Each time, you always left.

869
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,580
After you wake up,

870
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,580
I want you to look at me.

871
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,580
Don't go.

872
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:28,580
Fate isn't a journey.

873
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:29,580
Do you still believe me?

874
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:34,580
I would believe you if you dare to say.

875
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,580
You are everything to me.

876
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:43,580
I can't help myself.

877
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,580
I'm too useless to you.

878
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:46,580
I still love him.

879
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,580
I'm waiting for the perfect look

880
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,580
I'm still waiting for the impossible

881
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,580
Gao Jianhong and Fang Zhijing

882
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,580
are planning to launch an excuse

883
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,580
This person needs to be investigated

884
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,580
Be careful he will give us a social situation

885
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,580
He knows Li Xun the best

886
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:02,580
I'll leave the painting here

887
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,580
If he succeeds in the market

888
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,580
I'll take the picture of the picture

889
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,580
and give him a son

890
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,580
You have a plan?

891
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,580
I'm waiting for the perfect look

892
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:14,580
I'm still waiting for the impossible

893
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:17,580
If love is too cold and cold

894
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:21,580
This dream will be pushed back automatically

895
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:25,580
Wake up and leave you alone

896
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:28,580
Don't leave, fate is not a map

897
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:31,580
Grab my hand

898
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:35,580
The soul is shining

899
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:39,580
You are my everything

900
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:43,580
The soul is not enough

901
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:46,580
I care too much about you

902
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,580
I'm waiting for the perfect look

903
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,580
I'm still waiting for the impossible

904
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,580
If love is too cold and cold

905
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,580
This dream will be pushed back automatically

906
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,580
Wake up and leave you alone

907
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:14,580
Don't leave, fate is not a map

908
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,580
Grab my hand

909
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,580
The soul is shining

910
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:20,580
You are my everything

911
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:22,580
I care too much about you

912
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,580
Don't leave, fate is not a map

913
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,580
Grab my hand

914
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,580
The soul is shining

915
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:30,580
You are my everything

916
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,580
I care too much about you

917
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:34,580
Don't leave, fate is not a map

918
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:36,580
Grab my hand

919
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,580
The soul will be pushed back automatically

920
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:40,580
Wake up and leave you alone

921
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:43,580
Don't leave, fate is not a map

922
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:47,580
Grab my hand

923
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,580
The soul is shining

924
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,580
You are my everything

925
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,580
I care too much about you

926
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:58,580
Don't leave, fate is not a map

927
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:01,580
Grab my hand

928
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:04,580
The soul is shining

929
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:05,580
I'm so tired.

930
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:06,580
I'm so tired.

931
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:07,580
I'm so tired.

932
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:08,580
I'm so tired.

933
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:09,580
I'm so tired.

934
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:10,580
I'm so tired.

935
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:11,580
I'm so tired.

I'm so tired.

938
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:14,580
I'm so tired.

939
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,580
I'm so tired.

940
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:16,580
I'm so tired.

941
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:17,580
I'm so tired.

942
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:18,580
I'm so tired.

943
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:19,580
I'm so tired.

944
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:20,580

I'm so tired.

951
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:27,580
I'm so tired.

952
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:28,580
I'm so tired.

953
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,580

959
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:35,580
I'm so tired.

960
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,580
I'm so tired.

961
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:37,580
I'm so tired.
