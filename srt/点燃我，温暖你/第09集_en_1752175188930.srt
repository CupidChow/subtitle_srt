2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if the light is bright

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will fight against the darkness

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless emotions

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day there is a touch of panic

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast night?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I burn up the night just for you

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This is how everything looks like at first

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The wind and the color of the night sky are bright

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The mountains are broken, but you are still by my side

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Everything is how it looks at first

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Woke up

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Where is this

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
My studio

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Your studio

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
When you slept last night

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I was so tired

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm so tired

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Where is Li Xun

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Don't remember where you are

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Remember Li Xun

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Last night

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh my god

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Where is he

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He left early

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Back to the base

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
He doesn't have to report this to me

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Mobile phone

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
There is no place to charge anyway

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
No need to go first

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Everyone is sleeping

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Just run

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Woke up

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You drank a lot last night

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
How can you do these procedures

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The genes of people are different

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
We haven't finished the topic last night

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You don't have to finish it, right

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You have to make it clear

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What did I say

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You have to say

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No, you have to say

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Come out with me

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Why didn't you say it earlier

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We have done this website for so long

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
In the end, it's not worth it

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Then we are not

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What we did before was useless

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Useless

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You finished this project

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Don't you have any profit

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You can't say that

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
If I tell you

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
This website can't make money

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Will be replaced by others in the future

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Will you study so hard

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
No buts

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
This website is fine

68
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
High completion

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
As for whether you can make money

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Many factors decide together

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Then you can tell us

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let's just do the best one

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What Han Jiakang said

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Your uncle drank

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Do it directly

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Work for others to make money

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Money money money

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I only know to say money every day

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I see you and that Zhao Xiaobai

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What did you say

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What did you say

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What did you say

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Let's say it again

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What did you say

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What did you say

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Let's say it again

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What did you say

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Princess

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You really don't know

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The rule of the house

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Do you know

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The broken band in the human land

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
How many school classes do you have a month

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Then I ask you

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Does the computer run fast

96
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Do you know what configuration

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Have you ever thought about

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Why is the school

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Only this one computer

100
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,640
Now I'm in hike aim.

101
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,320
Fear is taking away my sense of duty,

102
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,960
but the girl out of you is better than anyone.

103
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,680
In the universe,

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,440
there is only you and Gu reflect on it,

105
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,120
the fullstarnya of dreams,

106
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,320
the fullstoria of dreams,

107
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,200
the fullstoria of dreams.

108
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:35,960
The fullstoria of dreams,

109
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:36,600
is missing from you.

110
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,400
Every")

111
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,000
negotiated contract

112
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,400
between us.

113
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,800
Why are you laughing?

114
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,840
I'm re-eating.

115
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,640
What are you eating?

116
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,880
The soup you made for me.

117
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,720
Zhu Yu.

118
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,360
Everything

119
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,880
is what it was

120
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,400
at the beginning.

121
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,800
You have to change your mind after you make a wish.

122
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,880
But people deserve to work hard.

123
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,280
We work hard

124
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,600
to keep it from changing.

125
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,880
Am I right?

126
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,040
Yes.

127
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,280
You know what I mean.

128
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,840
Good.

129
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,280
What are you doing?

130
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,320
None of your business.

131
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
There is a suddenly

132
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,160
an unexpected impulse.

133
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,760
I dislike it.

134
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,640
Get up.

135
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,240
You can't get up.

136
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,240
You get up.

137
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,680
fixes

138
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,120
is

139
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,360
Li Xun is crazy.

140
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,440
How can he come here?

141
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,600
I don't know.

142
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,680
He asked us to come, but he didn't show up.

143
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,920
See you at the top of the mountain.

144
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,000
See you at the top of the mountain?

145
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,840
Be careful.

146
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,440
Okay.

147
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,320
Sorry.

148
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,600
Li Xun, what the hell are you looking for?

149
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,480
I'm looking for you.

150
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,160
Not yet.

151
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
There are so many more.

152
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,160
Be careful.

153
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,640
How far is it?

154
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,360
Not yet.

155
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Let me help you.

156
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,960
No, I'm fine.

157
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,120
Li Xun, I...

158
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,880
My goodness.

159
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,560
There.

160
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,600
You're quite strong.

161
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,440
I can't climb anymore.

162
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,080
I can't do it.

163
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,200
You're here.

164
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,920
Are you up here for the third time?

165
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,720
First time before the first ride.

166
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,960
When did you go up here?

167
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,960
I went up early.

168
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,000
How long did you ride for?

169
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,080
At least two and a half hours.

170
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,800
And you?

171
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,520
I didn't.

172
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,320
I...

173
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,920
Why didn't you tell us?

174
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,000
Why not?

175
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,440
Why did you ask us to come up?

176
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,360
It's not a wind-blown view, right?

177
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,600
We need to learn to look far away from the light.

178
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,560
Understand?

179
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,320
Didn't you say we should have a meeting?

180
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,080
Say it.

181
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,000
Gao.

182
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,480
Tell her.

183
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,240
Okay.

184
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,960
I'm sorry.

185
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,040
This is Lan Guan's app?

186
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,320
Yes.

187
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,280
You know about this?

188
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,480
Yes.

189
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,600
When did you become his accomplice?

190
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,720
What do you mean?

191
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,680
He saw Han Jiakang at Lan Guan that day.

192
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,080
He knew Zhang Xiaobei would come to us

193
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,640
and steal our website.

194
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,840
So we decided to

195
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,520
secretly create an app

196
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,800
and sell it to Lan Guan.

197
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,280
Why didn't you tell me?

198
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,960
Zhang Xiaobei is watching us at the base every day.

199
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,240
He's a man of many eyes.

200
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,120
It's better to know less about him.

201
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,560
Why did you tell me now?

202
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,840
I wanted to get you into trouble.

203
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,480
You're so sincere.

204
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,080
You invited me?

205
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,120
What if I don't agree?

206
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,960
You can think about it.

207
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,840
It's nothing.

208
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,840
It's just a waste of time.

209
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,240
Is that so?

210
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,120
Okay.

211
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,720
Tell me.

212
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,160
What did you people do?

213
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,200
Isn't this just a website?

214
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,880
In short,

215
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,320
it's not even a website.

216
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,760
Isn't this

217
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,000
the develop and scale of

218
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,600
the 고양이왅 primeiro

219
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,320
Lan Guan is not open to other platforms.

220
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,840
He wants his own website.

221
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,120
The starting point is good.

222
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,120
What trend?

223
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,360
The shopping website has just started these years.

224
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,400
Although it looks like a place with many things to do,

225
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,720
and has many spots,

226
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,240
it won't take long.

227
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,640
Most resources

228
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,880
will be concentrated on several large platforms.

229
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,520
This platform is quite difficult to build.

230
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,480
Can't we do it ourselves?

231
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,080
We can.

232
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,840
It will take you ten years to complete it.

233
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,040
Your Highness.

234
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,040
Your Highness.

235
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,760
Don't call me that.

236
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,040
Then how should I call you?

237
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,440
Forget it. Go on.

238
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,320
How many products does Lan Guan have?

239
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,400
Do you remember?

240
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,880
500.

241
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,280
Hundreds of products.

242
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,560
You can complete the search function by yourself.

243
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,120
What if it's hundreds of millions?

244
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,240
Hundreds of billions?

245
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,440
Hundreds of billions?

246
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,960
Just like the silver box.

247
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,720
At that time, no data warehouse

248
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,040
can be stored.

249
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,000
Then you have to start to study

250
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,600
and store the data separately.

251
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,120
Then

252
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,320
you have to start to study

253
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,760
how to arrange these data,

254
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,400
recommend these data,

255
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,120
and add or delete them.

256
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,800
Every item

257
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,120
needs strong algorithmic support

258
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,600
to prevent the system from collapsing.

259
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,120
Do you think you can do it

260
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,520
in a month?

261
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,120
It's just a function.

262
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,560
Such a website

263
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,480
needs a lot of human and physical

264
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,800
resources

265
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,680
in the early stage and the late stage.

266
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,040
We are not enough.

267
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,280
Lan Guan is not that rich.

268
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,600
So we want to use our combined strength

269
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,320
to fight against these large-scale websites.

270
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,440
It's very unrealistic.

271
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,800
The second trend

272
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,480
is the spread of smart phones.

273
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,680
So we gave up

274
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,240
the large-scale websites

275
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,600
and directly entered the app.

276
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,120
Even if the app is still a new thing,

277
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,920
it's simple enough.

278
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,920
So it's developing

279
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,320
in a flash.

280
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,120
If you want to launch a army,

281
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,080
you have to use other methods.

282
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,080
The feature of large-scale platforms

283
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,000
is that they are wide

284
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,600
and the app is tight.

285
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,400
So in terms of one function,

286
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,120
it needs to be deep and tight.

287
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,080
The advantage of Lan Guan

288
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,320
is its nutrition.

289
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,240
Its products

290
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,440
have health functions

291
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,720
and are the majority.

292
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,560
And their style is very special.

293
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,520
In the market,

294
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,800
only they are producing.

295
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,840
It may be related to

296
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,360
Lan Guan's mother's Chinese medicine.

297
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,600
You even know that

298
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,440
their mother's Chinese medicine.

299
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,120
Yes.

300
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,320
Look here.

301
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,600
This function is mainly for nutrition.

302
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,760
Ordinary people

303
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,120
don't know much about

304
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,320
nutrients and health products.

305
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,600
They are lazy to look at it.

306
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,560
They won't go through the same thing.

307
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,080
So it's better to just check the medicine.

308
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,560
In this input symptom,

309
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:43,920
for example,

310
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,960
dizzy, eye, flower,

311
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,080
disgusting, anti-tumor.

312
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,360
Then the system

313
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,880
will recommend the product directly.

314
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,080
And Lan Guan's products

315
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,320
are arranged according to the series.

316
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,760
It's easy to promote.

317
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,440
Do you want to add

318
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,840
a function to explain the disease?

319
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,960
Simply put,

320
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,600
the reason for the condition of the body

321
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,400
and the product formula

322
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,440
that can solve the problem

323
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,720
will be more convincing

324
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,960
and make people want to buy it more.

325
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,040
Add it.

326
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,200
Today, Zhu Yun is in the fire.

327
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,160
I announce that

328
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,840
Lan Guan's app

329
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,280
is officially established.

330
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,800
It has been set up in the company of

331
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:35,360
dispatch and

332
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,720
the company lateral

333
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,320
wellbeing suites,

334
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,440
supremoys,

335
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,680
philtrum thyroid

336
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,800
Definitely not the earth wound

337
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,680
But its basic principles

338
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,500
of Godzilla

339
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,040
are uniform Commander Meng

340
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,180
Don't worry about me

341
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:08,860
You're canoing?

342
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,840
What're you looking at?

343
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,480
You

344
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,460
OK?

345
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,560
I'm looking at

346
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,120
your eyes

347
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,120
My mind went blank

348
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,600
I'm sure no one can save anyone

349
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,920
until you enter the world.

350
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,200
Even if the world shatters into darkness,

351
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,200
let's fight in the darkness.

352
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,800
Hope and light

353
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,720
are the same net that I've been searching for.

354
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,600
I see the direction of the endless hope.

355
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,840
After that peaceful afternoon,

356
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,000
before the four seasons have been over,

357
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,360
the era of intelligent mobile phones has just started.

358
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,760
The three of us are on the top of Mount Li.

359
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,920
We listen to Li Xun's thoughts,

360
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,360
his ideas,

361
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,760
and his ambitions.

362
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,160
I don't know if this program

363
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,800
can be sold to Lan Guan.

364
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,160
The only thing I can be sure of is

365
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,440
that this memory will be

366
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,240
stored in my brain forever.

367
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,640
At that moment,

368
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,160
I really believe

369
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,320
that our journey is the answer to the stars.

370
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,560
Boss, I want to print it.

371
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,480
Print what?

372
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,680
The photo. I want to send it to you.

373
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,760
Do you have the USB drive?

374
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,000
I can do it myself. I know how to do it.

375
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:51,900
Tony Alter,

376
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,000
it's an cabinet.

377
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:53,680
Hey,

378
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,360
not an assassin,

379
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,700
but a

380
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:57,920
tornado.

381
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,320
I feel uncomfortable now.

382
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,640
I know.

383
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,840
If you are a bit uncomfortable,

384
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,360
thank you,

385
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,400
boss.

386
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,440
I'll see you around.

387
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,320
Mr. Li.

388
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,080
Well,

389
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,080
I'm so lonely without you

390
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,080
I see your white shirt

391
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,080
I'm so warm and I like you

392
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,080
Oh, a minute and a second

393
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,080
I've hidden a secret

394
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,080
I want to be with you

395
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,080
Don't want to be in the fairy tale

396
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,080
I want to be with you

397
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,080
The autumn weather is a destined meeting

398
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,080
Let me feel you

399
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,080
Guarding your simple wish

400
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,080
A blink of an eye

401
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,080
The time has passed

402
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,080
No longer afraid of the huge world

403
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,080
With you by my side

404
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,080
Say good night every night

405
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,080
The past has never changed

406
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,080
The Autumn Cicada

407
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,080
Episode 16

408
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,080
Remember to eat after you order back

409
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,080
You too

410
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,080
The canteen is not good

411
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,080
You can eat out

412
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,080
Zhu Yu

413
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,080
What are you doing

414
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,080
Come here

415
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,080
I am a little tired

416
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,080
I'm going to sleep

417
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,080
I will go to sleep

418
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,080
I will go to sleep

419
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,080
I will go to sleep

420
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,080
Let me introduce you

421
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,080
This is my brother Zhang Zhicheng

422
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,080
Hello

423
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,080
Hello

424
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,080
You have something to talk about

425
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,080
See you tomorrow

426
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,080
I have something to talk about

427
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,080
One second

428
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,080
When are you lowdown behind me

429
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,080
Sunsi sky whistling

430
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,080
What a lowana

431
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,080
When did you fall in love

432
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,080
He was not

433
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,080
The الإك الس又 Rings bell

434
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,080
That time

435
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,360
I met him in class.

436
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,160
He asked me out several times.

437
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,920
Basically,

438
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,760
he is my boyfriend.

439
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,760
But I want to try

440
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,080
to see if I have feelings for him.

441
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,840
You can try?

442
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,280
Zhu Yu.

443
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,320
Have you ever been in a relationship?

444
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,160
What does it feel like to like someone?

445
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,000
Kissing and leaving.

446
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,200
It shouldn't feel like a relationship.

447
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,520
I think it's good

448
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,240
to be with him.

449
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,440
I can't let go of him.

450
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,040
I just want to protect him.

451
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,800
What's this?

452
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,120
Zhang Xiaobei's car?

453
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,240
What is he doing here?

454
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,160
Hello.

455
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,120
Chamberving."

456
00:20:52,280 --> 00:21:11,680
Weilan bride Digital

457
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,120
You're Ivy3 Zhonggans'Today to you.

458
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,840
It's not good to listen too much.

459
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,000
In general, it's a small application at one end.

460
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,840
The main purpose is to improve the functions and features of the original system.

461
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,120
You...

462
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,520
Li Xun,

463
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,320
you have this skill?

464
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,120
Playing the yin-zhao?

465
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,080
You pretend to be a website and do nothing.

466
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,560
You secretly make an app and sell it to a fake one.

467
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,400
You're not that small.

468
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,520
You're exaggerating.

469
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,080
I didn't do that.

470
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,080
I just got a notice that I'm stopping the website project.

471
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,080
Do you know what it means?

472
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,440
I invested all my budget for this year in this project.

473
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,680
Once the project is stopped, it means that students from the entire research institute

474
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,640
like Han Jiakang, can all roll up their sleeves and leave.

475
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,240
What do you want?

476
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,640
That's not right, President Zhang.

477
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,720
For your company,

478
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,920
the profit of this project is a small amount.

479
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,960
But for a senior like Han Jiakang,

480
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,520
he's working for you for almost a year.

481
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,120
Zhang Xiaobei,

482
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,520
I don't want to do it.

483
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:52,200
If you

484
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,160
were not like mice

485
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,920
trying to catch loquats

486
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,640
and stuffed into my little shit!

487
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,040
Why would you eat different types of food?!

488
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,120
I won't be your company manager anymore.

489
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,880
That's all I have.

490
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,440
You can be a driver.

491
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:25,220
Don't be a

492
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,600
good person.

493
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,560
Mr. Zhang,

494
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,320
if there's nothing else,

495
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,520
I'll leave first.

496
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,640
Okay.

497
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,640
Is your family in a difficult situation?

498
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,000
I've checked.

499
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,040
Your information has been changed.

500
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,000
Including your family's

501
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,120
phone number and address.

502
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,800
It's all been changed.

503
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,600
The school can't contact

504
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,480
any of your relatives.

505
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,160
But you're lucky.

506
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,200
I found the original file

507
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,600
of your high school.

508
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,280
Li Xun,

509
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,240
you were fired by Lin Yang

510
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,280
and got punished.

511
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,160
You even got a year's worth of school revenge.

512
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,560
Right?

513
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,520
Moreover,

514
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,120
I can't smartphone

515
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,280
to any ret launch high school graduate.

516
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,080
Here's your honor.

517
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,360
Thinking that you're a fique,

518
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,760
so you were booted from this institution.

519
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,840
To fabricate your files is a big deal.

520
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,040
Being it a flak for your hot blastingaudience

521
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,560
I didn't lie.

522
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,560
You can find out.

523
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,560
The school can also find out.

524
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,560
You're right.

525
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,560
But you don't have to explain this to me.

526
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,560
I don't care.

527
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,560
I said this just to tell you

528
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,560
that I understand your difficulties.

529
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,560
So I don't blame you for Lan Guan's situation.

530
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,560
But people have to learn

531
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,560
to be responsible for their mistakes.

532
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,560
You have to spit out what you owe me.

533
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,560
If you turn your head to me now,

534
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,560
it's not too late.

535
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,560
It's meaningless to fight against me.

536
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,560
You can think about it yourself.

537
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,560
I understand.

538
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,560
Let's go.

539
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,560
How's it? Not bad, right?

540
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,560
Great.

541
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,560
The new one is the new one.

542
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,560
We don't even have one in our school.

543
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,560
Of course.

544
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,560
This thing is not only expensive,

545
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,560
but also needs to be updated often.

546
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,560
Not to mention your art institute,

547
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,560
there are only a few schools in the country

548
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,560
with this set of equipment.

549
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,560
Did you change your money here?

550
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,560
Come on.

551
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,560
I paid a lot of money myself.

552
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,560
But with this set of equipment,

553
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,560
we can achieve a lot of new functions.

554
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,560
Awesome.

555
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,560
You've seen the budget.

556
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,560
Let's talk about the price.

557
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,560
Let's go.

558
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,560
This is the person in charge of our project.

559
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,560
Hello.

560
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,560
I agree with your report.

561
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,560
No, no, no.

562
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,560
It's equivalent to

563
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,560
doing a free training for us.

564
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,560
Learning this system

565
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,560
will be a perfect bonus

566
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,560
for us to find a job in the future.

567
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,560
Right?

568
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,560
Okay.

569
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,560
There are people in the base for 24 hours.

570
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,560
You can use it.

571
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,560
Great.

572
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,560
Thank you.

573
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,560
Then you can adjust it.

574
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,560
Okay?

575
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,560
Chu Yu,

576
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:43,220
take a look at our set of

577
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,560
the equipment.

578
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,560
It's so clear.

579
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,560
No delay.

580
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,560
Why are you looking at me?

581
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,560
You look like a puppet.

582
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,560
Look there.

583
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,560
So clear.

584
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,560
Very good.

585
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,560
Go a little further from the back.

586
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,560
Look.

587
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,560
Is it there?

588
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,560
Yes, yes, yes.

589
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,560
You do the same action again.

590
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,560
It's clearer.

591
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,560
Okay.

592
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,560
Why are you here?

593
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,560
I want to introduce you.

594
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,560
This is Xiao Liu.

595
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,560
You've seen him before.

596
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,560
This is the keyboard player.

597
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,560
This is our bass player, A'Ling.

598
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,560
A'Xing.

599
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,560
Yes.

600
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,560
No.

601
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,560
You're so cute.

602
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,560
I'm busy.

603
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,560
I'm here to listen to the song.

604
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,560
Okay.

605
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,560
Let's do it again.

606
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,560
Is there a problem?

607
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,560
Just now, this...

608
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,560
I think it's okay.

609
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,560
It's okay.

610
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,560
It's okay.

611
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,560
It's okay.

612
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,560
It's okay.

613
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,560
It's okay.

614
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,560
It's okay.

615
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,560
It's okay.

616
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,560
It's okay.

617
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,560
It's okay.

618
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,560
It's okay.

619
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,560
I think it's okay.

620
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,560
This is it.

621
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,560
Yes, yes, yes.

622
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,560
You guys go practice first.

623
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,560
What's wrong?

624
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,560
Are you in a bad mood?

625
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,560
Is there alcohol?

626
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,560
Try it.

627
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,560
You drink alcohol?

628
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,560
If you drink too much,

629
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,560
I won't mind you.

630
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,560
Bye, bye, bye.

631
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,560
Bye, bye.

632
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,560
Bye.

633
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,560
Be careful.

634
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,560
He drank too much.

635
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,560
It's a big deal.

636
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,560
You're so embarrassed.

637
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,560
Tell me.

638
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,560
Who bullied you?

639
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,560
Zhang Xiaobei.

640
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,560
Who?

641
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,560
Is he a teacher at school?

642
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,560
No.

643
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,560
So what?

644
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,560
Beat him.

645
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,560
As long as it doesn't affect your graduation certificate,

646
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,560
he can beat you up.

647
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,560
What can he do to you?

648
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,560
What if he decides

649
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,560
our sister's life and death?

650
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,560
Then you're still a fake tail.

651
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,560
Why are you so cowardly?

652
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,560
This is called wisdom.

653
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,560
Survival wisdom.

654
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,560
A man can go to the south.

655
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,560
The future is long.

656
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,560
It's okay to bow down now.

657
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,560
I can bow down,

658
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,560
but he can't.

659
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,560
Who?

660
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,560
I don't allow it.

661
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,560
Why are you looking for me?

662
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,560
No wonder the app development

663
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,560
I participated in the whole process.

664
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,560
The rite has only been completed

665
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,560
a half of it.

666
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,560
But I know the basic structure.

667
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,560
Then you came to surrender

668
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,560
on behalf of the base.

669
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,560
This is purely my personal behavior.

670
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,560
Actually, it's good to be at the base.

671
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,560
But you know,

672
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,560
Li Xu's temper

673
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,560
is relatively stubborn.

674
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,560
Besides, no matter what you do at the base,

675
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,560
you're always small.

676
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,560
Unlike the platform resources

677
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,560
and connections of President Zhang,

678
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,560
you just help me.

679
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,560
As for you young people,

680
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,560
you just let go of the road

681
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,560
and insist on crossing the bridge.

682
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,560
I'm a person who has been through it.

683
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,560
Which projects are good,

684
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,560
which will help you in the future,

685
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,560
I can't be more clear.

686
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,560
How about this, Zhuo Yun?

687
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,560
You come to me.

688
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,560
I'll give you a month's probation.

689
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,560
You go back and let Li Jun

690
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,560
hand over the app.

691
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,560
I won't let you down.

692
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,560
Brother.

693
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,560
Brother.

694
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,560
You are all like this.

695
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,560
Who?

696
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,560
You don't talk.

697
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,560
We have special situations here.

698
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,560
We are forced to do it.

699
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,560
We must be careful.

700
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,560
I'm not afraid of you.

701
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,560
You are my brother.

702
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,560
I'm your brother.

703
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,560
You are my brother.

704
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,560
You are my brother.

705
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,560
You are my brother.

706
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,560
You are my brother.

707
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,560
You are my brother.

708
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,560
You are my brother.

709
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,560
You must stay in the infirmary for the whole day.

710
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,560
You can't stay for too long.

711
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,560
Zhang Xiaofei said

712
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,560
you should hurry up

713
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,560
and make the app a big deal.

714
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,560
You must send Li Jun

715
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,560
to deliver it.

716
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,560
I'll give you a week.

717
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,560
Is that okay with you?

718
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,560
I think so.

719
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,560
Do it well.

720
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,560
Lan Guan's project is going well.

721
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,560
He is angry.

722
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,560
He's only taking a bunch of breathable air.

723
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,560
You are under a lot of pressure.

724
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,480
Let's go.

725
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,920
Li Xun.

726
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,080
President Zhang.

727
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,440
What can I do for you?

728
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,240
You're so late.

729
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,160
The promotion has been going well recently.

730
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,480
Thank you for your concern.

731
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,040
I'm sorry.

732
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,720
I'm fine. I'm just asking.

733
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,880
Goodbye.

734
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,200
Oh, right. I almost forgot to tell you.

735
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,600
Zhou Ying is helping me develop an app

736
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,440
for Lan Guan Zuo.

737
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,920
I'm sorry.

738
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,520
I'm sorry.

739
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,040
I'm sorry.

740
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,840
I'm sorry.

741
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,760
I'm sorry.

742
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,560
I'm sorry.

743
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,480
I'm sorry.

744
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,280
I'm sorry.

745
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,800
We're supposed to go to Plus Gr proper.

746
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,480
Verse-a- Barracys will compare,

747
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,520
especially to the three families.

748
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,760
Nothing, nothing.

749
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,560
What is Li Xun?

750
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,920
Hello,

751
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,040
I asked Zhiyun to go down.

752
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,480
He asked you to go down now.

753
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,960
Maybe this is all part of your game plan...

754
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,360
to oùhi-

755
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,640
Zhuyu.

756
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,440
Stop pretending, will you?

757
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,220
I didn't hear.

758
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:26,860
Come out.

759
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:28,480
Right now?

760
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,360
It's already past ten.

761
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,640
I'll wait a minute at the door of your dorm.

762
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,280
1 minute?

763
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,120
I'm wearing a sleeping vest now,

764
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,480
how can I possiblyManag Jian silk-

765
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,080
If you change clothes properly, you can jump off.

766
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,440
Are you really going?

767
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,120
I don't even know where to annoy him.

768
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,760
Just wear this and go down.

769
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,920
What else?

770
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,400
I'll change my clothes to pick up the price.

771
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,680
You're so stubborn.

772
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,680
Can you talk to me?

773
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,720
Do you think Zhang Xiaobei really believes you?

774
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,920
What's wrong?

775
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,960
I'll go over there.

776
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,080
Tell me what you're thinking.

777
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,640
You're still laughing?

778
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,400
Get out of here.

779
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,200
I promised to help Zhang Xiaobei.

780
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,240
I told you to get out of here.

781
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:32,880
Why?

782
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,440
You really want to help him with this app?

783
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,240
Yes.

784
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,440
And you copied the same structure as me.

785
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,640
Did you register for the patent

786
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,880
or publicize it?

787
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,320
Why do you think I copied it?

788
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,640
Do you know what he's going to do?

789
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,040
You two have a conflict.

790
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,080
It's none of my business.

791
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,040
I'll say it again.

792
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,120
I'm not going to do it.

793
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,240
Li Xun.

794
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,480
I think you've misunderstood something.

795
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,840
Just say it.

796
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,360
What's our relationship?

797
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,400
You and I

798
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,080
are not in a relationship of upper and lower classes.

799
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,320
We're just ordinary

800
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,800
and equal classmates.

801
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,240
Although I respect your position

802
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,440
in the foundation,

803
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,480
I also recognize your leadership ability.

804
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,440
But one,

805
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,000
we don't have a verbal agreement.

806
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,760
Two,

807
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,360
we don't have a labor contract.

808
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,080
I don't think you have a sufficient reason

809
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,200
to let me listen to you.

810
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,840
We're just ordinary

811
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,920
and equal classmates.

812
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,200
What else?

813
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:41,960
Zhu Yin.

814
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,160
We don't have an equal relationship.

815
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,560
What kind of mistake did I give you

816
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,080
that made you think I'm a bad girl?

817
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,000
I'm leaving.

818
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,400
Zhu Yin.

819
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:58,960
I'm leaving.

820
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,800
I'm leaving.

821
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,600
I'm leaving.

822
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,400
I'm leaving.

823
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,080
I'm leaving.

824
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,920
I'm leaving.

825
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,720
I'm leaving.

826
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,240
If you don't leave, don't go back to the base.

827
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,040
I forgot to tell you.

828
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,280
I've already moved to Han Jiao Kang's base.

829
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:13,960
Bye.

830
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,120
No problem.

831
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,000
I promise to

832
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,880
keep up with you.

833
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,640
Don't worry.

834
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:38,920
Okay.

835
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,640
Okay, bye.

836
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:41,880
How is it?

837
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,040
It's in the book.

838
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,440
There should be no problem tomorrow.

839
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,360
Let me see the operation.

840
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,240
I'm still adjusting.

841
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,200
You have to move faster.

842
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,760
Hurry up and fix the errors and the alarm.

843
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,680
Take Ma to run first.

844
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:03,840
Okay?

845
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,440
I know.

846
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,240
Can't wait until tomorrow.

847
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,800
You have to work overtime tonight.

848
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,200
I've changed the water in the water dispenser.

849
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,480
I can do it myself from now on.

850
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,520
It's a matter of course.

851
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,600
I'm leaving then.

852
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,600
Bye.

853
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,120
Bye.

854
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,240
Here.

855
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:51,720
What?

856
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:54,720
What's wrong?

857
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,360
I'm fine.

858
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:55,920
I'm fine.

859
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,520
I'm fine.

860
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,120
I'm fine.

861
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:57,760
I'm fine.

862
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,520
I'm fine.

863
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,120
I'm fine.

864
00:39:59,120 --> 00:39:59,720
I'm fine.

865
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,400
I'm fine.

866
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,120
I'm fine.

867
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,840
I'm fine.

868
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,800
You're so childish.

869
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,080
You don't like it?

870
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:09,720
Am I?

871
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,480
I like the kind of person

872
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,760
that can give me interest

873
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,720
and let me follow him to run.

874
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,120
Not this kind of person

875
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,720
that needs to cleaning, 드� 🎵dg d t.

876
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,060
You two made up with each other

877
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,800
and he gave you support.

878
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:26,880
That's great.

879
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,760
What's great about it?

880
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,640
He gave beingplace to everyone,

881
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,600
Not moved at all?

882
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,520
It won't turn into a relationship.

883
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,160
If you like someone,

884
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,600
it should be the light of the day.

885
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,840
The moment when the wind blows.

886
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,440
You can't do it sooner.

887
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,840
You can't do it later.

888
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,880
Why are you laughing?

889
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,000
It's so awkward to hear you say that.

890
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,480
It's my creation, okay?

891
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,640
You've been here for an hour

892
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,560
and you haven't opened your computer to write code.

893
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,360
What's going on?

894
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,560
Zhu Ying has been here for two days.

895
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,120
She likes to hide from you.

896
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,800
She is.

897
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,080
The code you wrote for me last night

898
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:12,640
was written here the whole night.

899
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,520
Did you bully her?

900
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,480
No.

901
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,800
Then who bullied her?

902
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,800
Did someone bully you?

903
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,200
Last Friday, Zhu Ying came to my place.

904
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,120
She was drunk and shouted slogans.

905
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,600
I could bow down

906
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,480
to her.

907
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,640
But she couldn't.

908
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,920
I would never allow it.

909
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,720
I didn't understand anyway.

910
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,440
Was it you?

911
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,560
Why are you here?

912
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,040
How are you?

913
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,960
What do you mean?

914
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,400
Did you get bullied by Zhang Xiaobei?

915
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,200
Not bad.

916
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,600
Compared to Boss Li,

917
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,080
it's a small house with a big house.

918
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,840
People who can live in the base

919
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,640
are the best in the immune system.

920
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,640
What do you think?

921
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,400
What if Zhang Xiaobei finds out?

922
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,040
Find out what?

923
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,800
Do you really think you can fool him?

924
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,880
I don't plan to fool him either.

925
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,400
I just want to be a good friend.

926
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,680
I don't want to be a bad friend.

927
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,880
I just want to be a good friend.

928
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,920
I don't want to fool him.

929
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,240
Did you hear

930
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,440
what he said to me?

931
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,440
You don't think I went to

932
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,160
find Xiaobei for you, right?

933
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,240
You're self-willed.

934
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,240
There will be a time when you lose control.

935
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,840
You will Mexican in thesize.

936
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,120
You won't go over there.

937
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,040
Xiaofei.

938
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,280
What's wrong with this?

939
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,480
What's wrong with this?

940
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,680
You keep messing it up.

941
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,360
role in the whole family.

942
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,920
We gave everything 부 of this plan.

943
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:27,760
What's wrong with me?

944
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,280
You're done.

945
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,720
Zhang Xiaobei was scolded by Lan Guan.

946
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,040
She came to you in the early morning.

947
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:38,920
She's looking for you.

948
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,040
She's looking for me?

949
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,200
Zhu Min.

950
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,600
She asked me

951
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,400
about your program.

952
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:48,600
I...

953
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,520
It's okay.

954
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,120
I can't hide it from her.

955
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,520
