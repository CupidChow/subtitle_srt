1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Everything is different

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,600
I was once a little shadowless

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,600
I don't believe anyone can save anyone

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,800
Until you break into my world

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,200
Even if the world breaks into darkness

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,000
We will fight in the darkness

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Even if the light is bright

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I will still be there to protect you

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I see the direction of my heart

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Every day, I feel anxious at the end

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Even if I'm blinded by time

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
How can I be alone in this endless night?

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm burning up just for you

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is how everything looks like

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
If I'm the light, the wind and the sun will shine

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The most ancient of the mountains, you're still by my side

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Everything is how it looks like

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 16

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Are you sure you're not going to use me again?

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Then how about we go to the canteen first and eat something?

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You're back

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Hello

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Hello

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You're back

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Hello

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Hello

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Hello

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Hello

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Is he the ordinary student you mentioned?

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This is Li Xun, my classmate

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This is Tian Xiaozhu

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm back

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Li Xun, wait for me

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That one

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Which one?

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What's your new project?

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,880
The company's input and output

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Is it hard?

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You didn't tell me

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You're back so early

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm free anyway

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'd better come back and do something

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
After all, the boss just paid the salary

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I have to perform well

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Who was that?

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
My driver

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Your driver?

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Does the princess need a bag?

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
No, it's not heavy

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And it's strong

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Then don't be so rude

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's all from the late

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I should have left Xiu Zhuge

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
At least I can help my mother

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm back

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You're so polite

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You're so generous

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm back

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Bye

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm back

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Hello

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You're in the dormitory

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Come back soon

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Am I crazy?

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm back to say that

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,620
I can't, let me do it

67
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,500
Come here

68
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,300
lungs the file and the code

69
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,140
For a suitcase you are so slumped

70
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,100
You are the boss

71
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,780
You know everything

72
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,340
Whatever you say

73
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,340
Then just come here

74
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,660
What is the work

75
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,100
but we still have to have the base rules

76
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,220
it's not the school start time yet

77
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,380
you don't have a reason to Hui me like that

78
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,780
You are doing it on purpose

79
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,200
Is that so?

80
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,700
If I want to work overtime, I will

81
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,340
Your attitude need to be better

82
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,420
I think you are going to ugly

83
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,740
ий marvelous that

84
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,300
tomorrow the vacation,

85
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,860
why?

86
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,860
do you have a driver to play with?

87
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,860
You have a driver to accompany you.

88
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,860
Give me the documents and code.

89
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,860
Are you free?

90
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,860
He is not my driver.

91
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,860
He is my mother's classmate's son.

92
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,860
And then?

93
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,860
I have known him since childhood.

94
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,860
He ate chicken wings in the competition when he was a child.

95
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,860
And then?

96
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,860
And then...

97
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,860
And then he threw up.

98
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,860
And then?

99
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,860
And then he went abroad.

100
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,860
You know everything about it.

101
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,860
He is the warm-hearted man who can draw, right?

102
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,860
You remember it so clearly.

103
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,860
Are you satisfied?

104
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,860
Can you give me the documents and code?

105
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,860
Zhu Yan.

106
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,860
If you lie again,

107
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,860
you will be responsible for your own loss.

108
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,860
Come and give me the documents and code.

109
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,860
You know how to code.

110
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,860
What about the warm-hearted man?

111
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,860
Let him go back early if he is free.

112
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,860
Take the exam.

113
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,860
What's wrong?

114
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,860
You are ordering?

115
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,860
I am treating you today.

116
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,860
But you are not eating.

117
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,860
You finally remember me.

118
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,860
What do you mean by finally?

119
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,860
Let me tell you.

120
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,860
Look.

121
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,860
I am making money now.

122
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,860
Of course I have to treat you to dinner.

123
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,860
What does it feel like to spend your own money?

124
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,860
Is it very successful?

125
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,860
I am not a good person.

126
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,860
I am not a good person.

127
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,860
I am not a good person.

128
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,860
What does it feel like?

129
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,860
Heartache.

130
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,860
Tell me.

131
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,860
What do you need me to cooperate with you this time?

132
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,860
You don't have to be so purposeful.

133
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,860
You put such a big snowboard.

134
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,860
You don't let me add some additional value.

135
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,860
Do you believe it yourself?

136
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,860
I am very sincere.

137
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,860
We two eat today.

138
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,860
Order whatever you want.

139
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,860
Okay.

140
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,860
I want this.

141
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,860
Heart-like knife feet.

142
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,860
What is this?

143
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,860
It's watermelon juice.

144
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,860
It's such a name.

145
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,860
It's so expensive.

146
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,860
It's strange that it doesn't have a heart-like knife foot.

147
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,860
Xiu Zhu.

148
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,860
After dinner, you should go back and rest.

149
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,860
I made you a work trip.

150
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,860
You can go to Lishan tomorrow.

151
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,860
I won't go with you.

152
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,860
So you are waiting for me here?

153
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,860
No.

154
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,860
Our school has an emergency.

155
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,860
Otherwise, I wouldn't have come back so early.

156
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,860
Is it an emergency with an ordinary classmate?

157
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,860
Of course not.

158
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,860
I am not a normal person.

159
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,860
Of course not.

160
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,860
I met your ordinary classmate at the art gallery last time.

161
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,860
Why didn't you say hello to us?

162
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,860
You are so honest.

163
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,860
I am afraid you will be more scary when you get up.

164
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,860
What?

165
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,860
Are girls now picky about looks?

166
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,860
I didn't expect you to be so lucky.

167
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,860
So you also think he is handsome?

168
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,860
You are good at talking.

169
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,860
You are always so silly.

170
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,860
Apple chicken is easy to be eaten.

171
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,860
I think he is not stable.

172
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,860
What do you mean?

173
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,860
I will tell you directly.

174
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,860
He is too strong.

175
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,860
But he is not my type.

176
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,860
You have seen him several times.

177
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,860
I don't want to say something like that to someone.

178
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,860
But I think he is not suitable for you.

179
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,860
You can't change him.

180
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,860
Why should I change him?

181
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,860
Because you will be hurt.

182
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,860
How can you be sure?

183
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,860
You don't know him.

184
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,860
I don't know him.

185
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,860
But I know you.

186
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,860
Xiu Zhu.

187
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,860
You are really like my mother.

188
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,860
You think you know me well.

189
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,860
You don't like different people.

190
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,860
You can't accept others' past.

191
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,860
No matter if others' past is in his control.

192
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:25,860
You can blame others with your own mind.

193
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,860
To be honest, Zhang is really too much.

194
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,860
I hope I am wrong.

195
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,860
Sorry.

196
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,860
I should say sorry.

197
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,860
Thank you, Xiu Zhu.

198
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,860
Have fun tomorrow.

199
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,860
Sorry.

200
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,860
Okay.

201
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,860
Go in.

202
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,860
You shouldn't be in a hurry.

203
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,860
I said I would treat you.

204
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,860
It's mainly because this meal is not big enough.

205
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,860
When you make a lot of money,

206
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,860
I will give you a big meal.

207
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,860
It's a deal.

208
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,860
Bye.

209
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,860
If my mother calls, don't tell her you missed it.

210
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,860
I know.

211
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,860
I will go back.

212
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,860
Have fun tomorrow.

213
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,860
Bye.

214
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,860
Bye.

215
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,860
Bye.

216
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,860
Fang Shu Miao.

217
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,860
You are here.

218
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,860
I just met Mr. Lin.

219
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,860
He asked you to his office.

220
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,860
He asked me?

221
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,860
I think he has good news.

222
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,860
He seems to be happy.

223
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,860
Why did you come back at this time?

224
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,860
I have a meeting tomorrow.

225
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,860
I have to attend the class.

226
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,860
I haven't finished the red suit.

227
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,860
I am leaving.

228
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,860
By the way,

229
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,860
I will be the Minister of Publication of the Student Union.

230
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,860
You have to vote for me.

231
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,860
You are promoted.

232
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,860
Of course.

233
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,860
Why do you say you are so good?

234
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,860
Why are you so insensible?

235
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,860
I am happy.

236
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,860
What are you doing?

237
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,860
Let her go.

238
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,860
Where?

239
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,860
Let go of my hand.

240
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,860
Let go.

241
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,860
Stop.

242
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,860
What's going on, Mr. Sha?

243
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,860
Next month,

244
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,860
the college students of Nanhu University

245
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,860
will hold the information security competition

246
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,860
at the Information Science and Technology University.

247
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,860
Do you know that?

248
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,860
It seems to be a big event.

249
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,860
Of course.

250
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,860
Although this is the first year,

251
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,860
this is the first time

252
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,860
that the college students of Nanhu University

253
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,860
hold the information security competition

254
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,860
in the field of information technology.

255
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,860
It is said that

256
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,860
the students of your first year

257
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,860
are not qualified to participate in it.

258
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,860
They think your application is good.

259
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,860
Especially,

260
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,860
they think I am so shameless

261
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,860
and give them the number of participants.

262
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,860
So many people are looking for it.

263
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,860
I let her go.

264
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,860
Look.

265
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,860
She is pushing me away.

266
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,860
You are the representative of the class.

267
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,860
You are the representative of the class.

268
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,860
I have to go.

269
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,860
I have to go.

270
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,860
I went.

271
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,860
The integration system of the source and the source is not good.

272
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,860
Who will do it?

273
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,860
Don't be so stupid.

274
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,860
How much time can it take you

275
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,860
to participate in a competition?

276
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,860
Didn't Gao Jianhong sign up?

277
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,860
He has gone enough.

278
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,860
Can he go alone?

279
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,860
You all have to go.

280
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,860
I have to go, too.

281
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,860
Of course.

282
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,860
You are so stupid.

283
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,860
Participating in the competition

284
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,860
and opening your eyes

285
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,860
is to let you

286
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,860
communicate with the industry,

287
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,860
the academic world

288
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,860
and the top experts.

289
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,860
You find your own shortcomings.

290
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,860
No need.

291
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,860
What did you say?

292
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,860
No need.

293
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,860
You don't need it.

294
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,860
No.

295
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,860
You said you didn't need it.

296
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,860
Do you think

297
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,860
you have no shortcomings?

298
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,860
Yes.

299
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,860
Teacher.

300
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,860
If you want to

301
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,860
make a name for the school

302
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,860
and make an appearance,

303
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,860
I really don't think it's necessary.

304
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,860
Li Xun.

305
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,860
You are so arrogant.

306
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,860
Who do you think you are?

307
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,860
What do you mean?

308
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,860
Let me handle it.

309
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,860
I tell you.

310
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,860
You.

311
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,860
Teacher, don't be angry.

312
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,860
Don't be like this.

313
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,860
Let's go.

314
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,860
I have seen many naughty students.

315
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,860
But like him,

316
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,860
I...

317
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,860
I...

318
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,860
What a good opportunity.

319
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,860
Those who participate in the competition

320
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,860
are the top experts in the country.

321
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,860
Even the sponsors

322
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,860
are the most powerful companies in the industry.

323
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,860
Just wait for the prize work to be announced.

324
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,860
Direct cooperation.

325
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,860
Invest in use.

326
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,860
You have been doing base projects for so long.

327
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,860
It has improved your professional ability.

328
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,860
You are a donkey and a horse.

329
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,860
You should pull it out and walk.

330
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,860
I know you two have a good relationship.

331
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,860
So obvious.

332
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,860
You must convince him

333
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,860
to participate.

334
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,860
I will try my best.

335
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,860
Not try your best, but must.

336
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,860
Otherwise, I will take you to the test.

337
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,860
Must.

338
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,860
His temper

339
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,860
will be lost sooner or later.

340
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,860
Zhu Yan, you are the representative of the class.

341
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,860
And he trusts you.

342
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,860
You must keep him in mind.

343
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,860
Okay.

344
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,860
Li Xue.

345
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,860
Don't waste your time.

346
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,860
I know.

347
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,860
For Li Tiancai,

348
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,860
it's not interesting to participate in the competition.

349
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,860
Others participate in the competition,

350
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,860
they go to learn.

351
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,860
Li Zhuang also participates in the competition,

352
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,860
he is just a sweeper for others.

353
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,860
You just treat it as a training team.

354
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,860
It's not good to be alone.

355
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,860
You have to help the whole team.

356
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,860
You have a lot of ideas.

357
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,860
Zhu Zhengwei.

358
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,860
I have the thought work.

359
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,860
Take it away.

360
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,860
You can not participate in the competition.

361
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,860
But this forum is interesting.

362
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,860
Like the new ship company,

363
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,860
which is specialized in

364
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,860
docking and shipping.

365
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,860
So?

366
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,860
So we go to pick their bugs.

367
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,860
Do you agree?

368
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,860
No.

369
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,860
Then I can't go.

370
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,860
Blind?

371
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,860
I don't know.

372
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,860
Blind?

373
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,860
Blind side?

374
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,860
Blind breakpoint?

375
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,860
Who are you?

376
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,860
Your old man has worked so hard

377
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,860
to get us a place.

378
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,860
You should go to a forum

379
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,860
to make him happy.

380
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,860
You are so fake.

381
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,860
What are you doing?

382
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,860
You go with me.

383
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,860
Li Xun.

384
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,860
You just go to the forum with me.

385
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,860
Next month, the weather is good?

386
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,860
He really agreed.

387
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,860
I will go to the forum.

388
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,860
Okay.

389
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,860
You go with me.

390
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,860
Why are you nervous?

391
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,860
This is the first competition.

392
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,860
Are you afraid that

393
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,860
you can't win the competition?

394
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,860
I just want to ask more.

395
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,860
To feel more relieved.

396
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,860
Sometimes, my mom,

397
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,860
Lin Xun,

398
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,860
is so arrogant.

399
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,860
But sometimes,

400
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,860
you should learn from her.

401
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,860
Her confidence.

402
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,860
No matter what young people do,

403
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,860
they should be careful about themselves.

404
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,860
Mr. Lin.

405
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,860
Since I decided to participate in the competition,

406
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,860
I don't want to be casual this time.

407
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,860
I want to prove my ability.

408
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,860
If you say so,

409
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,860
it means you are confident.

410
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,860
What is your topic?

411
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,860
Based on the exchange machine,

412
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,860
the second attack defense system of the Juyi network.

413
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,860
This topic is difficult.

414
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,860
How long do you prepare this topic?

415
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,860
Two days.

416
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,860
Impossible.

417
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,860
Actually, it's been a while.

418
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,860
I usually organize some information

419
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,860
and collect some questions.

420
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,860
I was going to use it as

421
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,860
the material for the graduation thesis.

422
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,860
It sounds good.

423
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,860
It should be a cold topic.

424
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,860
And it's practical.

425
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,860
Remember.

426
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,860
Opportunity is always left to the prepared.

427
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,860
I'm sorry.

428
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,860
I'm sorry.

429
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,860
I'm sorry.

430
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,860
Hello.

431
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,860
Hello.

432
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,860
Yes, we're here.

433
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,860
Half an hour.

434
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,860
OK, see you later.

435
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,860
Gao.

436
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,860
Go in yourself.

437
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,860
Help me and Zhu Ying to report the arrival.

438
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,860
You...

439
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,860
You?

440
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,860
We go to Xinda Biotech.

441
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,860
Meet their person in charge.

442
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,860
They always want to talk to me

443
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,860
about the development of biotech database.

444
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,860
I'm sorry.

445
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,860
I'm sorry.

446
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,860
I'm sorry.

447
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,860
I'm sorry.

448
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,860
I'm sorry.

449
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,860
They always want to talk to me about the development of biotech database.

450
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,860
You agreed to come here

451
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,860
for the sake of Xinda Biotech?

452
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,860
Otherwise?

453
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,860
You're so fake.

454
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,860
What is fake?

455
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,860
What is dead?

456
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,860
Where did you get your ass?

457
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,860
Don't forget you're my man.

458
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,860
See you later.

459
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,860
Help me.

460
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,860
See you.

461
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,860
Xinda Biotech

462
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,860
Where's the school?

463
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,860
Nanhu University.

464
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,860
Nanhu Second District.

465
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,860
It's at the door.

466
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,860
Thank you.

467
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,860
It's OK.

468
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,860
Hello, which school are you from?

469
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,860
I'm from Nanhu.

470
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,860
OK.

471
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,860
How many students are there?

472
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,860
I'm from Nanhu.

473
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,860
OK.

474
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,860
Just give him one.

475
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,860
OK.

476
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,860
Hello, I'm Gao Jianhong.

477
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,860
I'm from Nan...

478
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,860
You're from Nanhu University, right?

479
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,860
Hello, I'm Xu Li Na.

480
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,860
I'm from the computer science department.

481
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,860
I'm also a freshman.

482
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,860
Gao Jianhong.

483
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,860
You should have two more people.

484
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,860
Li Xun and Zhu Ying.

485
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,860
Didn't they come?

486
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,860
They don't participate in the competition.

487
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,860
Only in the forum.

488
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,860
OK.

489
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,860
How do you know us?

490
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,860
I'm also a contestant.

491
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,860
The Lan Guan app is about to be on the teaching platform.

492
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,860
You did it, right?

493
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,860
Yes.

494
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,860
You're pretty good.

495
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,860
Only the first-year students can represent.

496
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,860
You can still come to such a high-quality competition.

497
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,860
It's been a day today.

498
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,860
There are few students in this department.

499
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,860
Not to mention the first-year students.

500
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,860
It's mainly our teachers who are good.

501
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,860
What's wrong?

502
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,860
You're very good.

503
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,860
But you're modest and low-key.

504
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,860
You're much better than the boys in our school.

505
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,860
Go to the procedures first.

506
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,860
We'll talk later.

507
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,860
OK.

508
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,860
Give him two room cards.

509
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,860
OK.

510
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,860
Hello, which school are you from?

511
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,860
Tongjiang University.

512
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,860
Give him two cards, too.

513
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,860
OK.

514
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,860
Are you free tonight?

515
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,860
Let's have dinner together.

516
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,860
OK.

517
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,860
Basically, it's almost done.

518
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,860
Thank you for your hard work.

519
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,860
See you tomorrow.

520
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,860
Bye.

521
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,860
You've been waiting for a long time.

522
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,860
No, I just got off the bus.

523
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,860
I've booked the dinner.

524
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,860
Let's go to dinner.

525
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,860
I'll call a taxi.

526
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,860
No, follow me.

527
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,860
Welcome to come again.

528
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,860
Goodbye.

529
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,860
Miss Yu, the seat is reserved for you.

530
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,860
It's still your old seat.

531
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,860
OK, thank you.

532
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,860
This way.

533
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,860
This way, please.

534
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,860
Please sit.

535
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,860
Thank you.

536
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,860
Please.

537
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,860
Bye.

538
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,860
If I knew you'd bring me to such an official place,

539
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,860
I should have worn my only suit.

540
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,860
Although everyone said...

541
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,860
Have some water.

542
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,860
Thank you.

543
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,860
Although everyone said that my suit

544
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,860
looked like a real estate agent.

545
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,860
Really?

546
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,860
I'd like to see it.

547
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,860
Actually, it's not that formal.

548
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,860
Everyone has their own style.

549
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,860
If you wear something too fancy,

550
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,860
it's just to take a picture and post it on WeChat.

551
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,860
Look, the two over there.

552
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,860
I'll take a picture for you.

553
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,860
Sure.

554
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,860
Let me see.

555
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,860
What are you taking?

556
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,860
I've changed my shape.

557
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,860
You've made me 1.2 meters.

558
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,860
Look at this.

559
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,860
I have a pearl on my head.

560
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,860
I see.

561
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,860
You're a little stingy.

562
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,860
I'm not.

563
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,860
I'm just a little stingy.

564
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,860
I'm just a little stingy.

565
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,860
I'm just a little stingy.

566
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,860
I'm just a little stingy.

567
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,860
I'm just a little stingy.

568
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,860
I'm just a little stingy.

569
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,860
I'm just a little stingy.

570
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,860
I'm just a little stingy.

571
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,860
No matter how good the scenery is,

572
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,860
it's still a good time to take a picture.

573
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,860
I'll take another one.

574
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,860
Yes.

575
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,860
A little higher.

576
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,860
One more.

577
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,860
Much better.

578
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,860
Let's take a selfie.

579
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,860
Stand closer.

580
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,860
Three, two, one.

581
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,860
The two behind are okay.

582
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,860
It's pretty good.

583
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,860
Two people.

584
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,860
This is the menu.

585
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,860
Thank you.

586
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,860
This is pretty good.

587
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,860
Stop looking.

588
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,860
The one you took is a female menu.

589
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,860
There's no price on it.

590
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,860
I'm sorry.

591
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,860
I'm sorry.

592
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,860
I'm sorry.

593
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,860
It's okay.

594
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,860
How does it taste?

595
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,860
It's pretty good.

596
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,860
Eat.

597
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,860
If we can write codes in such a nice place in the future,

598
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,860
it will be very efficient.

599
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,860
Good idea.

600
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,860
Next time, you can try it.

601
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,860
Then the two of us

602
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,860
will become a beautiful scenery on the outside.

603
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,860
Why is your god Li Xun

604
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,860
always missing?

605
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,860
Are you looking for him?

606
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,860
Is it your blue can app?

607
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,860
I heard that it's your favorite app.

608
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,860
Our practice base was built by it.

609
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,860
Blue can is the project we took on.

610
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,860
I downloaded your app.

611
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,860
It's not about the operation, but the creativity.

612
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,860
I think that...

613
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,860
The design of the place where it's uncomfortable

614
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,860
is very interesting.

615
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,860
The place where it's uncomfortable?

616
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,860
You're really good at naming things.

617
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,860
To be honest,

618
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,860
my programming is actually very poor.

619
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,860
Impossible.

620
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,860
I'm not good at it.

621
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,860
Impossible.

622
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,860
The computer department of the Department of Computer Science and Technology

623
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,860
is very close to the ranking.

624
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,860
But I'm a special student of the National Dance.

625
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,860
I just got into this major

626
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,860
because of my sudden interest.

627
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,860
I'm not good at math.

628
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,860
I'm in class now.

629
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,860
It's like listening to a book.

630
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,860
Do you understand?

631
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,860
Don't be modest.

632
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,860
You're here to participate in the competition.

633
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,860
All the students in our class look down on me.

634
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,860
They all think I'm an art student.

635
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,860
They don't even let me do the group homework.

636
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,860
I'm here to take the competition

637
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,860
and get a name.

638
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,860
Let them see it.

639
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,860
What did you think of the app?

640
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,860
Can you tell me about it?

641
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,860
You want to hear it?

642
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,860
The shopping website has just started these years.

643
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,860
It looks like there are many places to put your products.

644
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,860
But it won't take long.

645
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,860
Most of the resources will be slowly

646
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,860
shared to several large platforms.

647
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,860
The second trend is the popularity of smart phones.

648
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,860
We gave up the large website and chose the app.

649
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,860
It's because the features of large platforms are broad.

650
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,860
The features of the app should be clear.

651
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,860
It should be in one function.

652
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,860
It should meet the needs of the user.

653
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,860
It should meet the user's habits.

654
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:32,860
Because in the future,

655
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,860
the app's user base will be lower than the website.

656
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,860
Why?

657
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,860
Because everyone has a cell phone.

658
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,860
It can be used anytime.

659
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,860
But the computer is not.

660
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,860
So we based on different user images

661
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,860
to add the ID search system.

662
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,860
You don't need to know what disease you have.

663
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,860
You just need to enter the ID.

664
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,860
Then we added the Mocap.

665
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,860
Mocap?

666
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,860
It's the action capture system.

667
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,860
Many Hollywood movies have added this technology.

668
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,860
Our model is based on this technology.

669
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,860
It's more intuitive than the ID, right?

670
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,860
How is it?

671
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,860
Very good, Gao.

672
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,860
Really.

673
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,860
Very good.

674
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,860
Actually,

675
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,860
there are still many shortcomings.

676
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,860
You are already very good.

677
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,860
You are too modest.

678
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,860
I have a lot to say today.

679
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,860
No, no.

680
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,860
You can say more.

681
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,860
I'm not saying too much.

682
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,860
I'm just saying.

683
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,860
I'm just saying.

684
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:28,860
I'm just saying.

685
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,860
I'm just saying.

686
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,860
I'm just saying.

687
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,860
I'm just saying.

688
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,860
I'm just saying.

689
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,860
No, no.

690
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,860
You can say more.

691
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,860
You still want to hear?

692
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,860
Although the smart phone is not fully popularized,

693
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,860
the mobile internet speed is still lagging.

694
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,860
But...

695
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,860
We're here.

696
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,860
Gao.

697
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,860
You will definitely win the competition.

698
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,860
Thank you.

699
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,860
I'm leaving first.

700
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,860
Go back and rest early.

701
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,860
Good night.

702
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,860
Bye bye.

703
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,860
Good night.

704
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,860
Good night.

705
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,860
Bye bye.

706
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,860
You're back.

707
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,860
How's the talk today?

708
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,860
Not bad.

709
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,860
I want to post a photo of you.

710
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,860
Don't play with your phone while driving.

711
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,860
Talk at home.

712
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,860
I'm sorry.

713
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,860
Who is it?

714
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,860
Gao, it's me.

715
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,860
I'll be right there.

716
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:16,860
Gao, what are you doing?

717
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,860
Coming.

718
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,860
Good morning.

719
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,860
Good morning.

720
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,860
Can I come in?

721
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,860
Sure.

722
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:35,860
You're alone?

723
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,860
I'm alone.

724
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,860
Did you have breakfast?

725
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,860
I'm not used to breakfast.

726
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,860
Gao, can you help me look at my competition project?

727
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,860
Of course.

728
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,860
As long as you don't mind.

729
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,860
I'm not asking for free.

730
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,860
Here, reward, osmanthus cake.

731
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,860
It's delicious.

732
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,860
It's delicious, right?

733
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,860
The sign of the green waves is delicious.

734
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,860
Can you help me look at it?

735
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:25,140
This is our software

736
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,860
Let me introduce.

737
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,860
This is Li Xun.

738
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,860
Hello, Li Xun.

739
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,860
My name is Xulina.

740
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,860
I've heard of your name before.

741
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,860
Sorry to bother you.

742
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,860
Li Xun, can you help me look at

743
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,860
our competition project?

744
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,860
Is there anything to be improved?

745
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,860
Look, this is the software

746
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,860
self-discovery system.

747
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,860
And its principles...

748
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,860
You didn't make this yourself, did you?

749
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,860
Li Xun.

750
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,860
How did you figure it out?

751
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,860
There are only two principles

752
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,860
in the software company's self-discovery system.

753
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,860
The first one is to pass

754
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,860
the internal digital test.

755
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,860
The second one is to capture information

756
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,860
when the software center is in contact.

757
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,860
This is the second one.

758
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,860
But your two ideas are all useless.

759
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,860
It's not good for the team

760
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,860
The premise of capturing information is

761
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:33,860
your software can cross the front line of Windows

762
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,860
and directly access the internal data

763
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,860
of C盘文32 related files.

764
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,860
But you really think that

765
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,860
the personal security and firewall

766
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,860
of the Windows system are a waste of time.

767
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,860
Many domestic companies

768
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,860
are the network of PPOE.

769
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,860
The IP address of the network will definitely change.

770
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,860
However, Mac will only show up

771
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,860
when it is uploaded after it is run by S&MP service.

772
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,860
The rest is taught

773
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,860
by the way of the short-term test.

774
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,860
You are so stubborn.

775
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,860
Li Xun, stop talking.

776
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,860
Li Xun, do we still have the old one?

777
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,860
Because others can't see it.

778
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,860
Find a better one and redo it.

779
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,860
Let him follow the first idea.

780
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,860
It's easier to reverse and redo it than to change it.

781
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,860
Wait.

782
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:23,860
Can you tell me

783
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,860
the first idea you just said?

784
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,860
Sorry, I'm busy.

785
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,860
I'm busy.

786
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,860
Can I ask you for a favor next time?

787
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,860
After I've done this,

788
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,860
I'll show you.

789
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,860
No.

790
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,860
I have no obligation to hide it from others.

791
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,860
My name is Xu Li Na.

792
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,860
I'm from the software engineering class of C&K.

793
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,860
She is just like that.

794
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,860
Don't mind it.

795
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:46,860
She is so awesome.

796
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,860
Hello, everyone.

797
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,860
Welcome to our information technology college.

798
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,860
Thank you for participating and supporting the contestants.

799
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,860
The competition committee

800
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,860
is honoured to receive a gift from the C&K.

801
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,860
The gift is a letter of appreciation.

802
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,860
Thank you.

803
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,860
Thank you, everyone.

804
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,860
Thank you, everyone.

805
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,860
Thank you, everyone.

806
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,860
Thank you.

807
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,860
Thank you.

808
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,860
Thank you.

809
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:18,860
Thank you.

810
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,860
Thank you.

811
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,860
Thank you.

812
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,860
Thank you.

813
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,860
Thank you.

814
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:25,860
Thank you.

815
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:31,060
received the works of more than 300 contestants from the national universities.

816
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,860
After three days of selection,

817
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:37,260
14 works were selected from them and entered the final competition.

818
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,060
Okay, everyone saw it.

819
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,660
They are the group and individual contestants

820
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:46,060
who entered the final competition.

821
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,460
Congratulations.

822
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:52,460
Half a month later, you will return here again to win.

823
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,060
Next, I announce that the first round of the

824
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:02,060
Nanhu University's Information Security Competition

825
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,660
will officially begin.

826
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:12,860
Please welcome the leaders of Mark Technology Co., Ltd.

827
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:18,060
and the one who won the special award in this competition,

828
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:23,460
Fang Zhijian, to come up to the stage and press the crystal city with us.

829
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,660
Thank you.

830
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:33,260
Come, one, two, three.

831
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,060
Come, one, two, three.

832
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,460
Eggplant.

833
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,860
Come, one more.

834
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:51,060
Come, one, two, three.

835
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,860
Eggplant.

836
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,460
Okay, okay.

837
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,660
Hello, Mr. Fang.

838
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,860
I just added your WeChat account.

839
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,060
I'll see you later.

840
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,460
Bye, Mr. Fang.

841
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,460
Bye, Mr. Fang.

842
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,660
Bye, Mr. Fang.

843
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,660
Bye, Mr. Fang.

844
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,660
Bye, Mr. Fang.

845
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,660
Bye, Mr. Fang.

846
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,060
Bye, bye, bye.

847
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:13,060
Brother, can I add your WeChat account?

848
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,860
Okay, you can find me.

849
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,660
Your group's project is so great.

850
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,460
You are the only one who won the special award.

851
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,860
Thank you.

852
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,660
Which university are you from? I'll memorize it.

853
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,660
I'm from Nanhu University.

854
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,460
Nanhu University?

855
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:34,060
Your school has a school named Li Xun, right?

856
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,460
Yes, we did the Lan Guan App together.

857
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,460
What about this? You did it together?

858
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,060
He didn't participate in this project.

859
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,860
I did it alone.

860
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,260
Fang.

861
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,060
Let's go.

862
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,460
Okay, let's talk a lot.

863
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,660
Let's talk a lot.

864
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,660
Let's go.

865
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,660
Bye, bye.

866
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,660
Bye, bye.

867
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,660
Bye.

868
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,260
Is it good?

869
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,260
Yes.

870
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,460
It's okay.

871
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,460
Thank you.

872
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,660
It's okay.

873
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,260
Brother.

874
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,260
Congratulations.

875
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,460
Thank you.

876
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,660
Congratulations.

877
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,260
Thank you.

878
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,460
Where's Li Xun?

879
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,060
He's probably busy.

880
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,260
He's so busy.

881
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:23,660
No wonder I haven't sent him a WeChat message.

882
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,860
You've added his WeChat?

883
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:28,260
Don't be angry. I'm a volunteer.

884
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,660
Gao, can you help me talk to him?

885
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,660
Let him get through it.

886
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,660
Okay.

887
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,860
I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

888
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:43,260
I'll invite some of my classmates to celebrate.

889
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,060
Okay.

890
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,260
You must let Li Xun come.

891
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,660
I can make it to the finals.

892
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,660
It's all thanks to him.

893
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,460
I have to thank him.

894
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,260
I'll do my best.

895
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,260
Okay.

896
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,060
Fang Zhijian.

897
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,460
You're the one who's been pestering Yan.

898
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,660
Zhang Bao gave you the title.

899
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,060
He was ruined by everyone.

900
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,460
He killed himself because of you.

901
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,060
You're the one who...

902
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,260
Chu Yue.

903
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,060
It's clearly his own fault.

904
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:21,460
It's clearly his own fault.

905
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:25,860
Join the competition with me

906
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,860
to defeat this project.

907
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,260
Not really.

908
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:54,260
The train never stops

909
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:58,660
I'm leaning on your shoulder

910
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:05,660
We will never be separated

911
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:08,660
Escape from the noisy world

912
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,860
Accompany me

913
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:15,260
Is your new destination

914
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,260
Raise me up and bravely meet

915
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:25,060
The flame that burns like the night

916
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:33,060
Cause I believe I love you

917
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:37,460
To love will take its course

918
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:42,660
I'm by your side

919
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:46,260
Spending a long time with you

920
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:50,860
Cause I believe I want you

921
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:55,260
To love will take its course

922
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:59,860
The flame that burns like the night

923
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:08,660
Is always by your side

924
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:20,060
It's the sense of dream

925
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:24,860
Breaking through the border

926
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:28,060
A page of memory

927
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,860
Flowing

928
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:33,860
Then it won time for me

929
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:37,060
It's always there

930
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:39,060
Unstopping

931
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,060
I'm also

932
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:43,460
by your side

933
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:45,460
Only be brave

934
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:48,060
Every dream I have

935
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:49,060
Won't

936
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:50,460
Won't

937
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:55,860
Won't lose to the world

938
00:45:55,860 --> 00:46:00,460
Cause I believe I love you

939
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:05,060
To love will take its course

940
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:09,060
I'm by your side

941
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,060
Take its course

942
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:15,060
I'm by your side

943
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:20,060
Spending a long time with you

944
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:24,060
Cause I believe I want you

945
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:29,060
To love will take its course

946
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:33,060
The flame that burns like the night

947
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:38,060
Is always by your side

948
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:43,060
It's the sense of dream

949
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:46,060
Breaking through the border

950
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:49,060
A page of memory

951
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:51,060
Flowing

952
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:55,060
Then it won time for me

953
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:59,060
It's always by your side

954
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:01,060
Only be brave

955
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:04,060
Every dream I have

956
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:06,060
Won't

957
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:11,060
Won't lose to the world

958
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:15,060
Cause I believe I love you

959
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:20,060
To love will take its course

960
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:25,060
The flame that burns like the night

961
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:33,060
Is always by your side

962
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:42,060
To love will take its course
