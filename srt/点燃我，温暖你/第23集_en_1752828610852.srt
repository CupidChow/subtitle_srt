00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if the light is very bright

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will still watch over that vast vast land

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless atmosphere

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day, the lens is a little bit yellow

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast night?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I burn up the night just for you to remember

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How everything was in the beginning

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The wind and the color of the night are like wild grass

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The mountains are broken but you are still by my side

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Everything is how it was in the beginning

Yes

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Someone is looking for you

25
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I contacted several lawyers

26
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
They said if you appeal to the second aunt

27
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's possible to give up the new wife

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What are you doing?

29
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I want to help you

30
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
No need

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
This is your plan

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You are hiding from me, right?

33
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Everything you do

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
All your countermeasures

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Just to push me away

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You are going to revenge Fang Zhijing, right?

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Princess, you are really smart

38
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
When did you start this plan?

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
From the beginning

40
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I started this plan six years ago

41
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I started this plan six years ago

42
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Six years ago

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
From the night I stood at your door

44
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I didn't expect

45
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I still can't understand

46
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You really can't understand

47
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You never tasted the bad taste

48
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
My mother was forced to transfer from ICU to the general ward

49
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Died

50
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
For saving money

51
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Li Nan was replaced by remote areas

52
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Died too

53
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
In your eyes

54
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm just a person who stands outside your door

55
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Waiting for pleading

56
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Waiting for the person who was lost

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Do you remember what I told you before?

58
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You are too fake

59
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You and me

60
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
We are together

61
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Just to satisfy

62
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You can also get back the sympathy

63
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Right?

64
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You hate Fang Zhijing so much

65
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But in fact, you are the same person as him

66
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You are revenge me

67
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I saw you for the first time at the door of your villa

68
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I originally thought

69
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
We will never have a fight

70
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I didn't expect

71
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
We entered the same university

72
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Same major

73
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I didn't want to find you

74
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I didn't want to find you

75
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I didn't want to find you

76
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I didn't want to find you

77
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Who told you to stick to me?

78
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I stick to you

79
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
it is good

80
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Then why don't you let me stand?

81
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Because of Lan Kuan

82
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
A project, Zhang Xiaobei wants to grab it

83
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But your parents

84
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Just a few words

85
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Can you get it back?

86
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I found that

87
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Your family is still a bit weak

88
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I checked

89
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Your dad is a medical equipment

90
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
This is a violent industry

91
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Do you know

92
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I don't know

93
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Do you know

94
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Dad really improved one percent of the healing

95
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The dream of LV

96
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's also for our life

97
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
No matter what LV is

98
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What dream

99
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's all about you

100
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yes

101
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
How could I be so stupid?

102
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You go

103
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Don't come again

104
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Li Xun

105
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You said

106
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Betrayers are in hell

107
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Then I'll be betrayed

108
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
This kind of thing

109
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
For me

110
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
There is no more than a hand

111
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Even if it's really raining

112
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It doesn't matter

113
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I have a lot of experience

114
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
After all, since childhood

115
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I have been in the public many times

116
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I will never betray you

117
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Li Xun

118
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I want to start a business with you

119
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
From the beginning of LV

120
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I love you

121
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Princess

122
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Do you have a dream?

123
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
My dream is

124
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
With my first love, Zhengguo Xiu Chen

125
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I admit that you are my look

126
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Blurred clear

127
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
How stubborn

128
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I have never been

129
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
With you

130
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Always by your side

131
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I want to give you a cure

132
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
A little bit of light

133
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Just like that is you

134
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The shoulder you gave me

135
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Some thoughts can't be told

136
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I have to learn to forget

137
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I want to give you a cure

138
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
A little bit of light

139
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Just like that is you

140
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
The shoulder you gave me

141
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
A little bit of light

142
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Just like that is you

143
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
A little bit of light

144
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Just like that is you

145
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
A little bit of light

146
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Just like that is you

147
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
A little bit of light

148
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
A little bit of light

149
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Just like that is you

150
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
A little bit of light

151
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Just like that is you

152
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
A little bit of light

153
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Just like that is you

154
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
A little bit of light

155
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Just like that is you

156
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Is it all here?

157
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Almost

158
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
When we go out of school

159
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's hard to get so many people

160
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Maybe you and many people here

161
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
This life

162
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Is the last time to meet

163
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
No one expected

164
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Now it's too late

165
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Did you do that, monitor

166
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You did that, monitor

167
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Graduation photo must be taken

168
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Otherwise, I have been reading for four years

169
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I don't even have a photo

170
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Okay

171
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Stand up

172
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Stand up

173
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Be quiet

174
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Come a little bit closer

175
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Stand up

176
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,460
Hello,

177
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,000
Come here, together

178
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Gao Jianhong

179
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Move one more to the side

180
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Leave a place for Li Xun

181
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Put it on him later

182
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Come, everyone, look at the camera

183
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Is the watermelon sweet?

184
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Sweet

185
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Hello

186
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Where are you

187
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
On the way to the airport

188
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Zhu Yu

189
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You're over there

190
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Take good care of yourself

191
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Don't forget

192
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And me

193
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And me

194
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And me

195
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And me

196
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Zhu Yu must be fine

197
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
We are all waiting for you to come back

198
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Did you hear

199
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Come back quickly

200
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I know

201
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Come

202
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Three years later

203
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The enemy must be alive

204
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Then the big sister

205
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Don't you dare sing the song of the red flag?

206
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Three years later

207
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I just graduated from the research club

208
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm nothing

209
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Zhu Yu

210
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You two in the company

211
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Let's not say

212
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Copy Google

213
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
At least the money to battle after three years

214
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
As for Wu Mengxin

215
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
That's your wife and child

216
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Hot head

217
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I can't see you without a private person

218
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I don't recognize

219
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Ok, let's wait and see

220
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
it is good

221
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
All things

222
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Only when I was in the beginning

223
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Is his original appearance

224
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
The more I get

225
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The more I know

226
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Wang Lixing

227
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Don't think about it

228
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You let me ensure

229
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,120
I

230
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,880
I

231
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,000
Don't make trouble

232
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
about it

233
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,600
The more you go, the more you'll be.

234
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,280
I know.

235
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,640
Because of various reasons,

236
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,800
our company's main business is medical.

237
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,000
You are all the old members of LP.

238
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,240
But the company's future development direction

239
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,280
needs to be adjusted.

240
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,760
After all, we are not doing charity work.

241
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,760
So we decided to

242
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,000
separate this whole business.

243
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,360
Thank you for your understanding.

244
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,160
Mr. Gao.

245
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,880
Just tell me the truth.

246
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,880
Did you sell our medical software?

247
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,200
Yes, we sold it.

248
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,640
It's not a secret.

249
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,920
The medical industry is big.

250
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,600
The professional technology is high.

251
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,800
And the performance is full.

252
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,960
It's not a small company like ours

253
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,360
that can stand it.

254
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,560
We are a small company.

255
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,840
We can't pull such a big car.

256
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,520
It depends on what the code is.

257
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,760
You are right.

258
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,680
I can tell you in a big way.

259
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,720
The company's next step in the future

260
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,040
is to develop funds

261
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,080
by selling this software.

262
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,920
Of course,

263
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,440
it includes your money.

264
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,720
Finance.

265
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,440
Yes, Mr. Gao.

266
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,880
About the compensation,

267
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,360
I will talk to you about it.

268
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,080
Don't worry.

269
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,240
I won't treat you badly.

270
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,440
Please.

271
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,120
This way, please.

272
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,520
Mr. Gao.

273
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,280
Everyone.

274
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,160
Mr. Gao.

275
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,160
Although it's not the first time we meet,

276
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,000
I still want to

277
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,400
introduce myself again.

278
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,280
Gao Jianhong,

279
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,720
the new shareholder of the company,

280
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,000
legal assistant and general manager.

281
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,600
Recently,

282
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,400
I have a problem.

283
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,360
I am thinking

284
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,920
what is the goal of our LOP?

285
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,840
Today,

286
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,040
I can tell you clearly.

287
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,360
Two words.

288
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,000
Profit.

289
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,720
What is the most profitable now?

290
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,080
Online education or shared business?

291
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,120
You can mention

292
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,160
the new direction of our company.

293
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,160
I have been with you for a long time.

294
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,280
You will know

295
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,920
that I am open-minded.

296
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,960
We can make money together.

297
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,240
Let's make a new

298
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,520
LOP dream together.

299
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,160
Great.

300
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,640
I have a few investors.

301
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,760
You can get back to work.

302
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,760
Okay, Mr. Gao.

303
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,920
Okay.

304
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,280
Let's go!

305
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,920
533

306
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,040
Let's go!

307
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,080
The product for today

308
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,880
is restored.

309
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,360
Thank you.

310
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,180
Gao.

311
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,680
I heard that you refused to sue.

312
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,800
Do you really have to be so stubborn?

313
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,200
Does Zhu Yun know

314
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,520
what you've done for her?

315
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,760
Did you change the public registration?

316
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,640
Yesterday.

317
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,240
I changed it.

318
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,600
Gao.

319
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,560
From now on, we'll only talk about work.

320
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,320
We won't talk about the past.

321
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,120
Do you still want me to report to you

322
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,280
about work in such a place?

323
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,160
I need to give you some advice.

324
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,000
If we don't talk about the past,

325
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,600
we won't have anything to talk about.

326
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,840
Do you think you'll have a future?

327
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:51,800
Li Xun.

328
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,200
You can't blame me.

329
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,920
I'm not blaming you.

330
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,560
I'm just trying to help you.

331
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,160
I'm just trying to help you.

332
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,200
I'm just trying to help you.

333
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,240
I'm just trying to help you.

334
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,240
I'm just trying to help you.

335
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,320
You can't blame me.

336
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,880
I once gave up everything.

337
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,240
I gave up everything

338
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,240
that the school recommended

339
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,600
to go abroad and to be a security guard.

340
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,400
I gave up my pride and self-esteem.

341
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,880
I just want to stay away from you.

342
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,680
But you didn't even give me

343
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,760
such a chance.

344
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,640
Think about it.

345
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,680
What have you done all these years?

346
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,520
When did you think about

347
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,560
other people when you made the decision?

348
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,000
Who did you really care about?

349
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,640
Sometimes, I really admire you.

350
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,880
How can you be so selfish?

351
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,600
You think you're so selfish?

352
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,840
You've been thinking about it for a long time, right?

353
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,720
Is it easy to feel humiliated?

354
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,280
No.

355
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,200
It's just a way to swallow your anger

356
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,440
and take your own pride.

357
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,440
It doesn't matter.

358
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,200
What matters is that I've succeeded.

359
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,880
Did you see it clearly?

360
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,080
I'm telling you.

361
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,160
I sold out your whole system.

362
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,760
I don't want any online medical system.

363
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,680
Just treat it as what you did before

364
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,160
as a contribution to my cause.

365
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,360
Li Xun.

366
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,880
The current LOP

367
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,600
has nothing to do with you.

368
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,240
Let your 1% go.

369
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,360
You've lost.

370
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,640
You've lost.

371
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,880
You've lost.

372
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,000
Don't say it too early.

373
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,120
There are still many days left.

374
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,200
What I can give you

375
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,960
can also be taken back.

376
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,600
Li Xun.

377
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
You're really something.

378
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,680
You're still like this

379
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,320
even though you're dead.

380
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,960
You've been so arrogant until now.

381
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,880
You don't blame anyone.

382
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,480
You don't blame Fang Zhijin or me.

383
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,400
You're just being selfish.

384
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,320
You deserve it.

385
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,040
By the way,

386
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,240
do you know how Fang Zhijin

387
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,560
found your sister?

388
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,720
I told her.

389
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,120
What did you say?

390
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,520
What did you say?

391
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,640
Li Xun.

392
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,680
Let go of me.

393
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,560
I'm waiting for you.

394
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,360
Calm down.

395
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,760
There's a library

396
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,160
and a computer here.

397
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,320
Have fun.

398
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,400
New hairstyle suits you.

399
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,040
I'll kill you if you don't believe me.

400
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,520
Calm down.

401
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:42,960
Li Xun.

402
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,680
Go.

403
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,400
Take me there.

404
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,840
Hold on.

405
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,760
Since he also learned from his hear penny in othersamo.

406
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,280
There were also people that acted in holding formulation.

407
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,520
How can I be seen by him and give him an explanation of situations like that?

408
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,400
Determine it quickly!

409
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,040
Chief,

410
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,200
have you decided yet?

411
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,840
Not yet.

412
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,800
I'll tell the driving case right away.

413
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,840
I know you want to beat that person to the ground

414
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,840
and make him kneel on the ground to apologize to you.

415
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,440
The key is, do you need to make a living for someone?

416
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,440
Three years ago,

417
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,840
I was already waiting for this moment.

418
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,640
What I want is not money,

419
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,640
nor a company.

420
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,640
I want dignity.

421
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,640
I lost it.

422
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,640
It has to be returned.

423
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,640
The domestic game market will not change in the next few years.

424
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,640
The sales of the game will be increased.

425
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,640
Many new teams will be able to enter the game.

426
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,640
It's exciting.

427
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,640
Of course, someone said

428
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,640
the most people can stay in the game room.

429
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,640
I'll go find Gao Jianhong.

430
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,640
When did he come out?

431
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,640
A few days ago.

432
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,640
A few days ago?

433
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,640
How did he come out at this time?

434
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,640
He was cut.

435
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,640
Why did he cut so much?

436
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,640
How long has it been?

437
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,640
More than three years.

438
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,640
You've only been a blind man for three years.

439
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,640
Feng Zhijing,

440
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,640
do you have to be so scared?

441
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,640
No,

442
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,640
don't you worry at all?

443
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,640
What should I worry about?

444
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,640
Why did he come out at this time?

445
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,640
Our company is about to be listed.

446
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,640
There shouldn't be any mistake.

447
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,640
Yixun is a man

448
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,640
who is always on the run.

449
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,640
Since he can find a way today,

450
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,640
he should be afraid.

451
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,640
Why?

452
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,640
You know better than me.

453
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,640
Even if he can climb up the sky,

454
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,640
he won't be able to do anything.

455
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,640
In three years,

456
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,640
how fast can this industry be updated?

457
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,640
In three years,

458
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,640
he can replace a generation of Internet users.

459
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,640
It's enough to erase all his things.

460
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,640
Erase?

461
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,640
You can learn again.

462
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,640
I can't tell.

463
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,640
You have a lot of confidence in your old enemies.

464
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,640
I'm not afraid of them.

465
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,640
Then let him come.

466
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,640
Feng Zhijing,

467
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,640
look at this place.

468
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,640
Look at this building.

469
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,640
Look at how many people and resources you have in your hands.

470
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,640
Look at him.

471
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,640
What does he have?

472
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,640
We spent three years

473
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,640
to do this.

474
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,640
Don't tell me that even if it's like this,

475
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,640
you still dare not fight with him.

476
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,640
You don't have to be so cold to me.

477
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,640
I'm not afraid of him.

478
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,640
I'm not afraid of him.

479
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,640
To the end,

480
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,640
it's what you did.

481
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,640
You bought it yourself.

482
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,640
But no matter what,

483
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,640
we are now on the same boat.

484
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,640
I hope you can win.

485
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,640
Come on.

486
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,640
To the three of us.

487
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,640
To the rich and the poor.

488
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,640
Cheers.

489
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,640
Zhu Yu,

490
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,640
if you didn't come back this time,

491
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,640
even though we're all in the same city,

492
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,640
the number of times I met Ren Di

493
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,640
is not as many as his fans.

494
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,640
Do you think he's interesting?

495
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,640
It's you.

496
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,640
We, Fang Dalu,

497
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,640
are the same age.

498
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,640
You're the same age.

499
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,640
You're the same age.

500
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,640
You're the same age.

501
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,640
It's you.

502
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,640
We, Fang Dalu,

503
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,640
are so different from each other.

504
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,640
We have to have a schedule

505
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,640
when we meet, right?

506
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,640
But Fang Shu Miao,

507
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,640
you're exaggerating.

508
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,640
You majored in computer engineering,

509
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,640
but you became a lawyer.

510
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,640
He wasn't a computer engineer

511
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,640
in college.

512
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,640
He was a student council member.

513
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,640
That's right.

514
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,640
People have to be like this.

515
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,640
They have to correct their own ways.

516
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,640
I think

517
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,640
the position of lawyer

518
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,640
is very suitable for me.

519
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,640
What's the name of your law firm?

520
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,640
Our law firm

521
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,640
is very famous in Shanghai.

522
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,640
It's a family of three founders.

523
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,640
My boss's surname is He,

524
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,640
my master's surname is Yuan.

525
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,640
Let me tell you.

526
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,640
Our boss and the lawyer are old and handsome.

527
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,640
But Ming Cao is the boss.

528
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,640
He was the first one

529
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,640
to have a formal relationship with his college.

530
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,640
Just like you,

531
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,640
he's a national hero.

532
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,640
What's this?

533
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,640
I'm almost blind.

534
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,640
Then you didn't understand

535
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,640
what he meant.

536
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,640
He wanted to tell you

537
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,640
that the career of a lawyer

538
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,640
has a bright future.

539
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,640
Don't talk nonsense.

540
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,640
How can you buy yourself a diamond ring?

541
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,640
Then which big boss?

542
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,640
This one.

543
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,640
I have to return it in two days.

544
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,640
Such a large amount of property

545
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,640
should be given in a fair way.

546
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,640
I don't plan to marry him.

547
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,640
I have to return it after breaking up.

548
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,640
I really can't bear to leave him.

549
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,640
Look at this bling.

550
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,640
It's so beautiful.

551
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,640
Stop being silly.

552
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,640
I'm going to be blind.

553
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,640
Enough.

554
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,640
Break up with him.

555
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,640
I'll introduce you to someone.

556
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,640
Fang Shu Miao.

557
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,640
Your life has changed so much.

558
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,640
It's called being more and more miserable.

559
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,640
Stop it.

560
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,640
I'm really going to be blind.

561
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,640
What's the name of the classmate

562
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,640
in our university?

563
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,640
Wu Meng Xin.

564
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,640
Didn't you say that when you graduated,

565
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,640
he carried your clothes back?

566
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,640
Is he still a star?

567
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,640
He's in the city committee now.

568
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,640
He has a bright future.

569
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,640
I still have a case to deal with.

570
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,640
So you've figured it out.

571
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:29,820
You're going to sell your

572
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,640
This is your own.

573
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,640
What kind of psychological activity

574
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,640
did you see your ex-lover this time?

575
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,640
You went back to school

576
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,640
just to touch him, right?

577
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,640
Of course not.

578
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,640
Of course not.

579
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,640
I'm leaving.

580
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,640
I'm going back to school.

581
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,640
I didn't expect it either.

582
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,640
Why are you all staring at me?

583
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,640
You're a criminal.

584
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,640
You're a lawyer.

585
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,640
You're a professional, aren't you?

586
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,640
It's not a professional disease.

587
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,640
It's just a gossip

588
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,640
about a dog blood story.

589
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,640
I don't have any gossip.

590
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,640
I'll leave tomorrow.

591
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,640
I'll be out of the country in two days.

592
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,640
I can't play those dog blood stories.

593
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,640
Li Xun

594
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,640
Is he still so handsome now?

595
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,640
No, Wu Muxin is handsome.

596
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,640
What are you talking about?

597
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,640
I want to hear it, too.

598
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,640
What are you talking about?

599
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,640
To Wu Muxin.

600
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,640
To Wu Muxin.

601
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,640
Why do you want to enter Wu Muxin?

602
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,640
Enter is not right.

603
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,640
Enter is wrong.

604
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,640
Enter.

605
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,640
Enter, he has money.

606
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,640
Enter.

607
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,640
Welcome to the city.

608
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,640
Thank you.

609
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,640
Your coffee.

610
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,640
Thank you.

611
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,640
Thank you.

612
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,640
I didn't sleep well last night.

613
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,640
It's okay.

614
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,640
You took your wallet back.

615
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,640
Why are you still unhappy?

616
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,640
No.

617
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,640
Do you know why Li Xun

618
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,640
took the key and left it behind?

619
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,640
Why?

620
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,640
Because he took the important things

621
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,640
and cared about them.

622
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,640
He cared about them

623
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,640
and stayed.

624
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,640
He let them go.

625
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,640
A man travels around

626
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,640
and forgets the past.

627
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,640
He looks forward to the future.

628
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,640
Finally, he decided

629
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,640
to move forward

630
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,640
with a firm will.

631
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,640
He is very kind.

632
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,640
I'm leaving.

633
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,640
Bye.

634
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,640
Hello, mom.

635
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,640
Hello, Yunyuan.

636
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,640
Are you together?

637
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,640
Yes, he is beside me.

638
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,640
That's good.

639
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,640
Your dad asked me to call

640
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,640
and ask when you will be home.

641
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,640
We will be home soon.

642
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,640
Okay.

643
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,640
I will cook more good dishes for you.

644
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,640
He is pushing us.

645
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,640
The 14th Internet Conference

646
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,640
will be held in the present day.

647
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,640
This conference is hosted by LP.

648
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,640
As the leading company in the Internet,

649
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,640
LP has been leading other game companies

650
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,640
and has become a standard company

651
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,640
for domestic games.

652
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,640
Your old classmates

653
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,640
are very good at posting.

654
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,640
LP will accelerate the current game

655
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,640
and new updates

656
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,640
and overseas releases.

657
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,640
It's a good chance to get the game out.

658
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,640
Thanks.

659
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,640
I'm here to get the money.

660
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,640
This money is for Li Xun.

661
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,640
Li Xun shouldn't ask for money from others.

662
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,640
Li Xun is a big shareholder of LP.

663
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,640
He said he wouldn't lack money.

664
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,640
Why would he ask for money

665
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,640
from others after he was released?

666
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,640
It's a bit strange.

667
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,640
What's wrong?

668
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,640
Li Xun is not on the shareholder list.

669
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,640
Is he looking for someone to replace the shareholder?

670
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,640
If the media knows

671
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,640
that the biggest shareholder of LP

672
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,640
is in prison,

673
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,640
it will be bad for LP.

674
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,640
It's possible.

675
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,640
But there is Fang Zhijing on the shareholder list.

676
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,640
Fang Zhijing?

677
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,640
The one Li Xun beat up?

678
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,640
Anyway,

679
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,640
Li Xun won't forgive Fang Zhijing.

680
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,640
He won't cooperate with him.

681
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,640
I need to go back.

682
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,640
Do you want me to go in with you?

683
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,640
No.

684
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,640
Actually,

685
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,640
you have nothing to do with them.

686
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,640
I'm not doing this for anyone.

687
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,640
LP has my salary.

688
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,640
I need to figure out the situation.

689
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,640
Mr. Gao.

690
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,640
Long time no see,

691
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,640
old classmate.

692
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,640
Long time no see.

693
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,640
Let's go.

694
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,640
I'll take you to see the place.

695
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,640
Zhu Yu, you should know

696
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,640
that I'm mainly playing games.

697
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,640
This is the project department.

698
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,640
Look at these hardware.

699
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,640
I ask to update to the highest configuration every six months.

700
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,640
The apartment is good, but it must be good.

701
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,640
When we were at the base,

702
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,640
we were still there.

703
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,640
Now we know what is the mountain outside the mountain.

704
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,640
This is the planning department.

705
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,640
They are in the meeting room every day.

706
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,640
They are in the office after the quarrel.

707
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,640
There are more than ten meeting rooms.

708
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,640
I plan to change the two floors upstairs

709
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,640
into open space.

710
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,640
At least twice a month,

711
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,640
I'll have to come to the mental hospital twice.

712
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,640
The legal department is downstairs.

713
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,640
I opened the company to know that

714
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,640
it's too expensive to raise lawyers.

715
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,640
It's millions a year.

716
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,640
But I can't just ignore it.

717
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,640
I'll take you downstairs.

718
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,640
Gao.

719
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,640
Let's talk alone.

720
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,640
Okay.

721
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,640
Zhu Yu, how do you feel?

722
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,640
I know you.

723
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,640
Now you graduated from a prestigious school.

724
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,640
You have seen a lot of things.

725
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,640
But we are not working.

726
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,640
You come to me.

727
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,640
I'll give you a chance.

728
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,640
Why is there a prescription

729
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,640
on the LLP shareholder list?

730
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,640
So you are guilty.

731
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,640
Why is there a prescription

732
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,640
on the LLP shareholder list?

733
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,640
Why can't it be?

734
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,640
Fang Zhijin is not only the LLP shareholder,

735
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,640
but also the LLP vice president and CTO.

736
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,640
He is my partner.

737
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,640
Gao, what's going on?

738
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,640
Three years ago, Li Xun sent me out

739
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,640
and entrusted the company to you.

740
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,640
You know everything

741
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,640
between us and Fang Zhijin.

742
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,640
What's the difference

743
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,640
between you and stabbing him now?

744
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,640
I'm going to stab him.

745
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,640
What?

746
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,640
Gao,

747
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,640
no matter what misunderstanding

748
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,640
you have with Li Xun,

749
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,640
Fang Zhijin can't stay in LLP.

750
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,640
This is Li Xun's company.

751
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,640
This is my company.

752
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,640
You have checked the LLP shareholder list.

753
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,640
You should have seen it clearly.

754
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,640
Li Xun has no shares in LLP.

755
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,640
When he was in jail,

756
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,640
he transferred all your shares to me.

757
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,640
I also dealt with

758
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,640
your online medical system.

759
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,640
So from that time,

760
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,640
Li Xun has no good relationship

761
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,640
with LLP.

762
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,640
You used Li Xun's trust

763
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,640
to take over LLP.

764
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,640
I should have thought

765
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,640
that this is not his company.

766
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,640
Li Xun will not destroy LLP's

767
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,640
future and reputation for money.

768
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,640
Whatever you say.

769
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,640
Anyway, the current LLP

770
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,640
is my Gao Jianhong's.

771
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,640
He won't let you go.

772
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,640
To tell you the truth,

773
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,640
since the university days,

774
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,640
I have been looking forward to

775
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,640
having a fight with Li Xun

776
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,640
to see who will win.

777
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,640
The result of this fight

778
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,640
will be very cruel.

779
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,640
Even if Li Xun did something wrong,

780
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,640
at least he has been

781
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,640
sincere to you.

782
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,640
You are still the same as before.

783
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,640
You don't give anyone a chance.

784
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,640
You will always stand by Li Xun unconditionally.

785
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,640
Compared to the four years of university,

786
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,640
the pain and torture he brought me,

787
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,640
this is far from enough.

788
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,640
You can't win him.

789
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,640
I admit that he is a genius.

790
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,640
But the most important thing

791
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,640
in this era is genius.

792
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,640
It's different from the university days.

793
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,640
Look at the current LLP.

794
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,640
There are geniuses everywhere like him.

795
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,640
I can get as much as I want.

796
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,640
What can he win me with?

797
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,640
But you forgot one thing.

798
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,640
There are many geniuses in this era.

799
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,640
But Li Xun is the only one.

800
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,640
I, Gao Jianhong, am the only one.

801
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,640
If you regret it now,

802
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,640
I will consider releasing you.

803
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,640
From today on,

804
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,640
I will get the LLP back.

805
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,640
What?

806
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,640
Get it back?

807
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,640
You always fool me.

808
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,640
Miss Zhu.

809
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,640
What a coincidence.

810
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,640
Long time no see.

811
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,640
I really care about you.

812
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,640
I'm here.

813
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,640
