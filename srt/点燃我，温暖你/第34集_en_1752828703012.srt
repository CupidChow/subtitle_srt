00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if the light is very bright

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will still watch over that vast vast land

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless atmosphere

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day, the lens is a little bit yellow

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast night?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I burn up the night just for you to remember

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How everything was in the beginning

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The wind is like a wild grass

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The mountain is broken, but you are still by my side

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Everything is the original look

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The King of Blaze

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Episode 16

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
In short, we will be on the basis of the original code of the King of Blaze

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Make a better and more playable game

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The premise is to avoid all possible legal risks

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
In order to avoid affecting the company's listing

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The code of the King of Blaze is very shabby

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Once the most critical part is changed

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It will affect the specific work

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We spent a week

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Trying to find a replacement plan

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Didn't find

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
No

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Even if the game is not enough

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We can't let the people of the company

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
To use the code to sue us

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Is there any other way?

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
No need to change

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is a trap

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The reason Li Xun wrote such a shabby code

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Is because he forced us to change

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
No matter how we change

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It is also in his control range

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We can't change

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
No matter how we change

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It is also in his control range

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Then, Mr. Gao

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Our perfect girlfriend

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Use it directly

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Perfect girlfriend

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
To use the fastest time to get online

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
There is only one way

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It is to use the game source code of the love blind box directly

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I disagree

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I disagree

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You go out first

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Gao Jianhong

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Are you crazy?

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You stole the code and black code before

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I know you are angry

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But we used the eight styles

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
To use the core gameplay

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
No matter what

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You can't use the original code directly

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You are crazy

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
There are many game codes that open online

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Many

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Where do you think I have many?

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Do you think it's a greedy snake and a lotus?

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I tell you

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Li Xun's set of things

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Is completely self-composed

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Where did you go?

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Gao Jianhong

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
After the company is listed

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I don't care what you do

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I am ok

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But now is the most sensitive time

76
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You will send us to jail

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Since I want to use his original code

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I have considered the problem of suing

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I am not afraid of him

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Powerful lawsuit

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
High cost, low compensation

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's hard to get a good position

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The small company can't stand us

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Believe me

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
In less than a week

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He will withdraw

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I am so happy

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I know you are happy

89
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You are so happy

90
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You are so happy

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You are so happy

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You are so happy

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You believe it yourself

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
How can you kill them?

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I tell you

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Li Xun's capital chain

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Not only is it as simple as Feiyang

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Not to mention the investors who are looking for him

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
He has a brother

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I remember

101
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The one in Qinghong band

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Ren Di

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
He is also your college classmate

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Why do they all help him

105
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Not you?

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Gao Jianhong

107
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I have never seen Li Xun give up

108
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But you

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I am looking forward to seeing you

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The day you kill him

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You should take care of yourself

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You are so anxious to let your perfect girlfriend go online

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You are so anxious to see the ghost

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Fang Zhijun

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Who do you think you are?

116
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You dare to compare with me

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I think you are the partner

118
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You are the partner

119
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Otherwise

120
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You are a worker

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Really?

122
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
How much power do you think you have?

123
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Ok

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Ok

125
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You said it

126
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Ok

127
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I won't accompany you to send the message

128
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I will count my shares today

129
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I won't play with you

130
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Don't worry

131
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I will help you get a resignation as soon as possible

132
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Then I will go

133
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Gao Jianhong

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Look at the computer screen

135
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Look at your bad attitude

136
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Do you know

137
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The company is bankrupt without me

138
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
These years

139
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I have been helping the company

140
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
To get business, money and resources

141
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You really think the company

142
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Rely on you to get here

143
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Ok

144
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I will show you today

145
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
If I leave

146
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
How many people will stay?

147
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Will the company collapse?

148
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And the listing

149
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's a secret

150
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Fang Zhijun

151
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I tell you

152
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What I care about

153
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Is not the listing

154
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I will go

155
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What time is it?

156
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's four o'clock

157
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Nothing

158
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
From their original code

159
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
To the new art resources and technical work

160
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We are not ready

161
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Are you sure?

162
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The Italian port

163
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Was copied by Gao Jianhong

164
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
With the level of LP platform

165
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Another game of the same game

166
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The Friar of the Fogs has no remorse

167
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We will lose the only income so far

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
This is a gamble

169
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Do you still believe me?

170
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
But Li Xun

171
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You can't do technical upgrades

172
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And prepare such a complicated

173
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Knowledge property rights

174
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
We have Fang Shumiao

175
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You can't carry so much alone

176
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You have been working for a week

177
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
After this battle

178
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I have time to rest

179
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I will go

180
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
This is the hottest girl now

181
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Gao Jianhong

182
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Really willing to pay

183
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The place where LP is willing to spend money

184
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Is publicity

185
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Their investment

186
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Six percent of it is on the campaign

187
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
This is just the internal strategy

188
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's called non-publicity

189
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I have to go

190
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I have to go

191
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I have to go

192
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I have to go

193
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I have to go

194
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I have to go

195
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I have to go

196
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Done

197
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Perfect girl on the left

198
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:52,600
Love

199
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Let's copy it first

200
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Anyway, they think

201
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
There are ways to force you to withdraw

202
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Li Xun

203
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Prepare for the lawsuit

204
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The information is ready

205
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Ask Hou Ning if you have any questions

206
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
When is the lawsuit?

207
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
No hurry

208
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Wait for their game to be online

209
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Let's make a big turn

210
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
During this time

211
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You contact other companies

212
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
All projects with LP

213
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Companies with copyright disputes

214
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Run a trip

215
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
They are willing to file a lawsuit

216
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
We can bear all the costs

217
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
If you don't want to

218
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It doesn't matter

219
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Try to collect more material evidence

220
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Don't think so much

221
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Tension and dissection

222
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I have to go

223
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's the same

224
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Li Xun

225
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Li Xun

226
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Li Xun

227
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Li Xun, what's wrong?

228
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Li Xun

229
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I will be fine

230
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Family can't come in

231
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Li Xun

232
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Let go first

233
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'll be out in a while

234
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Okay, just do a CT

235
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's not a death sentence

236
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Be good

237
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Let go first

238
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
How is it?

239
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Nothing

240
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I didn't know you were here

241
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You used to come to our hospital

242
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Have you seen it?

243
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Correct

244
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But it was a few years ago

245
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It was a problem with the waist

246
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
What does it do?

247
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
IT computer industry

248
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
No wonder

249
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But don't worry

250
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
No big problem

251
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's still a problem with the spine

252
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
There is a spinal cord injury caused by the waist

253
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The symptoms are obvious

254
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
As for me

255
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Your industry

256
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's a high-end industry

257
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It can kill several

258
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But how can the problem of the spine

259
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
How can it faint

260
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Its back is stiff

261
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Blood can't go up

262
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
When it comes to the shoulder

263
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
But its brain

264
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But it's always working at high intensity

265
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Long-term need

266
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
High oxygen and high blood pressure

267
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
When the oxygen is conflicted

268
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It doesn't faint

269
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
What should I do?

270
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Rest

271
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Exercise

272
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Brother Xiao Chu

273
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Zhu Yu

274
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Are you okay?

275
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm fine

276
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I heard from Guo Shijie

277
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I just knew he was hospitalized

278
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
These days

279
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You didn't contact me

280
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You are right

281
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
His health is not very good

282
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
All by one breath

283
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
No one has endless energy

284
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Being able to live a healthy life

285
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Is the most difficult thing

286
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You seem to be the first time

287
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Remember my words so clearly

288
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Decided

289
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Don't go

290
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Don't go

291
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I have never seen a girl

292
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Can force yourself to go

293
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But never regret

294
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Zhu Yu

295
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I came this time

296
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Just want to say goodbye to you in person

297
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I decided to give up

298
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I said so

299
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Are you a little relaxed?

300
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
In this world

301
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Women in love

302
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
There are so many

303
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
But can put your fate

304
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Work, life, ideals

305
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
All pinched together

306
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And a woman who can bear it

307
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Too few

308
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You can't bear it either

309
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Just try harder

310
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
OK

311
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I will remind you one last time

312
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You and Li Xun

313
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
The regrets of two people

314
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Have a lot

315
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Don't waste it so carelessly

316
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Ask your own heart

317
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Take courage

318
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Go face it

319
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You are thin again

320
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's nice to fight for love

321
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
But if you fall in the work position

322
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Not romantic at all

323
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Not romantic at all

324
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I know

325
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Then I'm leaving

326
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm leaving

327
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Who

328
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Morning

329
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Where is Li Xun

330
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm here

331
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,900
to not tell me that she will wird.

332
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,580
How do you feel now?

333
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,660
Much better.

334
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,300
I'll make some porridge.

335
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,340
It will be hot, remove the retired.

336
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,120
Never say a word

337
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,440
I kept it safe

338
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,240
What happened

339
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,600
it is not

340
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,920
What to do

341
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,720
What is the results

342
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,520
Call me out

343
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
What's wrong?

344
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
What else?

345
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,480
Nothing.

346
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,200
What else?

347
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,800
Nothing.

348
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,640
Are you going to teach me?

349
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,240
I'm not.

350
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:15,880
Are you going to teach me?

351
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,600
I'm not.

352
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
Are you going to teach me?

353
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,520
How do you know everything?

354
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,520
Hurry up.

355
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,240
Take it.

356
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,600
Take care of yourself.

357
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,000
I'll keep these first.

358
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,080
She's so annoying.

359
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,320
Who's annoying?

360
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,320
Yifan.

361
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,680
What's wrong?

362
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,320
My arm.

363
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,880
It's sore.

364
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,360
Is it?

365
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,040
Does it hurt?

366
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,040
It hurts.

367
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,280
Does it hurt?

368
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,280
It hurts.

369
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,080
Can you not hurt yourself?

370
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,560
You just came back from the hospital.

371
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,560
You still want to go back?

372
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,400
I've already asked Dong Siyang for leave.

373
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,840
You're not allowed to go to work this week.

374
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,840
Take care of yourself.

375
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,040
You're really good at making decisions.

376
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,520
You're so bold now.

377
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,560
I can be even bolder.

378
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
Really?

379
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,280
Wait and see.

380
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,800
I'll let you see now.

381
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,080
If you're capable,

382
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,760
you can get a good shot and settle the score with me.

383
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,600
So relieved.

384
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
I've told you,

385
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,720
I've told you to rest.

386
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,680
Listen,

387
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,640
I'm the man of the jag vertices.

388
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,560
When the coupe plays a auspiciousが

389
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:02,600
In the era of

390
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,720
Get a good shot

391
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,520
In the world of the lock

392
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,520
this special period.

393
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,480
We'll be facing

394
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,240
the LPs soon.

395
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,960
Everyone, be prepared.

396
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,920
I have only one request.

397
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
Just do it.

398
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,160
Huang Ning,

399
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,000
tell us the sequence

400
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,680
of the Love Box.

401
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,960
The next update

402
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,240
will mainly improve the process,

403
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,440
increase the double verification,

404
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,240
and add the feature of

405
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,080
brushing the copybook with friends.

406
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:27,960
It's a multi-person mode.

407
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,920
This game is still in the team?

408
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,800
Zhu Zheng Lei,

409
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,840
you said you wouldn't participate

410
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,200
in the Love Box.

411
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,640
Do I want to?

412
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,480
I can't hear you

413
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,240
surrounding me.

414
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,000
Okay, get up.

415
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,720
Let's do it.

416
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,400
What's wrong with you?

417
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,200
Let's do it.

418
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,200
Let's do it seriously.

419
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,280
You can do it best.

420
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:54,880
Look at you.

421
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,360
Let's go.

422
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:57,760
Seven.

423
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,280
Let's move.

424
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,760
Ready.

425
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,520
Go.

426
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,240
One, two, three.

427
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,520
What are you doing?

428
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,200
See if there's anything wrong.

429
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,680
I've confirmed it with Li Xun.

430
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,520
He can be ready

431
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,400
to hand over the court at any time.

432
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,120
What else did he say?

433
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,480
Nothing.

434
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,000
He said that

435
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,080
the time is just right.

436
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,480
Gao Jianhong,

437
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,280
the perfect girlfriend,

438
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,360
is in her peak period

439
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,360
and is in the period

440
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:35,960
of the LLP's

441
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,560
Procuratorate of Justice.

442
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,200
We were so desperate

443
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,040
to do it.

444
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,960
He's really cruel.

445
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,240
LLP owes us a lot.

446
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,800
There are too many companies

447
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,000
that have the right to dispute with them.

448
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,160
The small companies before

449
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,120
either gave up

450
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,880
or couldn't afford to pay.

451
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,320
But this time,

452
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,960
we have enough evidence.

453
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,000
Li Zhuangyuan is going to kill people.

454
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,080
When is the day?

455
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,560
It's a holiday in a few days.

456
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:05,960
The legal department of LLP

457
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,120
should have booked

458
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,440
the tickets for the vacation.

459
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,520
You're so vicious.

460
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:11,840
Thank you.

461
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,480
I'm off work now.

462
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,000
Wait for me.

463
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,240
I'll go back later.

464
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,160
Come in.

465
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,880
Mr. Wang.

466
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,520
I just received

467
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,480
the court's pass.

468
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,320
Put it here.

469
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,560
Don't you want to see it?

470
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,520
What's there to see?

471
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,320
The company's lawyer's card

472
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,760
can be booked as a book.

473
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,880
You can come back and see it.

474
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,240
Shan Shan.

475
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,080
Which company

476
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,720
is suing us this time?

477
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,120
I saw it.

478
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,120
It's a collective lawsuit.

479
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,560
I'm the main lawsuit for the flying network.

480
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,160
There are more than ten companies behind it.

481
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,760
Don't be afraid.

482
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,160
Return the ticket.

483
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,040
Call everyone back.

484
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,680
The lawsuit itself is not difficult.

485
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,880
But our company

486
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,520
is now in the critical period of listing.

487
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,200
This collective lawsuit

488
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,080
is easy to be criticized.

489
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,200
And it will make shareholders

490
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,600
distrust our company.

491
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,400
Don't worry.

492
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,200
But our situation is very passive.

493
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,480
Once this thing is out of control...

494
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,440
Why does everyone

495
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,640
want me to say it over and over again?

496
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,280
Since I dare to do this,

497
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,840
I have a way to deal with him.

498
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,360
Do you understand?

499
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,240
Okay.

500
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:02,920
Gao Qianhong.

501
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,280
Gao Qianhong.

502
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,800
Why are you here?

503
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,640
Gao Qianhong is not here.

504
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,040
He doesn't live here anymore.

505
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,600
I just came to see you.

506
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,440
Gao is sick.

507
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,040
Sick?

508
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,400
Brain cancer.

509
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,880
Dr. Chen has saved him from the death of your brother.

510
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,000
The doctor said

511
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,720
you should get the surgery this time,

512
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,660
to find Mr. Hu,

513
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,440
How is this malignant assured?

514
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,200
He doesn't even tell me about it.

515
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,600
No. He never said that.

516
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,080
I saw him go to the neurosurgery department.

517
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,960
I looked for someone to investigate.

518
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,840
Only then did I know.

519
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,080
The doctor said

520
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,720
Gao was not going to treat him.

521
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,640
Then why did you tell me?

522
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,280
What do you think?

523
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,240
The LOP was washed.

524
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,760
Li Xun did it, right?

525
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,680
Finally.

526
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,680
This time is very troublesome.

527
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,480
If you can't do it well,

528
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,640
not only will the company be listed on the world's top,

529
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,960
but also the company will lose a lot of money.

530
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,200
Very, very much money.

531
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,280
What's more,

532
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,480
as long as this door is opened,

533
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,520
there will be a series of companies

534
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,080
that will be the same as the same.

535
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,200
By that time,

536
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,280
the company will really face the death of life and death.

537
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,240
I'm not going to do it.

538
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,280
Aren't you going to resign?

539
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,120
What's your business?

540
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,000
Do you think I care?

541
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,120
I haven't sold my shares yet.

542
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,720
Think about it.

543
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,960
Who else dares to take over once this matter comes out?

544
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,760
If it doesn't go to the market, it's okay.

545
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,240
What if I lost money and went to jail?

546
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,920
That's what you should do.

547
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,560
Right.

548
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,680
I am indeed a scapegoat.

549
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,720
What about Lao Gao?

550
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,160
Have you ever thought about Lao Gao?

551
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,200
He did this.

552
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,440
He should have been prepared for it.

553
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,520
Xu Li Na.

554
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,840
Xu Li Na.

555
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,960
You can touch your conscience and say it.

556
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,880
Gao Jian Hong treated you well.

557
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,840
When you were having the most difficult time,

558
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,320
Lao Gao helped you.

559
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,480
Even if he did anything wrong,

560
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,840
he was sincere to you.

561
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,440
You don't need to tell me that.

562
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,080
He's in a bad state now.

563
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,840
I just don't want you to see him like this.

564
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,920
You just

565
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,360
have to get this whole case over with.

566
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,120
Then Lao Gao will possibly go for operations in time.

567
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,400
A hundred kind- Natural chairman in a twist,

568
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,520
do you really want him dead like this?

569
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,440
Then, what can I do?

570
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,440
I'm not going to be a good friend to you.

571
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,440
I'm going to find Zhu Yan and Li Xun.

572
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,440
They will listen to me?

573
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,440
No matter what,

574
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,440
Lao Gao and them are old classmates.

575
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,440
You can use Lao Gao's medical records to torture them.

576
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,440
Just take Lao Gao's medical records.

577
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,440
There are so many things that can't be taken away from him.

578
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,440
It's best...

579
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,440
It's best to convince Li Xun

580
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,440
to come over to see him.

581
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,440
This will have a better effect.

582
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,440
I know Li Xun.

583
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,440
He won't listen.

584
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,440
I don't know Li Xun.

585
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,440
Do you think you know him?

586
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,440
Li Xun's sister is just a pretense in front of him.

587
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,440
He must have a reason for the death of his friends.

588
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,440
Don't look at him as a cold person.

589
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,440
He's actually a sensitive person.

590
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,440
This time,

591
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,440
I'll make him take the Liu family.

592
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,440
Liu family?

593
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,440
Liu family?

594
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,440
Liu family?

595
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,440
Liu family?

596
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,440
Liu family?

597
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,440
Liu family?

598
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,440
Liu family?

599
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,440
Liu family?

600
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,440
Liu family?

601
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,440
Liu family?

602
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,440
Liu family?

603
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,440
Liu family?

604
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,440
Liu family?

605
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,440
Liu family?

606
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,440
Liu family?

607
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,440
Liu family?

608
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,440
Liu family?

609
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,440
Liu family?

610
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,440
Liu family?

611
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,440
Liu family?

612
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,440
Liu family?

613
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,440
Liu family?

614
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,440
Liu family?

615
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,440
Liu family?

616
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,440
Liu family?

617
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,440
Liu family?

618
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,440
Liu family?

619
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,440
Liu family?

620
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:42,080
Never were my feelings after my

621
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,020
Noble Consort Consort's death.

622
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,320
It all began in her faster than anyone.

623
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,140
Then don't say anything more.

624
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,300
You'll say what's on your mind in the chain now.

625
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,840
With my sister,

626
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,560
Qingloade Hu recreational houses escape fromatoriums.

627
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,080
They can give you another ball.

628
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,920
Okay, take the call.

629
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,680
It's not one of infective factors.

630
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,040
Tell me.

631
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,720
I want to,

632
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,040
the bottle.

633
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,320
How are we leading the situation here?

634
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,000
It's operation is done,

635
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
This is CT.

636
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I didn't want to say this,

637
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
but I really can't think of any other way.

638
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Brain cancer treatment.

639
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
It's disgusting.

640
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
You don't withdraw from the hospital.

641
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
The doctor won't do the surgery.

642
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I hope

643
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
your old relationship

644
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
is not said by anyone.

645
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
If he knew I was here today,

646
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
he would be very unhappy.

647
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
It's Fang Zhijing who asked you to come.

648
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I'm here to see you.

649
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I'm here for you.

650
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Did Fang Zhijing ask you to come?

651
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
No.

652
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
He told me.

653
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
But I decided to come today.

654
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
He kept the contract of your three.

655
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I can't think of any other way.

656
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Lao Gao must do the surgery immediately.

657
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
But now he won't give up.

658
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I made the decision.

659
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Lao Gao really doesn't know.

660
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
He always wants to be your father.

661
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
In fact, I haven't done anything for him

662
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
these years with Lao Gao.

663
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
He doesn't have many days.

664
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I don't want to leave regrets.

665
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Zhuyuan.

666
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
You also persuade Li Xun.

667
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
He's been living in hatred all the time.

668
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
It's tiring.

669
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
He has been in love for four years.

670
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Don't waste time on others.

671
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Throw it away.

672
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Li Xun.

673
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Zhuyuan.

674
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Do you think we are easy to bully?

675
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Why does Fang Zhijing think

676
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
we will cooperate with him?

677
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
You must have asked him to come.

678
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Gao Jianhong will never bow to us.

679
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
He won't die.

680
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
It's a bad thing.

681
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So?

682
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Fang Shumiao called.

683
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
He said the legal department of LLP

684
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
wanted us to sit down and talk.

685
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
As long as we reconcile,

686
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
we can open as many companies as we want.

687
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
It's Fang Zhijing's doing.

688
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
He is cooperating with shareholders to test the pressure.

689
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Is it possible?

690
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Impossible.

691
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Okay.

692
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I'll call

693
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
and tell Fang Shumiao to reply.

694
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Fang Shumiao also said

695
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
the Securities and Exchange Commission

696
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
has asked LLP

697
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
to supplement the materials.

698
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
The reason is

699
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
the representative company of the reorganization

700
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
is full of uncertainty

701
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
in terms of business capabilities.

702
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
So we can refuse to meet.

703
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
We can meet.

704
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Why not?

705
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I'm here.

706
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
What are you doing?

707
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
You have been meeting for a long time.

708
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
The Fourth Season of Sunzi's Law

709
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
is to be used to serve the country.

710
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
To train the enemy and to break through.

711
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
When the enemy is tired,

712
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
we can give them a head start.

713
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
What have you learned

714
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
in the past thousand days?

715
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
That's what Mr. Yuan taught me.

716
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
How did you not learn

717
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
my skills?

718
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Go.

719
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Don't stand in the classroom all the time.

720
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Go to sleep quickly.

721
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
You have a meeting with the lawyer.

722
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Yes.

723
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Long time no see.

724
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Fang Da.

725
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Long time no see, Mr. Gao.

726
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
You are getting less and less

727
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
gentlemanly.

728
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I'm sorry.

729
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Lawyer Fang.

730
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Where is your client?

731
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Mr. Li is not available.

732
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
He asked me to talk to him.

733
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
There is no way.

734
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
A lot of funds have been used to recruit.

735
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Today, several investors

736
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
are waiting to see Mr. Li.

737
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
If you want to see him, you have to make a number.

738
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Okay.

739
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Then we will open the door and enter the mountain.

740
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
LP is the leading company in the game industry.

741
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
It has always been

742
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
helping small game companies in the industry.

743
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
In order to create a good

744
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
industry environment,

745
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
we are willing to take out 30 million RMB

746
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
to support

747
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
the leading small game company.

748
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
What are the conditions?

749
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
You have to cancel the final notice of LP.

750
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
A final notice?

751
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
LP is willing to spend 30 million RMB.

752
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Aren't you afraid that people will come to you every day?

753
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Lawyer Fang.

754
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
It's true that you say it a thousand times.

755
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Besides, there are too many people who are interested in LP.

756
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
People are willing to see

757
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
those bloody holes.

758
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
By the way,

759
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
for your control group,

760
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
we also retained the right to

761
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
counterfeit your slander.

762
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Of course, I said that

763
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
LP, as the big brother,

764
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
always wants to lead everyone to move forward together.

765
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
We are also generous.

766
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
These 30 million RMB is just a problem

767
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
for LP.

768
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
But for you,

769
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
it's different.

770
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
We?

771
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
The most important thing for us as lawyers

772
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
is to put the interests of the parties first.

773
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
You are leading the collective lawsuit.

774
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Shouldn't you ask

775
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
the opinions of other parties first?

776
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Is Mr. Wang teaching me how to do things?

777
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Miss Fang,

778
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
let's make a deal.

779
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Actually, the conditions we have

780
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
are very good.

781
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
You can persuade your party.

782
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
It's not up to you to decide whether it's good or not.

783
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Besides, you should have paid this money earlier.

784
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
You just became a lawyer,

785
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
it's not long, right?

786
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I checked you.

787
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
You are not from the class,

788
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
but you are a student of legal exam,

789
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
and your academic ability is not high.

790
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
You can also be a lawyer.

791
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
No wonder you don't know the rules.

792
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
A big mouth like you

793
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
is not a good negotiation skill.

794
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
You will harm your mentor.

795
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I can't compare this with Mr. Wang.

796
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I studied law for seven years,

797
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
but the best I learned

798
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
was to help the evil.

799
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Mr. Wang,

800
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
you can go out.

801
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I want to talk to my old classmate alone.

802
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Okay.

803
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Why did Li Xun suddenly agree to let you come?

804
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Xu Li Na has found Li Xun and Zhu Yun.

805
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
They know you are sick.

806
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I said

807
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Li Xun never

808
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
dare to waste time.

809
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
If he is determined to drag it to the end,

810
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
he won't give anyone a chance to talk.

811
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
He let you come

812
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
means he has moved.

813
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
But I don't need it.

814
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I don't need him to sympathize with me.

815
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Do you know why we dare to

816
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
directly copy the love blinds?

817
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Because you have no choice.

818
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
You never doubted

819
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
why I dare to copy it directly?

820
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I don't know.

821
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I just want to know

822
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
why you dare to copy it directly.

823
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I don't know.

824
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I just want to know

825
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
why you dare to copy it directly.

826
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I just want to know

827
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
why you dare to copy it directly.

828
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I just want to know

829
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
why you dare to copy it directly.

830
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I just want to know

831
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
why you dare to copy it directly.

832
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I just want to know

833
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
why you dare to copy it directly.

834
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I just want to know

835
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
why you dare to copy it directly.

836
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I just want to know

837
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
why you dare to copy it directly.

838
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I just want to know

839
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
why you dare to copy it directly.

840
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I just want to know

841
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
why you dare to copy it directly.

842
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Hello, Miao Miao!

843
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Zhu Yu, Li Xun decide to withdraw.

844
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
When?

845
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
A while ago.

846
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Now?

847
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Why?

848
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Zhu Yu, hang in there.

849
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,200
Can you see clearly?

850
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,640
I didn't dare to judge you.

851
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,240
After a few words.

852
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,600
If I say something wrong again,

853
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,400
I'll throw you a adult thesis.

854
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:34,800
Video notifications are not朋友 自由

855
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,760
Hello.

856
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,680
Do you believe me?

857
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,360
Does he really care about me?

858
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,680
Before I die,

859
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,640
I must beat him once.

860
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,280
Did you regret it?

861
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,400
I will fight him to the end.

862
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,480
So you also stand on his side.

863
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:52,920
Zhou Yue.

864
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,360
Why did we become like this today?

865
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:13,240
You won the world for me.

866
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:19,680
The car in the city never stops.

867
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:24,200
I lean on your shoulder.

868
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:30,800
We won't be separated.

869
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,040
Get out of the noisy world.

870
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,240
Accompany me.

871
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:40,720
I'm your new index finger.

872
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,800
Raise me up and bravely move forward.

873
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:50,440
Like the flame of night.

874
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,400
Cause I believe I love you.

875
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,960
True love will take its course.

876
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,800
I'm by your side.

877
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,800
I'll spend the long time with you.

878
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:16,320
Cause I believe I want you.

879
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,800
True love will take its course.

880
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:24,800
Like the flame of night.

881
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:34,000
Cause I believe I want you.

882
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,200
It's the intuition of dream.

883
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,760
독辉书

884
00:45:53,880 --> 00:46:19,220
worth over

885
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:27,600
I won't, I won't, I won't lose to time again

886
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:32,200
Because I believe I love you

887
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:36,600
True love will take its course

888
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:41,800
I'm by your side

889
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,400
Spending all my time with you

890
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:50,000
Because I believe I want you

891
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,400
True love will take its course

892
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,800
The burning fireworks

893
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:09,600
You've always been the one to light up my way

894
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:14,400
Because I believe I love you

895
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,800
True love will take its course

896
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:24,000
I'm by your side

897
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,600
Spending all my time with you

898
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:32,000
Because I believe I want you

899
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,600
True love will take its course

900
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:41,000
The burning fireworks

901
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:50,000
You've always been the one to light up my way

902
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,400
Oh, oh, oh

903
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,800
The burning fireworks

904
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:10,600
You've always been the one to light up my way
