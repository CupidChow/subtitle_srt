YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if the light is very bright

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will still watch over that vast vast land

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless atmosphere

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day, the lens is a little bit yellow

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast night?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I burn up the night just for you to remember

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How everything was in the beginning

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The wind and the color of the night are like wild grass

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The mountains are broken, but you are still by my side

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Everything is the original look

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The King of Blaze

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Episode 1

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You said there were so many people joining the base

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
My home

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You usually copy Zhu Yun's homework

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Why do you add it?

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
For the future

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Can copy Li Xun's

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
There is no Han Jinliang in this base

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Li Xun built this base

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
To start a business

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
He picked it up himself

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's also an outside project

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The capital is also prepared by himself

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I made money and I will share it with the college

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
He's starting to make money

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So great

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So what?

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I came to college to learn things

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
When can I make money?

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
When the time is not enough

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Can't find a job, can't keep my eyes on

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
He will regret it

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
He is a project-oriented trainee

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Much more than you, a two-year class leader

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Fang Shumiao, what will you eat later?

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Where is he?

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Ok, everyone is free to move

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I will tell you what I have to do

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Ke'ai's show is here

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Who is the breakfast for?

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Did you pay for the homework?

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Still have time to gossip

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I ate

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Give it to Lao Gao

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Where is Lao Gao?

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Lao Gao is angry

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I am afraid he has to go to the school

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He is in the classroom

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I think he is so angry

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
He has to go to the school

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
He is in the classroom

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I think he is so angry

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I think he is so angry

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I think he is so angry

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I think he is so angry

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
As far as I know

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The school has not approved the fact that the foundation will use the classroom

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Is it approved?

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Captain Ke

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Would you please help me get the watch back?

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
There are so many classrooms in the school

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Must you share it?

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Not share

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I am followers of Okinawa Nobles

73
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,640
What's this room for?

74
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:28,720
This is our class

75
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,520
class

76
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,340
Yu, I

77
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,680
I didn't eat

78
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,280
If your interest group hasn't disbanded and you have nowhere to go,

79
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,600
you can have an activity here.

80
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,800
Thank you.

81
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,200
Representative Ge, is this Li Junyou?

82
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,920
Where's mine?

83
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,320
Shut up.

84
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,400
Entry No. 9

85
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,920
The interest group has disbanded.

86
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,520
You can leave if you want.

87
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,000
Anyway, I forced you to come in.

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,920
That base is indeed more useful than the interest group.

89
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,120
Gao, why did you establish the interest group?

90
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,160
No reason.

91
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,280
I just want to learn more.

92
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,480
Why did you disband?

93
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,960
They organized the activities for them.

94
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,880
We organized our activities.

95
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,320
Our people are all gone.

96
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,080
Even Fang Shumiao is in the lead.

97
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,920
She's so shameless.

98
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,680
I can't afford to lose her.

99
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,360
Do you want to make a bet?

100
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,000
If I get the ball,

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,560
even if there's only the two of us,

102
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,320
we'll stay.

103
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,440
You still believe this?

104
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,280
You passed the whole exam.

105
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,600
I'm a 142-year-old math student.

106
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,120
I'm just a C-grad student.

107
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,360
We're not worse than others.

108
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,960
We're worse than Li Xun.

109
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,800
I heard that

110
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,840
it's not the coin that makes you decide to throw the coin.

111
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,240
Actually, when you were throwing the coin,

112
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,560
you already had an answer in your mind.

113
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,200
Anyway, I'll stay.

114
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
What about you?

115
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,560
You're a girl.

116
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,560
If there's no mole,

117
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,560
then come up and point at me.

118
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,760
Draw something.

119
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,080
Don't play with me.

120
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,320
If there's no mole,

121
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,280
then come up and point at me.

122
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:26,180
Yang Chaoyue, the most famous 40-year-old man in China

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,600
What about the wealthy and wealthy

124
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,600
What about Liu Sisi

125
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,640
No

126
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,080
The AUFFLICberg

127
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,480
And Zhu Liye

128
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,260
Zhu Liye

129
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,080
Zhener

130
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,280
Deng...Deng...Deng Tuo?

131
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,280
It's Deng Yao. I'm here.

132
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,280
Sorry, sorry.

133
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,280
This is Deng Yao.

134
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,280
This is an interview?

135
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,280
Yes, the kind of interview that looks at your face.

136
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,280
This is a good one.

137
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,280
Zhu Yu, my teacher is always leaving. Please help me take a look.

138
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,280
Your logic in this industry is wrong.

139
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,280
Right?

140
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,280
It seems that...

141
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,280
Look! Who ordered milk tea?

142
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,280
Mine, mine.

143
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,280
Thank you.

144
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,280
You're welcome.

145
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,280
Yixun, I ordered milk tea for you.

146
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,280
Remember to drink it.

147
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,280
Okay.

148
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,280
Hello, which one ordered the hamburger?

149
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
It's me.

150
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,280
Thank you. This is the hamburger I ordered for you.

151
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,280
You have to eat it while it's hot.

152
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,280
Hello, which one ordered the hot pot?

153
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
Here.

154
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,280
Here.

155
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,280
Your base is seriously affecting our interest group.

156
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,280
Who's affecting you?

157
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,280
This classroom is already our base.

158
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,280
You're angry with them?

159
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,280
Can you talk properly?

160
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,280
Don't be so nosy and change your mind.

161
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,280
The class representative.

162
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,280
Yes, talk properly.

163
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,280
Don't be angry.

164
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,280
Who's not talking properly?

165
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,280
Forget it. I didn't say anything.

166
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,280
Let's go.

167
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,280
Hello, everyone.

168
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,280
I want to share with you

169
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,280
an electric toothbrush that I've been using recently.

170
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,280
It has two colors.

171
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,280
One is white and the other is black.

172
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,280
If you want to make a new smile,

173
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,280
you have to take care of your lips like a nanny.

174
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,280
This electric toothbrush has 12 different...

175
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,280
When did this store grow?

176
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,280
I'm so annoyed.

177
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,280
You're back.

178
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,280
You bought a new toothbrush?

179
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,280
Yes.

180
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,280
I bought a new toothbrush.

181
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,280
I bought a new toothbrush.

182
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,280
You're back.

183
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,280
Your new electric toothbrush is here.

184
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,280
Open it and let's take a look.

185
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,280
Yu Yu.

186
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,280
Look.

187
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,280
Is this toothbrush very beautiful?

188
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,280
It's pretty.

189
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,280
Yu Yu, you don't know.

190
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,280
Our classroom is really unable to stay.

191
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,280
Those girls can do it one by one.

192
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,280
I saw Li Xun just suck his nose.

193
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,280
One girl immediately opened the escape room

194
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,280
to buy a heater.

195
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,280
The classroom is so messy now.

196
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,280
How can we do the project?

197
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,280
Those girls are not pure at first sight.

198
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,280
Li Xun doesn't care.

199
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,280
I'm so annoyed.

200
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,280
Then you can quit.

201
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,280
Yu Yu, you don't know how abnormal our school students are.

202
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,280
They work hard all year.

203
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,280
Each member can only get 20 points.

204
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,280
If I didn't want to be a good bodyguard in front of the base leader,

205
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,280
I wouldn't go.

206
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,280
I'm a timid person.

207
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,280
I'm a timid person.

208
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
I'm suddenly a little hungry.

209
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,280
How about we go to the barbecue and eat in the Northeast?

210
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,280
I'm not going.

211
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,280
I'm going to the fire.

212
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,280
Those girls in the base,

213
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,280
their skin is good and they need to be killed.

214
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,280
I'm too ashamed to eat.

215
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,280
Then you have to be a beauty to have some real skills.

216
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,280
You're right.

217
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,280
How about I eat some papaya?

218
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,280
I'll pay for the food.

219
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,280
You're a woman, aren't you?

220
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,280
You're a man who doesn't know the bad luck.

221
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,280
You have to be responsible for this.

222
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,280
The enemy is here.

223
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,280
The enemy is here too.

224
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,280
You're here.

225
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,280
I have something to show you.

226
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,280
Turn the chair.

227
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,280
Is there anyone here?

228
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,280
Yes.

229
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,280
Gao is sitting here.

230
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
Just take it directly.

231
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
Li Xun.

232
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,280
Are you a little too much?

233
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,280
What's so great about you that you look down on people so much?

234
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,280
Isn't it just a broken base?

235
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,280
Forget it.

236
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,280
You sit down.

237
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,280
Come on.

238
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,280
You'd better leave.

239
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,280
What did you say?

240
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,280
If you really think you can learn to make up

241
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,280
with a private language,

242
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,280
you'd better give up.

243
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,280
You're just good at the college entrance examination.

244
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,280
I'm not worse than you.

245
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,280
There are only five people left in the middle.

246
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,280
You don't have the right to look down on me.

247
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,280
In this life,

248
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,280
there won't be only a sixth-grader who can talk, right?

249
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,280
The college entrance examination is a water-diver.

250
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,280
From the moment it ends,

251
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,280
the things that people can do with just effort

252
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,280
are getting less and less.

253
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,280
If you're really smart,

254
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,280
just throw the textbook

255
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,280
and join my base.

256
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,280
I'll teach you later.

257
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,280
Do you dare to make a bet?

258
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,280
Next week is the mid-term exam.

259
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,280
We'll compete once.

260
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,280
If Gao's C language score is above yours,

261
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,280
your practice base will join our interest group.

262
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,280
You'll listen to us.

263
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,280
What if you lose?

264
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,280
Then we'll disband the interest group.

265
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,280
The classroom is yours.

266
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,280
Zhu Yue.

267
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,280
You're really over-the-top.

268
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,280
What age are you?

269
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,280
You're still competing for the score.

270
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:58,700
You can sesame

271
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,280
Just bet.

272
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,280
Okay.

273
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,280
What's the point of comparing the C language alone?

274
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,280
If we compare overall rank,

275
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,060
how would you feel

276
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,200
Then why is a surrey

277
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,040
find here

278
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,640
Ok

279
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,880
I will play with you

280
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,640
but that night

281
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,400
all of a sudden

282
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,240
a pair of

283
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,760
lonely girls

284
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:52,360
started to

285
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,160
talk reception!

286
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:00,840
and they

287
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,480
Yijing

288
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,360
Hello, Liao

289
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,600
I heard Zhu Yun and Li Xun are fighting

290
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,800
They are competing?

291
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,400
Why are you so gossipy?

292
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,000
The exam is coming

293
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,680
Duohua should study with us

294
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,400
She dares to compete with the college entrance examination

295
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,080
She is so brave

296
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,600
Do you think she is

297
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,400
hateful because she loves others?

298
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,400
It's normal for people like her to hate each other

299
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,240
She is a psychopath

300
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,960
She is so twisted

301
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,080
Zhu Yun

302
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,440
You are here

303
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,520
Have you finished?

304
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,200
Yes, I have

305
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,200
You don't need to ask for the interview next time

306
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,640
Just ask me

307
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,320
As far as I know, the psychopath

308
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,960
has seven or eight types

309
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,640
He hates and hates others

310
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,400
But he is so skeptical

311
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,120
You can talk

312
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:13,920
I have to go

313
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,480
Bye

314
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,280
Do you know what Li Xun is good at?

315
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,720
It seems to be

316
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,120
sports dance

317
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,520
What is it?

318
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,080
National dance

319
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,400
Our school's sports dance team

320
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,480
also participated in the national youth competition last year

321
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,760
They are a little weak

322
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,600
I think Li Xun

323
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,520
is just a mixed grade

324
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,280
He may not dance at all

325
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,520
Even if he is a master, a genius

326
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,600
I don't believe he can dance

327
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,200
And you can imagine

328
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,240
people like him

329
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,640
wear a baggy pants

330
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,880
and dance there

331
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,640
He can't be a man

332
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,680
I don't believe I can't beat him in sports

333
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,400
Come here, guys

334
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,320
I will announce the class experience

335
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,160
The final class is the mid-term exam

336
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,120
The final exam result

337
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,400
is 30% of the total

338
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,680
Everyone should pay attention

339
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,000
Yes

340
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,400
Enough, stop it

341
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,080
You have to take the exam

342
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,800
The video has been sent to all the class leaders

343
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,960
You should go back and practice more

344
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,160
I will hang up

345
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,880
Don't come to me and cry in the future

346
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,680
Wait and see my ultimate counterattack

347
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,440
I will go to the gym

348
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,440
I will go to the gym

349
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,440
I will go to the gym

350
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,440
I will go to the gym

351
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,440
I will go to the gym

352
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,440
I will go to the gym

353
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,440
I will go to the gym

354
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,440
I will go to the gym

355
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,440
I will go to the gym

356
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,440
I will go to the gym

357
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,440
I will go to the gym

358
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,440
I will go to the gym

359
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,440
I will go to the gym

360
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,440
I will go to the gym

361
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,440
I will go to the gym

362
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,440
I will go to the gym

363
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,440
I will go to the gym

364
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,440
I will go to the gym

365
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,440
I will go to the gym

366
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,440
I will go to the gym

367
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,440
I will go to the gym

368
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,440
I will go to the gym

369
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,440
I will go to the gym

370
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,440
I will go to the gym

371
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,440
I will go to the gym

372
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,440
I will go to the gym

373
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,440
I will go to the gym

374
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,120
I will go to the gym

375
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,160
Library closed time

376
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,160
The students stop for something

377
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,520
Go back to the dorms if you have time

378
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,000
Let's go

379
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,080
You go first

380
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
We should hurry up

381
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,400
Otherwise, there will be no hot water

382
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,960
Classmate, it's time to close the door

383
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,160
Pack up quickly

384
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,400
You go back first

385
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,200
What?

386
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,560
You want to go back to the dorms

387
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,480
and pick up the paper?

388
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,520
If the dorms are broken

389
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,680
I can't check the code

390
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,800
Write it tomorrow

391
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,040
No

392
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,720
I have been stuck with Lao Gao for several days

393
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,120
I will go to the new group later

394
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,400
I must write it tonight

395
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,120
I will go out

396
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,080
I have an event tomorrow

397
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,040
I have to be the examiner

398
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,240
I won't open it tonight

399
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,160
If the teacher finds out today

400
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,280
I will call you

401
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,240
Where are you going?

402
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,760
You installed the door lock

403
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,920
You think I am free to try it?

404
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,480
Come if you want

405
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,000
I won't even say hello to you

406
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,080
Today is a special occasion

407
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,040
I can't use it in other places

408
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,800
I will use it for the time being

409
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,040
Besides

410
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,680
Who said this rooftop is yours?

411
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,600
The base is specially made by teacher Lin

412
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,360
Is it also specially made here?

413
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,560
I have to go to the dorms

414
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,520
I have to go to the dorms

415
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,520
I have to go to the dorms

416
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,640
The support of you here is very important

417
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:56,920
Close the door

418
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,800
Otherwise I will just expect your welcome

419
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,420
Before you are officially mines

420
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,680
You should think about it

421
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,640
I told supplier to go away

422
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,640
The vent of conscience

423
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,160
doesn't need that handsh kä

424
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,880
I didn't compete with them

425
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,920
I only tried to give myself a good reason

426
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,480
You must know

427
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,960
because I can't remember it.

428
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,040
You can't see the real account until the end.

429
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,960
Besides, the competition is just a form.

430
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,560
You learn everything for yourself.

431
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,480
You're thinking of me again.

432
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,640
You're building your mind, aren't you?

433
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,160
I'm teaching you

434
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,440
so that you won't lose to me

435
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,000
in the name of fame.

436
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,520
You can't figure it out.

437
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,920
What's the signal of your computer?

438
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,160
It starts up pretty fast.

439
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,400
designs

440
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,840
Great aunt, why are you looking at the bike agro?

441
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,640
To gather him.

442
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,480
I just did the border test.

443
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,480
Try all the tests.

444
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,480
You should be able to get it.

445
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,480
I'm going to sleep again.

446
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,480
Logic.

447
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,480
What logic?

448
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,480
You like short codes.

449
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,480
Sometimes,

450
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,480
it's not about pursuing simplicity.

451
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,480
It will affect logic.

452
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,480
Check again.

453
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,480
It's working.

454
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,480
How do you know that I like short codes?

455
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,480
Because you're boring.

456
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,480
I'm just writing short codes.

457
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,480
I'm just writing short codes.

458
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,480
I'm just writing short codes.

459
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,480
Because you're boring.

460
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,480
You're not even smart.

461
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,480
You treat textbooks as books.

462
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,480
New Verses

463
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,480
Liu nahong

464
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,480
High-CD

465
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:28,480
Ergen

466
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,920
Hi, Nanhu University five in the morning!

467
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,520
You are such a miser.

468
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,840
Don't say that or I'll just zawstid briefing fired.

469
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,880
I don't care.

470
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,120
In any case, I feel happiness

471
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,120
I'm happy

472
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,240
Bye

473
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,120
You are leaving?

474
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,120
Lock the door

475
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,520
Really?

476
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,640
I can come here by myself in the future

477
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,120
I can come here by myself in the future

478
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,880
He won't run away from the truth, right?

479
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,280
Come

480
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,760
Come

481
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,280
braid

482
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,380
No

483
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,760
The self-selection meantime

484
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,640
..is in my brain

485
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,480
I can answer it directly

486
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,480
Let him have a look.

487
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,480
Draw a heart with the program.

488
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,480
This is too simple.

489
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,480
It's too boring.

490
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,480
You can start.

491
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,480
Draw a heart with the program.

492
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,480
This is too boring.

493
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,480
You can start.

494
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,480
Draw a heart with the program.

495
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,480
This is too boring.

496
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,480
You can start.

497
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,480
Draw a heart with the program.

498
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,480
This is too boring.

499
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,480
You can start.

500
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,480
Draw a heart with the program.

501
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,480
This is too boring.

502
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,480
You can start.

503
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,480
Draw a heart with the program.

504
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,480
This is too boring.

505
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,480
Draw some patterns with colour pencils.

506
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,480
Volos can provide better result.

507
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,480
It's cool, right?

508
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,480
I've done this before.

509
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,480
I'll paint some patterns.

510
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,480
planner

511
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,480
It's so long.

512
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,480
Theently

513
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,480
Ş engagement

514
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,000
Miss.

515
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,360
Yes.

516
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,640
King.

517
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,680
Yang manyang is right.

518
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,480
So what if

519
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:31,600
Yang manyang

520
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,600
Give it back to me.

521
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,600
Okay. You don't have a hundred books.

522
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,600
You'll compare it with me next time, right?

523
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
Let me say this.

524
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
This class is a one-off.

525
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,600
This is your first time in the programming class.

526
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,600
You can communicate with each other.

527
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,600
Look at other people's thoughts.

528
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,600
If there are things you don't understand, you can ask me.

529
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,600
But I want to remind you to be quiet.

530
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
Don't say things that you can communicate.

531
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,600
The class will become a mess.

532
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,600
God, please help me look at you.

533
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,600
You're really a little piece of my mind.

534
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,600
My idea is like this.

535
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,600
You're a master.

536
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,600
No.

537
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,600
Then why did you learn like you didn't learn?

538
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Look at yours.

539
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,600
Mine? You probably can't see it.

540
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,600
Look at the class representative.

541
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,600
Wow, so precise.

542
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,600
I asked for two books.

543
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,600
You can use Korean.

544
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,600
I didn't turn my head just now.

545
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,600
I've been to the class. Thank you.

546
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,600
It's normal. I'm like this sometimes.

547
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,600
You'll know when you're familiar.

548
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,600
You're a little piece of my mind again.

549
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,600
Your ears are pretty good.

550
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,600
Show me yours.

551
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,600
Don't look at it too hard.

552
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,600
You're going to break your mouth.

553
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,600
You're too good.

554
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,600
Thank you, teacher.

555
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,600
Goodbye.

556
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,600
I didn't drink a glass.

557
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,600
I'm sorry.

558
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,600
I'm sorry.

559
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
I'm sorry.

560
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,600
I'm sorry.

561
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,600
I didn't drink a glass.

562
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,600
Did you solve it?

563
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,600
I'm sorry.

564
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,600
It's like this.

565
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,600
I'm done.

566
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,600
I seem to have been hit by Jiang Wei.

567
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,600
Actually, he was afraid of stimulating you.

568
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,600
So I didn't say it.

569
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,600
I think Li Xun is still at the base every day.

570
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,600
But he didn't review it at all.

571
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,600
It's all written in the bag.

572
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,600
People are better than animals.

573
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,600
I think you should be careful.

574
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,600
People are better than people.

575
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,600
It's so annoying.

576
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,600
The college entrance exam is 100 points.

577
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,600
It's because there are only 100 points in the test paper.

578
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,600
This is the difference between you and the college entrance exam.

579
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,600
No, the difference between students.

580
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,600
Zhu Yu.

581
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,600
Let's disband the interest group.

582
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,600
But...

583
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,600
Your virus was actually solved by Li Xun.

584
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,600
Wu Meng Xin came to me one day.

585
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,600
I wrote it like a virus.

586
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,600
I just reflected where to start.

587
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,600
Li Xun must have asked Wu Meng Xin to come here.

588
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,600
He must have asked Wu Meng Xin to come here.

589
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,600
Otherwise, I would have been so confused.

590
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,600
I can't even touch the door.

591
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,600
Li Xun must know that we can't solve it.

592
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,600
So he asked someone to provide clues.

593
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,600
I was really hit by Jiang Wei.

594
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,600
He wants to stimulate you.

595
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,600
He wants to stimulate you.

596
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,600
He wants to destroy you.

597
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,600
It has nothing to do with you.

598
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,600
How can you say that?

599
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,600
The cold God.

600
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,600
He has a little bit of the scent of love.

601
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,600
Don't be so sad.

602
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
We didn't lose this time.

603
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,600
This is called...

604
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,600
This is not called acquisition.

605
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,600
This is called purchase.

606
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,600
Let's have a drink.

607
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,600
To celebrate our interest group.

608
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,600
Dismiss officially.

609
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,600
It's ten years later.

610
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,600
You should be proud of yourself.

611
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,600
You should be proud of your future.

612
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,600
Come on.

613
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,600
I don't know how to drink.

614
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,600
Chu Yu.

615
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,600
When can you drink the drink of an adult?

616
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,600
Fang Shou Miao, you are a traitor.

617
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,600
You are so embarrassed to say that I am a traitor.

618
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,600
You are from the base.

619
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,600
Who is the first traitor?

620
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,600
Right.

621
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,600
We will be a group of people.

622
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,600
You are so worthy.

623
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,600
You two come to the base.

624
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,600
If you want to make yourself better.

625
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,600
You should be with someone better than you.

626
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,600
I will join.

627
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,600
I haven't decided yet.

628
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,600
Where are you going?

629
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,600
I envy you.

630
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,600
You know what you want.

631
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,600
Miao Miao wants to be a nurse.

632
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,600
Gao wants to go abroad.

633
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,600
But I...

634
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,600
My mom made the decision.

635
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,600
This profession.

636
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,600
But the representative.

637
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,600
I have thought about it.

638
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,600
Should I change my profession?

639
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,600
You made a bet with Li Xiong.

640
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,600
You have a lot of fight.

641
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,600
It's called fighting with people.

642
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,600
But I still don't know

643
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,600
whether I like it or not.

644
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,600
You are a tacit understanding.

645
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,600
You are like a bulldog who has fought with a chicken blood.

646
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,600
You are like a bulldog who has fought with a chicken blood.

647
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,600
You are like a bulldog who has fought with a chicken blood.

648
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,600
Why do you think so much?

649
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,600
Right, we haven't finished our sports.

650
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,600
What?

651
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,600
You want to win or lose?

652
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,600
I will lose.

653
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,600
But I want to let him know that we are not losing in the exam.

654
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,600
You are forcing yourself.

655
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,600
I am just in case.

656
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,600
He is so good.

657
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,600
What if he changes the system of school?

658
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,600
It makes sense.

659
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,600
Right.

660
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,600
I didn't expect it.

661
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
I can change it.

662
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,600
You are an excellent class leader.

663
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,600
You are an excellent class leader.

664
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,600
Okay, next group.

665
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,600
Be polite.

666
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,600
I was right.

667
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,600
He won't come.

668
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,600
I was right. He won't come.

669
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,600
Anyone else didn't pass the exam?

670
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,600
Li Xun.

671
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,600
Li Xun from computer class.

672
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,600
Li Xun from computer class.

673
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,600
Are you here?

674
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,600
Okay, class is over.

675
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,600
Teacher.

676
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,600
Li Xun, right?

677
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,600
Yes.

678
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,600
You know you are here for the exam.

679
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,600
You didn't pass the exam.

680
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,600
You can retake it tomorrow.

681
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,600
Teacher.

682
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,600
No more medical expenses.

683
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,600
Teacher.

684
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,600
I hurt my spine.

685
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,600
Okay, go back.

686
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,600
You can pass the exam?

687
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,600
You are so worried.

688
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,600
You still want to come to the exam?

689
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,600
I am afraid you will run away.

690
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,600
You are afraid of seeing me fail the exam?

691
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,600
Where did you get the medical expenses?

692
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,600
You use this to deal with me.

693
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,600
Which eye do you see me?

694
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,600
I didn't hear that you are not good at the math.

695
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,600
I didn't hear that you are not good at the math.

696
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,600
You don't know too much.

697
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,600
You are really sick.

698
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,600
What do you mean?

699
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,600
You are sick.

700
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,600
What?

701
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,600
I have discussed with Gao about the competition.

702
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,600
I have discussed with Gao about the competition.

703
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,600
The new team is disbanded.

704
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,600
You will be the new team.

705
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,600
Why?

706
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,600
No reason.

707
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,600
I am not interested.

708
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,600
You finally know yourself.

709
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,600
That's not necessary.

710
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,600
You didn't win the score of the competition.

711
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,600
We are the only ones who can win.

712
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,600
We just choose the game.

713
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,600
One point.

714
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,600
And one point.

715
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,600
Two.

716
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,600
Three.

717
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,600
Four.

718
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,600
Five.

719
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,600
Six.

720
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,600
Seven.

721
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,600
Eight.

722
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
I'm here.

723
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,200
Li Xun.

724
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,600
Behave yourself.

725
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,600
I gave you this place.

726
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,800
This time, we won't lose.

727
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,320
We'll thank you.

728
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,600
Anything else?

729
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,600
Can I join the base?

730
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,600
Pretend I didn't say anything.

731
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,600
You used the 2-point method to find the algorithm, right?

732
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,600
Have you seen the program I wrote?

733
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,600
To be honest,

734
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,600
it's hard to find someone with a strong ability to work at this base.

735
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,600
Go back and finish your work tonight.

736
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,600
Thank you.

737
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,600
Zhang Fei, was it real?

738
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,400
Bye-bye,

739
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,600
Chiefiskheits recorder.

740
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,360
Come!

741
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,160
Yuan Di.

742
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:02,920
Shopping.

743
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,200
It's rare to see you so free.

744
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,080
It's weekend.

745
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,040
I don't have to go to the base.

746
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,160
I'm free.

747
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,040
You also shop?

748
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,000
Together?

749
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,480
I'm waiting for someone.

750
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,840
Come on.

751
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,800
Stop.

752
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,680
Let me announce.

753
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,440
This is the princess I invited.

754
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,960
You're so annoying.
