YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if the light is very bright

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will still watch over that vast vast land

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless atmosphere

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day, the lens is a little bit yellow

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast night?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I burn up the night just for you to remember

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How everything was in the beginning

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The wind and the color of the night are like wild grass

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The mountains are broken, but you are still by my side

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Everything is the original look

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The King of Blaze

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Episode 1

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Come on

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Nana

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I have something to discuss with you

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What is it?

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Now only you can help me

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What to do?

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What happened?

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The flood in the Black Sea has broken thousands of millions

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Now several large investment institutions

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
have begun to contact them

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And now it's just the beginning

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Breaking thousands of millions

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It doesn't seem to be a big deal

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's nothing now

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But the market trend is very dangerous

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Once they have money

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We have no products to fight them

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You also saw

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I can't get into the network of flying sheep

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What do you want me to do?

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Bring the code of the game of Love Monghe

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
here

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
How?

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You can still get close to Li Xun now, right?

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What you did today

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Is it for me to get the code?

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Nana, we are tied together now

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm not for me alone

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I can't let him go anymore

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You know Li Xun's means

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
As long as he has a little chance to kill L.P.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
He won't let me go

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
As long as he doesn't let me go

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We have nothing

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Nana

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Disgusting

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You hate him, right?

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You want to see him fail

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You want to see him beg me, right?

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You hurt me, let me go

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Or you can't laugh

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I didn't

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You have been thinking about Li Xun

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What a good opportunity

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll send you there

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'll send you there

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Are you crazy, Gao Jianhong?

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Do you know what you are talking about?

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Don't pretend to me here

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You can't wait

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Can't wait to play the piano with him

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Want to be ambiguous with him

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You have been thinking about Wu Ming

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
In your heart

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Many times

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
How could I marry you?

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Regret

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Of course

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You never loved me

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What you love is my money

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
If not

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I would have cleaned up those messes for your dad

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
How could you marry me?

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I marry you

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Because I thought you were

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Gao Jianhong from six years ago

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The one who talked about the Lan Guan app with me

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Talk about the person who will shine in the future

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I tell you

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I Xu Yida

92
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Never seen a woman

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Love the most

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You asked me to do this

95
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I can't do it

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Don't force me

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I force you

98
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Li Xun is forcing me

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You are forcing me

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Let's divorce

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Ok?

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What did you say?

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Divorce

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Gao Jianhong

105
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You have lost

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,900
Li Tesha

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,520
You

108
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,360
I

109
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,720
Sister

110
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I agree to divorce you.

111
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,320
Do as I said.

112
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,560
I'll give you freedom.

113
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,960
Why do you want to see me?

114
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,880
Come in.

115
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,040
Sit down.

116
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,640
What do you want to drink?

117
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,560
No, thanks.

118
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,080
Coffee then.

119
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,920
Just tell me.

120
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,280
Oops.

121
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,280
The OPS is going public.

122
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,640
You know, right?

123
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,600
So what?

124
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,360
So,

125
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,400
you can't beat Li tagging?

126
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,680
Do you want to persuade us to give up?

127
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:03,960
No,

128
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,800
it's for cooperation.

129
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,840
It's strange to say that.

130
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,400
Xu Mingna suddenly came to me this morning.

131
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,800
She said we should give up the fight

132
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,240
and start a love alliance with Gao Jinghong.

133
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,440
How can it be a joint venture?

134
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,760
Gao Jinghong won't cooperate with us even if he dies.

135
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,040
I think there's something wrong with this.

136
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,600
I also think it's not normal.

137
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,240
But it's not right to say it.

138
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,480
Okay, let's leave her alone.

139
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,160
Let's go back to the company. There's good news.

140
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,360
What good news?

141
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,240
You'll know when you're back.

142
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,160
Congratulations to your company's online game,

143
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,320
The Five Generals,

144
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,680
for winning the Government Award for Network Industry Development.

145
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,720
You're invited to the award ceremony

146
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,680
for Network Industry Development.

147
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,920
It's also called

148
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,920
Information Industry Network Industry Development Association.

149
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,720
So it's still a government award.

150
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,720
How can a government have an association?

151
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,000
It sounds like a kind of fee.

152
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,120
But it's not paid.

153
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,080
Wait a minute. Look.

154
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,480
There's really an award.

155
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,200
Network Industry Development Association

156
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,920
is a government award for Network Industry Development

157
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,280
for the new award in 2019.

158
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,720
It's used to encourage network technology innovation.

159
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,440
It's an official website.

160
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,560
How can you believe big data?

161
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,000
It's true.

162
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,240
This award is the first one today.

163
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,520
There are three awards in total.

164
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,040
We're one of them.

165
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,080
It's also the only mobile game.

166
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,720
That's great.

167
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,520
I still don't believe it.

168
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,160
Professor Zhao recommended it.

169
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,680
No.

170
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,400
I don't believe it.

171
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,760
Look.

172
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,920
This year,

173
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,240
you two made a game together.

174
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,520
But your game is a success.

175
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,920
Your game won the award.

176
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,480
It's a win-win situation.

177
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,200
So I can point at you two

178
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,520
and I can be at ease.

179
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,480
Yes.

180
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,720
I'm flattered.

181
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,600
Don't float.

182
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,000
Did you find the person I asked you to find?

183
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,720
You really forgot about it.

184
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,240
I'll give you a sign.

185
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,720
Look.

186
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,040
There are many guests for this dinner.

187
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,640
My surname is Fei Yang.

188
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,200
My uncle's surname is Yu.

189
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,280
My name is You.

190
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,120
L.P.

191
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,320
Pu Gongying.

192
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,920
There are so many guests.

193
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,440
Are we going?

194
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,800
Yes.

195
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,160
Not only that,

196
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,880
we have to go there in a grand way.

197
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,040
Where are they?

198
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,040
They left for the ceremony.

199
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,280
Oh my god.

200
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:11,840
It's so late.

201
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,520
Why didn't you remind me?

202
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,040
Let's go.

203
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,600
Are you going in that?

204
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,160
What's the problem?

205
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,320
As the only female employee of Fei Yang,

206
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,880
you should be more serious.

207
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,320
I've been updating the news all day.

208
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,640
And it's too late to go back now.

209
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,680
What's this?

210
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,280
What's beautiful?

211
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,640
Shaking

212
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,280
What is this?

213
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,000
It's so hot

214
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,280
to see I'mBut your constant burn.

215
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,760
Are you not tired?

216
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,960
Why don't you make honorifics?

217
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,340
Thank you.

218
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,840
You're welcome.

219
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,240
It's hot.

220
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,240
I'm not a good driver.

221
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,240
I've never seen anyone.

222
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,240
No, I'm a little nervous.

223
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,240
I...

224
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
Where are my glasses?

225
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,240
Why are you all black?

226
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,240
Why is there no one taking pictures of us?

227
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,240
I'll take pictures for you.

228
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,240
Your phone.

229
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,240
I'll come.

230
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,240
Come on.

231
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,240
Let's take a picture.

232
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,240
Brother Fang, squat down.

233
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,240
I'm tired.

234
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,240
Who is this?

235
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,240
There is.

236
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,240
Oh my god.

237
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,240
Is this Zhong Zhewei?

238
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,240
I thought it was a model.

239
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,240
Let's go.

240
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,240
Let's go in.

241
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,240
Let's go.

242
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
Oh my god.

243
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,240
Why is the seat still open?

244
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,240
What are the faces of the two of us?

245
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,240
The bodyguard.

246
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,240
Okay, stand up.

247
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,240
Smile.

248
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,240
Let's go.

249
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,240
Let's go.

250
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,240
I'm nervous.

251
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,240
You're nervous.

252
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,240
He's nervous.

253
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,240
The leader is here.

254
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,240
Okay, let's welcome the leaders and guests on stage to share their thoughts.

255
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,240
Don't embarrass me.

256
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
I'm not a good driver.

257
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,240
Okay, let's welcome the two of you.

258
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,240
Let's welcome the two of you.

259
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,240
Let's welcome the two of you.

260
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,240
Okay, thank you.

261
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,240
Please take a seat.

262
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,240
Thank you.

263
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,240
The leaders are sitting.

264
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,240
The leaders are sitting.

265
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,240
Okay.

266
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,240
Thank you.

267
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,240
Come on.

268
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,240
Let's go.

269
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,240
Okay.

270
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,240
Let's go.

271
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,240
Thank you,?the committee, for giving us this award.

272
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,240
This honor belongs to every employee of our Feiyang network.

273
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,240
Good.

274
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,240
This honor belongs to every employee of our Feiyang network.

275
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,240
Good.

276
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:09,240
I believe this is just the beginning of our Feiyang network.

277
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,240
Mr. Lv Xu, is there anyone you want to thank today?

278
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,240
I want to thank someone.

279
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,240
I really do have someone to thank.

280
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,240
He is the president of L.P. company, Gao Jianhong.

281
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,240
Mr. Gao.

282
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:44,240
I once decided to join the Feiyang network at the internet conference.

283
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,240
It was Mr. Gao who gave me this award.

284
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,240
I didn't expect that the award is still here.

285
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,240
It's really fate.

286
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,240
I have to thank you for your hard work.

287
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,240
I won the award.

288
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,240
Today, I want to ask Mr. Gao,

289
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,240
is the 7-core version of your company still good?

290
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,240
People say that the things that are copied are not as good as the life force.

291
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,240
China's Internet has made so much money.

292
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,240
But the content of the technology is not as good as the life force.

293
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,240
People don't want the Chinese Internet companies to be like today,

294
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,240
which can only rely on entertainment, service, and cheap goods.

295
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,240
Mr. Lv Xu, since last year,

296
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,240
you have been the financing director of the Internet.

297
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,240
Recently, the Feiyang network has become the target of investors' pursuit.

298
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,240
But I heard that you have rejected it.

299
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,240
Why?

300
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,240
They are all here to invest in games.

301
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,240
Isn't Feiyang a game company?

302
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,240
It is now, but it is not just that.

303
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,240
May I ask what the direction of the development of Feiyang is?

304
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,240
We will discuss it later.

305
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,240
I hope to increase the survival rate of cancer by one percent.

306
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,240
I hope to increase the survival rate of cancer by one percent.

307
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,240
The path we choose is not easy.

308
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,240
I'm afraid many small investors can't afford it.

309
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,240
So we choose the standard of investors is to choose to be lazy.

310
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,240
If you believe in yourself,

311
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,240
you will always believe in yourself.

312
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,240
I believe that in this industry,

313
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,240
there are people who provide convenience,

314
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,240
there are people who provide entertainment consumption,

315
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,240
but there are also people who are responsible for changing the times.

316
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,240
Thank you.

317
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,240
I'm sorry.

318
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:20,240
The reason why I play this game is because I have a group of capable people.

319
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,240
These new people...

320
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,240
I don't know them.

321
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,240
I feel like I haven't eaten in eight lifetimes.

322
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,240
You don't drink?

323
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,240
Where is Li Xun?

324
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,240
I didn't see him.

325
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,240
What is he doing?

326
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,240
I don't know either.

327
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,240
I'll take you to a place.

328
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,240
Let's go.

329
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,240
You have played with me in Love Bus.

330
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,240
Not bad.

331
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,240
Really?

332
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,240
Our game's average users are lonely and poor people.

333
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,240
You have a unique taste.

334
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,240
You just fired him.

335
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,240
Do you have something to say to me?

336
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,240
You have something to say to me.

337
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,240
Actually, I only found out about Gao's cooperation with Fang Zhijing later.

338
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,240
Gao never let me interfere with the operations of LOP.

339
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,240
But to be honest,

340
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,240
Gao has been doing well in the past years.

341
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,240
He has been holding his breath.

342
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,240
He wants to prove himself in front of you.

343
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:28,240
But I think LOP will still be yours in the end.

344
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,240
Why?

345
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,240
Because he only wants to make money.

346
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,240
He only wants to prove to you that he has no dreams.

347
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,240
So he has been more and more anxious these years.

348
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,240
He is more and more stubborn.

349
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,240
I remember when I first met him, he was not like this.

350
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,240
All of us have changed because of you.

351
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,240
Only you haven't changed.

352
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,240
I was a little confused when you were on stage.

353
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:28,240
I thought time has not passed.

354
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,240
Are you jealous?

355
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,240
Yes.

356
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,240
I tell you,

357
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,240
there will be more and more women around Li Xun in the future.

358
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,240
You will regret it.

359
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,240
Don't come to our plan.

360
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,240
What plan?

361
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,240
What plan?

362
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,240
Nothing.

363
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,240
Say it.

364
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,240
The original code, Li Xun wants to give it to him,

365
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,240
but he can't give it directly.

366
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,240
So we have to plan it.

367
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,240
What are you two talking about?

368
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,240
We are talking about the past.

369
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,240
It's hard to forget.

370
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,240
It's good if you don't forget.

371
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,240
Remember to bring the original code back.

372
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,240
Don't worry.

373
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,240
I can't forget.

374
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,160
I will take you to the

375
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,240
hearing.

376
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,240
Don't tell Li Xun.

377
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,240
What?

378
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,240
Only Li Xun and I know the code.

379
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,240
Why didn't you tell me?

380
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,240
You really don't know or pretend you don't know?

381
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,240
I don't understand.

382
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,240
You are not with Li Xun.

383
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,240
Why does he think about your feelings

384
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,240
when he does anything?

385
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,240
After that, you don't know anything.

386
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,240
He is not free.

387
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,240
When Li Xun and Xu Ningna meet,

388
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,240
you have to tell me.

389
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,240
Are you afraid?

390
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,240
Why should I be afraid?

391
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,240
You want to be pushed down again, right?

392
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,240
You think I didn't say anything?

393
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,240
Gao Dong, long time no see.

394
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,240
Long time no see.

395
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,240
Gao Dong, congratulations.

396
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,240
Miss Rong is so beautiful.

397
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,240
Hello.

398
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,240
You are back.

399
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,240
I came to see you.

400
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,240
I'm back.

401
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,240
I'm here.

402
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,240
I'm back.

403
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,240
Do you know it was Gao Jian

404
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,240
who asked Xu Ningna to come here?

405
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,240
Yes.

406
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,240
You also know

407
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,240
he came to steal the original code.

408
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,240
I told you

409
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,240
I would force him to do it.

410
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,240
Xu Ningna came to see me today.

411
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,240
It means she has no way out.

412
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,240
I'm back.

413
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,240
I'm back.

414
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,240
I'm back.

415
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,240
Director Zhou, you haven't come off work yet?

416
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,240
Why are you here?

417
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,240
Aren't you watching the L.P. in the room?

418
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,440
Li Xun went home.

419
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,760
Then why are you here?

420
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,720
Then why am I here?

421
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,120
Then I'm going home.

422
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,320
Why are you wrapping this pillow?

423
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,160
What?

424
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,760
You want to sleep in the storeroom

425
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,320
and make Li Xun feel at home, right?

426
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,840
He's with Xu Li Na.

427
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,840
I'm going to sleep.

428
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,520
When you were on stage that day,

429
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,520
and you were thinking,

430
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,680
for a moment,

431
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,520
I thought I was back to the year

432
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,880
of the Information Security Competition.

433
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,840
I remember the judges asked you

434
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,320
why.

435
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,600
You said...

436
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,440
because of love.

437
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,720
It's all in the past.

438
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
Yes.

439
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,280
It's all in the past.

440
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,880
I'll take you home.

441
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,320
I...

442
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,840
I don't want to go home.

443
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,680
Waiter.

444
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,440
I'm sorry.

445
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,520
I'm sorry.

446
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,000
Let's play a game.

447
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,040
What game?

448
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,240
Let's play...

449
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,280
a lie game.

450
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,720
We ask each other questions,

451
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,680
but when we answer,

452
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,680
we have to lie.

453
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,480
How about it?

454
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,400
You go first.

455
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,880
I have nothing to ask.

456
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,400
Then I'll ask myself.

457
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,080
The first question.

458
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,800
Why did I marry Gao Jianhong?

459
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,160
Of course,

460
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,640
because of love.

461
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
The second question.

462
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,000
Have I been happy

463
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
all these years?

464
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,520
Of course, I am.

465
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,800
I have a bag in my room,

466
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,800
hundreds of beautiful high heels,

467
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,800
and Gao gave me

468
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,200
a big diamond necklace.

469
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,280
My dream ring

470
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,400
is even more beautiful than your room.

471
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,000
No, it's bigger than your house.

472
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,520
Of course, I'm happy.

473
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,440
The third question.

474
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,280
If the person I loved

475
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,800
appeared again,

476
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,800
what would I do?

477
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,800
I would tell him

478
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,600
how happy I am.

479
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,400
I would tell him

480
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,520
that his appearance

481
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,000
didn't affect me at all.

482
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,920
I would tell him

483
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,520
that my appearance

484
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,120
didn't affect me at all.

485
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,920
I would still have a good life.

486
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,120
I would still have a good life.

487
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,720
I'm sorry. I just drank too much.

488
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,120
I'll leave now.

489
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,320
Do you know if you give this to Gao Jianhong,

490
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,520
you will be chased away by the curtain in the future?

491
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,320
I'm sorry.

492
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,120
I'm sorry.

493
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,120
I'm sorry.

494
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,120
I'm sorry.

495
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,120
I'm sorry.

496
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,520
I'm sorry.

497
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,520
I'm sorry.

498
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,520
I'm sorry.

499
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,920
I'm sorry.

500
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,920
You knew what I was here for, right?

501
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,320
Of course you knew.

502
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,520
Since you knew my purpose,

503
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,920
the source code in it

504
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,920
is the set you gave Gao Jianhong, right?

505
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,920
I'm sorry.

506
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,520
I should give it to Gao Jianhong.

507
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,120
You can leave like this.

508
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,320
You don't need to help me.

509
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,120
This time, I'm not helping you.

510
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,520
I'm helping myself.

511
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,920
I'm helping myself.

512
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,920
When you planned all this,

513
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,920
did you think about me?

514
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,920
Xilin.

515
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,120
I've always owed you an apology.

516
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,520
I'm sorry.

517
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,920
I'm sorry.

518
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,320
You don't owe me anything.

519
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,920
Everything I do is honest.

520
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,320
I envy you and Zhuyun.

521
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,520
You haven't changed.

522
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,120
These years,

523
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,120
many things have changed.

524
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,320
I also want to leave something that hasn't changed.

525
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,120
I'll go now.

526
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,120
Bye.

527
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,120
See you.

528
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,120
Bye.

529
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,120
Where are you?

530
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,120
I'm at home.

531
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,120
Hello?

532
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,120
Where are you?

533
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,120
I'm at home.

534
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,120
Hello?

535
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,120
Hello?

536
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,120
Hello?

537
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,120
I'm at home.

538
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,120
Isn't that Zhuo Zhenwei?

539
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,120
You're at home.

540
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,120
What are you doing here?

541
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,120
I'm here to check on Zhuo Zhenwei.

542
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,120
Aren't you at home?

543
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,120
Are you here for checking on Zhuo Zhenwei?

544
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,120
You gave him the yuan bar?

545
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,080
Wait for us minutes.

546
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,200
Don't worry.

547
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,640
Iеты', he'd better not do such an elegant shit.

548
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,640
He has his own number of things to consider as well.

549
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,360
So, what should we do next?

550
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,440
Prepare yourself

551
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,280
to go to court.

552
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:19,760
I've done

553
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,060
what I told you to do.

554
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,120
I'll go back to work.

555
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,000
I've signed the divorce agreement.

556
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,720
You don't even look at the content in the USB drive?

557
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,720
I believe you.

558
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,120
You can say yes.

559
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,320
But you don't believe me.

560
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,920
Is that so simple?

561
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,120
That's it.

562
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,520
The money in the bank is always in your account.

563
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,920
Take it as my compensation.

564
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,920
You can sell the shares in the company to me after the company is listed.

565
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,720
You'll have money to pay your dad's debt.

566
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,120
You don't have to be dragged into doing things you don't want to do.

567
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,720
And this house, Jiangbei's apartment,

568
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,720
it's all your name.

569
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,120
I'll move out as soon as possible.

570
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,920
You don't have to do that.

571
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,720
These are all yours.

572
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,920
I've never wanted them.

573
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,120
You've never wanted them?

574
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,920
You've never stolen Yuan Dai's?

575
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,720
Li Xun gave it to you.

576
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,520
I stole it from your bag.

577
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,320
If Li Xun wants to get you in,

578
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,320
I'll say I forced you and threatened you to do that.

579
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,120
But to ensure everything is fine,

580
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,520
I'll send you abroad as soon as possible.

581
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,320
You're not allowed to leave.

582
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,720
You can't leave.

583
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,720
I'll leave.

584
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,720
Hello?

585
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,320
I'm the one who has to leave.

586
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,720
But what are you going to do next?

587
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,120
If you're found out,

588
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,720
will you go to jail?

589
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,520
I'll go to jail.

590
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,720
Thank you.

591
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,320
I should have given you freedom long ago.

592
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,120
But I'm not content.

593
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,920
It's quite ironic.

594
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,720
Li Xun is in jail.

595
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,920
We got married.

596
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,720
Li Xun is out of jail.

597
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,720
We got married.

598
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,920
Nana.

599
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,120
I thought I could give you happiness.

600
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,920
I'm sorry.

601
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,920
Here.

602
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,120
It seems that you've developed a lot these past few months.

603
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,920
When the nerve fluid is in the first stage,

604
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,720
it can be cut through surgery.

605
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,320
The recovery is not bad.

606
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,320
When it's more than the second stage, it's increasingly growing.

607
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,120
It's hard to have another surgery opportunity.

608
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,320
The effect of the relapse is also limited.

609
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,720
You're growing here.

610
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,720
You've already crushed your blood vessels.

611
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,120
Have you recently had a headache

612
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,120
or a numbness?

613
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,320
Yes.

614
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,120
Then you can't delay it any longer.

615
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,720
You have to get the surgery done as soon as possible.

616
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,520
The hospital, the check-up, the recovery of the surgery,

617
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,320
how long does it take?

618
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,720
Moreover, the risk of the surgery is also high.

619
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,720
Mr. Gao, you know this.

620
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,320
Surgery is not without risks.

621
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,720
We've talked about it before.

622
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,120
You're now taking a marriage with your wife.

623
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,320
You have to be smart not to have the surgery.

624
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,720
I don't want any risks.

625
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,120
Mr. Gao.

626
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:11,920
I don't know.

627
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,720
I don't know what to do.

628
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,320
I've said before

629
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,920
that I have things to do with Zhou You.

630
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,520
Is this a base?

631
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,880
It's really hard to find a capable person

632
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,560
to build this base.

633
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,720
I've never heard of you

634
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,960
since the beginning of this project.

635
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,600
You've suffered a lot.

636
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,440
You didn't build this app alone.

637
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,440
I've worked hard on it for a long time.

638
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,360
Is it hard for me

639
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,760
to say something to respect me?

640
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,000
If I tell you

641
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,840
that I treat Li Xun

642
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,720
the same way as you treat me,

643
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,520
I won't give up either.

644
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,520
Will you still wait for me?

645
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,160
I once

646
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,520
gave up everything.

647
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,120
I just want to get away from you as far as possible.

648
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,040
But you didn't even give me

649
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,240
such a chance.

650
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,840
But I don't owe him.

651
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,120
But you owe me!

652
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,520
Let go of me!

653
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,760
Li Xun,

654
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,800
do you really think no one can defeat you?

655
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,520
She asked you to come.

656
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,120
It means she's already shaken.

657
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,120
But I don't need it.

658
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,640
Since I dare to do this,

659
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,120
I'll find a way to deal with her.

660
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,800
Do you understand?

661
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,120
Li Xun!

662
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,520
The night

663
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,520
The night of the first rain

664
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,520
The night

665
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:24,520
Then won the world for me

666
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:31,520
The car always stops

667
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,520
I also lean on your shoulder

668
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,520
We

669
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,520
Won't be separated

670
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,520
Get away from the noisy world

671
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,520
Accompany me

672
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,520
Is your new point of view

673
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,520
Raise me up bravely

674
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,520
Like the flame of night

675
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,520
Because I believe I love you

676
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,520
True love will take its course

677
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:12,520
I'm by your side

678
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:17,520
Spending a long time with you

679
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,520
Because I believe I want you

680
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,520
True love will take its course

681
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,520
I'm by your side

682
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,520
True love will take its course

683
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,520
The fire of the horse is burning

684
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:44,520
You always look at the sky for me

685
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,520
The sense of dream

686
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,520
Break the cocoon

687
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,520
The night of the first rain

688
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,520
The night

689
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,520
Then won the world for me

690
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:21,520
The car always stops

691
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,520
I also lean on your shoulder

692
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,520
Just be brave

693
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,520
Every dream I have

694
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,520
Won't

695
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,520
Won't

696
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,520
Won't

697
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,520
Won't lose to the world again

698
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,520
Because I believe I love you

699
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:47,520
True love will take its course

700
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,520
I'm by your side

701
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,520
Spending a long time with you

702
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:00,520
Because I believe I want you

703
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:05,520
True love will take its course

704
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,520
The fire of the horse is burning

705
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:17,520
You always look at the sky for me

706
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,520
Because I believe I love you

707
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,520
True love will take its course

708
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,520
I'm by your side

709
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:34,520
Spending a long time with you

710
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,520
Because I believe I want you

711
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:43,520
True love will take its course

712
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:47,520
True love will take its course

713
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,520
The fire of the horse is burning

714
00:47:52,520 --> 00:48:00,520
You always look at the sky for me

715
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,520
The fire of the horse is burning

716
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:19,520
You always look at the sky for me
