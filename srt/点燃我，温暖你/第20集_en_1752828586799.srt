00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if the light is very bright

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will still watch over that vast vast land

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless atmosphere

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day, the lens is a little bit yellow

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast night?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I burn up the night just for you to remember

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How everything was in the beginning

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The wind and the color of the night are like wild grass

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The mountains are broken, but you are still by my side

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Everything is the original look

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The King of Blaze

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Episode 1

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The King of Blaze

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You are back

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I am so tired

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Come

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You are tired

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What's wrong

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yixuan, am I too nice to you

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It seems that after you are with me

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
There is only one part of the couple

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Who said that

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Do you know what I saw when I went back to school today

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I saw Liu Sisi

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Liu Sisi

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Liu Sisi again

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Liu Sisi again, right

35
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Who did you see

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Mr. Xi, Zhen Jingcan

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
In our school class

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Really

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I looked at the road of the contest

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I saw something interesting

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What's interesting

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Our moon is back again

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Fang Zhijing

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
He is really amazing

45
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Every time I forget him

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He has to show his presence

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The moon is very powerful in China

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Especially in the case of tumor drugs

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yes, yes, yes

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Can reach all companies

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Lao Gao

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Come in, come in

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Ok

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Can reach all companies

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
If we can cooperate smoothly

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That will be for our LP's experimental data

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Provide great convenience

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yes

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Lao Gao

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Go there, you can

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Lao Gao

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Lao Gao

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Why are you here

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I have something to talk to you

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Sit down

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'll get you a glass of water

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
No need

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What's the matter

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You seem to be in a hurry

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I saw Fang Zhijing

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I saw Fang Zhijing

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
With the people of the contest committee

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It seems to be heard

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
They mentioned the matter of the competition three years ago

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Li Xun

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Li Xun

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Can you get away from him

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Don't bother him during this period

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You should tell him

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I can't control him

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I can only tell you

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I have submitted to UCL

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The prize materials for our previous competitions

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
If nothing happens

85
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
After a while

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
My offer can be sent down

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
This period is too important to me

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Can't make any mistakes

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I understand

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Li Xun

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I beg you

92
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Not so serious

93
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Lao Gao

94
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Don't worry

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I have no inner work

96
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You have a glass of water

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Can you

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I can

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'll do it

100
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'll do it

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
No problem

102
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Lin Long

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
This is for you

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You put this contest project

105
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Give me a record

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I can't tell

107
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You find someone else

108
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Who am I looking for

109
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I can find someone

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I have to find you

111
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You are the last option

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Ok?

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You have taken away my life

114
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You don't answer my phone

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Who am I looking for

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Hurry up

117
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Record it

118
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Teacher

119
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Let me help you

120
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You are

121
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I am Fang Zhijing

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Fang

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I met him in the first contest

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Fang Zhijing, the big guy

125
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yes

126
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Hello, Fang

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Hello, teacher

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Teacher

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Is there anything else to pay attention to

130
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Tell me

131
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
No

132
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Thank you

133
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Hurry up

134
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Let him do it if he wants

135
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Save me from seeing

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
What shouldn't be seen

137
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's a trouble if your hands are itchy

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Teacher, let me help you

139
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Ok

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm leaving

141
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You stop

142
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Check all the machines for me

143
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Confirm

144
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
All the software of the team

145
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
After using the software

146
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You go again

147
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's not that easy to steal

148
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
There are machines

149
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
This Li Xun

150
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Is such a happiness

151
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
This kid is a little confused

152
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Don't take it to heart

153
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Look at what you said

154
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
How long has it been

155
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And

156
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's not my own problem

157
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Young people

158
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Easily make mistakes

159
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The road ahead is still long

160
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Maybe

161
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You will become good friends

162
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yes

163
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Teacher

164
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I am a good friend

165
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I am a good friend

166
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I am a good friend

167
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I am a good friend

168
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I am a good friend

169
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I am a good friend

170
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I am a good friend

171
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I am a good friend

172
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Teacher

173
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I heard before

174
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Nanhu University Computer Technology

175
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Can be removed

176
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Li Xun has always been guided by you

177
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You don't blame him for being wrong

178
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Li Xun's situation is a bit special

179
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
In terms of transformation

180
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
People and money

181
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Can be inserted into the sky and the ground

182
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
If a student doesn't open the door

183
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
No matter how good the teacher is

184
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's a waste

185
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Li Xun

186
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Just got into the fourth grade

187
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I quit school and started a company

188
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I always advise him to slow down

189
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You still have a lifetime

190
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But where can he wait

191
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Look at it

192
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So many famous big hospitals and big pharmaceutical factories

193
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm looking for him to cooperate with him

194
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
He thinks it's not appropriate

195
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Just turn him out

196
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's true

197
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Only he can reduce the error rate to less than one percent

198
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Now it's a wholesale market

199
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Your generation of young people

200
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Have a good time

201
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:46,300
Your

202
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Teacher, please take a look

203
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
How to get in here

204
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Old man

205
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
No eyes at all

206
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
No wonder he got into this age

207
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The IQ is still up

208
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Disgrace

209
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Hello

210
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The signal is not good just now

211
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Tomorrow night, right

212
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm going to the hospital

213
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'll be there

214
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Tomorrow night, right

215
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Ok, I see

216
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
what happened

217
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What do you want from me

218
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Two words

219
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Say it

220
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Why are you looking for the committee

221
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Your news is full

222
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
This is also related to you

223
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Really have nothing to do with me

224
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Director Fan

225
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Can you stop playing the sound all day

226
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
A little responsible

227
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You said you didn't evaluate it

228
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And don't go abroad

229
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What kind of human are you

230
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It seems that you care about Gao Jianhong

231
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I know

232
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Gao Jianhong these two days

233
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Always asking outside

234
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What did I tell the committee

235
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Not just worried about his offer

236
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
OK, I can stay out of it

237
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But I have a condition

238
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You apologize to me

239
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Don't take yourself too seriously

240
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
If you can be in this year's competition

241
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
In the opening ceremony

242
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Apologize to me in public

243
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Admit what you did

244
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Was in the absence of evidence

245
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Deceived me

246
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Damaged my reputation

247
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Then I can consider

248
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Your two words

249
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
For Gao Jianhong's good future

250
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm not too much

251
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
OK

252
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I promise you

253
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I can apologize in public

254
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But not to you

255
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You colluded with sponsors

256
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Internal prize

257
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
This is the fact

258
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I apologize

259
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Is for the competition committee

260
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And every contestant

261
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I broke the rules of the competition

262
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Influence the competition

263
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,620
I'm just a

264
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What do they have to do with me

265
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Fang Zhijing

266
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I advise you to promise

267
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
If I find

268
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What little action you have behind

269
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Last time I let you go

270
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
If there is another time

271
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I will definitely destroy you completely

272
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Don't tell me this

273
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Don't believe

274
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm not a fool

275
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
This is Nanhu University

276
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Good luck

277
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
OK

278
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
This time we will leave for nothing

279
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Go

280
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
All the leaders of the committee

281
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
All the judges

282
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
All the teachers and classmates

283
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Hello

284
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
This year

285
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Nanhu University students

286
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Information Security Competition

287
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Semi-final and final

288
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Will be held in our Nanhu University

289
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
We feel the honor of ten thousand points

290
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Here I represent Nanhu University

291
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Warmly welcome you to report

292
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
This competition

293
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'll say it

294
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Hello everyone

295
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I am Li Xin

296
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Everyone here should still remember

297
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The competition three years ago

298
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Because of my personal will

299
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Did something that does not comply with the rules of the competition

300
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You can get a special prize for this tofu

301
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's a fair insult to the competition

302
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Disturbed the order of the competition

303
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
For all the players

304
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Caused impact and loss

305
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Am I afraid of responsibility

306
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Or are you afraid of responsibility

307
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Again

308
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I want to apologize to the committee of the competition

309
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And every contestant

310
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I sincerely hope

311
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Such a thing

312
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Never happen again

313
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Good good

314
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Li Li Xin students bravely stand on the stage

315
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Admit your own mistakes

316
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Thanks

317
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Wait for me to come down

318
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Invite you to dinner

319
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm not missing a meal

320
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:33,600
Quite a well-historic

321
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Hello everyone

322
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,240
That Li Xin

323
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,280
So the committee is very important

324
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,880
to establish an investigation team for investigation

325
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,680
to confirm

326
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,880
Li Xun's destruction of the competition order three years ago

327
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,800
caused a very bad impact

328
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,080
and was against the rules.

329
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,240
The committee decided to cancel

330
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,760
the first prize of Zhu Yun and Gao Jianhong

331
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,720
who were in the same group as him.

332
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,760
This...

333
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,080
Li Xun, Zhu Yun and Gao Jianhong

334
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,040
are not allowed to participate in the competition.

335
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,960
The announcement is over.

336
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,360
Right. Why is the school so biased?

337
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,360
There's nothing.

338
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,760
Do you think we don't want to

339
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,760
invite you to the school?

340
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,960
It's a trash school.

341
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:49,840
Right.

342
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,040
It's a trash school.

343
00:16:59,160 --> 00:16:59,920
What do you want?

344
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,640
Fang Zhijing,

345
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,720
no matter where you go in the future,

346
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,080
you can't succeed in everything.

347
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,840
Because I will always be watching you

348
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,160
and know that you have paid enough.

349
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,360
The first prize of Zhu Yun and Gao Jianhong

350
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,040
is the first prize of Gao Jianhong.

351
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,040

The fifth prize is the first prize of Gao Jianhong.

355
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,040
The sixth prize is the first prize of Gao Jianhong.

356
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,040
The seventh prize is the first prize of Gao Jianhong.

357
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,040
The seventh prize is the first prize of Gao Jianhong.

358
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,040
The seventh prize is the first prize of Gao Jianhong.

359
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,040
The seventh prize is the first prize of Gao Jianhong.

360
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,040
The seventh prize is the first prize of Gao Jianhong.

361
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,040
The seventh prize is the first prize of Gao Jianhong.

362
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,040
The seventh prize is the first prize of Gao Jianhong.

363
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,720
Next, let's have Dr.ımızı fresh to our heart

364
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,720
with the director of the city government.

365
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,120
I'll go in!

366
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:41,560
Here, thoughts!

367
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,880
I should have come to thank you.

368
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,800
I'm sorry.

369
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,760
I've asked around.

370
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,120
Fang Zhijin said

371
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,240
as long as you apologize to him in public,

372
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,800
it's all over.

373
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,960
Why didn't you do as he said?

374
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,560
You promised me

375
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,920
not to provoke him.

376
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,560
Is this result

377
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,160
what you want?

378
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,360
No.

379
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,680
But I don't owe him.

380
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,080
But you owe me!

381
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,640
I've begged you.

382
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,760
I've begged you.

383
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:30,920
Why don't you

384
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,440
surrender for the first time?

385
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,280
I know

386
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,600
you're good, you're arrogant, you're arrogant.

387
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,400
Even now,

388
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,840
you don't want to say

389
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,760
you're wrong.

390
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,320
You think you can't

391
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,080
give up

392
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,800
just because you're sorry?

393
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,520
I've done everything I can.

394
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,960
Li Xue.

395
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,840
I, Gao Jianhong,

396
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,720
can't beat you.

397
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,360
I can't avoid you.

398
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,200
But now,

399
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,760
you don't even want to give me

400
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,320
the chance to avoid you.

401
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,960
Seeing me like this,

402
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,200
are you satisfied?

403
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,680
Yes, I am.

404
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,920
I will treat you well

405
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,920
when you grow up.

406
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,160
Xu Tian.

407
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,560
I promise.

408
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,480
Darling.

409
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,720
I'm sorry.

410
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,120
I always treat you as a friend.

411
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
If you're willing,

412
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,520
we'll still be teammates in the same team.

413
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,320
I'm sorry.

414
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,720
I'm sorry.

415
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,720
I'm sorry.

416
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,720
Wipe it.

417
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,720
Wipe it.

418
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,720
Wipe it.

419
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,720
Wipe it.

420
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,720
Hurry up.

421
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,720
Wipe it.

422
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,720
Wipe it.

423
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,720
Just a little bit.

424
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,720
Why do you

425
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,720
watch every match?

426
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,720
Three big and three small.

427
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,720
You even watch the ice-cold lake.

428
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,720
Do you understand?

429
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,720
How can I not understand?

430
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
The principles are the same.

431
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,720
I can understand it at a glance.

432
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,720
Okay.

433
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,720
Okay.

434
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,720
What are you doing?

435
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,720
I want to read the news.

436
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,720
What news do you think it is?

437
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,720
You're always talking about the chicken and the garlic skin.

438
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,720
Isn't this Yuanyuan?

439
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,720
Did you see it?

440
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,720
What?

441
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,720
You're a person.

442
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,720
This...

443
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,720
The one in the wedding dress.

444
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,720
You don't know your own daughter?

445
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,720
You're back.

446
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,720
Is Gao still angry?

447
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
Take it easy.

448
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,720
You're letting him win.

449
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,720
He prepared for more than a year

450
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,720
to apply for this university.

451
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,720
This is too sudden.

452
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,720
I know.

453
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,720
You've worked hard.

454
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,720
I'll go to persuade him.

455
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,720
It's a good choice to follow us.

456
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,720
You're successful.

457
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,720
You're on the news.

458
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,720
Internet, big data, and cloud computing development.

459
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,720
It's over.

460
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,720
What's wrong?

461
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,720
I got the news.

462
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,720
My mom must have seen it.

463
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,720
She's doing the big data testing.

464
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,720
No, I have to go back.

465
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,720
I have to be honest and honest.

466
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,720
What time are you going to book?

467
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,720
Li Lan is coming tomorrow.

468
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,720
I'll send her to pick her up.

469
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,720
Why is Li Lan coming?

470
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,720
There's a lot of dust in the flower garden.

471
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,720
There's a type of anemia in her eyes.

472
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,720
I asked her to come here for surgery.

473
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,720
How about I wait for her first?

474
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,720
It's okay.

475
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,720
It's a small operation.

476
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,720
Wait until she fully recovers.

477
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,720
Then I'll go to the hospital.

478
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,720
I'll let you see her again.

479
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,720
I have no other relatives.

480
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,720
What do you mean by that?

481
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,720
You're just a stepmother.

482
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,720
Is this a meeting with your parents?

483
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,720
You're not changing people?

484
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
I'm not changing people.

485
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,720
I can't find a better one anyway.

486
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,720
Princess.

487
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,720
I love you.

488
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,720
What did you say?

489
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,720
You can't wait for me?

490
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,720
I'll be back in a few days.

491
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,720
I'll be back soon.

492
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
Don't worry.

493
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,720
I'll be with your parents when you get home.

494
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
Li Lan won't leave so soon.

495
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,720
I'm not hungry.

496
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,720
You're back.

497
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,720
Mom, you're back.

498
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
You're back.

499
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,720
What are you eating?

500
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,720
Go wash your hands.

501
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,720
We're about to eat.

502
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,720
Mom, you made so many dishes today.

503
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,720
Eat more.

504
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,720
Dad, mom.

505
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,720
I have something to tell you.

506
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,720
Eat first.

507
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,720
Let's talk after we eat.

508
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,720
I gave up on the health care.

509
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,720
I want to start a business.

510
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,720
No, I don't agree.

511
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,720
Don't you ask me for my specific ideas?

512
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
Don't you want to know?

513
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
I don't want to.

514
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,720
From now on,

515
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,720
you should prepare to go abroad.

516
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,720
You've already left a big problem.

517
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,720
You know that, right?

518
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,720
You've already known

519
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,720
about Li Xun and me, right?

520
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,720
But it's such a big deal.

521
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,720
Why didn't you tell your parents earlier?

522
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,720
You're going to keep it from us?

523
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,720
When will it end?

524
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,720
Mom, he's not what you think he is.

525
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,720
Then what is he like?

526
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,720
He cheated for a reason.

527
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,720
He's short of money.

528
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,720
He can cheat for money, right?

529
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,720
According to the logic of people like them,

530
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,720
can he kill people and set fire

531
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,720
if he's short of money?

532
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,720
Then why did he kill people and set fire?

533
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,720
What else is there

534
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,720
that they can do?

535
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,720
When did you learn

536
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,720
to talk to your mom like that?

537
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,720
Calm down.

538
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,720
There's a saying,

539
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,720
a man who can't leave his home without a door.

540
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,720
Actually, I don't agree with him.

541
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,720
There's a possibility that

542
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,720
a golden phoenix can fly out of a chicken nest.

543
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,720
It depends on his luck.

544
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,720
There are some things on the pole

545
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,720
that can't be put on.

546
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,720
He didn't put it on.

547
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,720
I know best if he did.

548
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,720
I've brought so many students.

549
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
People like him

550
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,720
lack a sense of security.

551
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,720
When there's a chance,

552
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,720
you have to find a way to get out of it.

553
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,720
He didn't.

554
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,720
Why not?

555
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,720
Do you think he's bothering you?

556
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,720
He's doing it to get revenge on me.

557
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,720
I'm the one who's bothering him.

558
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,720
Yun Yue,

559
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,720
don't speak for him, okay?

560
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,720
My parents know you best.

561
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,720
And look at him.

562
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,720
Look at his behavior

563
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,720
in the competition.

564
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,720
Dad, you don't know that

565
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,720
he participated in the competition

566
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,720
for me.

567
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,720
You've been fooled by people like him

568
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,720
since you were a kid.

569
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,720
When will you grow up?

570
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,720
It's because Fang Zhijin

571
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,720
doesn't follow the rules of the competition.

572
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,720
It's unfair to other teams.

573
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,720
It's up to you to decide

574
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,720
whether it's fair or not.

575
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,720
What's the point?

576
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,720
Even if you don't want to talk about it,

577
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
it's really unfair.

578
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,720
You can just complain about it.

579
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,720
Like now,

580
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,720
you've crossed the teacher and the school.

581
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,720
You've ruined the sense of the competition.

582
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,720
It's only right to cancel your qualification.

583
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,720
Look at you.

584
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,720
You've been used by people like him.

585
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,720
You came back to fight with your parents.

586
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,720
You don't even have a sense of security, right?

587
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,720
You're so naive.

588
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,720
You're so childish.

589
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,720
Come back.

590
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,720
Yuanyuan.

591
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,720
I haven't finished yet.

592
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,720
Where are you going?

593
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,720
What's wrong with you?

594
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,720
Why are you like this?

595
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,720
You can be willful

596
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,720
in small things.

597
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,720
I don't care.

598
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,720
But you have to listen to

599
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,720
our parents' opinion

600
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,720
in this kind of important choices.

601
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,720
Do you know that

602
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,720
people are not stupid?

603
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,720
Do you know that

604
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,720
the most precious thing in a person's life

605
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,720
is the youth.

606
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,720
Especially a girl.

607
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,720
Now you've just learned a little bit.

608
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,720
You're going to start a business with others.

609
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,720
You don't even learn.

610
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,720
You'll be stuck in the future.

611
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,720
You'll be trapped in a place

612
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,720
and can't get out.

613
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,720
Don't be angry.

614
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,720
Yuanyuan.

615
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,720
We're a reasonable family.

616
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,720
Let's sit down

617
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,720
and talk about it.

618
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,720
There's nothing to talk about.

619
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,720
Put down your luggage.

620
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,720
Don't you think

621
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,720
our parents are important?

622
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,720
What if I say no?

623
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,720
You can stay at home with me.

624
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,720
You can't go anywhere.

625
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,720
You can reflect on yourself.

626
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,720
I'll go with you.

627
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,720
What's wrong with you, sister?

628
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,720
Nothing.

629
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,720
I'm just a little bit cold.

630
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,460
Try themaxs

631
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,840
Let me provide you with cooking villagers

632
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,020
Sister

633
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,000
Koizumi

634
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,640
You had a cut last morning

635
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,720
You are not cut

636
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:02,860
I'm hot

637
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:16,840
Used it

638
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,760
So expensive?

639
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,080
Then...

640
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,680
Let's not eat here.

641
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,600
It's unnecessary.

642
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,320
Waiter.

643
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:24,920
Waiter.

644
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,480
Order please.

645
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,520
Why did you order so much?

646
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,720
It's quite expensive.

647
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,920
Eat it.

648
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,720
You can go.

649
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:52,040
There's nothing we can't eat.

650
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:52,960
Go order.

651
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,640
Well...

652
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,400
It's popular these days.

653
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:06,960
Really?

654
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:14,640
Here.

655
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,440
Why didn't you watch it earlier?

656
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,200
Do you want me to force you?

657
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,360
You can save money?

658
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,760
Did Zhang Dakang quit drinking?

659
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,440
We both love neighbors.

660
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,280
I know I know.

661
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,920
But I can't just abandon them.

662
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,640
Good though it all seems

663
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,080
what I want,

664
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,120
I still can't give up on a single lady.

665
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,680
Can I

666
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,140
think about

667
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,680
how much

668
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,240
Zhang Dakang can teach you to be a good boy.

669
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,240
You'll know it in no time.

670
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,240
Sister.

671
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,440
Even if you're a woman,

672
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,040
we have to look after An'an.

673
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,240
From now on, An'an will come to school here.

674
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,840
I'll be your sister.

675
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,840
Okay.

676
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,840
Okay.

677
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,840
Let's treat the illness first.

678
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,840
When it's cured, we'll discuss it.

679
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,440
Don't worry.

680
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,440
Okay.

681
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,440
Dad.

682
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,440
You seem to have changed.

683
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,440
Really?

684
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,440
How did I change?

685
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,440
You seem to

686
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,440
have a heartache.

687
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,440
I'll tell you.

688
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,440
I've booked a hotel for you for a week.

689
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,440
I want you to stay a few more days.

690
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,440
No need.

691
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,440
I'll go back after the surgery.

692
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,440
After the surgery, you'll have to go back to get the line.

693
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,440
And I want you to meet someone.

694
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,440
Who?

695
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,440
To you,

696
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,440
it should be a familiar person.

697
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,440
You'll know when you come in.

698
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,440
Okay.

699
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,440
You arrange it.

700
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,440
Okay.

701
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,440
I'll arrange it.

702
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,440
Okay.

703
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,440
Eat.

704
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,440
What are you looking at?

705
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,440
Guo Jinghong, let's talk.

706
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,440
I've been waiting for you all night.

707
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,440
I have nothing to talk to you.

708
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,440
Think about it.

709
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,440
We're both being bullied by Li Xun.

710
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,440
He still keeps biting me.

711
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,440
Not only your future, but also mine.

712
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,440
We're both in the same boat.

713
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,440
Who is in the same boat with you?

714
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,440
You're not as good as others.

715
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,440
Okay.

716
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,440
I also have a chance to be a steward.

717
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,440
I have a good relationship with some investors.

718
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,440
I can recommend you.

719
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,440
You know that's a big company.

720
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,440
You help me persuade Li Xun.

721
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,440
Let's forget it this time.

722
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,440
We all take a step back.

723
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,440
Get out of here.

724
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,440
Gao Xianhong.

725
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,440
Are you asking me questions?

726
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,440
You've been following Li Xun all day.

727
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,440
What did you get?

728
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,440
You got the title in the competition.

729
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,440
You can't win the school's school's school.

730
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,440
You can't even win a girl's school.

731
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,440
Fang Zhijin.

732
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,440
Listen.

733
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,440
Li Xun and I are brothers.

734
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,440
Li Xun is ten thousand times better than you.

735
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,440
I'm willing to follow him.

736
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,440
He will keep an eye on you.

737
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,440
Don't worry about me.

738
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,440
If it weren't for Li Xun's sister,

739
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,440
do you think he would let you go?

740
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,440
When Li Xun's sister leaves,

741
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,440
he has a thousand ways to make you feel bad.

742
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,440
The final is coming.

743
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,440
Be careful not to lose again.

744
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,440
I'm going to add a list.

745
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,440
This is your room card.

746
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,440
Thank you.

747
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,440
Does it hurt?

748
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,440
It's okay.

749
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,440
Dad.

750
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,440
Can you return the hotel?

751
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,440
It's too expensive.

752
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,440
I paid for it.

753
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,440
It's a waste.

754
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,440
If you think it's a waste,

755
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,440
send it to me tomorrow morning.

756
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,440
If you're free,

757
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,440
remember to have breakfast downstairs tomorrow morning.

758
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,440
But...

759
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,440
Enough.

760
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,440
You just have a good rest.

761
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,440
I'll do something tomorrow afternoon.

762
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,440
Then I'll come and pick you up for dinner.

763
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,440
No need.

764
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,440
Okay.

765
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,440
Be quiet.

766

802
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,440

This bowl costs more than 500 yuan.

806
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,440
If you didn't see Li Bi at the competition, I wouldn't want to live here.

00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:37,480
Zhuyu.

822
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,560
Meng Zhijie, the bastard

823
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,520
tried to kidnap Li Lan

824
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:40,920

828
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,880
The boy is doing nothing

829
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:47,920
once he finished recording that at dawn.

830
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,020
once he finished recording that at dawn.

831
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:48,080
once he finished recording that at dawn.

832
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:48,480
He knew it was his fault,

833
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,380
But they really did nothing.

834
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:49,840
They potatoes Li Ran's away.

835
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,360
I'll only have you.

836
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,440
I'm not a good person.

860
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:22,440
We won't be separated.

861
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,440
Escape from the noisy world.

862
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,440
Accompany me.

863
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,440
I'm your new point of view.

864
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,440
Raise me up bravely.

865
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:42,440
Like the flame of the night.

866
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,440
Cause I believe I love you.

867
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,440
True love will take its course.

I miss you.

875
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:30,440
The feeling of dream.

876
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:34,440
Overcome the limit.

877
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,440
The last night.

878
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,440
