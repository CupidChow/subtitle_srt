1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,820
Osmore

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I don't believe anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
until you break into my world

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Even if the world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We'll fight in the darkness

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Even if the light is bright

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'll still watch over that vast ocean

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I see the direction of my heart

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Every day, I'm a little scared

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I'm light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
How can I be alone in the dark

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm burning up

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Just to remember

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The way everything was

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I'm light

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The wind and the sun shine like a wild grass

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The most ancient of all

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You're still by my side

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Everything is the original look

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Watch, watch, watch me

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This is the biggest bone for the summer

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Episode 2

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Let's go back to work.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Wait for me a day.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Li Xuan.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The base is yours.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The blue coffin is yours too.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You have the right to defend the people.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I have the right to quit too.

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Come and get the watch.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Let me cut it.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Are you a waste?

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You'll die if you cut it yourself.

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Are you really angry?

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I think Zhang Xiaobei

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
is a little too much.

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But Li Xun's way of handling it

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
is not bad.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Zhang Xiaobei's life

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
is a big enterprise cooperating with the school.

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What can you do?

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Give up the blue coffin project.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Why should we give up?

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
If you don't want to give up,

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
then accept the reality.

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You and Li Xun

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
are really a match made in heaven.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm much more realistic than Li Xun.

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
If I meet Zhang Xiaobei,

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'll be with him.

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'll pretend to cooperate with him first.

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
After I get what I want,

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll squeeze him hard.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
In this world,

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
there are so many people

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
who are willing to sacrifice for a grain of rice.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Even if it's half a grain of rice,

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
someone will take it.

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Zhu Yun,

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
you are protected too well.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That guy is usually

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
not afraid of anything.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He's scared all of a sudden.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What's the point of turning around?

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Is it worth getting so angry?

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I think you're just trying to get drunk.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You're not going to save him,

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
but to make Li Xun angry.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
For him?

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
A woman who has been obsessed with love since ancient times.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
A romantic wolf.

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Have you ever thought about Li Xun?

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Why is he so straightforward?

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He's afraid of offending Zhang Xiaobei.

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He's scared.

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Do you think Li Xun

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
is that kind of person who is afraid of love?

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Li Xun is different from us.

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
He's like this.

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He always understands his own goal.

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So he never

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
has any regrets.

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
He never cares about anything.

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
If he did something

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
that makes us not understand,

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
it must be because he did it that way.

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's more efficient and more efficient.

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Right?

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Li Xun

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Hello, Senior.

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'll be there soon.

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What's wrong?

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Who's calling?

94
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Han Jiakang.

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't know why Zhang Xiaobei

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
is doing something bad again.

97
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
He's making everyone go.

98
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You're free now.

99
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You can leave now.

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What are you doing today?

101
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm taking a class.

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm going to sleep.

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You're not?

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You were like a chicken's blood

105
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
the other day.

106
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You were so energetic.

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Now you're so boring.

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Can you do it?

109
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm tired.

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I was so tight before.

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I finally relaxed a little.

112
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Are you really going to quit?

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What else?

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yesterday, the base reported the workload.

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You're still on the list.

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Team Leader Li

117
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
reported you the full amount.

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Really?

119
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yes.

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Just do it.

121
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Why are you so slow?

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Thank you very much for

123
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
all your efforts and efforts.

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The project was well recommended.

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But can a project

126
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
go on smoothly?

127
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
In addition to the ability,

128
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
it needs a lot of other things.

129
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
In this respect,

130
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
New Creation will provide us

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
with technical support.

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
With the support of the big platform,

133
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I believe everyone can learn more from it.

134
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I know that this project

135
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
was always in charge of

136
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Li Xun's class.

137
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Li Xun is excellent.

138
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
But he's still young.

139
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
He must have not enough experience.

140
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm not modest about this.

141
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I've been in charge of

142
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
several hundred projects

143
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
along the way.

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So next,

145
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'll be in charge of

146
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Lan Guan's project.

147
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Han Jiakang will be the team leader.

148
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Please report your class schedule

149
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
to Director Han.

150
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We'll assign tasks according to the class.

151
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You can stay at the base

152
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
when there's no class.

153
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Is that okay?

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'll be honest with you.

155
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The exam is not to scare you.

156
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The attendance rate

157
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
will eventually be reflected

158
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
in your revenge

159
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
and project rights.

160
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I hope everyone can be more

161
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
responsible for the project.

162
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You can't always

163
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
take yourself as a college student.

164
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You have to learn to be responsible for yourself.

165
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'll do my best.

166
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Okay.

167
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'll go.

168
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Okay.

169
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'll go.

170
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Who's in charge of the aesthetic design?

171
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Before the UI part,

172
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Zhou Ying should be responsible.

173
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Where is he?

174
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
He has a class today.

175
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You two are in the same class.

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
He has a class alone.

177
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's a selection class.

178
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Teacher He Pei's week-end entrance.

179
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Didn't Teacher He Pei go abroad to study?

180
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
That class is taken by other teachers.

181
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Other teachers?

182
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Which one?

183
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I forgot the name.

184
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Open the textbook and look at the line.

185
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I have no choice.

186
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I have to go to the library.

187
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'll contact the Internet.

188
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'll go to the library.

189
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Open it.

190
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Change this.

191
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Zhou Yi Ru Man.

192
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Fang Shu Miao, what's wrong with my textbook?

193
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Little pig, little pig.

194
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm so jealous of you.

195
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
What's wrong with my textbook?

196
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
But Li Xun is too bold.

197
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I think Li Xun treats you differently.

198
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
No.

199
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
He must be afraid of trouble.

200
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
He's afraid that Zhang Xiaobei will find something to torture you.

201
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
But I don't think we can...

202
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That can't be on the online site.

203
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Li Xun is writing a written review in the department.

204
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Teacher, you can just do it yourself.

205
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I won't say much.

206
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
What did you say?

207
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I just said it.

208
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I just want to make myself clear.

209
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Fang Shu Miao.

210
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You don't know.

211
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
We are tortured to death by Zhang Xiaobei.

212
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But the most miserable thing is Li Xun.

213
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
He worked hard on the project.

214
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
He did everything for others.

215
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Now Zhang Xiaobei is in charge of the project.

216
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Han Jiakang is the team leader.

217
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What about Li Xun?

218
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
He's not in the list.

219
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Zhang Xiaobei even took the position of the project manager.

220
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Yes.

221
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You said when the project is famous,

222
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Li Xun can be the top.

223
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Let me see.

224
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
How many people came to study business?

225
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Who does Zhang Xiaobei think he is?

226
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
He came to us to play the role of Wei Feng.

227
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yes.

228
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Why should we listen to him?

229
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Li Xun has a good idea.

230
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Yes.

231
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Why doesn't he react at all?

232
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I think Li Xun will have a way.

233
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You mean

234
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
just like the last time the bid,

235
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
this time he also has a backup?

236
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The genius brain is different from us.

237
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
This kind of heartless, cowardly, and indecisive

238
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and then use one trick to defeat the enemy.

239
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Sounds very passionate.

240
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'll have a chicken leg.

241
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What did Brother Shen ask me to do?

242
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Can you write the project list

243
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
you wrote when you were bidding

244
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
and send it to me?

245
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Brother Shen, you are the team leader now.

246
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Isn't it difficult to write a project list?

247
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Didn't you also participate in the bidding?

248
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Is it Zhang Xiaobei?

249
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I won't send it if you don't say it.

250
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's Zhang Xiaobei.

251
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
He wants to be interviewed

252
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
about our project.

253
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'll send it to you.

254
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Does Li Xun know?

255
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Why?

256
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
He doesn't even know what the project is.

257
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
He doesn't even know what BIOS is.

258
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Why is all the work on him?

259
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
This project belongs to Li Xun.

260
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Who knows who Li Xun is?

261
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
What do you mean?

262
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Zhang Xiaobei is a newbie.

263
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
He is the project manager of 500-storied enterprises.

264
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
He has the value of an interview.

265
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What about Li Xun?

266
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Is he just a college student

267
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
or someone no one knows except for the project?

268
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Who cares how much he has the ability?

269
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Who cares who he is?

270
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Who cares how much he worked for this project?

271
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Who cares

272
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
if this project is for others?

273
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You didn't even think about

274
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
the project goals, right?

275
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I care about Li Xun.

276
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You're back.

277
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You're back.

278
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
The green part takes a week.

279
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
This part is not moved at all.

280
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
This is your task.

281
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
What if I don't come back?

282
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Are you sure I'll come back?

283
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You dare.

284
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You can say it.

285
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Li Xun,

286
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
you'll have a way, right?

287
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Zhang Xiaobei bullied you so much.

288
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You'll have a reaction.

289
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You must be like the last time,

290
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
you're ready to fight back.

291
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What do you mean?

292
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I mean,

293
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
what do you mean?

294
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Just say it.

295
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
The project to finish Lan Guan

296
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
will be over sooner or later.

297
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
What kind of method is this?

298
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Zhu Yan, do you know

299
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
everything

300
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
that he did

301
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
at the beginning

302
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
is what he was like before?

303
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The later, the more he deviates.

304
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
But it's still worth trying.

305
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
We try

306
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
to keep him away from it.

307
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Am I right?

308
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You're right.

309
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm not at fault.

310
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm not.

311
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
So you can just say it.

312
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Don't think about what you can do.

313
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
If you dare to quit,

314
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
you'll never come back.

315
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Everyone is busy being absent.

316
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,880
He's really in that situation.

317
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,400
The point is that

318
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,800
we're both forgetting to watch him kill Xiao Beisai.

319
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,160
But aside from that,

320
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,200
none of us are being fired because of him.

321
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,280
You are crazy!

322
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,120
You're Economy Department,

323
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,360
but you didn't work to power the computer.

324
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,880
Are you done?

325
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,160
Donated it to tremolo.

326
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,680
I'm free now.

327
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,900
My very own Jiang Xiaobei

328
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,800
is free from跟你-f 가운데 plan now.

329
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,200
I'm free now from today.

330
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,600
Now you're so anxious.

331
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,400
You should know,

332
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,660
my professional grain of rice

333
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,100
is blood CAN NUMBER 9 CONTXT.

334
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:03,580
has been our

335
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,600
crash of advances

336
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,620
since the highly professional lessons.

337
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,540
You're so stubborn.

338
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,900
You're willing to try.

339
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,500
Li Xu gave you the highest score.

340
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,580
So,

341
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,900
I'm quick-witted.

342
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,100
I won't drag you down.

343
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,220
Wrong again.

344
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,460
I've changed the color of the color of the guide.

345
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,620
This Zhang Xiaobei.

346
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,740
Actually, Zhang Xiaobei doesn't know how to mix it.

347
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,060
Whether the website is good or not,

348
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,300
he can pick words.

349
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,740
Come here.

350
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,820
You're not good at it.

351
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,180
I just thought about it.

352
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,900
I think our font is not good-looking now.

353
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,780
I want that kind of

354
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,860
more popular this year.

355
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,420
With a metallic texture.

356
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,420
Sand gold.

357
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,900
But our background is white.

358
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,220
The gold and white are too close.

359
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,140
It's hard to see.

360
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,540
Then change the background.

361
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,140
It's not that simple.

362
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,420
We've done a lot of

363
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,700
miscalculations in the early stage.

364
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,540
If we want to change,

365
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,500
we have to cover the previous ones.

366
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,780
Just change it.

367
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,140
But it's a lot of work.

368
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,620
If we want to change the previous miscalculations,

369
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,180
a lot of data will be wrong.

370
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,180
It's not easy.

371
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,740
A lot of data will be wrong.

372
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,100
Everyone has to change it.

373
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:07,980
These should be

374
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,180
your problems.

375
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,780
You should be careful when you do things.

376
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,140
If it's almost the same from the beginning,

377
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,020
then it's really

378
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,500
a thousand miles away.

379
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:17,980
That's it.

380
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,260
Draw a picture for me tonight.

381
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,180
I'll take a look.

382
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,180
Today?

383
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,380
Is it hard to draw a picture?

384
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,380
I know.

385
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,300
I'm so angry.

386
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,060
Don't be angry.

387
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,380
Remember his license plate number.

388
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,540
I'll blow up his tire.

389
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,220
You're right.

390
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,740
Help me with this.

391
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,020
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

392
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,420
Ziyuan.

393
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,020
I'm talking about the navigation.

394
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,780
The navigation is so bad now.

395
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,900
No wonder it's called the English language.

396
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,420
You're good at this.

397
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,660
It's so annoying.

398
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,820
I've drawn

399
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,940
five draft designs in a few days.

400
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,660
One for the title,

401
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,580
one for the color of the navigation.

402
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,340
I've changed them and I'm still struggling.

403
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,900
I'm so annoyed.

404
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,740
Li Xun.

405
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,580
Why don't you assign me other projects?

406
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,700
As long as you can save me,

407
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,060
I can be a cow or a horse.

408
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,780
There are no other projects.

409
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,220
Just stay here.

410
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,180
Ziyuan.

411
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,260
Are you listening?

412
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,700
I'm here.

413
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,660
What's wrong?

414
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,300
Just tell me I can change it.

415
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,700
I think

416
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,540
the first draft is better.

417
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,380
What do you think?

418
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,260
The first draft is better?

419
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,140
It's the fifth draft.

420
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,940
You're saying the first draft is better?

421
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,100
Why did you go early?

422
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,740
I just want to borrow the audio.

423
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,580
Ziyuan.

424
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,340
You've worked hard today.

425
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,940
Get the design drawings out.

426
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,860
Didn't you say you want to use the first draft?

427
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,940
The basic frame can be used for the first draft.

428
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,220
But I want the second draft for the body.

429
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,620
For the frame,

430
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,500
I think the fourth draft is the best.

431
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,020
How about this?

432
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,300
Help me to make it.

433
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,580
This shouldn't be difficult.

434
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,420
It's not difficult for you.

435
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,740
It's not difficult for you to do it yourself.

436
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,140
Mr. Zhang.

437
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,100
The Blue Caps called me today.

438
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,900
Why didn't they call me?

439
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,020
They said

440
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,940
they would come on Monday to see the progress.

441
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,660
Ziyuan.

442
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,540
How long will it take?

443
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,860
At least three days.

444
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,340
Then it's settled.

445
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,540
I'll do as I do now.

446
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:24,820
Okay.

447
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,100
Thank you.

448
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,140
I wish you a happy new year.

449
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:31,940
Don't forget it.

450
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,540
You're so realistic.

451
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,660
Mr. Chen.

452
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,060
Compared to the previous design of the payment,

453
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,820
and the product list,

454
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,020
this is the biggest innovation we've made this time.

455
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,020
Come on.

456
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,940
Try it.

457
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,020
How is it?

458
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,820
Interesting, right?

459
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,580
This is called micro-interactive.

460
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,740
It's also called micro-mobile.

461
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,860
It's a product that is currently being introduced in foreign networks.

462
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,860
My goodness.

463
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,940
He's been talking to micro-interactive for so long.

464
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,380
He really knows how to understand the Internet industry.

465
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:11,980
Is it good?

466
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,500
Look.

467
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,380
Small to small mouse,

468
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,580
carbon-fiber,

469
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,380
product design,

470
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,460
and so on.

471
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,820
It's very interesting.

472
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,380
It's simple and easy to get started.

473
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,860
I can guarantee that

474
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,940
I like every single user I've got.

475
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,460
And recently,

476
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,460
I've done some market research.

477
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,380
Our website

478
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,020
is the first one

479
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,700
to use this design with a large number of people.

480
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,220
If there are any problems

481
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,180
related to system update and maintenance,

482
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,100
you can ask the people below

483
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,980
to directly contact Han Jiakang.

484
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,780
We will be responsible for it.

485
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:44,660
Okay.

486
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,500
I think it's good.

487
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,420
I have something to talk with Mr. Chen.

488
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,340
You can go back first.

489
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,500
Okay, Mr. Zhang.

490
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:54,980
Do you have any other comments

491
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,260
to make up for it?

492
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,420
Not yet.

493
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,700
I'm worried about him.

494
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,060
He's a little bit sick.

495
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,100
It's all his again.

496
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,140
The project is over.

497
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,460
I'll treat you tonight.

498
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,340
Let's go.

499
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,420
Have another meal with Mr. Lv.

500
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,740
What's wrong?

501
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:50,660
Schnee.

502
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,340
Are you okay?

503
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,560
I may need to

504
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,140
treat future model

505
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:59,340
I have to move to Zhang Xiao Fei's place tomorrow.

506
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,740
I still have a new project.

507
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,140
I can't finish my undergraduate.

508
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,940
If I can't finish it, I won't graduate.

509
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,340
So that's how it is.

510
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,940
I studied for three years in the graduate school.

511
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,940
My senior studied for four years.

512
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,540
From the very beginning,

513
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,940
he kept doing projects for Zhang Xiao Fei.

514
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,740
My senior's thesis couldn't be written.

515
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,740
It was because Zhang Xiao Fei didn't give him the data.

516
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,140
He didn't want him to graduate.

517
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,140
My senior did projects for him.

518
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:52,740
In one year, he only gave him 800 dollars.

519
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:56,140
He still kept doing it.

520
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,140
If you don't want to do it, then don't do it.

521
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,540
It's not that easy.

522
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,740
He's a newbie.

523
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,740
He's so close to the school.

524
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,940
How can we

525
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,740
offend him?

526
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,340
I'll be honest with you.

527
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,340
He stole Lan Guan's project.

528
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,740
We didn't have anything

529
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,740
when we announced it.

530
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,140
We only knew that the project was good that day.

531
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,740
I knew it with my eyes closed.

532
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,740
After we left,

533
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,740
he would tell the person in charge of Lan Guan.

534
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,140
I can guarantee it with my life.

535
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:39,140
There won't be anyone like you.

536
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:42,540
This project is not going to be ruined.

537
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,940
This project,

538
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,340
no matter inside or outside,

539
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,140
is his own project.

540
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:58,140
I'm sorry, Yiheng.

541
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:05,740
I helped him manage the data and the results every day.

542
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,340
I'm not as good as you.

543
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,740
Very good.

544
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,620
Meng Jia,

545
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,860
you've come back?

546
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,540
Xiao Allen,

547
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,600
Of course

548
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,840
I will break him

549
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,180
To 치 disease

550
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,840
Poor

551
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,380
What am i

552
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,340
What am i

553
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,720
Don't fumble

554
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:31,140
Everyone dies

555
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,060
It's not big deal

556
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,540
Look at me

557
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,460
You're a good boy

558
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,260
You, I am

559
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,900
But it's always worth working hard.

560
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,060
We work hard

561
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,500
to make her more beautiful.

562
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,580
That's it.

563
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,620
It's okay.

564
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,820
Don't worry.

565
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,900
Don't worry.

566
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,700
Okay, stop.

567
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,420
Let go.

568
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,140
Slow down.

569
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,260
Brother Wang.

570
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,260
Well,

571
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,780
lend me your car.

572
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,500
Car?

573
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,900
You're not going to blackmail me

574
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,540
because I don't want you to sing here, right?

575
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,820
No, no.

576
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,740
I'll send the goods away.

577
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,100
I'll send the car back to you.

578
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:27,980
Goods?

579
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,980
What goods?

580
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,260
Brother Wang.

581
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,460
Brother Wang is so good.

582
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,140
Brother Wang, you're going to choke me to death.

583
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,260
Why are you so drunk?

584
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,940
You ordered the long-term ice tea.

585
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,460
I only ordered one cup.

586
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,300
You drank five cups.

587
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,860
Let's go back to the dorm.

588
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,700
It's two o'clock.

589
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,900
Why go back to the dorm?

590
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,420
How about

591
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,420
all of us go to my dorm?

592
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,500
You lead the way.

593
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,900
Okay, I'll drive.

594
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:06,660
I'll pull the car.

595
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,460
You press the button.

596
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,460
Okay, okay.

597
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,980
Li Xun, what are you doing?

598
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,500
Pulling the car.

599
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,740
Are you a cow?

600
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,980
Why do you pull the car?

601
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,700
Shut up.

602
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,540
It's so windy.

603
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,180
It's so windy.

604
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:54,740
Beyond the

605
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:03,860
Past

606
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,700
Are you awake?

607
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:09,860
Get down

608
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,700
on your toes if you're still awake.

609
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:14,260
You are my all

610
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,260
I am not a spirit

611
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,260
You think

612
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:23,260
I am just a joke to you

613
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,260
What

614
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,260
Don't be crazy

615
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,260
Sit down

616
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,260
You are not a spirit

617
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,260
You hold her

618
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,260
Then you drive well

619
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,260
Good job

620
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,260
Good job

621
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,260
Brother

622
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,260
I go to see the door

623
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,260
Arrived

624
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,260
Slow down

625
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,260
Take the bag

626
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,260
Ok

627
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,260
Slow down

628
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,260
Slow down

629
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,260
Sit down

630
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,260
Bring the bag

631
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,260
Ok

632
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,260
Cover it

633
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,260
Don't catch a cold

634
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,260
Oh my god

635
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,260
Come come

636
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,260
Drink some water

637
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,260
A little better

638
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,260
Where is this

639
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,260
This is my studio

640
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,260
The first floor

641
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,260
The second floor

642
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,260
This is my room

643
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,260
Where is Li Xun

644
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,260
Li Xun is in her room

645
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,260
She has her own room

646
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,260
Yes

647
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,260
Usually at the base

648
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,260
Sometimes late

649
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,260
She will come here

650
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,260
She is still sleeping at the base

651
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,260
No

652
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,260
She sleeps here

653
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,260
I forgot to tell you

654
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,260
She is my investor

655
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,260
You were quite curious

656
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,260
Our relationship

657
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,260
That's what I mean

658
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,260
She is my investor

659
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,260
I tell you

660
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,260
I have Li Xun's room

661
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,260
Is a suite

662
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,260
I only have this bed

663
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,260
So later

664
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,260
If you want to go to the toilet

665
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,260
You go out

666
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,260
You just go out this door

667
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,260
Turn right to the bottom

668
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,260
Ok

669
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,260
Then I'm going to sleep

670
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,260
I'll put the water here

671
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,260
Sleep a little longer

672
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,260
Heavy

673
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,260
Don't put it

674
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,260
Ok

675
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,260
Ok

676
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,260
Ok

677
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,260
Ok

678
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,260
Come

679
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,260
Get up

680
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,260
Let go

681
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,260
Let go

682
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,260
Come

683
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,260
Come

684
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,260
Come

685
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,260
Come

686
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,260
Come

687
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,260
Come

688
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,260
Come

689
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,260
She threw it away

690
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,260
This is not Ren Di's room

691
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,260
Go out

692
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,260
What are you doing

693
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,260
Can I help you

694
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,260
Can't help you

695
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,260
Let me see

696
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,260
None of your business

697
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,260
I'll sleep with you

698
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,260
Ok, shut up

699
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,260
I'm leaving

700
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,260
Not right

701
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,260
This project is all written

702
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,260
What does she write

703
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,260
lazy

704
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,260
No wonder

705
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,260
What are you doing again

706
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,260
You don't tell us

707
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,260
What are you doing

708
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,260
Shut up

709
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,260
What are you doing

710
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,260
Come and say

711
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,260
Shut up

712
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,260
I can't

713
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,260
Shut up

714
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,260
Tell me

715
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,260
Tell me

716
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,260
Shut up

717
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,260
Shut up

718
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,260
You drink a little wine

719
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,260
Like a crazy

720
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,260
Don't change the topic

721
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,260
What is it

722
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,260
You are so

723
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,260
All day long

724
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,260
What's up

725
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,260
Run back to the problem from morning to night

726
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,260
What is it

727
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,260
Are you awake now

728
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,260
I am awake now

729
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,260
Can do an exam right away

730
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,260
Ok

731
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,260
See for yourself

732
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,260
This system

733
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,260
Don't talk

734
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,260
I can see it myself

735
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,260
I can understand your code now

736
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,260
I won't die

737
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,260
You tell me

738
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,260
What are you doing

739
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,260
sell

740
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,260
sell

741
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,260
No wonder that website has expired

742
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,260
Can't earn money

743
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,260
I can't

744
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,260
I can't

745
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,260
I can't

746
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,260
I can't

747
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,260
I can't

748
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,260
I can't

749
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,260
Can't earn money

750
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,260
Can't earn money

751
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,260
Why don't you tell them

752
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,260
I tell them

753
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,260
What do i earn

754
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,260
There are so many shopping sites now

755
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,260
There are also many large platforms

756
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,260
The difficulty is self-sufficiency

757
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,260
There are no features on the website

758
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,260
Why should people buy

759
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,260
They can't even figure out their own advantages

760
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,260
Only know to follow up

761
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,260
Is money so easy to earn

762
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,260
Then you are in the line now

763
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,260
Mobile health app

764
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,260
Smart phone week

765
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,260
The app is the death

766
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,260
So you lie to me again

767
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,260
Didn't you say everywhere

768
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,260
I have two hands ready

769
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,260
But you guessed it right

770
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,260
It doesn't seem to be so much

771
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,260
Not really gone

772
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,260
Want me to let the resources

773
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,260
impossible

774
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,260
What we did before

775
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,260
All are useless

776
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,260
Then you can tell us

777
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,260
Let's do this app together

778
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,260
There are many ways to solve things

779
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,260
Although I can do better

780
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,260
You can also use this project

781
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,260
Processing

782
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,260
Increase experience

783
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,260
There is no need to waste time

784
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,260
When Zhang Xiaobei finds himself

785
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,260
I'm fooled

786
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,260
I will never be easily

787
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,260
Give up

788
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,260
I don't care about our dead flowers

789
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,260
Of course I worry

790
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,260
But you are too annoying

791
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,260
Love to be independent

792
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,260
Love to be self-sufficient

793
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,260
You don't miss me

794
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,260
When did I miss you

795
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,260
Zhou Yue

796
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,260
This matter is just the same

797
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,260
If you get angry again

798
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,260
I

799
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,260
Will I

800
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,260
I

801
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,260
I

802
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,260
Yixun

803
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,260
Play yinzhao, right

804
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,260
You were fired by Lin Yang Bajong

805
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,260
Punishment on the body

806
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,260
If you bow down to me now

807
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,260
It's too late

808
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,260
There is no point in dealing with me

809
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,260
I don't understand what you mean

810
