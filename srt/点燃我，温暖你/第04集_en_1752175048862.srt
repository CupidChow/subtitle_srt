YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if the light is very bright

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will still watch over that vast vast land

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless atmosphere

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day, the lens is a little bit yellow

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast night?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I burn up the night just for you to remember

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How everything was in the beginning

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The wind is like a wild grass

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The mountain is broken, but you are still by my side

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Everything is the original look

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The Long Ballad

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Episode 1

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You have been watching it for so long

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hello

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Shuyu

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Li Xun came to the morning self-study

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What?

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Where are you?

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What are you wearing?

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Mine

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Silly

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm sorry

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I think someone is trying to bother you

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,640
Let me

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Goodnt

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Let's mind the documentation

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You know it

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
She must not close that door

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'll follow back

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Okay

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
follows back

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I have been telling someone

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Where can I go with him?

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I don't know where to go

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,760
I won't go back to the dormitory

43
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,560
Then should I

44
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,680
go to the bathroom on the second floor?

45
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,280
Why are you nervous?

46
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,480
It's not an exam

47
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,320
Don't worry

48
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,400
Mr. Lin and I

49
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,920
are not here to teach you

50
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,520
We have something to announce

51
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,320
Yuxu, tell us

52
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,920
I applied to the college

53
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,880
to set up a digital practice base

54
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,800
This base is for students

55
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,280
Mr. Zhang will lead

56
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,360
Mr. Lin will be our instructor

57
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,200
This base

58
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,480
can be used as a second class

59
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,440
practice activity

60
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,240
It's a student of the elective class

61
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,960
During the base activity

62
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,840
you can avoid self-study

63
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,800
That's great

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,640
What did you help me persuade?

65
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,960
You ruined your self-study

66
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,760
Tang Yi gave it to someone

67
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,040
and left the pocket for himself

68
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,080
Be quiet

69
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,160
What's the problem?

70
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,560
Teacher

71
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,280
Can other professionals join?

72
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,760
Professional doesn't believe

73
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,520
I want to add something

74
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,640
Although I don't believe

75
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,120
I still have a way out

76
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,520
I need to pass the final exam

77
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,800
to get the score

78
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
You are new students

79
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,240
who just entered the university

80
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,600
You should focus on learning

81
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,280
and participate in social practice

82
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,880
Complete the task

83
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,840
and don't affect your studies

84
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,320
That's all

85
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,640
We should discuss it

86
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,400
after the class

87
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,240
Do you think Li Xun

88
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,080
is really interested in our group?

89
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,560
Li Xun

90
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,680
Chu Yin

91
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,080
You have a big opinion about me

92
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,520
Why don't you knock on the door?

93
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,200
I have to report to you

94
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,520
in my own dorm

95
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,440
I don't want to hit you

96
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,600
Then who do you want to hit?

97
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,160
You

98
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,240
How ugly is this?

99
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,400
It's so ugly

100
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,280
Look

101
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,720
Sorry

102
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,360
Yunyu is asleep

103
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,320
Li Xun

104
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,560
You hit her with your hand

105
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,640
You are so stupid

106
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,120
I will hit you too

107
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,480
I can't wake up early

108
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,840
I can't wake up early

109
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,080
I will die

110
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,280
I can't wake up early

111
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,600
I will go back to the new world

112
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,800
I can't wake up early

113
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,920
After thinking about it

114
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,280
Li Xun and I

115
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,440
are the same ugly

116
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,440
Chu Yin

117
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,960
You two are really

118
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,760
so stubborn

119
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,880
You should be careful

120
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,440
What should I be careful about?

121
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,360
Love and hate

122
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,200
Impossible

123
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,480
What should I do?

124
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,240
Come

125
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,800
Let's make an appointment another day

126
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,680
Ok?

127
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,280
Find one more person

128
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,040
Yes, call all the basketball team

129
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,360
It's raining

130
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,560
Men should play in the rain

131
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,000
Li Xun

132
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,280
I haven't seen you come out for activities

133
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,000
Let's play together

134
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,600
Hit the ball

135
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,640
Not interested

136
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,360
No

137
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,520
No

138
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,560
I am only good at

139
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,760
all sports

140
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:39,800
I know

141
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,520
Men

142
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,320
don't waste their physical strength

143
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,440
in meaningless places

144
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,400
Let's play together

145
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,120
Go

146
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,240
Li Xun

147
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,280
The establishment of the base today

148
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,000
You discussed it with Mr. Lin, right?

149
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,360
Is this related to you?

150
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,800
Mr. Lin should know

151
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,240
I organize an interest group

152
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,560
to let everyone learn from each other

153
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,040
communicate and improve together

154
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,640
You don't have to participate

155
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,280
You even set up a base yourself

156
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,000
You can add your academic score

157
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,200
Where did you get the policy advantage?

158
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,880
So this is what you think

159
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,760
I want to compete with you fairly

160
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,560
But you

161
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,160
You are openly oppressing us

162
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,800
We are all in college

163
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,920
It's useful to do this

164
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,400
Don't waste your time

165
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,000
I don't waste my time

166
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,680
Interest group waste their time

167
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,360
Won't the base waste their time?

168
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,400
You think too much

169
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,000
I mean

170
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,680
Don't waste your time competing with me

171
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,600
Li Xun

172
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,440
You set up your base

173
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,440
I set up my interest group

174
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,960
They are not interested in water

175
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,080
I don't occupy your place

176
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,680
You can't dig people from me

177
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,400
No

178
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,320
Li Bigixun

179
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,120
You shop for many opportunities

180
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,680
Shaoyong

181
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,000
Wouldn't you like to wear an events clothes?

182
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,800
Jewelry

183
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,040
Look

184
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,340
What do you say?

185
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,200
I made it with hemlock

186
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,440
It looks simplified

187
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,880
But it's not difficult

188
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,520
Let me show you the system integration

189
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,280
First, a Navin is constructed

190
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,040
It is based on an cake in the model

191
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,880
Which can help us

192
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,420
Reliant on user-friendly management projects

193
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,420
We just need to

194
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,420
set up a few parameters

195
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,420
to get a new project

196
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,420
with a perfect structure.

197
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,420
That's great, dear.

198
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,420
It's so short

199
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,420
and the structure is so clear.

200
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,420
By the way, Zhu Yuan,

201
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,420
I also checked the CCPPC.

202
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,420
The Chinese University Programming Design Competition.

203
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,420
There is a network competition every August.

204
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,420
We can't catch up this year.

205
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,420
Let's prepare for next year.

206
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,420
As long as we can win awards,

207
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,420
it will be very helpful for going abroad and maintaining the health.

208
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,420
And it can especially train people.

209
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,420
The University of Finance has considered so much.

210
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,420
They are planning for the future.

211
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,420
I'm used to it.

212
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,420
Zhu Wang,

213
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,420
do you know any talents?

214
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,420
I don't know anything.

215
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,420
Li Wei,

216
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,420
do you know any instruments?

217
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,420
No.

218
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,420
Piano?

219
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,420
No.

220
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,420
Piano?

221
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,420
Erhu?

222
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,420
No, monitor.

223
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,420
Can you take a break?

224
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,420
No.

225
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,420
This is a small group of people.

226
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,420
If you want to perform,

227
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,420
you can go somewhere else.

228
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,420
Shut up if you don't know anything.

229
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,420
I can make a song.

230
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,420
Can I go on stage?

231
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,420
All right, take a break.

232
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,420
You have cornered so many people in this small group.

233
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,420
I have to go.

234
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,420
People are so cruel.

235
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,420
No one is going to attend the Silver Star Gala.

236
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,420
Why is there no sense of honor

237
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,420
when you go to the university?

238
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,420
When we were in high school,

239
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,420
we were always competing for the participation.

240
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,420
We couldn't stop them.

241
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,420
When we were in the sports club,

242
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,420
there were so many people who signed up

243
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,420
for the 800 meters and 1000 meters.

244
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,420
When I was in the Gala,

245
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,420
I even said I looked like a good person.

246
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,420
You look like a good person.

247
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,420
You are talented.

248
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,420
Then you can talk to me.

249
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,420
How is that possible?

250
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,420
I can't get into the university.

251
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,420
Did you ask Yuan Di?

252
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,420
What do you think?

253
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,420
When we were in college,

254
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,420
we didn't fill in the student's information sheet.

255
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,420
You will know it later.

256
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,420
Are you going on a date?

257
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,420
I'm going to the hospital to accompany you.

258
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,420
Who are you accompanying?

259
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,420
Wu Muxin.

260
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,420
The people in our class,

261
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,420
the information sheet is filled with

262
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,420
the piano 10th grade, violin 9th grade.

263
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,420
The question is,

264
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,420
I haven't played for eight years,

265
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,420
and I haven't played for nine years.

266
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,420
They are all out of line.

267
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,420
Look at Wu Muxin.

268
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,420
She doesn't usually talk much.

269
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,420
She is good at traditional musical instruments.

270
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,420
She has participated in performances many times.

271
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,420
She is not an ideal person.

272
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,420
She just had a surgery after the surgery.

273
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,420
You let her go on stage?

274
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,420
People don't force themselves.

275
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,420
They don't know how much potential they have.

276
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,420
Let's go.

277
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,420
Wu Muxin.

278
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,420
Wu Muxin.

279
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,420
Monitor.

280
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,420
Why are you here?

281
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,420
Don't get up.

282
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,420
You can sit down.

283
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,420
How are you?

284
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,420
Are you okay?

285
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,420
I'm fine.

286
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,420
Wu Muxin.

287
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,420
You have been sick for several days.

288
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,420
I didn't come to see you.

289
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,420
I'm sorry.

290
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,420
No.

291
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,420
Monitor.

292
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,420
You are so busy with class.

293
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,420
I understand.

294
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,420
I'm fine by myself.

295
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,420
How is it?

296
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,420
Are you almost recovered?

297
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,420
Can you be discharged from the hospital?

298
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,420
Almost.

299
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,420
I had a surgery yesterday.

300
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,420
The doctor said

301
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,420
I can be discharged after the exhaust.

302
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,420
What is exhaust?

303
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,420
It's...

304
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,420
It's...

305
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,420
It's...

306
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,420
exhaust.

307
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,420
How can I be discharged?

308
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,420
You need to exercise more.

309
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,420
Okay.

310
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,420
Get up.

311
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,420
I'll help you exercise.

312
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,420
Now?

313
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,420
It's okay.

314
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,420
Let's walk again.

315
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,420
I told you.

316
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,420
You had a surgery.

317
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,420
Your family is not here.

318
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,420
Don't be polite.

319
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,420
I'll take care of them.

320
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,420
It's exhaust.

321
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,420
Can you be discharged

322
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,420
after exhaust?

323
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,420
I can be discharged after exhaust.

324
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,420
Don't worry, monitor.

325
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,420
I won't

326
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,420
delay the discharge rate of class.

327
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,420
I'll apply for discharge tomorrow.

328
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,420
It's okay.

329
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,420
Don't worry.

330
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,420
Just ask for a leave

331
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,420
if you have a sick leave.

332
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,420
Well, Wu Mengxing.

333
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,420
I think you are quite well-developed.

334
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,420
You can play traditional instruments

335
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,420
and perform many times.

336
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,420
What can you play?

337
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,420
Sonata.

338
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,420
Great.

339
00:13:54,420 --> 00:14:20,540
Sonata is the national

340
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,420
instrument.

341
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,420
It's okay.

342
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,420
We can talk about it next time.

343
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,420
It's late.

344
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,420
I'll go now.

345
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,420
Have a good rest.

346
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,420
Monitor, be careful.

347
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,420
Why didn't my dad teach me?

348
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,420
Gao,

349
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,420
this is the maven-e-lab

350
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,420
for web application.

351
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,420
It's easy

352
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,420
to handle.

353
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,420
It looks neat.

354
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,420
Didn't Mr. Lin say

355
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,420
the shorter the better?

356
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,420
Let's do this

357
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,420
and learn how to turn

358
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,420
web into desktop programs.

359
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,420
Fang Shumiao.

360
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,420
What about your program?

361
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,420
Fang Shumiao.

362
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,420
It's okay.

363
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:20,580
It's the best very good

364
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,380
Don't blame me

365
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,700
Hey, bro

366
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,280
Definitely my BI

367
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,220
Nice

368
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,620
This tea is heartless

369
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,460
When you need someone,

370
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,580
you should praise them.

371
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,300
You can just turn your back on them.

372
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,420
Fang Shumiao, you're quite a bad person.

373
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,740
Yu, I only have you.

374
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,660
Honey, I think this is really a good place to practice, right?

375
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,300
Yes.

376
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,140
Hello, everyone.

377
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,460
I'm Fang Shumiao from the computer department.

378
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,740
I'm Zhu Yun.

379
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,260
Today, we'll talk about our life.

380
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,580
We'll make fun of everyone.

381
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,220
Zhu Yun,

382
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,180
in front of so many people,

383
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,460
I have a question for you.

384
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,180
Go ahead.

385
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,500
You're not going to college?

386
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,580
You really don't know how to play?

387
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,780
We're not going to college now.

388
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,140
Thank you, everyone.

389
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,220
Oh, no.

390
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,460
Isn't it funny?

391
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,020
Everyone, start learning.

392
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,260
Don't waste your time.

393
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,620
What do you mean?

394
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,220
Chief Fang,

395
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,460
you can perform if you want.

396
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,900
We'll perform if you want.

397
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,860
You should do something serious.

398
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,860
No, you've heard it all.

399
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,580
You should say it out loud.

400
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,980
Do you want to hear the truth?

401
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,500
If you don't want to ruin our class,

402
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,180
don't go.

403
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,900
With this,

404
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,660
you might as well let Zhu Yun come back and touch your belly.

405
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,060
You're so bad.

406
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,860
This performance was very good.

407
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,040
What's the name of this performance?

408
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,380
You two went about this yourself, right?

409
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,300
I think it should be called

410
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,540
Body Mapper.

411
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,980
Li Xun,

412
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,380
don't give an advice but you hurt people.

413
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,060
You're not at the town hall.

414
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,300
If you have the time to bastards us,

415
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,940
then aren't you even functions staff at all?

416
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,620
I don't think someone like you

417
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,780
should be called Personal Interest Team.

418
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,820
Good many people

419
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:39,380
are in Guolement加加,

420
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,660
You're just spending time here.

421
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,300
If you go to college,

422
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,460
you'll be busy with useless things.

423
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,180
I suggest you to disband as soon as possible.

424
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,940
Don't waste your time and resources.

425
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,900
Yixun, we're all classmates.

426
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,740
You don't have to be so mean.

427
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,460
Yeah.

428
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,980
You look down on us.

429
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,140
You look down on us.

430
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,340
Why are you here?

431
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,220
Mr. Lin has already

432
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,780
assigned us a time base.

433
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,340
From now on,

434
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,940
this is ours.

435
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,540
Why?

436
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,940
She sent us a time base,

437
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,420
and allowed us to sleep on it.

438
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,700
We're scared to death

439
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,100
that we won this once.

440
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,420
What do you want?

441
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,180
Don't you remember

442
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,340
what院 park is like?

443
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,820
Salzburg.

444
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,620
Run to ring in the….

445
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,180
You stop!

446
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,940
It's great to be laughed at

447
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,540
by others

448
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,940
when you two are fighting.

449
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,620
I have the ability to be on stage.

450
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,060
Do you have the ability to come and see?

451
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,220
Are you inviting me?

452
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,260
Do you really want me to go?

453
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,860
Childish.

454
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,860
What are you laughing at?

455
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,500
If you are a single class cadres,

456
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,980
you will get 20 points.

457
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,740
If you are a good judge,

458
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,660
you will get 20 points.

459
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,100
If you are a social worker,

460
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,700
you will get 50 points.

461
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,060
If you have a related award,

462
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,500
you will get 50 points.

463
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,660
You haven't finished yet?

464
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,500
I just finished a part of it.

465
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,260
I'll send it to you.

466
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,140
Zhu Yu, stop writing.

467
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,260
I didn't report this show.

468
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,820
Let's open the window.

469
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,900
I'll do it myself.

470
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,180
It's just a show.

471
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,620
Yuanyuan, forget it.

472
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,420
No.

473
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,140
I have decided on this show.

474
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:56,820
Dr. C.

475
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,580
What is this paper plane for?

476
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,660
This is the theme of this new show.

477
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:05,900
Be careful.

478
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,740
Right.

479
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,340
The paper plane.

480
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,060
Wait for me.

481
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:11,860
Wait for me.

482
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,380
I have it.

483
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,340
Why is it so crowded?

484
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,300
This girl is good at playing the zither.

485
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,620
She is good at playing the zither.

486
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,740
Yes, she is pretty.

487
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,980
But I don't think I can win her heart.

488
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,660
She didn't ask you to.

489
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,340
Right.

490
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,540
This is my favorite book.

491
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,540
I have liked it since I was a child.

492
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,020
I like it.

493
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,060
Okay.

494
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:58,900
Come on.

495
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:37,860
Come on.

496
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,700
Thank you.

497
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,820
Thank you, everyone.

498
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,500
Actually, I want to give this song to a boy.

499
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,300
Although he just came.

500
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,900
Li Xun from the computer department.

501
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,900
Although you may not know me,

502
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,260
I have to say something today.

503
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,140
I

504
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:32,980
I

505
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,140
I have always liked you.

506
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,460
Wow.

507
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:41,900
What is this?

508
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,580
Li Xun is here.

509
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,780
He is here. He is on the stage.

510
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,580
Li Xun is so good.

511
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,700
He just left that girl there.

512
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,900
He said I was good.

513
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,700
You are not.

514
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,100
Zhu Yu.

515
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,580
Li Xun is here.

516
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,620
I can't let him go.

517
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,300
I will die.

518
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,940
It seems that the girl who studies music

519
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,700
is really extraordinary.

520
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,260
She is passionate.

521
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,420
She is so brave and direct

522
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,300
to express her feelings.

523
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,780
So next,

524
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:17,340
let's welcome the first class of computer class,

525
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,540
Zhu Yu.

526
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,820
She will perform the mouth-to-mouth show.

527
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,180
Let's welcome her.

528
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,300
Wow.

529
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:28,900
Zhu Yu. Zhu Yu. Zhu Yu. Zhu Yu. Zhu Yu.

530
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,060
Hello, everyone.

531
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,220
I am Zhu Yu, the first class of computer class.

532
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,860
I have never liked my gender since I was a child.

533
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,300
Everyone knows that

534
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,860
a girl, no matter how beautiful she looks,

535
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,860
as long as her gender is related to animals,

536
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,700
she will never be able to

537
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,940
have any children.

538
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,900
My father adores me.

539
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,780
He has encouraged me since I was a child.

540
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,500
He even gave me a very cute nickname

541
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,100
called Little Piggy.

542
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,460
I am so happy.

543
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,660
I am so happy.

544
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,740
It's called Little Piggy.

545
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,540
So cute.

546
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,340
So cute.

547
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,860
He said, Little Piggy,

548
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,420
no matter what you want,

549
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,420
I will do my best to give it to you.

550
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,060
I said, really, father?

551
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,380
I want to have a dog.

552
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,780
He said, get lost.

553
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,780
Don't even think about it.

554
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,900
Later, when I came to school,

555
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,660
I was very happy.

556
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:22,580
Because there are single dogs everywhere in school.

557
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,340
Happy birthday.

558
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,940
Happy birthday.

559
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,940
Happy birthday.

560
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,620
Happy birthday.

561
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,940
One day,

562
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,860
I met a very strong wild dog

563
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,660
near the medical school.

564
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,820
It was a golden-haired dog.

565
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,620
It is said that it is very smart

566
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,700
and is a reliable material.

567
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,980
I decided to adopt it right away.

568
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,700
And I won't raise it.

569
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,540
First,

570
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:51,100
I want to have a dog-like man.

571
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,660
The chef of my medical school said

572
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,540
I wanted the dog at the door.

573
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,380
The chef came out with the idea.

574
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,700
He asked me whether I wanted to have a dog or a man.

575
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,100
I said no.

576
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,460
I want to send it to school

577
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,820
and let it be a man.

578
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,180
The uncle was very disgusted with me.

579
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,940
He said, little girl,

580
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,420
are you sick?

581
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,340
It doesn't matter if it's sick or not.

582
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,460
Anyway, I will raise this dog.

583
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,100
I decided to take it to the morning self-study first.

584
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,500
I asked it with a little hair.

585
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,180
Little hair,

586
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,940
do you want to go to school?

587
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,820
Do you think the morning self-study is useful?

588
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,940
Three chances.

589
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,420
I will go to the morning self-study before I die.

590
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,860
Oh, no.

591
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,340
It bit me on the head.

592
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,860
You are so fake.

593
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,900
I thought about it while I was playing the dog-like man.

594
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,700
Did I touch it in the wrong way?

595
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,420
I went to find it the next day.

596
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,740
Can I play the dog-like man?

597
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,820
Can it play the dog-like man vaccine?

598
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,100
Are you afraid to call it?

599
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,820
No.

600
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,820
Is this a virus?

601
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,900
The third time,

602
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,100
I brought it to the skewer.

603
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,340
Except for your fashion,

604
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,780
you have to wear a perfume.

605
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,500
My phone is not here.

606
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,500
Open the door.

607
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,940
Hello, Zhu Yi is busy now.

608
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,500
Okay.

609
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,020
It's the same as everyone thought.

610
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,340
It not only ate my skewer,

611
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,180
but also bit the dog.

612
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:39,540
This dog is a real dog.

613
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,020
In order to achieve my goal,

614
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,420
I will brainwash it

615
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:48,260
in the next plan.

616
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,620
From now on,

617
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,260
I will call it every day.

618
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,220
Genius,

619
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,260
God,

620
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,620
Master.

621
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,900
It seems to understand me.

622
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,220
When you call it a master,

623
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:01,180
it will be so happy.

624
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,820
From now on,

625
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,220
everyone knows that

626
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,060
there is a golden hair

627
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,860
in the computer.

628
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,860
It's called a master.

629
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,020
It seems to understand me.

630
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,820
After all,

631
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,740
I have paid so much for it.

632
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,660
I decided to use the last hope

633
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,660
to brainwash it.

634
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,860
But it still doesn't understand me.

635
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,700
I am angry right now.

636
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,780
I think it's better to raise it

637
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,980
than to have a skewer.

638
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,140
I can kill it.

639
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:43,900
I was so angry that

640
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,140
I asked the chef to take it away.

641
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,620
But I thought about it.

642
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,140
It's a dog's life after all.

643
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,820
I have to save it.

644
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,660
I rushed to the canteen

645
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,860
and pushed the door.

646
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,700
I found that this golden hair

647
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,140
was in the pot.

648
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,860
It turned into a color.

649
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,460
It turned out to be a little dog.

650
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,340
It just fell into the gas can

651
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,980
and dyed it with durian yellow.

652
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,020
It finally appeared.

653
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,980
The chef thought

654
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,100
it was just a little dog.

655
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,140
But this little dog

656
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,820
was already in a state of shock.

657
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,820
It was so loud

658
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,940
when it heard this.

659
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,860
Who are you scolding?

660
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,420
Who is this little dog?

661
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,700
I am the champion.

662
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,500
Thank you, everyone.

663
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,700
I am Zhu Yun.

664
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,220
Good.

665
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:28,140
Good.

666
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,380
Good.

667
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,500
I think it's a little dog.

668
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,340
Hi, students.

669
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,380
You must have never thought

670
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,900
I am a new student.

671
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,580
Yes.

672
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,460
I don't know.

673
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,420
What are they doing?

674
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,980
What are they doing?

675
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,420
Little Piggy.

676
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:04,260
I didn't expect you to be so concerned about me.

677
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:04,980
You don't have to be so

678
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:09,780
concerned about me in the future.

679
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,860
We can be together openly.

680
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,540
Little Piggy.

681
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:17,220
Little Piggy.

682
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:30,500
Good.

683
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,460
If love has some temperature

684
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:38,300
This dream will be pushed out

685
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,500
After waking up, I want you to look at me

686
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,740
Don't go

687
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,340
Fate is not a map

688
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:49,260
Grab my hand

689
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:53,100
The soul is flickering

690
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,940
You are my everything

691
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,860
Why do you care

692
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,860
I care about you too much

693
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,420
Good.

694
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,460
You are up.

695
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,780
You were thinking about your phone.

696
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,420
I have been exposed.

697
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,260
What does it matter?

698
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,900
The forum is on the top.

699
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,540
You are so popular.

700
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,940
Little Piggy.

701
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:40,260
I didn't expect you to be so concerned about me.

702
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,460
Be honest.

703
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,780
When did you get together with Li Xun?

704
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,820
You still have the nerve to say that

705
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,380
I'm not for you, Mr. Ying Yong?

706
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,540
You really are Mr.

707
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,740
Fang Shu Miao.

708
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,460
Believe it or not, I'll hit you.

709
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,980
I'm not talking about you.

710
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,260
I'm talking about you.

711
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,620
I'm not talking about you.

712
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,820
I'm not talking about you.

713
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,980
I'm not talking about you.

714
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,980
I'm not talking about you.

715
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,980
I'm not talking about you.

716
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,460
As the old saying goes,

717
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,380
love is a fight.

718
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,660
If you don't like Li Xun

719
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,340
a little bit,

720
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,660
why do you care about him so much?

721
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,340
Okay, I'm wrong.

722
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,420
Go to the bathroom and brush your teeth.

723
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,940
There are still guests in the bathroom.

724
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,380
I'll go to the bathroom.

725
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,300
I was so confused yesterday that I forgot to wash my face.

726
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,340
Fang Shu Miao.

727
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,500
If I go out now,

728
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,980
will anyone recognize me?

729
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,740
Do you really think you are

730
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,620
the heroine of the star gossip?

731
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,620
You're so beautiful.

732
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,220
Everyone is just watching the fun.

733
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,620
No one will recognize you after you go out.

734
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,340
Not bad.

735
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,780
I heard you took Li Xun.

736
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,340
No way.

737
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,060
People who don't go back to school for a week

738
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:51,980
will know it.

739
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,620
Fang Shu Miao, go to the bathroom with me.

740
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,860
No one will recognize you

741
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,260
if you don't wear clothes.

742
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,540
Going back to the bathroom

743
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,900
will make the entire school empread around you.

744
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,940
Did you see the video I posted yesterday?

745
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,900
The girl who was on the nightclub

746
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,860
confessed her feelings.

747
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,060
I even went to see her secretly.

748
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,380
But the male lead didn't confess.

749
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,620
The video is so sweet.

750
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,540
And the guy is really handsome.

751
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,300
He seems to be famous.

752
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,420
His name is Li Xun, right?

753
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,860
He even used the low-pitched gun

754
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,100
to call the pig.

755
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,420
So vulgar.

756
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,220
The love story of the pig and the wild dog.

757
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,060
So sweet.

758
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,380
I'm so thirsty.

759
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,100
I forgot to bring my school card.

760
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:00,820
Let me look for it.

761
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,180
Excuse me,

762
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,460
I need your school card.

763
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,060
I didn't bring it either.

764
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,820
Whose is this?

765
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,420
Zhu Yin.

766
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,580
Isn't she the girl

767
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,820
who confessed her feelings?

768
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:15,820
It seems to be her.

769
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,820
I don't know her.

770
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:17,980
Is it hot?

771
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,460
It's okay.

772
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,860
Why are you so rude?

773
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,500
She recognized you.

774
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,540
Why did you run away?

775
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,780
I was found lying on the spot.

776
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,180
How could I not run away?

777
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:31,900
marsala

778
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,140
cows

779
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,940
This's no one I can trust.

780
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,220
Suddenly I ran away projected like a drone.

781
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,020
What are you doing?

782
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,620
I'll give the newspaper right now.

783
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,980
Why don't you invite some journalists?

784
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,780
Why don't you open an Schong theta talk?

785
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,820
How is it?

786
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,140
The important statement is that

787
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,140
everything that happened at the last party

788
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,580
was just the stage effect.

789
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,060
I'm still single.

790
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,820
Gao is right.

791
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,300
We still need time for this major.

792
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,220
If we rush, we won't learn anything.

793
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,220
Attention!

794
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,040
Attention!

795
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,660
Attention!

796
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,660
Yesterday was just a part of my performance.

797
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,180
In order to show our performance.

798
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,100
I don't like Li believing

799
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,380
that I couldn't be with her.

800
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,380
Are you satisfied now?

801
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,420
Really?

802
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,780
Look at my earlier testimony

803
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,020
making it clear on Resignation.

804
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,420
I shouldn't have made you angry.

805
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,860
Zhu Yu, you liar!

806
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,260
Is Li Xun really Li Xun?

807
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,540
Doesn't he need these software?

808
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,860
He's willing to do anything to make fun of me.

809
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,660
Dear teachers and students,

810
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,660
this is Nanhu University's broadcast station.

811
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,820
I'm Yuan Xiaoyun.

812
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,260
Good afternoon, everyone.

813
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,820
This afternoon, I'll be bringing you

814
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,260
a speech program.

815
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,340
If you have anything to say

816
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,700
or have any concerns,

817
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,580
feel free to

818
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,060
post your thoughts on our

819
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,300
Weibo account.

820
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,620
Now,

821
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,780
I'll play a song for you.

822
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,420
Zhu Yun?

823
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:47,780
Xiao Zhu Zhu?

824
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,100
Xiaoyun, I want to post a speech.

825
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,220
Hello, everyone.

826
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,100
I have a special speech.

827
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,980
The speaker is sitting next to me.

828
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,580
He's Zhu Yun from Class 1, Computer Science.

829
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:57,740
Recently,

830
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,700
something has been bothering him.

831
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,020
He wants to make a statement

832
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,380
on our broadcast station.

833
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:05,820
Hello, everyone.

834
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,020
I'm Zhu Yun from Class 1, Computer Science.

835
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,300
At yesterday's silver star party,

836
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,780
I performed a tongue-tied show on behalf of our class.

837
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,740
But at the end of the tongue-tied show,

838
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,380
there was a small interlude

839
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,580
that made everyone misunderstand

840
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,380
my relationship with Li Xun.

841
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,900
I want to make it clear that

842
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,020
Li Xun is just my performance guest.

843
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,420
We don't have any personal relationship.

844
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,500
I hope you don't misunderstand.

845
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,260
I'm taking your time.

846
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,020
Thank you.

847
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,700
Zhu Yun's statement is really effective.

848
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,260
Someone was chasing me

849
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,420
at the student council.

850
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,060
Is Li Xun single again?

851
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,620
Congratulations, Xiao Zhu Zhu.

852
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,820
You're finally going to be a man.

853
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,620
Yes.

854
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,660
I don't care.

855
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,180
I'm free anyway.

856
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,300
Fang Shumiao,

857
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,180
Xiao Zhu Zhu will be on the air in the future.

858
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,380
Especially you.

859
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,820
You mentioned Zi Hong.

860
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,540
It's strange.

861
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,060
Besides good grades,

862
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,540
Li Xun has a lot of outstanding qualities.

863
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,500
The good girls

864
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,500
are all the best in the future.

865
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,740
Just because of the personality of Samart?

866
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,060
Zhu Yun,

867
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,340
you're right to take him on stage.

868
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,740
Look.

869
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,260
It's me,

870
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,300
a female drug addict.

871
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,100
We are just simply vamos bowing to each other.

872
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,340
So circles of meat.

873
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,380
Yang Keyao.

874
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,220
Please Camp me.

875
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,380
Man,

876
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,660
will you really

877
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,900
get your hair dyed?

878
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,060
That's all for today.

879
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,060
Class dismissed.

880
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,500
Let's talk.

881
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,060
It's not good to talk here.

882
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,660
You're making a fuss.

883
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,900
I want to talk to you in person.

884
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,660
Let's go out and talk.

885
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,660
What do you mean?

886
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,420
Just talk here.

887
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,420
I'll finish in a few words.

888
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,260
In front of so many people?

889
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:44,940
You...

890
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:45,420
Say it.

891
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,420
Why are you saying that

892
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,260
in front of my grandpa?

893
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,420
What?

894
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,220
Forget it.

895
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,900
You can't cooperate with me

896
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,220
and explain it to everyone.

897
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,860
We're not in that kind of relationship.

898
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,700
Why?

899
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,060
What? Why?

900
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,420
Since we're not in that kind of relationship,

901
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,460
why should I help you?

902
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,660
You're happy to be seen like this by everyone, right?

903
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,060
Yes.

904
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,460
Who is your guest?

905
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,660
Have you asked me?

906
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,260
Li Xu, what's wrong with your hair?

907
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,380
Is it because of what you said to me?

908
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,060
If my words

909
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,620
have caused you to apologize,

910
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,740
then we can

911
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,220
make it clear together.

912
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,020
You're really careful and cute.

913
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,060
So?

914
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,660
Give me another statement.

915
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,580
Do you know that there's a word

916
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,180
called the darker the night?

917
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,580
You're the darker the night now.

918
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,820
Completely dark.

919
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,860
You're the darker the night.

920
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,260
You're the darker the night.

921
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,860
You're the darker the night.

922
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,340
You're the darker the night.

923
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,460
Hello, teacher.

924
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,260
Hello, teacher.

925
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:57,740
Li Xu.

926
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,820
You've combed your hair back.

927
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,540
It looks much more comfortable.

928
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,220
Didn't you say

929
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:06,980
not to be so picky?

930
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,740
Yes.

931
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,060
Does it look much more comfortable?

932
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:11,540
Good.

933
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,260
I'll say it again.

934
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,660
I'm not your guest.

935
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,020
I have no obligation to cooperate with you.

936
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,540
I have no obligation to cooperate with you.

937
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:24,980
Thank you everyone!

938
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,720
We are Qing Thai Chinese.

939
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,500
We have prepared a very interesting club for the graduates.

940
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:45,920
I'm very grateful that due to the

941
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,140
complication

942
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,540
or in short

943
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,220
cą prospit

944
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:50,240
or

945
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,240
get

946
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,020
fly

947
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:52,620
away

948
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,620
We are the Qing Tong band.

949
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,980
How is it?

950
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,500
I don't understand.

951
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,500
Do you agree?

952
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,060
What's the benefit to me?

953
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,060
You invested in us,

954
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,380
you're our boss.

955
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,380
After the band, you'll have your shares.

956
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,580
You're buying shares?

957
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,380
After the band, you'll have your profits.

958
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,380
I'll return the back rate you promised.

959
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,540
Okay.

960
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,660
It's a deal.

961
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,820
It's a deal.

962
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,100
Do you want to pay the deposit today?

963
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,860
Deal.

964
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:22,820
Boss Yu,

965
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,260
you can order whatever you want.

966
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,260
I'll make you a meal today.

967
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,180
Why are you here?

968
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,500
It's uncomfortable.

969
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,900
Is our singing that bad?

970
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,540
Don't misunderstand.

971
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,460
I'll vote for sure.

972
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,740
I just don't want to waste time.

973
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,540
Wasting time listening to our songs?

974
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,500
You won't waste time if you vote for this?

975
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,020
Please respect the source of your money.

976
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,700
You're earning so much money

977
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,980
by this?

978
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,020
Why are you still in the music school?

979
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,740
I would have quit if I were you.

980
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:05,300
Anyway, you don't teach self-study

981
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,180
and don't teach homework.

982
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,140
I don't teach homework and don't teach self-study

983
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,020
because these things

984
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,460
are too simple for me.

985
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,780
I don't want to do useless things.

986
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,260
I got an actual base.

987
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,980
You can come here.

988
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,940
I applied for this school

989
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,060
to get more points

990
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,580
and to avoid self-study.

991
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:24,540
It's useful for you.

992
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,580
You got your hair back

993
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:27,860
because of this?

994
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,580
I have to give Mr. Lin some respect.

995
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,140
Oh my god.

996
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,740
A thousand years of iron tree has blossomed.

997
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,900
Li Xun is going to be a good boy now.

998
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,380
I thought you were

999
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,660
stimulated by the pregnancy.

1000
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,320
ę

1001
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:11,260
The bases of you

1002
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,460
are influencing the plucked teach group greatly.

1003
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:15,500
You C value this classroom very much.

1004
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,100
Don't make it a big deal.

1005
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,660
How can you look down on others?

1006
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:53,660
We will not be separated

1007
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:56,660
Get out of the noisy world

1008
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:02,660
Accompany me, you are the point of my palm

1009
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:06,660
Raise me up bravely

1010
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:12,660
Like the flame of the night

1011
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:20,660
Because I believe I love you

1012
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:24,660
True love will take its course

1013
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:28,660
I'm by your side

1014
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:33,660
Spending a long time with you

1015
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:38,660
Because I believe I want you

1016
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:42,660
True love will take its course

1017
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:47,660
That burning fire

1018
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:56,660
Always you are the only one for me

1019
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:13,660
It's the sense of dream

1020
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:18,660
Overcoming the obstacles

1021
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:21,660
A night of attention

1022
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:27,660
Then I won the world for me

1023
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:32,660
Always wither, never stop

1024
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:36,660
I'm by your side

1025
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,660
Only a little bit brave

1026
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:41,660
Every dream I have

1027
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:49,660
I will not lose to the world again

1028
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:53,660
Because I believe I love you

1029
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:58,660
True love will take its course

1030
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:03,660
I'm by your side

1031
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:07,660
Spending a long time with you

1032
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:11,660
Because I believe I want you

1033
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:16,660
True love will take its course

1034
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:20,660
That burning fire

1035
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:31,660
Always you are the only one for me

1036
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:36,660
Because I believe I love you

1037
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:40,660
True love will take its course

1038
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:45,660
I'm by your side

1039
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:49,660
Spending a long time with you

1040
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:53,660
Because I believe I want you

1041
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:58,660
True love will take its course

1042
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:02,660
That burning fire

1043
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:11,660
Always you are the only one for me

1044
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:20,660
That burning fire

1045
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:27,660
Always you are the only one for me

1046
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:32,660
True love will take its course
