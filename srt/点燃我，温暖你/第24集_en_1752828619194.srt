YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if the light is very bright

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will still watch over that vast vast land

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless atmosphere

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day, the lens is a little bit yellow

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast night?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I burn up the night just for you to remember

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How everything was in the beginning

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The wind and the color of the night are like wild grass

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The mountains are broken, but you are still by my side

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Everything is how it was in the beginning

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The Long Ballad

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Episode 2

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What's up?

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Gao Jianghong sent Li Xun to get the drugs

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Aren't they good friends?

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What kind of relationship can't be trusted in the end?

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Brother Xiuzhu, can you do me a favor?

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Say it

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Although we agreed to come back this time

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
No matter what, I will be with you

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Say it

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Although we agreed to come back this time

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No matter what, I will be with you

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Just say yes

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But you may have to drive back to Lingyang alone

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And then?

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And then you may have to eat alone with my parents

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Ok

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Then I will eat with uncle and aunt

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Tell them about our experience these two days

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Tell them how you met Li Xun

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And then talk about the L.P. company

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Finally I will tell them

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The key to your return

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You just help me to get some time

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I will come back after I finish the thing

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What else do you deal with?

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You still want to see him?

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Li Xun and I have ended

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
He left the key

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's what he wanted to tell me

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He wants to keep this relationship

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Where it should be forgotten

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What's left between you two?

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This company is our dream

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I can't leave L.P. alone

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I have to see Li Xun again

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You are so nice

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You are lying

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You are so vulgar

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You are so self-righteous

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
People jump into the pit

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
They will always think of some

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Reasons to be happy

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You can scold me

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's better to scold myself

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I said my prediction was accurate

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You agreed?

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
No

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Think about it

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You let me eat with uncle and aunt

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's a red-card

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I can't go to eat with them

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's a red-card

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
If my mom knows

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
She will be at the door of the room tomorrow morning

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You can think about it

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Tomorrow morning

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Aunt will call me

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
She will come to kill me

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What should I do?

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What should I do?

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I will tell aunt

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Aunt, a friend came to see me

82
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
She came back from abroad

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I will take you to see her

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I have to be there for two days

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Great

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's called force

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You call

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You call

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We meet again

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Deng Lun

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Is this, cup?

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
This is the Internet conference

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Not fan gathering

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You are so small

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You don't know

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The fans now went crazy

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Those bastard will come?

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Internet Conference

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's the most important

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,400
As long as they come, Li Xun will definitely leave.

101
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,400
Thank you.

102
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,200
This way.

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,400
The contact information and address are on the top.

104
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,200
It's all in the program. Take a look.

105
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,000
Hello, hello.

106
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,400
This is the address.

107
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,400
The address is...

108
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
This is the address.

109
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,400
The address is...

110
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,400
This is the address.

111
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,400
The address is...

112
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,000
Hello, everyone. This is my business card.

113
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,600
Take a look.

114
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,000
Let me introduce myself.

115
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,200
I am a sales executive of Zhaoyang Network.

116
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,800
My name is Hong Xiaowei.

117
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,200
I'm sorry, I don't have a business card.

118
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,600
It's okay. What do you do?

119
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm a programmer.

120
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,400
A programmer?

121
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,400
That's great. Take a look.

122
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,200
This is our product.

123
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,000
It helps college students to get a job.

124
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,200
A part-time job?

125
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,600
Sister, since you're a programmer,

126
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,600
can you help me see how our software can improve?

127
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,400
I think the current function can be more perfect.

128
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,600
Now there's only a simple job introduction and contact information.

129
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,200
Maybe we can add value assessment.

130
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,000
And now the users can only search for their jobs.

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,200
I think we can recommend them based on their strengths and strengths.

132
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,200
But do you have records of the users' search history?

133
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,800
That's a waste.

134
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,400
The real data is the most valuable resource.

135
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,200
You need to know the needs of each user in a short time.

136
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,400
Finish it slowly.

138
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,800
The starting point of this software is good.

139
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
The market demand is also big.

140
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,400
Not bad. I can't tell at all.

141
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,000
Sister, what about you? Do you have any suggestions?

142
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,600
Me?

143
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,600
My suggestion is

144
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,800
to change the name.

145
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,200
It sounds not so good.

146
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,800
Maybe it'll be better to change the name.

147
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
That makes sense.

148
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,000
Let's do it step by step.

149
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
When the number of users is more, the advertisers will come.

150
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'll do my best.

151
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,600
You're so good.

152
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,000
I envy you.

153
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,800
Who's Xiaojian?

154
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,400
Wait a minute.

155
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,600
Guo Erjie.

156
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,200
Come here.

157
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,400
This is my boyfriend.

158
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,200
We just graduated from college today.

159
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,200
He works several jobs alone.

160
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,800
Xiaojian is the project of our joint start-up.

161
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,200
Yes.

162
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,200
But his main job is in the company of the Internet.

163
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,600
My new company.

164
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,000
My new company.

165
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,800
He's the art director.

166
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,200
But everyone likes to call him Xiaojian.

167
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,800
Hello.

168
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,600
Hello.

169
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,800
This sister is a programmer. She's great.

170
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,600
Sister is a programmer?

171
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,600
Our company is recruiting programmers.

172
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,800
You can know her.

173
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,200
My business card.

174
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,800
Your company's art director is here.

175
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
We have four people in our company.

176
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,000
We're the bosses.

177
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,200
We just started.

178
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,200
Sister.

179
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,800
Have we met you somewhere?

180
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,000
Sorry. We have an event later.

181
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
We'll go first.

182
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,600
Let's go.

183
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,200
Okay.

184
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,000
If you're interested in our company,

185
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,600
contact me anytime.

186
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,400
You can contact us.

187
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,600
Young people are so nice.

188
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,000
Who says not?

189
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,200
We stand at the right place.

190
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,600
Anyone can do it.

191
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,800
Hello. Which company are you?

192
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
LP.

193
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,800
Please register here.

194
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,800
Okay.

195
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,000
Give it to me.

196
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,000
Okay.

197
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Dear guests.

198
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,600
Welcome to the 14th Internet Conference.

199
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,200
At this moment,

200
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,000
we invite the model of our Internet celebrity,

201
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Miss Luna

202
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,600
and Mr. Gao Jianhong.

203
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
Welcome.

204
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,800
Next is the photo session.

205
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,600
Please look at the front camera.

206
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,000
We'll leave the time for you.

207
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,400
Luna, look here.

208
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,000
This is Gao Jianhong's wife.

209
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,400
Please take a picture of us.

210
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,200
Xinning.

211
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
She...

212
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,000
She is Xulina.

213
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,000
Xulina has been

214
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,800
with her for a long time.

215
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,600
Why did she marry Gao Jianhong?

216
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,000
The venue is ready.

217
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,800
Please take a break at the venue.

218
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,800
Thank you.

219
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,000
Okay.

220
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,200
Dear guests.

221
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,000
LP.

222
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,600
LP.

223
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Power.

224
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
At this moment,

225
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,800
we look forward to

226
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,600
the live broadcast of the 14th Internet Conference.

227
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,400
You can come with me.

228
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,200
Okay.

229
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
This way.

230
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,800
I saw Mr. Li.

231
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Mr. Zhang.

232
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
Mr. Zhang.

233
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,800
Mr. Gao, bye.

234
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,200
Mr. Gao.

235
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,400
Hello, Mr. Gao.

236
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
Hello.

237
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,600
Long time no see.

238
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,800
Okay, everyone.

239
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,800
Next,

240
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,800
we invite

241
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,400
the vice president of LP,

242
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,600
Mr. Feng Zhijin,

243
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
to come up to the stage and talk.

244
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,000
Please give him a round of applause.

245
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,200
Hello, everyone.

246
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,800
I'm the CTO of LP,

247
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,200
Feng Zhijin.

248
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,600
For Chinese games,

249
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,800
the coming year

250
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,200
is a year of value

251
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,000
and worth reflecting.

252
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,200
Why didn't you say it?

253
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,200
Then we have to chase

254
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,600
the early days of the past.

255
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,800
We all chase

256
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,200
the past.

257
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,600
We all chase

258
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,800
the past.

259
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,000
We all chase

260
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,200
the past.

261
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,400
We all chase

262
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,800
the data and the future.

263
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,200
And now,

264
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,600
the industry has put its eyes

265
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,800
on the social value of the industry.

266
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,200
How can the company and the industry

267
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,400
have a longer development?

268
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,000
With the relationship

269
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,800
between our life

270
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,200
and the game

271
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,600
getting closer and closer,

272
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,400
the game is not only

273
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,800
limited to a simple

274
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,000
entertainment and creative culture.

275
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,400
Sir, he is a

276
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,400
new education tool.

277
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,400
I'm sorry, sir.

278
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,400
Please cooperate with our work.

279
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,400
In 2018,

280
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
the first season of the game

281
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,400
is the first season of the game.

282
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,200
You can't sit here.

283
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,400
He let many users

284
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,200
have the programming knowledge.

285
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,600
Let many users

286
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,400
complete the programming

287
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,600
and master the programming.

288
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
Okay.

289
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,200
In the school's environment,

290
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,800
there are four modes.

291
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,800
I remember that Sony's CCO

292
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,200
has considered it.

293
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,200
How many?

294
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,400
Count it.

295
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,600
So...

296
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,400
What?

297
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,800
is to learn

298
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,800
to learn some kind of

299
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,800
knowledge.

300
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,800
I want all of you.

301
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,800
What do you want me to give you?

302
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Not to give,

303
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,800
but to return.

304
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,200
You still have one chance.

305
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,800
I'll ask you one last time.

306
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
Do you agree?

307
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
Li Xue,

308
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,800
are you crazy?

309
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,800
If you regret now,

310
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,600
I'll consider letting you go.

311
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's the same no matter how many times I ask.

312
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
If a person is not self-aware

313
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
to this point,

314
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,400
it's a little ridiculous.

315
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,000
The name LP

316
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,600
is not suitable for you.

317
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,600
From today,

318
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,600
I want to get the LP back.

319
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,400
You even came to tell me.

320
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,600
Li Xue,

321
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I've been waiting for this day.

322
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,400
I'm very lucky.

323
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,800
This competition

324
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,200
is after graduation.

325
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,200
This way,

326
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,800
I won't have to fight and make a fuss.

327
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,800
I want to see

328
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,200
how you can get the name of LP

329
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,200
back.

330
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,200
So I believe

331
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,400
the Chinese game

332
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,000
can be played in the future.

333
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm from my new Internet network company.

334
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,200
We recruit programmers.

335
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,600
Do you want to know more?

336
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,000
What?

337
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,800
You found a new company so quickly?

338
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,200
That's right.

339
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,000
Your resume is half-finished.

340
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,400
It's good that they don't dislike you.

341
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,000
You have no right to dislike others.

342
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,000
I'll contact you.

343
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,200
Okay.

344
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,000
Call me anytime.

345
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
There's a business card here.

346
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,400
Please have a look.

347
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,200
If you need it,

348
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,600
you can find me.

349
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Goodbye.

350
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,000
Hello, this is...

351
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,800
You're still the same as before.

352
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,400
You want to do something, you do it.

353
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,600
You're the same as before.

354
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,200
You can't see far.

355
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,000
By the way,

356
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,600
Zhu Ying came to see me.

357
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,600
You didn't expect it, right?

358
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,000
I didn't expect it either.

359
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,000
She's still the same as before.

360
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,600
Even if she's against the whole world,

361
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,800
she'll still stand by your side.

362
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,800
This is between the two of us.

363
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Stay away from her.

364
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,800
You used to say this and that.

365
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,600
Today, for the sake of the old classmate,

366
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,000
I'll also advise you.

367
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,600
You have to be honest.

368
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,800
With your current status,

369
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,400
it's hard to find a job.

370
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,000
Do you want me to help you?

371
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,600
You're different from before.

372
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,400
You can't climb the mountain

373
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,800
by yourself.

374
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
Gao Jianhong,

375
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,200
remember this.

376
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,000
I never need to climb the mountain.

377
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,600
Wherever I am,

378
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,200
there's a mountain top.

379
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,200
Gao Jianhong,

380
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,000
you're not alone.

381
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,200
You're the only one who can help me.

382
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,800
I'm not alone.

383
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm with you.

384
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
I'm with you.

385
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,600
I'm with you.

386
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,800
I'm with you.

387
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm with you.

388
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
I'm with you.

389
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
I'm with you.

390
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,600
I'm with you.

391
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,800
I'm with you.

392
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm with you.

393
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
I'm with you.

394
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,400
I'm with you.

395
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
I'm with you.

396
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,800
I'm with you.

397
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm with you.

398
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,200
I'm with you.

399
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,400
I'm with you.

400
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,600
I'm with you.

401
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,800
I'm with you.

402
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
I'm with you.

403
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
I'm with you.

404
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,800
I'm with you.

405
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,800
I'm with you.

406
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm with you.

407
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
I'm with you.

408
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,800
Li Xun took the company on the business card we just met,

409
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,200
didn't we just met?

410
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,800
How can I trust you?

411
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,200
Why did you get a flat tire?

412
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,200
On the way,

413
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,520
I got a call from your mom.

414
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,160
My mom?

415
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,040
What did she say?

416
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,240
She asked us

417
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,280
when we would go back and see our friends.

418
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,680
I said we'd see them all.

419
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,640
And?

420
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
At that time,

421
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,040
the car had called the police.

422
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,040
When I got off the car,

423
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,480
I saw a flat tire.

424
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,400
But why is your tire so small?

425
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,880
It's a spare tire.

426
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,880
What did you say?

427
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,960
I said we'd see our friends.

428
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,560
We'll go back in two days.

429
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,480
I won't go back for now.

430
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,760
I wrote a resignation letter to the company.

431
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,280
I won't go abroad.

432
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:00,880
Well,

433
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,120
a friend of mine

434
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,120
has been inviting me to have a painting exhibition here.

435
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,000
You can stay here

436
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,040
to help me with the exhibition.

437
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,840
And organize more international exchange activities.

438
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,680
It'll be helpful for you to get a green card.

439
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,920
And your mom won't suspect you.

440
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,720
I'm sorry.

441
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,840
Why are you apologizing?

442
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,280
It's unfair to you.

443
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,920
You shouldn't waste time

444
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,040
on things that you don't want to do.

445
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,120
Why are you so honest?

446
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,400
All right.

447
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,400
You don't have to

448
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,720
think it over.

449
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,880
I

450
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,080
have a lot of work to do

451
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,880
when I stay in China.

452
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,840
I just think

453
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,760
I'm living a comfortable

454
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,120
and simple life with you.

455
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,560
That's it.

456
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,200
Eh

457
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,080
Well,

458
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,080
have a try.

459
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,720
Star Fly helmets.

460
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,080
pel.

461
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,160
You also work on games?

462
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,840
But most games

463
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,720
will be bad before they're ready.

464
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,040
It'll take too long to find a programmer.

465
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,640
I think you should be more careful

466
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,800
about your future.

467
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,040
The monthly salary is only 6,500 yuan.

468
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,280
That's too little.

469
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,960
But if it's really like

470
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,200
what that boy said yesterday,

471
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,320
even the art summary

472
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:39,960
is here,

473
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,680
the 6,500 yuan will be a lot.

474
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,240
It seems like

475
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,320
he's going to close down.

476
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,080
But Li Xun chose this company.

477
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,560
Are you kidding me?

478
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,680
It's small, broken,

479
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,720
and not reliable.

480
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,240
Not to mention the LP.

481
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,640
But he has other choices.

482
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,280
LP is now the boss of the industry.

483
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,640
Even if a big company

484
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,880
wants him,

485
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,320
Gao Jianhong can say hello

486
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,880
and he will be embarrassed.

487
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,960
Zhu Yu,

488
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,640
have you really thought it through?

489
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,480
Qu Fei Yang.

490
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,800
Since it's all over,

491
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,160
who will he be enemies with in the future?

492
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,560
Whether he lives or dies,

493
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,800
what does it have to do with you?

494
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,480
I stayed

495
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,960
not just for him.

496
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,120
We can't

497
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,400
avoid it.

498
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,440
I'm telling you the worst.

499
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,640
It's a mess.

500
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,200
Don't jump into

501
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,640
a big pit

502
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,600
and get yourself involved.

503
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,160
Right?

504
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,920
You're really not going back?

505
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,120
You don't want your job?

506
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,120
Think about your career.

507
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,160
Think about your million-dollar salary.

508
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,720
Where's the dollar?

509
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,840
Now, for me and Li Xun,

510
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,560
it's not about money and interests.

511
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,440
It's about dreams.

512
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,120
Right.

513
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,120
Time 디 lost a Visa ya know.

514
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,720
Don't talk about that sound.

515
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,380
This iseled like a

516
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,800
traffic jam.

517
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,120
I'm sorry about this.

518
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,480
Any hearth Funds today?

519
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,680
This lot?

520
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,960
Two yuan...

521
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,560
Hello.

522
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,720
Excuse me.

523
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,280
Where's my new online quit?

524
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,040
There.

525
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,680
Go that way.

526
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:45,960
There?

527
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,880
Go stairs to the third floor.

528
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,480
Alright, thank you.

529
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,040
No problem.

530
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,960
I can't scrambled.

531
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,540
This meeting

532
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,140
is because

533
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,300
her parents

534
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,400
planet is

535
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,400
She gave dark

536
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,140
equipment to uma sahle

537
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,400
I didn't mean to

538
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,660
Then

539
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,280
Ok

540
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,560
Li Shuang

541
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,420
I met humongous

542
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,000
when I was little

543
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,640
Official

544
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,400
I don't know how I've been there

545
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,400
It's been so long

546
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,400
What are you doing?

547
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,400
Don't be like this

548
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,400
What is this

549
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,400
What is this

550
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
It's like your own home

551
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,400
Be careful

552
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400
Come out

553
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
Put two guns in the back

554
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,400
Ok

555
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,400
What's going on

556
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,400
Sorry

557
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,400
I'll take a look

558
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,400
Ok

559
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
You drink some water first

560
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,400
Thank you

561
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,400
Our director is in there

562
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,400
Interview

563
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
The next one is you

564
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,400
Let me introduce you

565
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,400
His name is Zhao Teng

566
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,400
We all call him Lao Teng

567
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,400
He is the director of our company

568
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,400
He is the director of our company

569
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,400
What

570
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,400
Can't be

571
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,400
He's a big shot

572
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,400
Go away

573
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,400
Who is the person who leads the company every day

574
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,400
He has someone

575
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
Is this also a villa

576
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,400
Correct

577
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,400
It's over

578
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,400
Come on

579
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,400
Come on

580
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,400
You get up too

581
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,400
Get up

582
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,400
Come on

583
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,400
Come on

584
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,400
He sits in my room

585
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,400
What do you do

586
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,400
Why are you looking at me

587
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,400
I'm sitting on you

588
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,400
You give me the resume

589
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,400
He said you are like him

590
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,400
There is no such thing as resume in the family

591
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,400
I'm sorry, this is my resume

592
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,400
Now young people

593
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,400
It's really impossible to compare with us

594
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,400
No qualifications

595
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,400
Look at this

596
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,400
I don't know

597
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,400
Xiaojian, you are every day

598
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,400
What kind of person is he in my company

599
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,400
Not a bastard, but a liar

600
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,400
liar

601
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,400
Please say it carefully

602
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Please

603
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,400
In the future, be a fake

604
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,400
Do it sincerely

605
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,400
Just this kind of confidence

606
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,400
Can come to this kind of company

607
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,400
You have no confidence in your company

608
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Yes

609
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
It's just that you don't look at it at all

610
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,400
Your company

611
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,400
If you even interview employees

612
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
It's a tomorrow

613
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,400
The company is going to close down

614
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,400
How can you get rich

615
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,400
You are so right

616
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,400
He just

617
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,400
He always thinks like this

618
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,400
Even if the company really has no power

619
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,400
You have to be confident

620
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,400
You can have luck if you are confident

621
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,400
To touch the good card

622
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,400
In addition

623
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,400
You are the HR director of the company

624
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,400
Yes

625
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,400
Then I will say something

626
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,400
What do you think is most important to be an HR

627
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,400
What do you think is most important

628
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
What do you think

629
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,400
It's the ability of the knower

630
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,400
Otherwise, you can't recognize the card

631
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,400
That's too bad

632
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,400
card

633
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,400
He almost got me in

634
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,400
What you mean is

635
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,400
You two are the king, right?

636
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,400
Who is the king and who is the little king

637
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,400
Then you are the interviewer

638
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,400
You must be the judge

639
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,400
But even if it's a thousand miles

640
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,400
It needs to be happy, right?

641
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,400
You two

642
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,400
know

643
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,400
Count

644
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,400
Not familiar

645
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,400
I beg you

646
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,400
Can you

647
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,400
Come after you understand this

648
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,400
How many companies did you interview before

649
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,400
I didn't meet when I was abroad

650
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,400
Directly A&E

651
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,400
This is the first one

652
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,400
You

653
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
I didn't meet before I went out

654
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,400
I didn't meet before I went out

655
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,400
You

656
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,400
I didn't meet before I went out

657
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,400
It's the first time after I went out

658
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,400
You are a computer engineer at Cornell University

659
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
Master

660
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,400
The title of the excellent intern of Rong Huo Jia Guwen

661
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,400
As Google

662
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,400
Google code Jam

663
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,400
The final of the whole state

664
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,400
Are you all true?

665
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,400
Of course it's true

666
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400
Wang Zhe

667
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,400
Great

668
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,400
It's a friendly reminder, Mr. Zhang

669
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,400
This Dong Dong will be back the day after tomorrow

670
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,400
If you can't recruit anyone

671
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,400
Just prepare to be short-term

672
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,400
Work for him

673
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,400
Not this

674
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,400
You say you guys are equal

675
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,400
Just this company

676
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,400
I do the work

677
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
I love it

678
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,400
They don't do anything

679
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,400
Just play games

680
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
Eat

681
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,400
Is it easy for me?

682
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,400
It's not easy for you

683
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
The company is for everyone

684
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,400
But someone has to stand out and lead

685
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400
You have suffered more

686
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,400
It can only prove that you have done more work

687
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,400
Of course it's right not to work

688
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,400
There is no chance to be scolded

689
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,400
Yes

690
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,400
He speaks very well

691
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,400
Your name is

692
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,400
Li Xun

693
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,400
Yes, Li Xun

694
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,400
This little guy

695
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,400
Yes

696
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,400
It's easy to talk

697
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,400
What confidence

698
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,400
What knowledge

699
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,400
A mouthful of a box came out

700
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,400
You don't have to be responsible at all

701
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,400
Right?

702
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,400
Yes

703
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,400
What do you think is consciousness?

704
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,400
What is the pattern?

705
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,400
Just this

706
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,400
I think today

707
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,400
It's about the same for you two

708
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,400
I'll contact you later

709
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,400
Take care

710
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,400
Wait a minute

711
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,400
I'll be down soon

712
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,400
Brother Teng

713
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,400
My girlfriend came to send me food again

714
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,400
Bye bye

715
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,400
Just your girlfriend

716
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,400
I'm angry

717
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,400
I can't see you

718
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,400
What are you doing again?

719
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,400
Where is the project?

720
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,400
Say something

721
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,400
Can you do something serious

722
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,400
Very simple

723
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
Two questions

724
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
The first question

725
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,400
You just have to answer it

726
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,400
Then the second

727
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,400
You have to do this program

728
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,400
What if the game is not good?

729
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,400
What is this feeling?

730
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,400
You see

731
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,400
I said you had to solve the problem

732
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,400
You play first

733
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,400
How about it

734
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,400
Quite boring

735
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,400
This game

736
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,400
Director Zhang

737
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,400
Planned and produced by himself

738
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,400
But apart from boredom

739
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,400
What else do you feel?

740
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,400
A bit of a card

741
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,400
Not very smooth

742
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,400
And the logic order

743
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,400
It's particularly bad, right?

744
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,400
These are all called feelings

745
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,400
Then I will simply understand

746
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,400
Improved improvement

747
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,400
Continue

748
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,400
The data structure of this game

749
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,400
And optimization algorithm

750
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,400
All have problems

751
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,400
The resource is not dynamic

752
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,400
For the no longer used memory

753
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,400
Did not be released in time

754
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,400
And you see

755
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,400
This character is for the player

756
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,400
The response is not very reasonable

757
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,400
And the data transmitted by the network

758
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,400
Should also have honor

759
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,400
If you adjust all of these

760
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,400
The touch should be

761
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,400
A big improvement

762
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,400
You put this

763
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,400
Make a sentence

764
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,400
Before writing

765
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,400
Can I ask a question

766
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,400
Exam

767
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,400
No chat during the exam

768
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,400
Sit down first

769
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
It's the same whether you do it or not

770
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,400
You know

771
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,400
This salary

772
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,400
What do you think

773
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,400
You can just give the salary

774
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,400
But I have a condition

775
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,400
What condition

776
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,400
The one who just interviewed me

777
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,400
You have to hire together

778
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,400
You are not a group girl

779
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,400
Not relatives

780
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,400
What relationship can that be

781
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,400
I tell you

782
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,400
Our company is strictly in the office

783
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,400
Then you really think too much

784
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,400
We do know

785
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,400
But now I really don't know

786
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,400
Not familiar

787
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,400
You are not familiar with Wang Li

788
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,400
What do you think of our company

789
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,400
Our company's circle of friends

790
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,400
Just pull people

791
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,400
What group relationship

792
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,400
I tell you

793
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,400
We are completely

794
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,400
Just talk by ability

795
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,400
If it's really difficult

796
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,400
Just forget it

797
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,400
I wish you all

798
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,400
Find a suitable partner

799
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,400
Wait a minute

800
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,400
Just this one

801
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,400
Good clothes

802
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,400
Sign it soon

803
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,400
What to sign

804
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,400
Where is the person

805
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,400
I didn't hear he was going to engage in group relationships

806
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,400
Just do it

807
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,400
You think one person

808
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,400
Six thousand and five in a month

809
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,400
A total of two people are only one thousand and three

810
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,400
We made a big turn

811
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,400
You are not the head

812
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,400
Don't know the financial rules

813
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,400
Moreover

814
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,400
Look at that person

815
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,400
Can't even get a resume

816
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,400
And I've been in prison

817
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,400
And I've been in prison

818
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,400
Intentionally hurt people

819
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,400
You

820
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,400
You said the person who eats prison food

821
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,400
He doesn't necessarily eat

822
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,400
Such a social revolution

823
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,400
You called him in

824
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,400
Don't you look ugly?

825
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,400
I've eaten prison food

826
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,400
That came out to change my confidence

827
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,400
Isn't it also solid?

828
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,400
correct

829
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,400
Don't we also go to jail?

830
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,400
So

831
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,400
You didn't find it yourself

832
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,400
You are not enough

833
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,400
You call another one

834
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,400
What do you mean

835
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
Double debuff

836
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,400
Anyway, what about opinions

837
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,400
I gave it

838
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,400
I don't care about Zhao Zhen's business

839
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,400
You like to listen

840
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,400
Don't like to listen to nonsense

841
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,400
I go back to work

842
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,400
Old man

843
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,400
Come come come

844
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,400
Tell me the truth

845
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,400
This girl

846
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,400
Really as you said so powerful

847
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,400
Not big brother

848
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,400
Can you get a salary

849
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,400
Where is he worse than you?

850
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,400
About your relationship

851
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
His situation is special

852
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,400
After all, I went in

853
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,400
And he just

854
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,400
What ability did he have before

855
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,400
Let's not talk about it

856
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,400
After all, he has been in this industry for several years

857
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,400
Now

858
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,400
No one knows what level

859
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,400
Of course

860
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,400
Our company

861
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,400
There is also a sense of social responsibility

862
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,400
We are still willing to accept this

863
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,400
Specialist

864
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
Help them return to society

865
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,400
But I also have a condition

866
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,400
Since this person

867
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,400
You insist on recruiting people

868
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,400
His salary

869
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,400
You have to pay

870
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,400
OK

871
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,400
OK, I will pay

872
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,400
agreed

873
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,400
This is cool

874
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,400
Cool

875
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,400
Then I will tell you again

876
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,400
Our arrangement later

877
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,400
Since you two together

878
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,400
Then one month's salary is six thousand five

879
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,400
But ugly words say in front

880
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,400
If you are late

881
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,400
I have to deduct money if I retire early

882
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,400
Of course he is late

883
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,400
I deducted your money

884
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,400
If this condition can be accepted

885
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,400
What can come tomorrow

886
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,400
I won't let you down

887
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,400
OK

888
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,400
Come, congratulations

889
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,400
Then we will be colleagues in the future

890
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,400
Don't be polite

891
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,400
Zhao Tang

892
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,400
Zhu Yu

893
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,400
Then I'll go first

894
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,400
it is good

895
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,400
Walk

896
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,400
Fat

897
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,400
Great

898
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,400
You are getting more and more shameless now

899
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,400
I am a businessman

900
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,400
That is a general

901
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,400
Miss Zhu

902
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,400
Such a coincidence

903
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,400
Long time no see

904
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,400
Coincidence

905
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,400
You shouldn't have appeared here

906
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,400
Two days ago

907
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,400
I went to the Internet Conference

908
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,400
This company is good

909
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,400
Quite potential

910
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,400
Where is the potential

911
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,400
Then I have to ask you

912
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,400
What do you like about him

913
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,400
Give you a suggestion

914
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
Stay away from me

915
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,400
You don't have to resist me like this

916
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,400
If we have the same goal

917
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,400
It's not a bad thing to be in a company

918
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,400
We can deal with L.P. together

919
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,400
I'm against L.P.

920
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,400
Because he was mine

921
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,400
What reason can Miss Zhu have

922
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,400
Is it because of us

923
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,400
The past friendship

924
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,400
L.P. used to be mine

925
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,400
How much do you want to take back him

926
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,400
I'm the same

927
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,400
What friendship

928
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,400
No matter what our relationship is

929
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,400
What is it like

930
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,400
I always believe you are a real genius

931
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
So I came back

932
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,400
Can't understand, right

933
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,400
I'm a fool

934
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,400
It doesn't matter if I starve to death

935
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,400
It has nothing to do with you

936
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,400
You just take your little white face

937
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,400
And the great resume

938
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,400
How far away

939
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,400
Do you understand

940
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,400
I went to Gao Jinghong

941
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,400
I also checked L.P.'s equity structure

942
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,400
This time you say anything

943
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
I won't leave

944
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,400
See you tomorrow

945
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,400
Hello, the chairman's car is serving you

946
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,400
Please get in the car

947
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,400
Master

948
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,400
Master

949
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,400
Your car is so good

950
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,400
How can you bear to pull the fire

951
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,400
Is this a good car

952
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,400
My car just came out of the long-distance

953
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,400
It hasn't been washed for a few days

954
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,400
You don't mind

955
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,400
This is pretty clean

956
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,400
Service industry can't be held back

957
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,400
You are also an amateur car driver, right

958
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,400
Special position

959
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,400
Chairman's car serves you

960
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,400
Special position

961
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,400
Can your car make money

962
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,400
Sometimes

963
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,400
It doesn't matter if you make money or not

964
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,400
The key is to be happy

965
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,400
I like driving

983
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,400

When can you change

994
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,400
Self-reliance problem

995
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,400
