YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if the light is very bright

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will still watch over that vast vast land

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless atmosphere

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day, the lens is a little bit yellow

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast night?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I burn up the night just for you to remember

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How everything was in the beginning

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The wildness of wild grass is like the wind

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The mountain is broken but you are still by my side

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Everything is how it was in the beginning

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The Long Ballad

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Episode 16

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I can understand your fear

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I was so scared that day

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I was really scared

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
They did too much

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Even if you really ruined our game

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That was just a game

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It could be you

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I don't think so

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I don't think so

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I don't think so

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I don't think so

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I don't think so

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It could be your game

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's not just my game

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's the work of everyone in this company

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Didn't you expect that

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The situation would be so big

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You think

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We are like a small company

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Even if we are caught

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It won't be so

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But no matter how small the company is

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's also the salary of others

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Don't underestimate others

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Li Xun told me about you

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Would you like to go somewhere with me?

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Where is this?

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Go in and have a look

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Go in and have a look

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Look

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I have a lot of things for you

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I will leave it to you

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I will leave it to you

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I will leave it to you

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I will leave it to you

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Go

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
This room

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And all your things

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He always keeps it for you

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
He is so good

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
He is waiting for you

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He is the only one who treats me like a human

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Li Xun can't leave

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You know him

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We have something to do

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
If you really can't let him go

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Come here yourself

67
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
How about it

68
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Done

69
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Not only the political commissar

70
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This is done by thinking work

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What to do next

72
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
How to do

73
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
How to do

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You two are so serious

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Why ask me

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Then we will

77
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Tie a stone and weigh it

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What nonsense

79
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So I ask you how to do

80
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Let him stay in the company

81
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Do you accept

82
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What if he is not by your side

83
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What if he is cheating

84
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And if he escapes from this city

85
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Can you catch him

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's better to watch by your side

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You said he was very strong

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Our company is sure

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's best to help us

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I love to hear this

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Everything comes from the company

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But that boy looks a little ugly

93
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm leaving, I'm on vacation

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I am the boss

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Did you ask me for leave?

96
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
He usually

97
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So blind

98
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
A little timid

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
More lovely than this

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Look good

101
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
How cute

102
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm leaving

103
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Hongning

104
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I still have that sentence

105
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You want to go

106
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I won't stay

107
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
But as long as you follow me

108
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I will let you

109
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Be a man

110
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I know

111
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
How is Zhou Yun's meal?

112
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
No way to eat

113
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's also a sign

114
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I am a major political commissar

115
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You have to get a red top

116
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You are too like that

117
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Okay, pay attention

118
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What are you doing?

119
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What are you doing?

120
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
This is high

121
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Wait, come and see

122
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What is this hanging?

123
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Look at this side

124
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Which side do you look at

125
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I can't understand

126
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Come, let me explain

127
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
New slogan

128
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Look at this

129
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Our main sign is also written

130
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's you again

131
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Money is money again

132
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You play this game, right?

133
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Devil

134
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You have money

135
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You can be a devil

136
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's not bad

137
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Can make money

138
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
This sentence is too good

139
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Can make money without doing bad things

140
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You are my nephew

141
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I love you

142
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
coming

143
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Come, go

144
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
All are here

145
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Introduce

146
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
This is my friend Hou Ning

147
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Zhang Fang Zhao Teng Guo Shijie

148
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Welcome

149
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Hou Ning

150
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'll clean up a place for you later

151
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Zhao Teng, you help him install a computer

152
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I have prepared the materials

153
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You take a look

154
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
In the future, you will ask Li Xun about the work

155
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'll help you find the host

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
No need

157
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I will order it online

158
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'll be there in the afternoon

159
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That's fine

160
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Our company is finished

161
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Should have been eliminated

162
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
There is a problem

163
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Where is his good brain?

164
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The black man is not so fast

165
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Talk too much

166
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I have to tell me

167
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Quite self-aware

168
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Half of our company

169
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Have been in prison

170
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Plus the criminal habit of Hou Ning

171
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And Mr. Dong

172
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That amazing

173
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The way to deal with problems

174
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I have to keep an eye on you at any time

175
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
From today

176
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I am the director of the Flying Supervision Management Committee

177
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I will look after you on behalf of Teacher Lin

178
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You do it yourself

179
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I will do it myself

180
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Director Zhu

181
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I like to be an official

182
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Disagree

183
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Zhang Fang has a problem with Hou Ning

184
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But for Hou Ning

185
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Maybe it's a good thing

186
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
If he wants to be a real person

187
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Survive in this society

188
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I have to work hard

189
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Change the view of others

190
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Can't escape like before

191
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But you can rest assured

192
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Zhang Fang is a hard-mouthed psychological person

193
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
He won't really bully Hou Ning

194
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You should worry about Zhang Fang

195
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
What are you looking at

196
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
In fact, in this company

197
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm watching you

198
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I have something ugly to tell you

199
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
If you are here

200
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
If you don't take it seriously

201
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Take the company back

202
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
No need to walk, no need to leave

203
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I can't take your little body

204
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Zhang Fang

205
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Your circuit is online

206
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Oh my god

207
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Come quickly

208
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I haven't been in the interview

209
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Not my dad

210
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
What

211
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm in my mother's room

212
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I didn't do it

213
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm telling you

214
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm telling you

215
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I really want to see it

216
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I want to see

217
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm so embarrassed

218
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What are you doing

219
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What are you doing

220
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Why are you so small

221
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Work

222
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Newcomer

223
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You did it

224
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What do you mean

225
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm here to show off

226
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I admit

227
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I have seen this net

228
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Before I was worried about myself

229
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I didn't hurt anyone

230
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
How do you remember

231
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Zhang Fang Zhang Fang

232
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I let him do it

233
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
We won't make such jokes anymore

234
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Take care of the newcomer

235
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
See you don't go

236
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Don't say

237
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Like you just came

238
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Say it to me

239
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What are you doing

240
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Make a fuss

241
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Fight

242
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Clean it up

243
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm thinking

244
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Our flying income group

245
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Isn't this the personnel

246
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's getting more and more complete

247
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What do you mean

248
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Rebellious

249
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I dare not

250
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What about next week

251
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What is this love blind box?

252
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm going to find the internal test, right?

253
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
If you drop the chain

254
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I can't spare you

255
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Do you know

256
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Hello

257
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Xiao Tong is at home to serve you

258
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What is your goods

259
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That can be that can be

260
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I can't pull this for three people

261
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Wait for me

262
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Wait for me

263
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Don't get in the way

264
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
The number of users in these days

265
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Why is it not increasing?

266
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You know what

267
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Zhang Fang, let me ask you

268
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Did you promote

269
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Where did you spend this money

270
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
God's conscience

271
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Then I

272
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Every promotional bullet

273
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm one word

274
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
One word

275
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Hand hit

276
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
That's not spending money

277
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
No, do you know

278
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
This wine box is also afraid of the alley god

279
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Other games

280
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Promotion costs

281
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
With development costs

282
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
One to one

283
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Brother Ren

284
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
What do you do for me

285
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Love blind box

286
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Three days of internal testing

287
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
But the data is not optimistic

288
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Someone lost

289
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Isn't this project

290
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Is it caught by Li Xun?

291
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It is said

292
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
He took it himself

293
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
This time

294
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
He is a bet

295
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You arrange

296
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Find someone to pull this

297
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Love blind box

298
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
We make one ourselves

299
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Is this worth it?

300
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
We make one ourselves

301
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
How much do we pay?

302
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
The vision can't be too shallow

303
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Just think about the listing

304
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Just take a pen

305
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Now's L.P.

306
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Although the funds are full

307
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
But the project is not enough

308
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Many games

309
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Three to six months after the launch

310
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
The data will be significantly lowered

311
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
This is not easy

312
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Pass the verification of the certificate

313
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
We have to have a representative

314
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Representative

315
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You call this representative

316
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
This game looks

317
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Frontline straight

318
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
But it's easier to be rejected

319
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
But it's easier to be accepted by the market

320
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
The potential users are large

321
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Once played

322
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
There is a return

323
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
The disadvantage of flying

324
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Is publicity and promotion

325
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
But this is our L.P. strength

326
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
We don't grab it in front

327
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Push it in the pot

328
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Isn't that stupid?

329
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
So sure

330
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Sure

331
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Then I should ask

332
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You are out of the professional judgment

333
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Or

334
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What personal reasons

335
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
The intuition is that this game will be popular

336
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
This market is too big

337
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
There are too many games that will be popular

338
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Let it be popular

339
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
We make our money

340
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Why are you staring at this place?

341
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You don't want to see Li Xun turn over, right?

342
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I know

343
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Li Xun's fart

344
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You have to ask

345
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I disagree

346
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
L.P. can't be influenced by your personal grudges

347
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Fang Zhijian

348
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Your eyes

349
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I beat the blind

350
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Why are you so good?

351
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I forgot the pain

352
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Anyway, I said the ugly words in advance

353
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Even if you do it now

354
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's too late

355
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And even if you do it now

356
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
If you don't tell me

357
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Li Xun will bite you

358
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Then we will be more passive

359
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You don't have to worry about this

360
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I have my own arrangement

361
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Let's get people first

362
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Let Dongliang

363
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Bring all the backbone of the development department

364
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The love blind box is about to be online

365
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
No time

366
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Hurry up

367
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm sorry

368
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's okay

369
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm sorry

370
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's okay

371
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Sorry

372
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's okay

373
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Here

374
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
How long has he not been here to record?

375
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm here to record today

376
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's a long time to delay

377
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I think he shouldn't form a band

378
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Let's form a wine bureau in the future

379
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Wait a minute

380
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Xiao Liuzi will be back soon

381
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Don't tell him I've been here

382
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
What can't you do in such a short time?

383
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Zhu Ying and Li Xun have a project to ask you for help

384
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You contact them specifically

385
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I have no relationship with them

386
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Want to find me a help

387
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Sit down and talk

388
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Their company has a new game

389
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
continue

390
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
That's it

391
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
They want to

392
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Hello, Mr. Zhao

393
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
How can I be missing for a long time?

394
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Okay, okay, okay

395
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Okay, come over right away

396
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Didn't you record today?

397
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
What a joke

398
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Mr. Zhao is waiting

399
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Rendie

400
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Don't you want to know who Mr. Zhao is?

401
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Pour it

402
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Mr. Zhao

403
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What happened last time was really our fault

404
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I hope Mr. Zhao won't blame the little ones

405
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Mr. Zhao is the one who actually controls Dongting International

406
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
He signed all five albums

407
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Later, you quit the star red band

408
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
He was very angry

409
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
How much do I pay?

410
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'll give it to you

411
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Mr. Zhao is not short of money

412
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
He joined many record companies

413
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Said to block you

414
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Whatever

415
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I quit the star red band

416
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I won't play the band anymore

417
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I know you don't care

418
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But Liu Zhe cares

419
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
He always thinks you are the soul of the star red band

420
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
The star red band can't live without you

421
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Come on, come on, come on

422
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
We are not drunk today

423
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Come on, come on, come on

424
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
These days

425
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
He has been drinking and fighting with the record company

426
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Ask them not to kill you

427
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I

428
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You

429
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Miss

430
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Come back

431
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Come back

432
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Come back

433
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You

434
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Don't leave me, okay?

435
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The tears are still falling

436
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
A photo of a naked person in autumn

437
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Is it necessary to be so grand?

438
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Now you know

439
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
This is the so-called life photos

440
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
How was it taken?

441
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Every angle is carefully designed

442
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Every thing that is exposed

443
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Have his personality

444
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
But does the band need to be exposed?

445
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You don't want to show your face

446
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
So he came

447
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Each person's quality and cooperation are not good

448
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Speaking of which, it's angry

449
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Living like a fake person

450
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
But Li Xun reminded me

451
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Send Weibo text message

452
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
No need to write this game

453
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Don't act like a big ad

454
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Someone will dig into the details

455
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I really underestimated you two

456
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm so angry

457
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
This is his idea

458
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It has nothing to do with me

459
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
But it can be calculated

460
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's all on me

461
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
But think carefully

462
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Which time did you leave me?

463
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Last time, Shao Men asked me for money

464
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
This time

465
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
A call came

466
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Just ask me to go to him

467
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Aren't you busy with this activity every day?

468
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Where does he care about whether I am active or not?

469
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Push it over

470
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I think he hasn't changed at all

471
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Same as when I was in the first grade

472
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
We are both competing with each other

473
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
But a little bit

474
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
That word

475
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
What do you say

476
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Heart to heart

477
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Yes yes yes

478
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Let me tell you

479
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I remember he told me before

480
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Said

481
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
He said that love is a chess opponent

482
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Love is a self-indulgence

483
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
He said this

484
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Actually I really envy you

485
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It hasn't changed for so many years

486
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
He hasn't changed

487
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
With a clear goal

488
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Can also let go of yourself for the other

489
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
He just came out for a while

490
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I see his bad look

491
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I really think he deserves it

492
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
How miserable this is

493
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
How miserable it is for me

494
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
But now

495
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I still hope he can succeed

496
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
He is going to be listed soon

497
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
This is the last chance

498
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Still lack of money

499
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Li Xun didn't go out to find money

500
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It means he thinks we are fine

501
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Money is too easy to make

502
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I do not think it's interesting

503
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I am an example

504
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
In the past

505
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
When I have no money

506
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Fight for every chance to perform

507
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Now

508
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
The next group of photographers will be here soon

509
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Ready

510
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Everyone, this way please

511
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Thank you

512
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I'll take a picture for you

513
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Right now

514
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm here

515
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I'm here

516
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I'm here

517
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I'm here

518
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
You are not here

519
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I'm here

520
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I'm here

521
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I'm here

522
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I'm here

523
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I'm here

524
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I'm here

525
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I'm here

526
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Really

527
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Sit here

528
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You two sit here

529
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Come

530
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Change it

531
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Change it

532
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Wait a minute

533
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
What's up?

534
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I'm here

535
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I'm here

536
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I'm here

537
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Let's take a serious picture first

538
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Yes

539
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I haven't taken a picture in years

540
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I think we should let the two team leaders take the lead.

541
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
One, two, three.

542
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Come on.

543
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
One, two, three.

544
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It's not natural to wear it.

545
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
This one is good.

546
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
What? I'll take it.

547
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
This one?

548
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
This one.

549
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I'll take it.

550
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
This one?

551
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
This one.

552
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
You're wearing a suit.

553
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
That's the top 50 in the service department.

554
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Enough.

555
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You're like a fool.

556
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
It's good.

557
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Why do you say that?

558
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
It's not like Guo Xiaojian.

559
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Is that your father's clothes?

560
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Why do you wear it like a happy manager?

561
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Stop it.

562
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I look like a professional driver.

563
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Whose clothes are those?

564
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Don't insult the professional driver.

565
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I'm a professional driver.

566
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
This one.

567
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Look.

568
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Come on.

569
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Why does it look like...

570
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
It's a wedding photo.

571
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Yes, it's very similar.

572
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
It's a perfect match.

573
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
This one belongs to me.

574
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Which one is the prettiest?

575
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Is that your daughter?

576
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
There are many flower granddaughter dresses.

577
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
What's their father's painting?

578
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
She used to butter sentences,

579
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
but these are in different candidates.

580
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I'll change that flower to red one.

581
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,040
You see,

582
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,840
our love box is on the line.

583
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,160
In less than half a month,

584
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,600
it will be 3 million yuan.

585
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,640
What does it mean?

586
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,120
It means that we can break the contract

587
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,080
in five months.

588
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,080
It's done.

589
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,560
It's so easy.

590
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,040
It's so fast.

591
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,800
It's all about money.

592
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,760
Let me tell you.

593
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,920
It means that

594
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,760
our business has been successful.

595
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,880
It's successful.

596
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,800
Let me tell you.

597
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,480
It's a hero's job.

598
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,800
Once he becomes Guo Jianchi,

599
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,120
his collection volume will go up.

600
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:39,760
After he goes up,

601
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,000
I'll search for his collection volume

602
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,760
at that time.

603
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,520
I'll put 4,000 numbers in it.

604
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,440
Whoever he loves,

605
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,120
he's a hero.

606
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,840
You'll know that

607
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,800
it's a great show

608
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,880
if you can play this game.

609
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,000
That's it.

610
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,880
Of course.

611
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,720
It's mainly because

612
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,800
our president and our leader

613
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,640
have been working on it.

614
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,200
So you have to follow

615
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,160
the future publicity.

616
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,560
Don't worry.

617
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,880
I'll listen to whatever you say.

618
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,800
You and Li Xun

619
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,400
are the two masters of our company.

620
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,520
Where's Li Xun?

621
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,080
He updated the shares last night

622
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,040
and didn't sleep all night.

623
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,520
He's in there now.

624
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,360
It's so hard.

625
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,480
I'm 마�istically worried that

626
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,520
our CEO will ruin our company's reputation.

627
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,520
I don't know must

628
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,960
Bauren Monk

629
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,560
will update the number of people

630
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,640
누 Els Xiao

631
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,320
is reprimanded

632
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,800
and forced to quit his construction job.

633
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,080
du I feel pas

634
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,720
so emotional

635
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,880
when they saw

636
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,420
the competitors' work.

637
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,280
I'm worried

638
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,440
about the company's reputation.

639
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,040
Yes.

640
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,040
You're still concerned about this?

641
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,600
If you keep going on like this, do you still want to die?

642
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,440
Go back to sleep.

643
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,560
We've researched the love blind boxes in the development department.

644
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,560
We want to make one that's similar to this.

645
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,000
It'll take at least half a year.

646
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,400
Just this?

647
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,280
It took so long?

648
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,640
Their love blind boxes are very strange.

649
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,440
There are many gameplay settings that we've never seen before.

650
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,680
Without the template, it's very difficult to make it come true.

651
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,360
Let's make one ourselves. How long will it take?

652
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,560
It'll take about four months.

653
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,400
Hong Ning is quite good at taking care of people.

654
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,360
You can't always not rest.

655
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,160
The company won't be able to make a living without you.

656
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,960
You won't make any money.

657
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,760
What are you thinking about?

658
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,360
I'm thinking...

659
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,560
If I'm not wrong,

660
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,560
Gao Jianhong is already thinking of a way to fill up the love blind boxes.

661
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,360
I understand.

662
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,760
If it was before,

663
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,960
you wouldn't have spent so much effort on a game like this.

664
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,360
You're interested in it because ALP is about to be launched.

665
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,760
You must hurry up and push it to the top.

666
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,760
Use Gao Jianhong's plagiarism and sue them for infringement.

667
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,160
Is my stuff that easy to imitate?

668
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,560
I won't give them the original code.

669
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,160
They'll have to spend at least half a year to make some code.

670
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,160
No wonder when I was reading the love blind boxes,

671
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,560
I found a lot of strange things.

672
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,360
Your previous code was very addictive,

673
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,960
but this time, you used a lot of complicated structures.

674
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,160
The more unique the code, the more traps you'll find.

675
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,360
But even if they fall into a trap,

676
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,360
are we really going to give them half a year to make a love blind box?

677
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,560
So,

678
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,360
I'll give them the original code directly.

679
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,960
I've been investigating the recent years of the domestic game's difficulty in choosing.

680
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,160
If it's just a simple copy,

681
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,160
it'll be very difficult to win.

682
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,760
It's not about whether we can afford the lawyer's fee.

683
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,960
The domestic game copyright lawsuit

684
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,760
can't be finished in ten years.

685
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,160
If it really becomes a battle with ALP,

686
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,360
we'll be ruined first.

687
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,760
Don't worry.

688
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,160
Gao Jianhong is more anxious than us.

689
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,160
Who else knows about this plan?

690
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,760
Hongning and Dong Siyang.

691
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,160
You're still here.

692
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,360
What about Zhao Teng and the others?

693
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,960
They don't know.

694
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,160
Remember.

695
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,560
The less people know, the better.

696
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,360
What way do you have to get them the original code?

697
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,360
Will Gao Jianhong use it directly?

698
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,360
Don't worry about that.

699
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,960
They're used to walking on the wrong path.

700
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,560
You won't even walk on the main road.

701
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,160
Gao Jianhong has been looking for a successful project.

702
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,960
The reason they can survive is because the game market is too chaotic.

703
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,960
The domestic users are too large.

704
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,960
When everyone sees these things,

705
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,160
they'll naturally be more tolerant.

706
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,560
But what's false is false.

707
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,160
People can't always be pure.

708
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,760
When users grow up,

709
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,160
these companies that don't have the ability to develop themselves

710
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,960
will be ruined.

711
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,560
But how can users grow up in a few months?

712
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,360
ALP is about to be launched.

713
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,760
Will they take this risk?

714
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,360
I'll force them to do it.

715
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,560
This kind of small company

716
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,160
will be a clown.

717
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,560
What can it do?

718
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,760
Can the total flow of blood be better than our company's one-month-old?

719
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,360
Gao, you mustn't be taken away by Li Xun.

720
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,760
I'm about to hand over the Shenhe material.

721
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,760
This is the most critical time.

722
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,160
For the company,

723
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,960
we can't just stand by and do nothing.

724
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,360
Director Gao.

725
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,960
Director Gao.

726
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,760
What kind of goals do you have?

727
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,760
Become the number one in the industry.

728
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,160
You're really a big shot.

729
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,360
But an industry like ALP

730
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,360
can't compete with its competitors.

731
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,160
In terms of company's ability...

732
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,360
Ability?

733
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,560
What kind of ability do you think ALP has?

734
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,560
Is it a copy and paste?

735
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,760
A company like this

736
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,760
doesn't deserve to compete with us, Fei Yang.

737
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,760
Gao.

738
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,960
Even if Li Xun is in the eight love relationships,

739
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,760
he can't pose a threat to us.

740
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,760
He's just waiting to make you angry.

741
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,160
I'll tell you one last time.

742
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,760
Take care of what you should take care of.

743
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,160
Don't be so stubborn with me.

744
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,760
If you don't want to do it, you can leave.

745
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,760
But I must do this.

746
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,760
I'll do it.

747
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,760
I must do it.

748
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,560
Got it.

749
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,560
These two idiots.

750
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,960
They're from Southeast Asia.

751
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,360
They're from the SQL branch.

752
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,960
They don't have any heart.

753
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,560
Let's put some water in.

754
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,160
Gao Jianhong, take those codes away.

755
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,960
I've already given them to them.

756
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,560
With our ability,

757
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,760
we can let him take the codes away.

758
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,760
Do they dare to copy them?

759
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,360
I'll do my best.

760
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,160
We're not letting you in casually.

761
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,160
I'll go in.

762
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,160
I'll go in.

763
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,360
What are you hacking?

764
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,360
I'm doing a good job.

765
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,360
I almost forgot.

766
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,160
You can understand it too.

767
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,160
What do you think?

768
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,160
What's the latest crime?

769
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,360
This is a back-up data of a love blind date.

770
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,160
What do you want?

771
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,560
In case there's anything I can borrow.

772
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,160
You want to steal Yuan Dama?

773
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,760
You used to copy, but now you dare to steal Yuan Dama?

774
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,560
You're breaking the law.

775
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,760
These hackers are in Malaysia.

776
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,760
They can't find us.

777
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,560
The company is going to be listed.

778
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,560
You're really good at picking times.

779
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,560
It's not my fault.

780
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,160
I've told you everything I should.

781
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,160
You two have a good talk.

782
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,960
Why are you like Fang Zhijing?

783
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,360
You only have money in your eyes.

784
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,960
You used such a mean way to deal with Li Xun.

785
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,960
You want him.

786
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,160
You want to go to jail, don't drag me down.

787
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,160
Then let's get divorced.

788
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,160
You've been thinking about this line for a long time.

789
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,560
This is what you really want to say.

790
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,560
Why are you so much?

791
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,560
You want to divorce, just say it.

792
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,160
First, consider your loss.

793
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,160
Don't do the company's business.

794
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,560
But Jiuyang...

795
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,160
I'm in the office to work for you.

796
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,160
What can I do for you?

797
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,160
This isn't the first time I've been to work for a cakes icons.

798
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,960

00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,160

It suits you.

806
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,360
This diamond is 12.13 karat.

00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,760

816
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,960
do you remember

817
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,960
when we ate together for the first time,

818
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,200
we were like in a restaurant like this.

819
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,960
Back then, you are me and you.

820
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,760
I remember

821
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,760

822
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,760
I'm sorry

823
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,760
When I proposed to you

824
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,760
I said

825
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,760
I would never

826
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,760
be angry at you

827
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,760
But I didn't do it

828
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,760
I was impulsive that day

829
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,760
But did you consider

830
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,760
what I said?

831
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,760

832
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,760
Let's not talk about this today

833
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,760
Don't you want to

834
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,760

835
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,760
I'll go with you

836
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,760
We can buy a house together

837
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,760
You can apply for a school

838
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,760

839
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,760

You don't need to

give me anything

846
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,760

for a long time

850
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,760
We should talk it over

851
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,760
I used to think

852
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,760
as long as

853
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,760

854
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,760

855
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,760

00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,760
Your feelings

858
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,760
Any feelings

859
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,760
need to be taken into account

860
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,760
Nana

861
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,760
I'm sorry

862
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,760
