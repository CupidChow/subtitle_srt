YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if the light is very bright

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will still watch over that vast vast land

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless atmosphere

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day, the lens is a little bit yellow

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast night?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I burn up the night just for you to remember

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How everything was in the beginning

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The wind and the color of the night sky are like wild grass

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The mountains are broken, but you are still by my side

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Everything is how it was in the beginning

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The Long Ballad

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Episode 2

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I didn't expect this restaurant to be still here

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I know there are not many restaurants

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That's right

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You didn't take me to eat some of the dishes

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's cheaper for you

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You remember it well

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I remember

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I remember

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I remember

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I remember

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I remember

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What is this

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Un恒

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This talent

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I have never heard of him

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Useful

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Can't hear

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Can't connect

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Can't read

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Can't read

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yes

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Baojia

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
How can I work with you

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You know

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I know

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
there are that kind of programs

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Really

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You did say so

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,760
他們還跟我沒進來

49
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,080
我成立基本鍵字書

50
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,520
還有倫敦帳的帖子

51
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,080
包括有些野石畫篇

52
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,120
野石

53
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,720
那我最喜歡看了

54
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,240
我是用來跟你學習的

55
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,240
不是用來跟你八卦的

56
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,360
你平時也不怎麼玩遊戲吧

57
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,520
我上一次玩遊戲的時候

58
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,320
我還是

59
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,800
你告訴我你上次打遊戲

60
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,520
晚上是過河死

61
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,720
遊戲

62
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,720
Three chances. I'll go to find Qi Yi before I die.

63
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,280
I also found some games that are like the invincible weapons.

64
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,520
The instruction manual is in the USB.

65
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,280
Tomorrow is the weekend. Don't work overtime.

66
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,280
Spend some time to have fun.

67
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,720
Find some feelings.

68
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
I'll go.

69
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,120
You're always so smart.

70
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,520
You should know how big your dream is.

71
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,320
You're so good at talking.

72
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,920
So you're ready to fight against Gao Jinghong?

73
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,720
The invincible weapon is our first bullet.

74
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,320
Be careful.

75
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,320
I know.

76
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,320
Boss.

77
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,320
One pot of Erguotou.

78
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
Wait.

79
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,120
You want to drink?

80
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,720
Yes. To celebrate.

81
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,920
Wait.

82
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,120
Don't drink.

83
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,920
Why? You're so nosy.

84
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,320
Who told you to drink?

85
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520
Who told you to?

86
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,320
Don't drink. I won't pay you.

87
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,320
I'll pay you.

88
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
Go.

89
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,920
Who are you listening to?

90
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,320
Me.

91
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,720
I'm the team leader.

92
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,120
Go, boss.

93
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,320
Thank you.

94
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,720
To celebrate.

95
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,920
You don't have to see me off.

96
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,720
What's the point of being a bad drinker?

97
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,920
I was like that when I was abroad.

98
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,120
You learned this when you were abroad?

99
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,720
It has nothing to do with abroad.

100
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,720
You brought me back.

101
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,920
You taught me how to drink for the first time.

102
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,120
The first time to drink.

103
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,120
The first time to play games.

104
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,920
The first shot, the first win.

105
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,720
The first time to fight.

106
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,720
Good.

107
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,320
I'm sorry.

108
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,120
How are you doing abroad?

109
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,520
Pretty good.

110
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,320
I'm just a little bit embarrassed

111
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,320
because I'm speaking English.

112
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,720
But I can do the job I like

113
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,520
and learn what I like.

114
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
I'm happy.

115
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,520
You're not going back?

116
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,920
Are you going to give up like this?

117
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,320
You're going to miss a lot of things.

118
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
I know what I want.

119
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,320
So I'll go in that direction every step.

120
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,120
I'll never regret.

121
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,920
You told me that.

122
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,920
Don't say that again. I'm so angry.

123
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,520
Are you sober?

124
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,320
Yes.

125
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,120
I live here.

126
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,720
Thank you for bringing me back.

127
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,320
I'm leaving.

128
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,720
See you tomorrow.

129
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
Come on.

130
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,120
What are you eating today?

131
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,920
Whatever.

132
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,320
Don't eat.

133
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,920
Who is it?

134
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,920
Who are you?

135
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,120
I'm looking for Li Xun.

136
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,720
He's looking for Li Xun?

137
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,520
Long time no see.

138
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,520
I'm here to see you.

139
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,320
I'm here to see you.

140
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,520
I'm here to see you.

141
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,320
What's up?

142
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,520
You're not going to invite me in?

143
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,720
Are you free?

144
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,520
Let's go out for dinner.

145
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,520
No.

146
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,520
I'm cooking.

147
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,920
I didn't prepare you.

148
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,120
It's okay.

149
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,520
I'll prepare.

150
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,520
The dishes are ready.

151
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,720
Please enjoy.

152
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,920
Send Master Wang back first.

153
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,520
Eat more.

154
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
Okay.

155
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,520
Okay.

156
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,720
I'll eat.

157
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,520
How is your company?

158
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,920
You really went?

159
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,520
You and your husband know it.

160
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,720
He's staring at me every day.

161
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,920
Just ask him directly.

162
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,720
I know he'll follow you.

163
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,720
But you're starting out like this.

164
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,520
Don't you feel a little bit boring?

165
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,520
If I stay here,

166
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,920
drive me a car.

167
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,520
My dad has a house with a house of his own.

168
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,120
It's empty.

169
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,320
Why don't you live there?

170
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,520
You don't have to stay here anymore.

171
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,320
You're here to dig up the dumplings.

172
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,720
You want to support me?

173
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,520
Have you ever thought about

174
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,320
if you were with me back then,

175
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,720
everything would be different now?

176
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,520
Can you make up for it now?

177
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,520
I can't.

178
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,320
No.

179
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,520
I feel a little sick.

180
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,520
Li Xun.

181
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,520
Don't you ever know to regret?

182
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,320
Xu Li Na.

183
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
Xu Li Na.

184
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,120
You came to such a cold place

185
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,320
to remind me.

186
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
Thank you.

187
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,520
If I have one thing I don't regret,

188
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,120
it's that I rejected you.

189
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,520
You and Zhu Yun

190
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,520
can never be compared.

191
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,320
I'm sorry.

192
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,320
Take care.

193
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,320
I won't see you off.

194
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,320
Gao has been on a business trip for days.

195
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,120
I have to tell Gao about this.

196
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,520
What are you doing here?

197
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,920
What am I doing here?

198
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,320
I'm here to know my own problems.

199
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,720
Besides using this kind of

200
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
dirty tricks,

201
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,320
what else do you know?

202
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,320
Dirty tricks

203
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,120
are your husband's idea.

204
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,720
It has nothing to do with me.

205
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,320
You're such a good dog.

206
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,920
You're a waste.

207
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,720
Look at you now.

208
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,520
What did I do to you?

209
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,720
Disgusting.

210
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,920
Xu Li Na.

211
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,120
Don't forget

212
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,120
who you're eating and who you're using.

213
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,720
Let's go.

214
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,120
And who's sitting in the car I bought you.

215
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,120
You're too dirty.

216
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,120
Get into the mission room quickly.

217
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,120
I'm so much cleaner than you.

218
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,120
Mom.

219
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,920
It's time to eat.

220
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,640
I like it very much

221
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,440
Thank you, aunt

222
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,480
Come, aunt

223
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,520
Taste my stewed

224
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,720
Tomato beef soup

225
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,440
Why are you so polite?

226
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,600
There are only three of us

227
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Make so many dishes

228
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,960
Are you busy this time?

229
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:27,840
I've been here for two days

230
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,760
Can accompany you

231
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,640
You don't have to accompany me

232
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,120
I'm here this time

233
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,240
Just look at my daughter

234
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,160
What are you busy with

235
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,480
These days

236
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,720
Is it always with me

237
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,840
Making exhibition

238
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,280
I am planning to

239
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,560
Send it back to her these two days

240
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,160
Didn't you just rent this site?

241
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,280
This is a free guest

242
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,720
The site layout is also showing

243
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,520
When did you start this exhibition?

244
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,960
next month

245
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,400
It started next week

246
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,600
Always on display until next month

247
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,960
Good good good

248
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,960
By then

249
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,680
Auntie must be here to support the factory

250
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,480
Let me give you some advice

251
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,720
This is what I told you

252
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,600
I dare you to try it

253
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,540
OK

254
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,960
The trouble is that

255
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,680
Right here

256
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,520
Come

257
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,520
I'll go to thank your aunt

258
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,760
Then

259
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,800
Want to let Zou in here

260
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,140
Helping you prepare for your exhibition

261
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,200
Come

262
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,880
Wish you success in art desires

263
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,000
I know

264
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,680
Nothing wrong

265
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,040
She has been helping mefeit paintings recently

266
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,280
What's wrong?

267
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,720
Mom, I want to say

268
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,480
Though that person has gotten in

269
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,560
Yuanyuan takes it serious

270
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,280
I am worried

271
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,520
Will you sneak up on her?

272
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,600
You must keep an eye on her

273
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,920
Don't worry, aunt

274
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,640
I'll report to you as soon as possible

275
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,280
That's good

276
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,240
I'm relieved to have you

277
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,080
Eat, aunt

278
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,800
Okay

279
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,760
You said you would hold a painting exhibition next week

280
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,520
What if my mom does a surprise check?

281
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,560
She's good

282
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,920
Try my tomato beef soup

283
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,520
I can't believe it

284
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,360
Now Xiuzhu can draw and cook

285
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,400
I'm sorry, aunt.

286
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,360
I'll answer the phone.

287
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,240
Hello?

288
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,440
Mom?

289
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,440
Brother Xiu Zhu,

290
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,960
you're sending the bomb to the police?

291
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,120
You said the exhibition will be held next week.

292
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,800
My mom will be back any time.

293
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,680
What if she gets a sudden attack?

294
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,200
It's nothing.

295
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,640
I'm just worried about her.

296
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,760
I'm worried about her.

297
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,760
I'm worried about her.

298
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,760
I'm worried about her.

299
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,760
I'm worried about her.

300
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,760
I'm worried about her.

301
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,760
I'm worried about her.

302
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,760
I'm worried about her.

303
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,240
It's nothing.

304
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,240
It's simple.

305
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,760
I'm having dinner with aunt Liu and Zhu Yun.

306
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,240
It's almost midnight.

307
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,920
I give up.

308
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,640
I have to go back to work this afternoon.

309
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,880
We can say that we'll meet the exhibition's guest.

310
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,160
Don't say anything about it.

311
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,920
Okay, no problem.

312
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,320
Listen to mom.

313
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,800
Mom, aunt Liu is beside me.

314
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,040
Do you want to talk to her?

315
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,280
Okay.

316
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
Come.

317
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,880
Hello, Jiang.

318
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,520
I...

319
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,720
Hello?

320
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,360
Hello?

321
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,360
Let me see.

322
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,120
It's broken.

323
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,000
The basic facilities abroad are not working.

324
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,360
The signal is too poor.

325
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,000
How about I call again?

326
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,680
Okay.

327
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,720
Stop calling.

328
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,560
Uncle and aunt are going to sleep.

329
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,360
How do you know?

330
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,720
Uncle goes fishing every morning.

331
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,000
Aunt goes running.

332
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,320
It's almost midnight.

333
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,120
You remember it better than me.

334
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,120
It's not a private grassland

335
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,840
next to your house.

336
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,880
In this environment,

337
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,880
it's good to hold a grassland wedding in the future.

338
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,040
I'll go to the art school of Nanhu University.

339
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,160
I have something to talk with you.

340
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,040
I can't accompany you to the wedding.

341
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,160
Aren't you familiar with Nanhu University?

342
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,240
Yes, I am.

343
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,320
I'll go with you.

344
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,520
Yes.

345
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,160
Then I'll take Zhu Yun with me.

346
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,960
No problem.

347
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,080
You can go together.

348
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,440
Leave me the house card.

349
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,040
Okay.

350
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,040
I'll go back first.

351
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,080
Eat shrimp.

352
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,640
Okay.

353
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,880
So weird.

354
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,080
You've been covering me for a long time.

355
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,520
Are you trying to make me send you back to the company?

356
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,400
It's related to three people

357
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,600
and the secret of the entire Fiawanao.

358
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,640
Why are you looking at me?

359
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,560
I'm not.

360
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,880
I'm just a little girl.

361
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,960
Why are you looking at me?

362
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,960
Zhu Yun,

363
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,760
you've changed.

364
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,760
You're different from when you were abroad.

365
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,600
When you were abroad,

366
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,040
you were just a robot to complete your work.

367
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,520
But now you're playing the game you made.

368
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,880
It's full of self-esteem.

369
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,200
It's in your eyes.

370
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,280
After all, this is the first work I want to complete alone.

371
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,360
Okay.

372
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,360
I'll take you upstairs.

373
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,440
No need.

374
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,600
I can go up myself.

375
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,200
You have to let me see

376
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,240
where the new game of China in the future

377
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,200
is born.

378
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,640
We're a small company.

379
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,280
Your elevator is quite old-fashioned.

380
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,000
Wait!

381
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,200
Open it!

382
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,000
Wait!

383
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Hurry up!

384
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Okay.

385
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Okay.

386
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Hurry up.

387
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Hurry up.

388
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Hurry up.

389
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Hurry up.

390
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,280
Hurry up.

391
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,200
I just saw the familiar face

392
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,480
in the living room downstairs.

393
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,480
It's really you.

394
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,880
You're Peng An?

395
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:04,880
Yes.

396
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
You're Zhu Yun's colleague, right?

397
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,120
Yes.

398
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,960
Hello.

399
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,840
I'm Tian Xiu Zhu.

400
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,840
Nice to meet you.

401
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,080
Peng An?

402
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,920
Are you the Tian Xiu Zhu in the picture?

403
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,040
It's me.

404
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,320
You're the idol in my life.

405
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,000
I have two idols in my life.

406
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,360
One is my senior in college,

407
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,200
Xu Kai Yang.

408
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,040
The other is you.

409
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,040
I really like you.

410
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,040
You're so shameless.

411
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,240
Actually,

412
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,800
it's not easy to see

413
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,960
the strength of a company.

414
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,240
It's mainly about its talent.

415
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,320
Your friend

416
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,200
is a double-choice

417
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,560
in our company.

418
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,080
He's a strong-willed person.

419
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,840
In recent years,

420
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,120
the new start-ups in China

421
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,840
are usually at the bottom.

422
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,720
Then they go around step by step.

423
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,120
Li Xun.

424
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,480
Let me introduce you.

425
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,800
I'm the friend of Mr. Zhu.

426
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,520
I'm the famous painter, Tian Xiu Zhu.

427
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,520
I'm here to wish you a happy new year.

428
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,080
I know you.

429
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,480
Mr. Tian.

430
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,960
He's the kind of person

431
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,800
who is very cold.

432
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,640
It's okay.

433
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,480
Drink it.

434
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,640
Okay.

435
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,560
If you don't like it,

436
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,640
I'll add some milk.

437
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,440
Okay.

438
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,840
Thank you.

439
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,720
I've passed.

440
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,600
No wonder.

441
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,160
You're too lazy to do other things.

442
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,000
Mr. Zhu.

443
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,320
We're getting busy.

444
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,840
Why don't you go back first?

445
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,320
Okay.

446
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,640
When will I pick you up later?

447
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,440
No need.

448
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,720
You're coming out with me.

449
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,360
Aunt is waiting for us.

450
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,040
Right.

451
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,440
Come over at five o'clock.

452
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,080
Okay.

453
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,960
I'll go first.

454
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,000
Okay.

455
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,640
I won't bother you with your work.

456
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,320
Mr. Tian.

457
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,320
You're not eating?

458
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,240
No.

459
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,200
Thank you for your kindness.

460
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,640
Thank you.

461
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,760
I'll go first.

462
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,760
You're leaving like this?

463
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,720
I'll send you off.

464
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,360
You're my friend.

465
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,320
You should send me off, too.

466
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:06,840
Go.

467
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,920
Mr. Tian, take care.

468
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,080
Come often if you have nothing to do.

469
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,080
Okay.

470
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,640
Be careful.

471
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,400
I'll go up and say hello to Aunt.

472
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,240
No need.

473
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,200
Mom.

474
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,080
Aunt.

475
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,760
Good timing.

476
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,200
You don't have to go in.

477
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,160
Yunyun.

478
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,560
I rent you a house.

479
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,040
Mom.

480
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,840
Why didn't you

481
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,880
discuss it with me before?

482
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,840
If I discuss it with you,

483
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,320
it'll be too late.

484
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:11,840
You don't even know

485
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,160
how familiar this house is.

486
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,640
Luckily, this afternoon,

487
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,880
I signed the contract

488
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,800
and paid the money immediately.

489
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,480
Otherwise,

490
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,920
we're not the ones

491
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,360
who come to see the house now.

492
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,080
I don't even have the right

493
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,840
to live anywhere now.

494
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,360
You have the right to choose.

495
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,400
I have the right to make decisions.

496
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,720
Xiu Zhu.

497
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,840
What do you think of this house?

498
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,000
Good.

499
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,280
It's very good, Aunt.

500
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,080
The environment here is not only good,

501
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:37,840
but also

502
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,280
the security is particularly good.

503
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,080
I think

504
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,680
the most important thing

505
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,520
is the security.

506
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,280
Because

507
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:45,880
it's one kilometer

508
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,920
from my studio.

509
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,880
It's very close.

510
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,720
Really?

511
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,720
What a coincidence.

512
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,440
Mom.

513
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,120
You and Xiu Zhu

514
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,560
have a good relationship, right?

515
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,520
No.

516
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,040
No.

517
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,600
It has nothing to do with him.

518
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,120
I made the decision

519
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,320
and I've decided to rent this house for you.

520
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,800
How much is the rent for this house?

521
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,560
You don't have to worry about it.

522
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,280
I've paid for you

523
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,200
for three months.

524
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,480
If you have money in the future,

525
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,760
you can return it to me.

526
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,560
I don't have money.

527
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,880
It doesn't matter if you don't return it.

528
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,600
How about this?

529
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,240
I think

530
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,880
I have to invite two aunts

531
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,760
to do the hygiene

532
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,840
and make soup.

533
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,360
They will be the housekeeper.

534
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,360
Mom, you can come out.

535
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,560
Aunt.

536
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,760
How about this?

537
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,640
Zhu Yun is used to

538
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,160
saving money abroad.

539
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,600
Don't make her work too hard when she comes back.

540
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,800
Tomorrow,

541
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,960
I'll find an aunt who cleans up

542
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,360
and I'll pay for it.

543
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,560
If Zhu Yun wants to eat,

544
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,560
drink soup,

545
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,040
go to my studio.

546
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,720
The housekeeper will serve you for 24 hours.

547
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,000
That's great.

548
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Xiu Zhu,

549
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,200
I'll have to trouble you again.

550
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,160
Aunt, you're too polite.

551
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,520
Here, aunt.

552
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,920
Thank you.

553
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,240
It's my pleasure, aunt.

554
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:03,960
Goodbye.

555
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,600
Goodbye, aunt.

556
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,680
You and my mom are a perfect match.

557
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,120
I'll tea you.

558
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,640
Thank you, aunt.

559
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,400
Come on, aunt,

560
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,520
take a seat.

561
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,840
Thanks, aunt.

562
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,320
You come in.

563
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,800
the

564
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:19,600
Let me say that

565
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,440
She is Zhu Yun

566
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,000
There is no past

567
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,200
Really

568
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,840
I should part it

569
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,240
Do you see him as an artists?

570
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,000
Don't mention him to me

571
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,760
Okay okay

572
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,240
I don't mention

573
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,320
If I don't mention

574
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,240
you can't do anything

575
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,360
He's busy.

576
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,440
But the problem of love,

577
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,600
to be honest,

578
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,360
he's childish.

579
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,600
You drove Di Mei away.

580
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,360
You came here again.

581
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,120
How could you kill her?

582
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,040
How did you know

583
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,000
she can't be with you?

584
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,720
You drove her away so selfishly.

585
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,840
Have you asked her about it?

586
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,160
You're alone here,

587
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,160
so you're so bored.

588
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,560
Why don't you ask her

589
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,240
if she's with that Chinese girl?

590
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,400
Me?

591
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,960
How can I ask her?

592
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,000
How?

593
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,200
You're so stubborn.

594
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,760
If I were you,

595
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,840
I wouldn't learn anything from you.

596
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,920
That's how to treat women.

597
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,920
Women are the most expensive flowers

598
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,240
in the world.

599
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,800
A little wind blows

600
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,360
will affect their smell and fragrance.

601
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,160
So their heart is

602
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,520
much faster than that of men.

603
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,920
Why are you so disgusting?

604
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,120
Stop jumping.

605
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,560
Stop.

606
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,960
You know,

607
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,320
you didn't give anyone a chance.

608
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,280
You only made your own choice.

609
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,640
So you don't know

610
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,040
how others have been through.

611
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,840
I don't know if he still loves you,

612
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,720
but I know one thing.

613
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,120
If you have a goal now,

614
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,720
he'll be the most ungrateful person in the world.

615
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,240
You're the most capable person.

616
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,520
Love is not a computer.

617
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,840
You should be more mature

618
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,880
to know 0 and 1.

619
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,120
The computer doesn't know 0 and 1.

620
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,040
It only accepts two inputs.

621
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,920
Because digital circuit can only accept 0 and 1.

622
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,480
Digital circuit can only accept 0 and 1

623
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,200
because there are only two non-linear electronic components

624
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,200
in the non-linear area.

625
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,840
Stop.

626
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,480
Before this matter is completely resolved,

627
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,920
I won't think about it anymore.

628
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,000
Then he'll think about it.

629
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,360
He's different from you.

630
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,480
He's easily confused,

631
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,040
especially in your case.

632
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,280
If it's really impossible,

633
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,800
don't let him misunderstand

634
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,440
and don't let him miss

635
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,800
his chance.

636
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,200
You know,

637
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,720
your tenderness is a double to him.

638
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,520
Once he feels that you can't let go,

639
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,400
it's hard to get out of this whirlpool.

640
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,040
Who said I can't let go?

641
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,680
Then why are you here?

642
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,840
I think

643
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,480
you're jealous.

644
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,800
You're away that the evidence grows,

645
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,480
but you think forever.

646
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:20,120
What

647
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,440
doesstand-out

648
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,040
is that you don't trust me.

649
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,520
So you're in love

650
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,760
with a girl

651
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,440
and a fellow guest in the office.

652
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,440
Go away!

653
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,560
from your mouth

654
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,680
is so vulgar.

655
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,480
No.

656
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,280
I thought you were praising your innocence.

657
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:44,600
Yes.

658
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,560
It's just two people

659
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,320
working on computers together,

660
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,760
working late at night,

661
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,200
and going to the same place.

662
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,120
Isn't this a job?

663
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,400
It's all for work.

664
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,720
But let me tell you.

665
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,600
We're going to start

666
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,560
doing the weapon next week.

667
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,240
And...

668
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,560
Who wants to hear you say that?

669
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,480
You're so annoying.

670
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,440
Anyway, I've had coffee now.

671
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,200
I'm very energetic.

672
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,400
If you don't say anything today,

673
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,760
we won't let you go.

674
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,160
Tell me.

675
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,800
What do you think?

676
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,520
What do I think?

677
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,600
I've made a deal with him.

678
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,360
We're just ordinary colleagues.

679
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,800
You're so stubborn.

680
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,400
Let me ask you this.

681
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,800
Are you happy?

682
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,760
Yes.

683
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,280
I can do what I like.

684
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,280
I won't feel tired.

685
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,560
Just like when we were at the base.

686
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,240
To be honest,

687
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,040
I've known you for so many years.

688
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,600
I can only see you like this

689
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,800
when I'm with Li Xun.

690
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,280
Passion, impulsiveness,

691
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,480
and courage.

692
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,360
It seems that you're not afraid of anything.

693
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,800
He has changed me.

694
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,440
If I hadn't joined the base,

695
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,000
I wouldn't have known

696
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,320
how much I like Biancheng.

697
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,240
But it's all in the past.

698
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,440
It's all in the past.

699
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,320
Now,

700
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,120
I'm speaking to him

701
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,520
with a positive tone.

702
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,560
I'm going to burn incense

703
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,080
even if we can have a normal chat.

704
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,960
You're afraid because you care too much.

705
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,840
I'm worried for you two.

706
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,240
You've been hanging around for so many years.

707
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,560
What's the point of it?

708
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,520
If you like someone, you can be together.

709
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,600
If you don't, you can break up.

710
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,480
Is it hard?

711
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,400
Why don't you just change your partner?

712
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,840
You can choose any of my boyfriends.

713
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,400
I'll give you a probation period.

714
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,040
If you're not satisfied for three days, you can cancel it.

715
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,800
Is that okay?

716
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,960
My clients are okay, too.

717
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,160
Get out.

718
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,040
Drink your drink.

719
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,920
It's already past

720
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,120
the scheduled time to board the ship.

721
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,600
Get on board.

722
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,080
I'll try again.

723
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,200
It's time,

724
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,680
but you're waiting for your client to scold you.

725
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:49,840
I'll be right there.

726
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,840
When can you get on the horse?

727
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,280
I'll be there soon.

728
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,840
How is it toiness?

729
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,840
Bro Xi Yang.

730
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:28,740
Don't jump

731
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,020
That's gentle.

732
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:37,340
I can't just ignore that.

733
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:46,900
I had my mission failed by my previous wife So I'm媽媽這樣的

734
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,040
Don't you see that's embroidery?

735
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:55,780
That's http://streeplow.org

736
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,500
Fruit F thread

737
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:03,000
Believe it or not, this is fine, if she doesn't like it

738
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,940
I don't know

739
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,940
You have to remember

740
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,340
This company has no product on the line

741
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,260
Wu Di and Wu Jiang are our only bullets now

742
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,620
If you can't do it well, you'll be screwed

743
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,660
You have to be with you for two years

744
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,100
Am I too weak and broken?

745
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,940
Team leader Zhu

746
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,900
You don't need anyone's approval now

747
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,620
And you don't need me

748
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,940
You should trust yourself

749
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,420
I feel

750
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,900
What Big Brother said is right

751
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,020
People have to believe in themselves

752
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,020
You don't even believe in yourself

753
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:41,820
How can you believe in others?

754
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,980
How can you live in a family in the future?

755
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,620
Get out

756
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:44,500
Okay

757
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,540
You have to believe in yourself

758
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,220
Get out

759
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,860
I forgot to talk about it

760
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,420
You have to be honest

761
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,900
You don't have to worry about yourself

762
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,740
Be honest

763
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,720
it's good

764
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,020
It's quite fun

765
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,660
Now all the customers

766
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,060
Half-hearted

767
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,260
I think our game is good

768
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:46,940
Not bad not bad

769
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,460
But

770
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,020
Our game is really good

771
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,020
Still have to wait for the official thread

772
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:55,860
After download

773
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,740
Do the operation promotion

774
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,380
Do it well

775
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,060
Don't be reluctant to spend money

776
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,060
Use money to wipe

777
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,140
I have done it

778
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,140
You can't have a leg

779
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,020
I tell you

780
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,940
If there is something wrong with you

781
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,180
I tell you to be careful with your leg

782
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,260
Do you understand

783
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,180
Not not not

784
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:12,900
Three pieces

785
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,460
Where to promote

786
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,180
Where to promote

787
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,060
Where is the money to promote

788
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,100
Why not

789
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,220
I see the report

790
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:25,740
Isn't it written

791
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,540
Have promotion fee

792
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,060
Correct

793
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,180
I don't know that money

794
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,020
You and that one

795
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,380
Did you pay the salary?

796
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,380
This salary is salary

797
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,540
Promotion is promotion

798
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:33,980
This product

799
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,060
So much money invested

800
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,500
If you don't promote it, you'll lose money

801
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,340
I

802
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,620
How much is there

803
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,300
Five million

804
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:43,940
Five thousand

805
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,860
How many thousand yuan are you kidding

806
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,460
Can i not understand that

807
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:48,940
No money

808
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,380
No money

809
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,660
Is that my responsibility

810
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:51,820
Yes

811
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,380
You are the financial director

812
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,580
Yes

813
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,860
You can't do it

814
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,700
Don't worry

815
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,580
Listen to the propaganda

816
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,620
I will think of a way after I come out

817
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,060
This is my masterpiece

818
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,580
How about it

819
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,220
OK

820
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,260
This time you are unconstrained

821
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,860
I think ok

822
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,540
I don't think so

823
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,740
It's too ordinary.

824
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:31,340
Ordinary? What does that mean?

825
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,340
The impact rate isn't enough.

826
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,140
Can you still fix it?

827
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,740
I've tried my best.

828
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,340
I know you've tried your best.

829
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,340
But the concept poster is the front.

830
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,340
It's the user's first impression.

831
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,940
You must make it look good.

832
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,540
What should I do then?

833
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,340
Push it back.

834
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,340
I knew you'd say that.

835
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:58,140
No, it's too late.

836
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,740
I think it's about right.

837
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,340
You have to change it.

838
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,340
But don't you dislike what I said.

839
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,140
This is his ability.

840
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,340
His ability is here.

841
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,740
He's not a great painter.

842
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:15,540
If you give him more time, he won't be able to make it.

843
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:18,340
That's not wrong.

844
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,140
I'm tired.

845
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,140
I'm tired.

846
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,140
I'm tired.

847
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,740
Wait.

848
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,740
What are you going to do?

849
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,740
Change it to a painting wall?

850
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,940
Change it to a painting wall?

851
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,140
There's a professional in the tree.

852
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:27,340
What are we going to do about this?

853
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,340
Shut up.

854
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,940
I'm sorry, sir.

855
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,140
I found out that the hospital lady

856
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,540
left the room a few days ago.

857
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,740
There's no recording of her after that.

858
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,940
What are you doing?

859
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,940
Help me check if there's any information about Zhu Ying's rental house.

860
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,340
Send me the address when you find it.

861
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,540
Now?

862
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,340
I'll find it for you right now.

863
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,940
This is your business.

864
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,940
No.

865
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:30,340
You're going to order me around every night, right?

866
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,140
I hung up.

867
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,140
I'm going to sleep.

868
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,940
I'm going to sleep.

869
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,940
I'm going to sleep.

870
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,740
I'm going to sleep.

871
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,140
I hung up again.

872
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,540
Hello, it's me.

873
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,740
Say it.

874
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,340
Help me call the police.

875
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,340
Ask where Zhu Ying is staying.

876
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:06,940
Big Brother, your relationship with the police is too bad.

877
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,340
Help me ask.

878
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,940
Okay, okay.

879
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,540
Thanks.

880
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,540
Thank you.

881
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:31,540
If you want my help, just tell me.

882
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,540
How did you know?

883
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,740
You have been staring at those posters all night.

884
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,140
You're so slow.

885
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,740
This isn't hard for me.

886
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,140
Moreover,

887
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,740
it's not hard for you to talk to me.

888
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,140
But,

889
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:56,340
our company just started.

890
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:00,540
The capital issue is a bit tense.

891
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,140
There's no revenge.

892
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:03,740
There is. There's definitely a revenge.

893
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:06,540
Just, how much do you think is appropriate?

894
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,540
Let's just forget about the debt.

895
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,940
I won't say thank you.

896
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:14,940
No, no, no.

897
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,140
You have to thank me.

898
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:19,940
I'll pay you back when I have enough.

899
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,340
Okay.

900
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,940
When do you want it?

901
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,540
I think it's convenient for you.

902
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,540
How about tomorrow?

903
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,540
Are you saying that I'm convenient?

904
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,140
Then tomorrow night is fine too.

905
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,940
The sooner, the better.

906
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:37,740
Where are you going?

907
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,540
I'm going to clean up and go back to the studio to work.

908
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:43,740
Then I'll go with you.

909
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,540
Let's work together.

910
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:13,540
I think that starting tomorrow,

911
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,740
you should become bit more neglectful,

912
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,640
a medium life is fine with me.

913
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,840
Then don't be afraid to 1,000 down,

914
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,240
and tell me that there won't be the main teacher.

915
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:34,140
I still have plans in advance,

916
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,740
but I plan something else to send out today.

917
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:40,140
Is Ti Zack is doing something at school?

918
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:40,900
Theester.

919
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,100
Thomas,

920
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,420
get ready,

921
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,260
say it.

922
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,820
You said you were not in love with anything else.

923
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:50,900
In the end,

924
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,140
you got yourself

925
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,180
rejected by your both of friends for being two people.

926
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,260
What do you want?

927
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:08,860
I do like you.

928
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:09,820
But so what?

929
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,100
Where did you call her?

930
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:46,260
We won't be separated

931
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,540
Get out of the noisy world

932
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:56,140
Accompany me, I'm your new compass

933
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:59,180
Raise me up bravely

934
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:05,740
Like the flame of the night

935
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:10,740
Because I believe I love you

936
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:15,060
True love will take its course

937
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:19,740
I'm by your side

938
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:23,940
Spending all the time with you

939
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:28,540
Because I believe I want you

940
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:33,340
True love will take its course

941
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:36,460
I am yours

942
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,060
All the time

943
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,180
To never let go

944
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,660
Your scent, it's nice

945
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,340
No one has said anything

946
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:54,780
Right, I want you

947
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:28,780
I will stand by your side

948
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:31,780
Just be brave

949
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,780
Every dream I have

950
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:41,780
I won't, I won't, I won't lose to time

951
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:46,780
Cause I believe I love you

952
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:50,780
True love will take its course

953
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:55,780
