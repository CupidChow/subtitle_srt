YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if the light is very bright

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will still watch over that vast vast land

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless atmosphere

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day, the lens is a little bit yellow

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast night?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I burn up the night just for you to remember

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How everything was in the beginning

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The wind and the color of the night are like wild grass

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The mountains are broken, but you are still by my side

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Everything is how it was in the beginning

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The Long Ballad

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Episode 2

00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yuan Di

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Shopping

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's rare to see you so free

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's weekend, I don't have to go to the base

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm free, too

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You also shop?

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Together?

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm waiting for someone

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You have an appointment

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'll go first

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Go

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'll go first

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Do you think Zhu Yun has changed?

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Why?

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
He used to be a substitute

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
He always felt troublesome

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Now he has the guts to say something

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and argue with you

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
He dares to scold people?

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You are different

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
In your heart

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
you only have your own goal

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Now you also argue with people and argue with each other

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Bixun, what's the situation?

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Is it a hit or an accident?

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I have my plan

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Any accident can't happen in this plan

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Do you understand?

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
OK

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Let's go

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The house I made is in front

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Go

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Go

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Thanks

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Fang Shimiao

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
How many people are in your project group?

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Wu Muxing and I

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll add you later

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm leaving

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Li Xun

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Does Ren Di usually come to the project?

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
No

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Why do you add him?

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I want to earn some points for him

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I don't want to let the unemployed add me

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You can do something first

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
before you say it

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The requirement for transfer is too high

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
and there are some art points

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But our school website

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
is really bad

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's not smooth at all

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Is it because you use too many pictures?

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You are finally back

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I have filled up the whole oil

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
and washed all the clothes

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and poured two bags of garbage

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's really boring

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Then you come to the base

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
There are so many people in the project

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
who are not good enough to work

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What's wrong with you?

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Who blamed you?

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Ren Di

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You don't participate in the base activity

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
and you are not good enough

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
to hang your name on my project group

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Do you like to

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
control people everywhere?

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You don't do anything

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Why should I hang your name?

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You work for nothing

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You can't come to the school early

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and you don't come back at night

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I have helped you

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
to cover up many times

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You don't even say thank you

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Did I ask you to help me?

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
If I were not the class monitor

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
do you think I would want to help you?

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
When you were the class monitor

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I didn't raise my hand to vote

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So I don't care about you

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What kind of logic is this?

104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You just quit school and quit speed

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Anyway, you don't come

106
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Waste resources

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Don't be angry

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You are a crazy girl

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You are a dog-eating dog

110
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He is just like this

111
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You know it

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I think he is more than Li Xun

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
He is not good at everything

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
They are really match

115
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What do you mean?

116
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
He is with Li Xun

117
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
He came to the base

118
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
to find Li Xun several times

119
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
in the middle of the night

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Li Xun was so rude

121
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He just saw

122
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
that he had a bone in front of him

123
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
He left with a finger

124
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
They left in the same night

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
One man and one woman

126
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What else can he do?

127
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
They are all adults

128
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What are you afraid of?

129
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I went shopping today

130
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I saw them

131
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
meeting each other

132
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He is so mischievous

133
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I thought he was

134
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
so cool

135
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He cares about

136
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
the two students at the base

137
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Human enemy and Li Xun

138
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
No way

139
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
They are like ice cubes

140
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
They won't freeze to death

141
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I told you

142
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You don't believe me

143
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You don't believe me

144
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You don't believe me

145
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You are just like me

146
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I don't believe you

147
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I will not stay here

148
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You want to change the dormitory

149
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Don't mind

150
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Fang Shu Miao is not against you

151
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
He is straightforward

152
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Don't be impulsive

153
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm not going to change my dorm.

154
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's good.

155
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Then why are you going to do so many things?

156
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm going to quit school.

157
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I already told my dad when I was in the senior year.

158
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
As long as I can get into college,

159
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I can do what I want to do.

160
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Play guitar, play the band,

161
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
and live my life as I want.

162
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You're here.

163
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You're not going to a good college.

164
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You're too different.

165
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Everyone is different.

166
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Fang Shu Miao is right.

167
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm a waste.

168
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I shouldn't waste my four years.

169
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Then I won't see you again.

170
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
What?

171
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm not dead.

172
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I rented a house near the school.

173
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm working.

174
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Come and play when you have time.

175
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Rendy,

176
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
you have to be careful.

177
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You're in a reasonable situation now.

178
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You're living with Li Xun now.

179
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You have to protect yourself.

180
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm serious.

181
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Fang Shu Miao told you?

182
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I guessed.

183
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
How did you guess it?

184
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Just by that time,

185
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
you accidentally met him on the street?

186
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'll tell you a secret.

187
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm not the one who likes Li Xun.

188
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's Fang Shu Miao.

189
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
When did it happen?

190
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Why do you think he should stay at the base?

191
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
His brain is very difficult to get along with Li Xun.

192
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But it's useless.

193
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
He can't hold on for long.

194
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
A woman like Li Xun can't keep up with a woman.

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm leaving.

196
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Rendy,

197
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
you're so brave.

198
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You're so nice.

199
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Zhu Yu,

200
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
you're actually braver than me.

201
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
But you don't know it yet.

202
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Rendy doesn't live in the dormitory anymore.

203
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What did I say that day?

204
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You don't believe it?

205
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
She dropped out of school.

206
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's not necessary to have a relationship.

207
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm not going to let you go.

208
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm going to give you a good lesson.

209
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's not necessary to have a relationship.

210
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You can put yourself in it.

211
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
She said she didn't date Li Xun.

212
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
She didn't live with him.

213
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Well,

214
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
it's not necessary to skip school.

215
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Forget it.

216
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's her own business.

217
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm here to do nothing.

218
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
She never said I was the monitor.

219
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Can you talk nicely?

220
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I don't like her.

221
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
She doesn't like me.

222
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Oh, right.

223
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Look at this for me.

224
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You're developing a website.

225
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's hard to fix it.

226
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The Blue Cane Food Company.

227
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Look at what's written here.

228
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The functions required are not what we can do now.

229
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Li Xun said

230
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
we can add credits only when the project is completed.

231
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
But I can't finish it.

232
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What should we do?

233
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Retreat?

234
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I don't think so.

235
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Forget it.

236
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I don't want to.

237
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Let's go.

238
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Let's go eat.

239
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
How about I cook for you?

240
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
How's it going?

241
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
She said we can't use it.

242
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Zhu Yu.

243
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Why are you here?

244
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Why can't we use that program?

245
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Zhu Yu.

246
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I asked for her.

247
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's so hard to do what others do

248
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
for nothing.

249
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You denied it in a word.

250
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What's your reason?

251
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Anything bad can be valuable.

252
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Your program

253
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
is actually a failure.

254
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It has no potential or value.

255
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's just a low level student.

256
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You can't do anything about it.

257
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm not angry.

258
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Why are you angry?

259
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Let's go.

260
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Don't be angry.

261
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The website has been set.

262
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Although there are dozens of people at the base,

263
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
the core team

264
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
only has Li Xun and Lao Gao.

265
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I think your program is fine.

266
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Maybe it's not as good as their idea.

267
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I think

268
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
it's just a little bit of a mistake.

269
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I think

270
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
the problem

271
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
is probably different from their idea.

272
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
What idea?

273
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Just make it work.

274
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What's the difference?

275
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
How do I know?

276
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Okay, okay.

277
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I've saved my tuition.

278
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
We're on the same page.

279
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Let's go shopping on the west street.

280
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
We're finally done with this.

281
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't want to be in Biancheng for a second.

282
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Let's go.

283
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
No.

284
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What?

285
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Where are we going?

286
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You wrote it well.

287
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Zhu Yue.

288
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I found that your codes are all very short.

289
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Did you go through it several times?

290
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Didn't the teacher say that the shorter the better?

291
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yes.

292
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I did say that.

293
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I remember the first time I taught you,

294
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I emphasized that

295
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
don't be addicted to it.

296
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You're a miracle.

297
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You have to be good at it.

298
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Zhu Yue, do you like Biancheng?

299
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Why did you choose this major?

300
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
My mom chose it for me.

301
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I've seen a lot of kids like you.

302
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You've had a good family background.

303
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You've had good grades.

304
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You've been growing up well.

305
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But then you suddenly found

306
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
that you didn't know what you wanted.

307
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Think about it.

308
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
If you really like Biancheng,

309
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I suggest you try it at Li Xun's.

310
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Why?

311
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Have you seen Harry Potter?

312
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Sometimes I feel that

313
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Li Xun is like the Elysian Mirror in there.

314
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
When you stand in front of him,

315
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
you'll find your deep thoughts.

316
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
He's so strong and persistent.

317
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's hard not to go to him.

318
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Think about what you want.

319
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
This base is not for making money.

320
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You can use your spare time

321
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
to go there and exercise.

322
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You can learn a lot.

323
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
The third module is to determine the blood type.

324
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Mr. Ke,

325
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
shouldn't you be a good teacher?

326
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
What do you mean?

327
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Are you coming?

328
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You come.

329
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'll treat you.

330
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You come.

331
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'll treat you.

332
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
What did you mean by that?

333
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You can't be late at 7 a.m. tomorrow.

334
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Did he invite me?

335
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
So this game is a must-win?

336
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yes.

337
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Then why did you let me play?

338
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You're not good at it.

339
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Mr. Ke,

340
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
shouldn't you be a good teacher?

341
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Are you coming?

342
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You come.

343
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'll treat you.

344
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
This is the fun of being a person.

345
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Isn't it great?

346
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm not good at it.

347
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm not good at it.

348
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm not good at it.

349
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm not good at it.

350
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm not good at it.

351
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm not good at it.

352
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm not good at it.

353
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm not good at it.

354
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm not good at it.

355
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm not good at it.

356
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm not good at it.

357
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm not good at it.

358
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm not good at it.

359
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm not good at it.

360
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm not good at it.

361
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm not good at it.

362
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm not good at it.

363
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm not good at it.

364
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm not good at it.

365
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm not good at it.

366
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm not good at it.

367
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm not good at it.

368
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm not good at it.

369
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm not good at it.

370
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,440
It's hard.

371
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,440
Let's wait.

372
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,280
Here.

373
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,840
Take it out of here.

374
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,800
Is your document completed?

375
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,080
Not yet.

376
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,000
No, I don't have time.

377
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,000
I can come and go as I please.

378
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,080
What's going on? You joined the base too?

379
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,920
Li Xun asked me to come.

380
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,920
Wu Mengqing and Fang Shumiao.

381
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,700
You two can continue from yesterday.

382
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,700
What about me?

383
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,700
I'm here.

384
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,700
That's it.

385
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,700
When Boss Li doesn't arrange the task,

386
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,700
he can do anything.

387
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,700
How about you play with me?

388
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,940
The internet speed is fast.

389
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,700
I can't play any game.

390
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,700
But why do I have to get up at six in the morning

391
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,200
and play games here?

392
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,320
Come on, do some work.

393
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,700
Help her do some homework.

394
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,700
Do whatever you want.

395
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,700
Whatever?

396
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,280
I can't do that.

397
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,240
Help me translate an art paper.

398
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,580
Which one do you want?

399
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,500
This one.

400
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,540
This is not an art paper.

401
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,040
This is a personal keyboard.

402
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,380
Whatever.

403
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,740
I can do my homework.

404
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,540
Okay.

405
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,540
The painter is quite neat.

406
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,540
I'll leave it to you, Junior.

407
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,660
Beautiful.

408
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,540
Add something to it.

409
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,540
You're done so quickly?

410
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,540
Anything else?

411
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,540
You're indeed a representative.

412
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,540
You're a fast writer.

413
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,540
I'm not here to write homework for others.

414
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,540
I'm just doing a job.

415
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,540
Don't forget that I'm the one you hired.

416
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,540
Don't you forget about the invitation?

417
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,540
Don't pretend.

418
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,540
Okay.

419
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,540
Okay.

420
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,540
What do you mean okay?

421
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,540
Come, come, come.

422
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,540
Stop, stop, stop.

423
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,540
I'll announce...

424
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,540
Come here.

425
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,540
Zhu Yin.

426
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,540
What do you want?

427
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,540
Come here.

428
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,540
I'll announce.

429
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,540
This is the princess I hired.

430
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,540
I'll host the class tonight.

431
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,540
I'll welcome the princess.

432
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,540
Thank you.

433
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,540
No need.

434
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,540
That won't do.

435
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,540
I hired her after all.

436
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,540
I can't let anyone else suffer.

437
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,540
Not the princess.

438
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,540
I must have offended you in the past life.

439
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,540
I'm sorry.

440
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,540
I'm sorry.

441
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,540
I'm sorry.

442
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,540
I'm sorry.

443
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,540
I'm sorry.

444
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,540
I'm sorry.

445
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,540
I'm sorry.

446
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,540
I'm sorry.

447
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,540
I'm sorry.

448
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,540
I'm sorry.

449
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,540
I'm sorry.

450
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,540
I'm sorry.

451
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,540
I'm sorry.

452
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,540
I'm sorry.

453
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,540
I'm sorry.

454
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,540
Sorry.

455
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,540
I Jean bolt.

456
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,540
It's really the handgun model.

457
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,540
It's true.

458
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,540
Ah.

459
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,540
assault.

460
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,540
Arse.

461
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,780
My self-esteem left my desk

462
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,780
And when the light shiner falls

463
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,380
I left behind the

464
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:13,580
장

465
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,340
Just you

466
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,220
You

467
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,940
It's really him

468
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,900
It's not cool

469
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,340
I'm so drunk today

470
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:35,940
I can't stop thinking about you

471
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,340
I'm so drunk today

472
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,740
I can't stop thinking about you

473
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:46,340
I'm so drunk today

474
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,540
I can't stop thinking about you

475
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:52,940
I'm so drunk today

476
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,340
I can't stop thinking about you

477
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,140
I'm so drunk today

478
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,140
I can't stop thinking about you

479
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,740
I'm so happy

480
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,140
Why are you singing here?

481
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,940
Yes, we are singing here

482
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,340
We are studying here

483
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,940
They don't have food

484
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,140
You can go get some

485
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,540
Hi

486
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,140
Enough, stop it

487
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,940
Li Xun is busy in love

488
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,140
He has no time to work

489
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:26,740
Really?

490
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,540
So many

491
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,940
I'm not doing this for him

492
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,140
Besides, who can come to the base

493
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,540
to get points for that?

494
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,940
Are you making up a story?

495
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,940
What are you doing?

496
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,540
I'm the one who made the online page of Lan Guan

497
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,740
See, how is it?

498
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,940
Li Xun made it

499
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,340
He just said it was a rough one

500
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,740
I wrote the real work

501
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,940
I wrote the code for each line

502
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,140
I can't stop thinking about it

503
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,340
I'm so drunk

504
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,540
But I feel very accomplished

505
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,140
The flash is only available next week

506
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,140
You can use it

507
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,540
So we need to

508
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,940
rely on practice

509
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,540
If Gao enters the company

510
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,940
he will be so happy

511
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,340
It's his own project

512
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,540
He has to do it with his heart

513
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,540
Besides

514
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,740
he came to the base to learn from each other

515
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,340
No one can tell the boss apart

516
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,940
If I enter the base

517
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,940
I will do the same

518
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,940
Impossible

519
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,140
You just came

520
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,140
You can't enter the core project

521
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,940
Don't worry

522
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,940
Li Xun is a bad talker

523
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,140
But he can learn something at the base

524
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,940
You're right

525
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,340
I regret it

526
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,740
after a day

527
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,940
We are here, don't regret it

528
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,340
Not bad

529
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,340
Your hand

530
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,940
You can help me later

531
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,740
Go

532
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,940
Come

533
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,740
Excuse me

534
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,540
Don't go

535
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,340
Keep the contact, little girl

536
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,340
What are you doing?

537
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,340
Call the police

538
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,140
Another girl

539
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,540
Why did you come out of the male toilet?

540
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,540
What are you doing in the male toilet, little girl?

541
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,340
Get out of here

542
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,940
You are a man and a woman

543
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,140
I'll check the goods

544
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,140
Get out

545
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:07,940
What are you doing?

546
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,740
Go away

547
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,140
Get up

548
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,540
Li Xun

549
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,140
I'll send Lao Wu back first

550
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,940
Don't help me

551
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,740
You can't do this

552
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,140
I'll go buy some medicine

553
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,940
Don't drive

554
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,140
Just drive

555
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,140
At least change a place to sing

556
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,740
Can you beat someone?

557
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,540
You go online

558
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,740
You have no face in your heart

559
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,140
Isn't she your friend?

560
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,940
Sorry

561
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,140
Thank you

562
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,140
It's all my fault

563
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,740
It's okay, I don't blame you

564
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,940
It's not your business

565
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,540
You take a break

566
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,340
Put some medicine

567
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,740
I had a good day

568
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,140
What are you mumbling about?

569
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,740
Nothing

570
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,340
Be honest

571
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,540
Make someone like you

572
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,540
What are you thinking about?

573
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,540
Say it

574
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,140
Can you help her to write her own homework?

575
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,540
Your girlfriend is the best

576
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,140
Why should I help her?

577
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,140
Really?

578
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,140
I'll quit if you do this again

579
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,940
I'm done

580
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,740
I'll go now

581
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,540
You can come and go

582
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,940
It's not reasonable to be here

583
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,340
Let me go

584
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,740
Your girlfriend is coming

585
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,140
Who said she is my girlfriend?

586
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,340
Isn't she?

587
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,340
Give me your hand

588
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,540
Go back and see for yourself

589
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,940
I am sorry

590
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,340
I need some rest

591
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,540
Your majesty

592
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,540
The logic of this Peony is all based on Goutube

593
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,540
Did you let your graph become a puppy again?

594
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,040
Look at everything

595
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,140
You're going to watch pageants with me?

596
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,140
If I am born with bad luck

597
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,140
What a bad name.

598
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,140
The name should be simplified.

599
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,140
You should use the verb, not the verb.

600
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,140
You should use the name, not the name.

601
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,140
How does he know that I wrote this function?

602
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,140
Ten points.

603
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,140
Why can't I use that program?

604
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,140
Your program...

605
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:05,140
is actually a failure in both the present and the future.

606
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,140
It has no possibility or value.

607
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,140
It's just a level of a student.

608
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,140
If you can't use it, then you can't use it.

609
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,140
Let's go.

610
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:19,140
The autumn in the garden is actually a destined encounter

611
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:25,140
Let me feel your hands and feet, your simple wishes

612
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,140
A blink of an eye, the time has passed

613
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,140
I'm not afraid of the huge world

614
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:37,140
With you by my side, I say good night every night

615
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:42,140
So this afternoon, you're going to change my program?

616
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,140
Tomorrow at seven o'clock.

617
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,140
You're a ghost.

618
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,140
This time it's real.

619
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,140
I know.

620
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:08,140
The autumn in the fairy tale is actually a destined encounter

621
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:13,140
Let me feel your hands and feet, your simple wishes

622
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:18,140
A blink of an eye, the time has passed

623
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,140
I'm not afraid of the huge world

624
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:26,140
With you by my side, I say good night every night

625
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:34,140
The autumn in the fairy tale is actually a destined encounter

626
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:39,140
Let me feel your hands and feet, your simple wishes

627
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:42,140
It turns out to be a dream

628
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,140
I'm not afraid of the huge world

629
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:54,140
With you by my side, I say good night every night

630
00:29:54,140 --> 00:30:01,140
The autumn in the fairy tale is actually a destined encounter

631
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:07,140
Let me feel your hands and feet, your simple wishes

632
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,140
A blink of an eye, the time has passed

633
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:15,140
I'm not afraid of the huge world

634
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:20,140
With you by my side, I say good night every night

635
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:26,140
The autumn in the fairy tale is actually a destined encounter

636
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:31,140
Let me feel your hands and feet, your simple wishes

637
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:35,140
A blink of an eye, the time has passed

638
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:39,140
I'm not afraid of the huge world

639
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:43,140
With you by my side, I say good night every night

640
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:51,140
The autumn in the fairy tale is actually a destined encounter

641
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:56,140
Let me feel your hands and feet, your simple wishes

642
00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:00,140
A blink of an eye, the time has passed

643
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:04,140
I'm not afraid of the huge world

644
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:08,140
With you by my side, I say good night every night

645
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:18,140
In my world, with you I say good night

646
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,260
Look

647
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,960
Actually, I have nothing to do annul Oh

648
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:27,860
Very does

649
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,640
Check

650
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,860
You still rely on that攻

651
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:46,100
There are two models in my THERE

652
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,940
Ordinary and special

653
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,020
I'm not good at it

654
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,660
Feng Shumiao said the money earned by the management

655
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,620
can only be paid by the factory and the management fee

656
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,820
You are the same

657
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,060
You have to share the money with the school

658
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,580
How much?

659
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,980
So the princess wants to make money too

660
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,180
I came for your money

661
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,660
I am usually pretty high

662
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,420
It's all pretending

663
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,540
Compared with Boss Li

664
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,860
I'm inferior

665
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,980
The whole base

666
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,460
is for you to work and make money

667
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,460
I am full of small things

668
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:19,860
vulgar

669
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,380
Say it again

670
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:31,660
Misunderstood

671
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,380
Say it again

672
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:32,980
Misunderstood

673
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,540
Say it

674
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,260
You misunderstood

675
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:34,500
Say it

676
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,220
I didn't mean that

677
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:35,820
Say it again

678
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,580
No, I really

679
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,740
What do you mean?

680
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,460
I go to the bathroom

681
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,380
Don't run

682
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,460
You entrust me

683
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:50,940
Miss Zhu

684
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,300
What's wrong with me?

685
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,780
Nothing, very good

686
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,260
Someone is coming

687
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,540
Are you afraid to see or am I afraid to see?

688
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,820
Squad leader Fang

689
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,180
Please have breakfast

690
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,100
I'm fine

691
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,860
I won't get up

692
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,140
Princess, come here

693
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,140
Princess

694
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,740
Bring stuff for home

695
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:41,820
Ever since today

696
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,380
yuns in my business

697
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,200
Cancer

698
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,660
What?

699
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,460
information

700
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:55,620
And your atrás on my Anurelis is so strong.

701
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,820
It looksIt's looking great.

702
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,260
You can get in when you just come in.

703
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,420
Great!

704
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,600
At leastwe haven't wasted our cuálmes.

705
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,340
Director,우L BOX g andy.

706
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,500
I agree with Gao.

707
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,660
It's yours.

708
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,620
Actually, Gao's writing program is not bad.

709
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,180
There's no need to reverse it completely.

710
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:29,980
We have to redo it.

711
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,460
Can we really do it?

712
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,260
No, how can we do it?

713
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,820
I think it's okay on the surface.

714
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,340
Just change the details and logic.

715
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,100
Besides,

716
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,780
we don't have time to redo it now.

717
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,380
But there's no problem with logic.

718
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,780
There's no time to redo it.

719
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,140
And there's no better idea.

720
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,820
There's no need to waste time.

721
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,420
I said we should redo it.

722
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,340
So we should.

723
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,460
Li Xun,

724
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,940
you brought this project here.

725
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,340
But you didn't do it alone.

726
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,780
We agreed to cooperate.

727
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,940
We have to discuss it.

728
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,380
If you say so,

729
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,060
we can't work anymore.

730
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:02,860
Am I right?

731
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,260
Okay.

732
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,820
I'll listen to you.

733
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,060
I'll write it with you.

734
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:17,580
Okay.

735
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,660
I think you're right in this part.

736
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,580
You just need to change it.

737
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,460
Change the details.

738
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,700
I'll write this part.

739
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:24,700
Okay.

740
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,380
Next part.

741
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,020
Okay.

742
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,020
Hello.

743
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:50,620
Hello.

744
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:51,460
Hello.

745
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:52,660
Hi.

746
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,620
Come back earlier.

747
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,540
Have a look at it again.

748
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,220
The farms are behind the buildings.

749
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,780
We don't have large rotate blossom1000 acre ç.

750
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,780
Sit here.

751
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,780
I'm talking to you.

752
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,780
I'm sorry.

753
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,780
You can't say anything.

754
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,780
Weren't you cold just now?

755
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,780
I'm sorry.

756
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,780
I'm sorry.

757
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,780
I'm leaving.

758
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,780
Okay.

759
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,780
Did I say you can leave?

760
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,780
It's already 10.30.

761
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,780
If you don't go back, I'll lock the door.

762
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,780
Then don't go back.

763
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,780
Tonight, you must finish your homework.

764
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,780
Then can I go back to finish it?

765
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,860
No, it's not.

766
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,020
We'll stay here for a week.

767
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:26,420
Li Ba, you're not a capital teacher yet.

768
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,580
It's for the project.

769
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,940
What's wrong with you and Fang Shumiao?

770
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,460
I have to write a report.

771
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,860
I need to write a report.

772
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,060
It's sour.

773
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,180
This nephew is so sour.

774
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,740
Li Xu, I bought you breakfast.

775
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,740
Have some.

776
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,140
These are all delicious.

777
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,380
Try one.

778
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,820
You stayed up late again, right?

779
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,260
Then,

780
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,260
how about some coffee?

781
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,500
It's good for your health.

782
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,540
Don't move.

783
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,260
Stop reading.

784
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,380
Fang Shumiao.

785
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,180
Your program

786
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,700
has a user interface

787
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,460
and 20 capital cities.

788
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,900
Do you know what you're writing?

789
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,380
Just talk to me.

790
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,860
Why do you have to do this?

791
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,020
Just leave if you can't stand it.

792
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,220
Don't waste my time.

793
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,300
Li Xun just wrote a wrong code.

794
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,300
Is it necessary?

795
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,740
What I said before is right.

796
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,300
You're just fit to

797
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,180
live in your hobby group.

798
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,260
You can't even bear this pressure.

799
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,820
You have no qualification

800
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,260
or ability to enter this base.

801
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,740
Everyone is the same.

802
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,420
Just work hard here.

803
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,740
If you can't stand it, just quit.

804
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,020
Cry if you want to.

805
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,620
I won't give birth to a child.

806
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:08,540
Miao Miao.

807
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,900
Li Xu, you're too self-righteous.

808
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,140
Let's ignore him.

809
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,340
Will you not go because of me?

810
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,140
What do you mean?

811
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,460
You're doing great in the base.

812
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,860
Li Xun not only doesn't scold you,

813
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,340
but also takes you to the core project.

814
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,660
Why don't you go?

815
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:29,700
Fang Shumiao,

816
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,660
if you have anything to say,

817
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,340
just say it.

818
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,340
Don't be so weird.

819
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,700
I said why you

820
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,700
rushed to help me.

821
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,940
It turns out it was Li Xun.

822
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,140
He's the one who did it.

823
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,420
He's the one who did it.

824
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,460
I'm not going.

825
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,460
I'm not going.

826
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,500
I'm not going.

827
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,660
I'm not going.

828
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,740
I'm not going.

829
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,900
I'm not going.

830
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,020
I'm not going.

831
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,540
Isn't that too much?

832
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,620
I didn't help you before.

833
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,340
You helped yourself

834
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,780
while you were helping.

835
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,660
You're so good.

836
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,900
Why are you the princess?

837
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,580
We're just a flowerpot.

838
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,020
Fang Shumiao,

839
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:58,900
if you like Li Xun,

840
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,020
just tell him yourself.

841
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,500
Look at Liu Sisi and Chen Mimi.

842
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,980
Why are you being so mean to me?

843
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,260
Who likes Li Xun?

844
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:04,980
Who likes him

845
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,140
knows it very well.

846
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,420
Who told you that?

847
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,420
Is it Gao?

848
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,460
You didn't even tell me

849
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,300
when you told Gao.

850
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,460
Now I'm nothing.

851
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,300
Why are you being like this?

852
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,060
Then you're just treating me as a friend.

853
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:24,940
Enough.

854
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,100
I don't blame you.

855
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,580
I didn't do anything wrong.

856
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,860
Why are you blaming me?

857
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,420
Enough.

858
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,700
You're a smart and talented

859
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,060
little princess.

860
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,180
Smart and talented.

861
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,660
You're only 180.

862
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,020
It's not your fault.

863
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,140
It's all because of God.

864
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,460
He gave you everything.

865
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:42,900
You're being jealous.

866
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,300
Fang Shumiao.

867
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,300
Enough.

868
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,620
Don't be angry.

869
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,980
After going through this,

870
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,740
I've figured it out.

871
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,420
I was blinded by the fact that

872
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,620
I liked Li Xun so coldly.

873
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,300
From now on,

874
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,060
I solemnly announce that

875
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,660
I don't like him anymore.

876
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:03,420
Take him away if you like him.

877
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,860
I don't like him.

878
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,300
Really?

879
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,020
Whoever likes him is sick.

880
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,900
Yes, he's sick.

881
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,860
Then you're not going to the base?

882
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,300
Of course I'm going.

883
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,300
I didn't scold him before.

884
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,420
I was just helping him.

885
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,660
If Li Xun dares to scold me again,

886
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,100
I'll have to teach him a good lesson.

887
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,660
Li Xun.

888
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,420
We're in the same team.

889
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,140
I treat you as a brother and a comrade.

890
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,940
Today, you're teaching me a lesson

891
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:47,260
and making fun of me on stage.

892
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,100
You're fooling us.

893
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,260
So what you're going to do

894
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:51,740
is to listen to me.

895
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:53,260
I'm not doing it.

896
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,100
I'm going to be brave

897
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:52,780
like the flame that burns in the night.

898
00:44:56,180 --> 00:45:00,660
Because I believe I love you.

899
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:05,260
True love will take its course.

900
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:08,900
I'm by your side.

901
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:13,580
I'll spend all my time with you.

902
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:18,060
Because I believe I want you.

903
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:22,540
True love will take its course.

904
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:26,540
The flame of love

905
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:35,700
is always on your side.

906
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:43,900
The flame of love

907
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:48,900
is always on your side.

908
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:52,900
The flame of love

909
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:57,900
is always on your side.

910
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:01,900
The flame of love

911
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:06,900
is always on your side.

912
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:11,900
The flame of love

913
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:16,900
is always on your side.

914
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:20,900
I'll always be by your side.

915
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,900
I'll be brave

916
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,900
to have every dream.

917
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:32,900
I won't lose to time again.

918
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,900
I'm not afraid of anything.

919
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:40,900
I'm not afraid of anything.

920
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,900
I'm not afraid of anything.

921
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:46,900
I'm not afraid of anything.

922
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,900
I'm not afraid of anything.

923
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:52,900
I'm not afraid of anything.

924
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:55,900
I'm not afraid of anything.

925
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,900
I'm not afraid of anything.

926
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,900
I'm not afraid of anything.

927
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:11,900
Because you're here for me.

928
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:16,900
Because I believe I love you.

929
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:20,900
True love will take its course.

930
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:25,900
The flame of love

931
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:29,900
is always on your side.

932
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:38,740
Even if I want you to love, I'll take it's course

933
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:43,060
That burning fire

934
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:52,060
You're always the one to light up my way

935
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:56,460
Oh my love

936
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:00,940
That burning fire

937
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:11,940
You're always the one to light up my way
