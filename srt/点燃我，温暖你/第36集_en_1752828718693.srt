2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't believe who can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Even if the light is very white

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I want to be there

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless emotion

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day, the end is a little bit flustered

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am the light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast night?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I burn up the night just for you

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This is how everything looks like at first

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am the light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I will shine like a wild grass

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I will be with you forever

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Everything is how it looks like at first

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
He still doesn't want to see me

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Don't think too much

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Do the operation

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We will talk about the other things after he recovers

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Even if I die

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
He still doesn't want to see me

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Right?

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What's wrong with you, Old Han?

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I will call the doctor

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I told Fang Zhijing

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
At that time

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
My future was in front of me

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I finally don't have to live under his shadow

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But he insisted on harassing Fang Zhijing

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He insisted on going

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I have begged you

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I have begged you

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Why don't you agree for the first time?

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You know he went for you

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I know

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I know

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But that day Fang Zhijing came to me

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I was so angry

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I hate him

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I hate him so much that I just want to destroy him

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I told Fang Zhijing

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Li Xun's sister lives in Guoqiang Hotel

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Li Xun said he would keep an eye on you

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
He will keep an eye on you

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I don't need to worry about you

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
If it weren't for Li Xun's sister

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Do you think he would let you go?

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
When Li Xun's sister left

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He has ten thousand ways to make you feel uncomfortable

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I just want to teach Li Xun a lesson

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I didn't expect this would happen

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I didn't expect Li Lan would die

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm afraid of losing my way

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm afraid that Li Xun will know from Fang Zhijing

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I said it

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I can only make him hate Fang Zhijing more

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm afraid

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
How busy you are

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm really afraid

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I've been wanting to forget this

65
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But I can't forget it

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I even dreamed

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
We three stood on the top of the mountain

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And talked about the pumpkin app

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I dreamed that the three of us

70
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
On the day of the third fire

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
We stood on the rooftop

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Talking about our dreams and future

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We, LNP

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Will always keep a partner for you

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The three of us forever

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
At that time, we

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Were so good

78
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
These things

79
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I can remember them often

80
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The more I think, the more it hurts

81
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The more it hurts, the more I hate him

82
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We shouldn't have been like this

83
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's his fault

84
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He forced me, he kept stepping on me

85
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
He asked me if I regretted it

86
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Chu Yu, you ask

87
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You ask him

88
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You ask him if he regrets it

89
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Lao Gao, everyone has made mistakes

90
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Li Xun has forgiven you

91
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Impossible

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Why should he forgive me

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
He has forgiven me

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Why should he forgive me

95
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He shouldn't have forgiven me

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's me

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I wanted to step on him

98
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I didn't let him turn over

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's me

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Don't think too much

101
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Go and do the surgery, okay?

102
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I won't do it

103
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I know it's useless to do the surgery

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I know

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The surgery is calling again

106
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm so tired

107
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
There are still surgeries behind the two directors

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Tell them

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I won't do it

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Lao Gao

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm tired

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I just want to rest for a while

113
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I won't do it

114
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm tired

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I just want to rest for a while

116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Let Gao Jianghong answer the phone

117
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's Li Xun

118
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Gao Jianghong

119
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Don't you agree

120
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
No

121
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I don't agree

122
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You can live without me

123
00:08:45,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Qiu Chen

124
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Wait

125
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
If you ever regret it,

126
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
please say sorry to her for me.

127
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Don't worry. It's okay.

128
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Don't worry.

129
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
There shouldn't be any more strongholds between the two hearts.

130
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The ruins of time have long been turned into a lonely island.

131
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Remember those years of suffering.

132
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And the path she once lit up but couldn't walk.

133
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Will Li Xun regret it?

134
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I can answer for her.

135
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
No.

136
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
At least she will never admit it.

137
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
She was so lonely in her previous life.

138
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
She was almost lonely.

139
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
She was so stubborn.

140
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
She made so few mistakes.

141
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
How could she say she regrets it?

142
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Or she had walked before.

143
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Li Xun.

144
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Gao Jinghong's surgery was successful.

145
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Reconcile with them.

146
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You go talk to them.

147
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm not going.

148
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Okay.

149
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I want the name LP.

150
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Okay.

151
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I want the name LP.

152
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
She will express her feelings in another way.

153
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I always believe her heart is soft.

154
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And it will get softer and softer.

155
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Like a child growing up.

156
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Or a peach that's ripe.

157
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It will get sweeter and sweeter.

158
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And it will get softer and softer.

159
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
13 companies like JIAFANG, LP,

160
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and Yifang, Ixin and Fengyang

161
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
have paid RMB 55 million.

162
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And they have transferred the company's name

163
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
to the online online company

164
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
of Ixin and Fengyang

165
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
in the name of Chinese Jili English LP.

166
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
JIAYI and Yifang

167
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
will keep the information and keep the secret

168
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
of the unauthorized public channels

169
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
obtained by the negotiation, signing and implementation of this agreement

170
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
in the process.

171
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Thank you for your consent.

172
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Gao agreed?

173
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
He has been doing anti-corruption training

174
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
more actively than anyone else these days.

175
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
He doesn't want to come.

176
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
He probably doesn't want to face it.

177
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
This is the common decision of all the entrants.

178
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
We are a small company.

179
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
We have to consider the future.

180
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
If we consume too much, we will not try.

181
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
We all know that

182
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
there is no common decision.

183
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Only Li Xun can make decisions from time to time.

184
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It doesn't matter to think about the past.

185
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It doesn't matter to sympathize with him.

186
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Thank him.

187
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
At least, he can keep Gao's hard work.

188
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What are you thinking about?

189
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Everyone in this building

190
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
doesn't know the real meaning of Yao Pi.

191
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
They don't know how much passion and dreams

192
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
are in this name

193
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
and the days of struggle.

194
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You are so stubborn.

195
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Sometimes I really envy you and Li Xun.

196
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You are old enough

197
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
to fight for a name.

198
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I really can't compete with your persistence.

199
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I don't think you are as handsome as before.

200
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Look.

201
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You are still so handsome.

202
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Let's go.

203
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
We have signed. Let's go to have dinner.

204
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Okay.

205
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Someone just said that you are still so handsome.

206
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Is it you?

207
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Let's go.

208
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Okay.

209
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Brother Feng, this is yours.

210
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Put it in.

211
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Okay.

212
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Look.

213
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It's yours.

214
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Xiaojian.

215
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I just put two new paper in the bathroom.

216
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You can put it in the box.

217
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Wu Yu.

218
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Anyway, the company is just a repair shop.

219
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Who wants your stuff?

220
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Let me tell you, Fang.

221
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
If you really don't dare to do this,

222
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
you won't find a new wife.

223
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You open the source and I cut the flow.

224
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Right?

225
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
We can do our own thing

226
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
to make our company bigger and stronger.

227
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Isn't that right?

228
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Brother Fang, why do you cut the flow?

229
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
In this handsome and handsome Li Group,

230
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
they can open a new river for you.

231
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You cut the flow. Is it necessary?

232
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
There is a day when the wolf will be in the way.

233
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Aren't you thinking about it?

234
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I really don't plan to do it.

235
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You cut the flow.

236
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Li Xun will announce a few things now.

237
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
First,

238
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I and Zhu Yun don't plan to play games anymore.

239
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Leave it to Zhao Teng.

240
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Shouldn't you discuss it with me?

241
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Second,

242
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
we will change our company's name

243
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
to LP.

244
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
We are all stockholders.

245
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Really?

246
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Really.

247
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Stockholders?

248
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Last,

249
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
LP will still belong to Dong Dong.

250
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Good.

251
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Good. This is good.

252
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Wait.

253
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
The second one.

254
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
What does the second one mean?

255
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Stockholders.

256
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I am a stockholder.

257
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Right.

258
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I am rich.

259
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Yes.

260
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I am rich.

261
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I will treat you to dinner today.

262
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Xiao Jian,

263
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
first, light up the candle in my two toes.

264
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I am also a stockholder.

265
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I love you.

266
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yes.

267
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
He is so romantic.

268
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Our

269
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
over-the-top game company

270
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
is finally free.

271
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You know what?

272
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It hasn't been long

273
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
since Team Leader Li and Team Leader Zhu came.

274
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
We are already in a good mood.

275
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What do you think

276
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
we can be after three years?

277
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Let me tell you first.

278
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I have an idea.

279
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
After three years,

280
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I will study abroad.

281
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
After I come back,

282
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I will hold a memorable wedding

283
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
for my girlfriend.

284
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Then I will go abroad

285
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
to marry a girlfriend.

286
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
That's good.

287
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Dong Dong.

288
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Buy a private plane.

289
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's cheaper than a driver's license.

290
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Are you going to

291
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
use the plane to work?

292
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
No traffic.

293
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It's not difficult.

294
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You just started to say the answer.

295
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Team Leader Zhu, what about you?

296
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
What about you?

297
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I think the express at the door is too noisy.

298
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You made it yellow again.

299
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
They put too many things in it.

300
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Everyone wants it to move away.

301
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's not difficult.

302
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
In six months,

303
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
this floor will be ours.

304
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Excuse me.

305
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Is this the company of Fei Yang?

306
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Zhu Yue.

307
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
By the way, Yu Yu.

308
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I heard that Xiu Zhu

309
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
went back to France to open a painting exhibition.

310
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Why didn't you tell us?

311
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Dad.

312
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Mom.

313
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I do have something

314
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
to tell you.

315
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
No hurry.

316
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Go home and tell us.

317
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
We should

318
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
have a good talk.

319
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I will go to the office.

320
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I will go to the office.

321
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I should have a good talk.

322
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Why don't you close the door?

323
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Why should I close the door?

324
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
No one can enter your house.

325
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
When did he come out?

326
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's been a long time.

327
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
He came out and looked for you?

328
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
No.

329
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I went to look for him.

330
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Why did you go to look for him?

331
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
How long are you going to keep this from me

332
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
and your dad?

333
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Mom.

334
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Let's talk about it in a peaceful way.

335
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
The time when I returned to China to sign the visa,

336
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
he just came out and met me.

337
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I didn't plan to stay.

338
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
But later I knew that

339
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
the company we established together

340
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
was robbed.

341
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
So I decided to stay

342
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
and start a business with him.

343
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I took it back to the company.

344
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Brother Xiao also knows.

345
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
There is no problem.

346
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Good.

347
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You guys are lying to us.

348
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
You are really capable.

349
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Now you know that

350
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
we are together again.

351
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Zhu Yue.

352
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I can tell you that

353
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I don't agree with you being together.

354
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Your dad won't agree either.

355
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
We didn't agree long ago.

356
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
We won't agree in the future.

357
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
We will never agree.

358
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Who is he?

359
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
He has been in prison.

360
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
This is a stain that can't be cleaned.

361
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
We did make mistakes in the past.

362
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
But everyone paid the price.

363
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Li Xun is indeed extreme sometimes.

364
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
But he is already changing.

365
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
You know that

366
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
the nature of the country is hard to be changed.

367
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
How much can he change?

368
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
That's right.

369
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Since you know that

370
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
he can't change

371
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
the stain in his bones,

372
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
no matter how long it takes,

373
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I still fell in love with him so easily.

374
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
What are you talking about?

375
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
You are brainwashed by him.

376
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Pay attention to his dad.

377
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Talk.

378
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I heard that

379
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Yunyu mentioned you.

380
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
That is to say,

381
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
she has been working for you these days.

382
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Your daughter is my boss now.

383
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
She works for herself.

384
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
What are you looking for me for today?

385
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I'm here to talk about two children.

386
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Talk about children?

387
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Do you have children?

388
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I'm not that stupid.

389
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I'm just a kid.

390
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I really don't have one.

391
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I'm an orphan.

392
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
No wonder.

393
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Then you may not understand

394
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
the parents' feelings for their children.

395
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
To be honest,

396
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Yunyu's mother

397
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
is a little emotional.

398
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
But we are also for the sake of the children.

399
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
For the sake of Yunyu,

400
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
don't walk the wrong path again.

401
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Don't be wronged again.

402
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I don't like to hear that.

403
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Your daughter is in love with Li Xun.

404
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Even if she walks the wrong path,

405
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
she will be wronged.

406
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
You are bullying Li Xun.

407
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
No adults will help her, right?

408
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
So what?

409
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
You are here today

410
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
to help Li Xun to be the boss?

411
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Yes.

412
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I just want to

413
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
represent Li Xun's elders today.

414
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm talking to you.

415
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Okay, then you talk about

416
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
where is Li Xun good?

417
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
What is special about him?

418
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I'm done.

419
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Let's just talk about one thing.

420
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
If it weren't for Li Xun,

421
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
my company would have been ruined.

422
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Does this count as Li Xun's

423
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
outstanding and special place?

424
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Go on.

425
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Dad,

426
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
it's not easy for two children

427
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
to come all the way here.

428
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
You know

429
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
your daughter can't let go of Li Xun.

430
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Right?

431
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
What is this?

432
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
This is called obsession.

433
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
You know your daughter better

434
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
than I do.

435
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Do you think you two

436
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
can stop her

437
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
by stopping her?

438
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Besides,

439
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
when we were young,

440
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
we made mistakes.

441
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
You can't just

442
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
let go of her

443
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
because of one mistake.

444
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It's not right.

445
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I agree with

446
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
what you said.

447
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Li Xun is indeed

448
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
a very special child.

449
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
He doesn't play by the rules.

450
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
But he's usually a genius.

451
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
He's half a devil.

452
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I think you're

453
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
a good person.

454
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
You can listen to me.

455
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
But you're talking

456
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
so silently to me.

457
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
It's useless.

458
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
You have to go up there

459
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
and talk to your wife.

460
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
No, no, no.

461
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
If I go up there,

462
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
it will really be a big car accident.

463
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Why are we talking about this?

464
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
To be honest,

465
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I think

466
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
it's their own children

467
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
who will choose

468
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
how they will end up.

469
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I like this.

470
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I think we have to wait a while.

471
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
There's a noodle restaurant next door.

472
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
The sweet and sour pork and pork ribs noodles

473
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
are good.

474
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I'll treat you to a bowl of noodles.

475
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
How do you know

476
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I like sweet and sour pork and pork ribs noodles?

477
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
You really like it.

478
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Let's go.

479
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Let's go.

480
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I don't welcome you here.

481
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I want to talk to my daughter.

482
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
You're not going to come in, are you?

483
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I'll give you a little bit of respect today.

484
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
But I hope you can do it.

485
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I won't agree to my daughter

486
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
being with you.

487
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Mom, this is our home.

488
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
You have no right to interfere.

489
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
You have no right to make decisions.

490
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Zhu Yan,

491
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I gave birth to you and raised you.

492
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Today you said

493
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I had no right to interfere.

494
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
You're not going to do it?

495
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Auntie,

496
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
you can make any conditions.

497
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
My condition is that you

498
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
don't appear in front of us again.

499
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
My daughter has been so obedient

500
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
and sensible since she was a child.

501
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
But since she was with you,

502
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
she's been like an evil person.

503
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Do you know what you've done

504
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
to our family?

505
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Mom, if you're like this,

506
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
we can't continue.

507
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
If you don't want to talk, then we don't talk.

508
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I'm not here to chat with you.

509
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I don't want to argue with you.

510
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
But I'm just telling you clearly.

511
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
We only have one daughter.

512
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
We don't agree that she marries you.

513
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Auntie,

514
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
you're Zhu Yan's mother.

515
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I have to listen to

516
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
whatever you say.

517
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I just said

518
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
you can make any conditions.

519
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I'll try my best to satisfy you.

520
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Our family

521
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
is not a family

522
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
that is not reasonable

523
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
and not reasonable.

524
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Our requirements for our future son-in-law

525
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
are not big or big.

526
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
As long as the family is not full,

527
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
we can just be on the same side.

528
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
My daughter has been

529
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
a good daughter since she was a child.

530
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
She's been a good daughter.

531
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I'm just telling you

532
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
that she's a good daughter.

533
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
My daughter has never made any mistakes

534
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
since she was a child.

535
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
We asked the other party

536
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
to be clear.

537
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Isn't that too much?

538
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
If you can find a way

539
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
to clean up your own

540
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
dirty spots on the file,

541
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
and invite your parents to come,

542
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and we two families sit together

543
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
and discuss this matter,

544
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I don't think it's normal.

545
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
What do you think?

546
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I think

547
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
you should be more careful

548
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
and think about your future.

549
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I'm not sure

550
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
if I can be a good daughter.

551
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I'll try my best

552
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
to make you a good daughter.

553
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I'll try my best

554
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
to make you a good daughter.

555
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I'll try my best

556
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
to make you a good daughter.

557
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I'll try my best

558
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
to make you a good daughter.

559
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
It's up to you, dad.

560
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I'll try my best.

561
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I'll try my best.

562
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
You must be hungry.

563
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
There's a good noodle restaurant

564
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
nearby.

565
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I'll treat you.

566
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
You didn't go?

567
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I was here all along.

568
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Your mom is so amazing

569
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
and so straightforward.

570
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
How could she

571
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
teach her daughter so well?

572
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I wasn't.

573
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
But don't blame her.

574
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
She's been a teacher for decades.

575
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
She has this kind of thinking.

576
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I'm here for her.

577
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I'll be here for you.

578
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I'll be here for you.

579
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I'll be here for you.

580
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I'll be here for you.

581
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I'll be here for you.

582
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I want to go to your house.

583
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Have a seat first.

584
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Have a seat first.

585
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,000
What else do you want?

586
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Did you call Ay chance from견 Conomi?

587
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,280
I've tried to speak to Pak vezel

588
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
and he given me the wrong answer.

589
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Dad was not at home.

590
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,440
What are you looking at?

591
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,920
That's ther book you mentioned,

592
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,360
right?

593
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:57,880
What do you think?

594
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,360
Not bad.

595
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,360
Zhu Yan.

596
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,840
Why not do something practical?

597
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,880
Practical?

598
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,840
In your eyes, ask me directly.

599
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,080
Well,

600
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,160
That one.

601
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,600
That's it?

602
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,880
That's it.

603
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,040
Are you done?

604
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,160
Do you have a reward?

605
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:30,920
Reward?

606
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,800
Reward?

607
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,680
Yes.

608
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,480
Li Xun.

609
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,120
The child we want.

610
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,400
You want to use the child to treat your mom?

611
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,720
It has nothing to do with this.

612
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,240
Then why do you suddenly want a child?

613
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,080
I want the child to be your partner.

614
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,400
You are one and a half years older than me.

615
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,840
You are almost 30 years old.

616
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,200
You are in your prime.

617
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,480
But it still depends on you.

618
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,280
We just got together.

619
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,920
Your career is not stable.

620
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,080
The most important thing is

621
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,680
we are not married.

622
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,880
We are not pregnant.

623
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,640
It seems to be over.

624
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,720
It's over.

625
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,440
It's over.

626
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,080
Why did you let it go?

627
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,120
I want a child too.

628
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,120
Give birth.

629
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,320
Give birth?

630
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,200
Give birth.

631
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,920
It's decided like this?

632
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:29,960
It's decided like this.

633
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,400
You go to a place with me tomorrow.

634
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,440
You two look first.

635
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,040
If there is anything, please contact me in time.

636
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:39,840
Okay.

637
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,240
This house is...

638
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,760
I bought it.

639
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,960
You bought it here?

640
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:14,840
I don't buy it here.

641
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,880
Why should I take you here?

642
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,520
You didn't come to work yesterday.

643
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,760
You went to buy a house.

644
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,840
You didn't buy food fast.

645
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,840
How much did you buy it?

646
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,200
Why do you ask?

647
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,600
I'm worried about your spending money.

648
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,240
You are here to borrow money or borrow money?

649
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,680
I just borrowed it.

650
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,200
I borrowed it.

651
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,400
Do you want to take a look?

652
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,920
Take me to take a look.

653
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:52,760
Okay.

654
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,040
Zhou Ying.

655
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,680
I have no idea about family.

656
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,880
I think marriage

657
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,760
is a very long love.

658
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,440
The most important thing in love is happiness.

659
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,520
I don't want you to sacrifice a lot of things

660
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,480
to be with me.

661
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,800
I hope you are happy.

662
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,200
What about you?

663
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,520
Are you happy to be with me?

664
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,120
I'm okay.

665
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,240
So, can I

666
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,680
take the last word as a proposal?

667
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,520
Zhou Ying.

668
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,120
We need to do something meaningful together.

669
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,000
Don't you ask me what it is?

670
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:16,960
What is it?

671
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:28,960
Excuse me.

672
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,880
Are you here to get married?

673
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,800
What about Muran?

674
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,960
All of us?

675
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,000
Yes.

676
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,760
I'm satisfied.

677
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:37,840
Move away.

678
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,600
No, no.

679
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,920
He is here to accompany us.

680
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,800
There are so many families here.

681
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,880
You can only go in a pair later.

682
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,320
Others are waiting outside.

683
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,640
Please show me your household register and ID card.

684
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,240
Let's go.

685
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,160
Okay, please wait a moment.

686
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,680
Yes.

687
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,520
Are you nervous?

688
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,200
No.

689
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,640
I regret that I didn't come in time.

690
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,120
When I go in,

691
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,280
don't fight with me, okay?

692
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,200
Okay.

693
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:17,800
Okay?

694
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,400
Okay.

695
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,760
Why are you so nervous?

696
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,360
I'm not married yet.

697
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,040
Let go.

698
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,360
You look so casual

699
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,160
in your wedding dress.

700
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,080
Look at us.

701
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,480
Yes, we are so strong.

702
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,240
Yes.

703
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,160
Hello.

704
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,480
How is our wedding dress?

705
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,880
Not yet.

706
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,760
What?

707
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,800
The wedding dress?

708
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,400
No.

709
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,520
Your mom is not here.

710
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,360
It doesn't matter.

711
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,200
Come on, look at the camera.

712
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,680
Well,

713
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,360
stand closer.

714
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,520
Smile.

715
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,480
Smile happily.

716
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,080
Li Xun.

717
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,520
I told you to smile.

718
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,680
You should smile gently.

719
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Not coldly.

720
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,760
Hurry up.

721
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,920
Don't be afraid of being hit by someone.

722
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,960
Smile.

723
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,520
Smile.

724
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,200
Three.

725
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,320
Two.

726
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,480
One.

727
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:22,800
Come in.

728
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,440
Hello.

729
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,600
Hello.

730
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,640
Hi, pretty.

731
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,280
Change your shoes.

732
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:27,880
What are you doing?

733
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,200
Change your shoes.

734
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:28,960
No, thanks.

735
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,600
Just come in.

736
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,200
No need.

737
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,320
Sit down.

738
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:31,960
Sit down.

739
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,440
I wish Zhao Jiali a happy wedding day.

740
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,400
I wish our dear

741
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,240
Political Commissar Zhu

742
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,200
a happy wedding.

743
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,680
This couple electric toothbrush

744
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,280
is a proof of love

745
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,240
for you two.

746
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:43,960
What a coincidence.

747
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,520
I bought it two days ago.

748
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,640
It's also a couple's dress

749
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,640
in black and white.

750
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,440
It's so nice.

751
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,280
This one

752
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,160
can only be cheaper

753
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,440
for people and kids.

754
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,640
What a coincidence.

755
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,160
Come on.

756
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:54,680
Sit down.

757
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,680
Congratulations, Mr. Dong.

758
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,320
Yes.

759
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:56,840
Come on.

760
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,160
Congratulations, Li.

761
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,200
Congratulations, Mrs. Li.

762
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,120
Thank you.

763
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,960
It's so big.

764
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:03,960
What about you?

765
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,760
Did you get it out?

766
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,160
You knocked my roommate out.

767
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:07,880
You know I have to

768
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,720
call the security guard myself.

769
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,800
You even asked me for a drink.

770
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,240
What's going on?

771
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:11,800
Come on.

772
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,120
Look at the lake.

773
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,600
It looks so comfortable.

774
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,160
Yes.

775
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,080
It's...

776
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,080
It's a four-door house.

777
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:17,400
A four-door house.

778
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,080
Sit down.

779
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,200
I'll pour you some water.

780
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,960
Do you have drinks?

781
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,640
Look for yourself.

782
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:21,960
It's so nice.

783
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,560
It's so breezy.

784
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:32,840
Are you ready?

785
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,200
Hurry up.

786
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:33,360
Okay.

787
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,000
Hurry up.

788
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,200
Please look back.

789
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:35,720
Ready.

790
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,400
Ready.

791
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:37,840
Okay.

792
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,840
One, two, three.

793
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,040
Later, our invincible general

794
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,520
was promoted to the top three in the mother's ranking.

795
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,040
But Dong Siyang's biggest wish

796
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,880
is still to be a five-star driver.

797
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,080
Ren Ding and Xiao Liaozi

798
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,120
are finally engaged.

799
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,800
Gao Jianhou and Xu Li Na

800
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,600
quit their company

801
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,800
and found a place to recuperate.

802
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,040
Fang Zhijin was arrested by the company's shareholders

803
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,440
for his job.

804
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,120
He was taken away by the police.

805
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,800
Sometimes,

806
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,000
I think this world is like a battlefield.

807
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,800
Everyone is struggling to resist.

808
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,240
Some people stand to death.

809
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,120
Some give up.

810
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,960
Some are still fighting.

811
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,520
Fighting requires strong strength and courage.

812
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,320
I'm not that capable.

813
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,720
So I can only be a tracker.

814
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:46,960
But he has it.

815
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,240
The feeling of getting married

816
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,280
is good.

817
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:02,840
Okay.

818
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,680
They say

819
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,360
marriage is the road of love.

820
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,720
I didn't see it.

821
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,360
What did they say?

822
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,560
Life is as weak as a sword.

823
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,600
If there's a turning point

824
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,360
when a person dies,

825
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:35,680
he

826
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,440
will probably be the last person

827
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,240
I've ever seen in my life.

828
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,680
It's the intuition of a dream

829
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,400
that breaks the boundary.

830
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,560
A night of rain

831
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,560
is over.

832
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,640
It won the world for me.

833
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:54,520
Because I believe I love you.

834
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:59,000
True love will take its course.

835
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,680
I'm by your side.

836
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,800
I'll spend the long time with you.

837
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:12,440
Because I believe I want you.

838
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,880
True love will take its course.

839
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,520
The fiery fire

840
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:29,400
gets brighter every broad day.

841
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,400
I'm sorry.

842
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,400
I'm sorry.

843
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,400
I'm sorry.

844
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,400
I'm sorry.

845
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,400
I'm sorry.

846
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,400
I'm sorry.

847
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,400
I'm sorry.

848
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,400
I'm sorry.

849
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,400
I'm sorry.

850
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,400
I'm sorry.

851
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,400
I'm sorry.

852
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,400
I'm sorry.

853
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,400
I'm sorry.

854
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,400
I'm sorry.

855
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,400
I'm sorry.

856
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,400
I'm sorry.

857
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,400
I'm sorry.

858
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,400
I'm sorry.

859
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,400
I'm sorry.

860
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,400
I'm sorry.

861
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,400
I'm sorry.

862
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,400
I'm sorry.

863
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,400
I'm sorry.

864
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,400
I'm sorry.

865
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,400
I'm sorry.

866
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,400
I'm sorry.

867
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,400
I'm sorry.

868
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,400
I'm sorry.

869
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,400
I'm sorry.

870
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,400
I'm sorry.

871
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,400
I'm sorry.

872
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,400
I'm sorry.

873
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,400
I'm sorry.

874
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,400
I'm sorry.

875
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,400
I'm sorry.

876
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,400
I'm sorry.

877
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,400
I'm sorry.

878
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,400
I'm sorry.

879
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,400
I'm sorry.

880
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,400
I'm sorry.

881
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,400
I'm sorry.

882
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,400
I'm sorry.

883
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,400
I'm sorry.

884
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,400
I'm sorry.

885
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,400
I'm sorry.

886
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,400
I'm sorry.

887
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,400
I'm sorry.

888
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,400
I'm sorry.

889
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,400
I'm sorry.

890
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,400
I'm sorry.

891
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,400
I'm sorry.

892
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,400
I'm sorry.

893
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,400
I'm sorry.

894
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,400
I'm sorry.

895
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,400
I'm sorry.

896
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,400
I'm sorry.

897
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,400
I'm sorry.

898
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,400
I'm sorry.

899
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,400
I'm sorry.

900
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,400
I'm sorry.

901
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,400
I'm sorry.

902
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,400
I'm sorry.

903
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,400
I'm sorry.

904
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,400
I'm sorry.

905
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,400
I'm sorry.

906
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,400
I'm sorry.

907
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,400
I'm sorry.

908
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,400
I'm sorry.

909
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,400
I'm sorry.

910
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,400
I'm sorry.

911
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,400
I'm sorry.

912
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,400
I'm sorry.

913
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,400
I'm sorry.

914
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,400
I'm sorry.

915
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,400
I'm sorry.

916
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,400
I'm sorry.

917
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,400
I'm sorry.

918
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,400
I'm sorry.

919
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,400
I'm sorry.

920
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,400
I'm sorry.

921
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,400
I'm sorry.

922
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,400
I'm sorry.

923
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,400
I'm sorry.

924
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,400
I'm sorry.

925
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,400
I'm sorry.

926
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,400
I'm sorry.

927
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,400
I'm sorry.

928
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,400
I'm sorry.

929
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,400
I'm sorry.

930
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,240
I'm sorry.

931
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,920
I'm not realizing anything.

932
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,880
I'm sorry.

933
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,440
I'm sorry.

934
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,480
I'm sorry.

935
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,400
I'm sorry.

936
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,320
I'm sorry.

937
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,460
I'm sorry.

938
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,920
I'm sorry.

939
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,760
I'm sorry.

940
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,660
I'm...

941
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:56,080
I'm sorry.

942
00:46:56,080 --> 00:47:00,880
The wind has become difficult to?

943
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:09,080
Now here, the yellow grass has withered and there is no more flower

944
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:16,880
Fortunately, I once had your spring, autumn and winter

945
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:21,080
They are all old, right?

946
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:25,680
Where are they?

947
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:33,680
We are just like this, away from each other

948
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:41,680
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la, like her

949
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:49,880
La la la la la la la la la la la la, is she still driving?
