YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if the light is very bright

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will still watch over that vast vast land

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless atmosphere

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day, the lens is a little bit yellow

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast night?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I burn up the night just for you to remember

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How everything was in the beginning

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The wind and the color of the night are like wild grass

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The mountains are broken, but you are still by my side

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Everything is how it was in the beginning

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The Long Ballad

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Episode 2

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The Long Ballad

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's early enough today

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The atmosphere of this company is still like a joke every day

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Why are you here

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Late

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
No

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Company rules

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
100 yuan for the delivery

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Invite people to dinner at noon

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
No, I

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Not so

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
shut up

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I have something to announce

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Li Xu, you say

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Dr. Shu

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
A new project was launched today

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Called Love Blind Box

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This project is officially launched today

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I will be responsible

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Ok

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Ok

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I see your plan

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I just have one opinion

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You are on the imperial edict

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You fight me in person

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Don't you want money here

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Then our director Dong makes some money

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's easy to sell the car

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Shut up

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You are so good

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
When did you start doing this project

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
A while

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Your plan is really good

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Just like them

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Can also see it immediately

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Perfect workflow

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Does our company still have money to make new games?

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This game

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Dong Dong sells a few hundred thousand cars

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Not enough

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
This game

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Li Xun said money

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Now Li Xun is our company

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The biggest shareholder

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But you guys

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Still under my leadership

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What's up

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Li Xun

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Say a few words

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Look at the picture and explain it directly

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Look

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's a bit interesting to zoom in

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It turned out that I went to the cafe last time

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I went to the typhoon

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's not a typhoon

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's not a typhoon

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I don't think it's a typhoon

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I think it's a typhoon

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I think it's a typhoon

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't think it's a typhoon

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's a typhoon

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This game is the love role play in the market

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Or a game of custody

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But what used to be

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Usually biased to the female market

87
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Like this

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Take care of our lonely group

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
quite rare

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I think this benefit is good

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What's good about this benefit

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm asking you about the content.

93
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,080
It looks like an ordinary love game.

94
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,840
But the difference is in the topic.

95
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,040
The blind box.

96
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,840
Do you know the Sijin Daxiang?

97
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,360
I know the 13th Battalion.

98
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,400
You've heard of the hero card, right?

99
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,120
Go ahead.

100
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,800
In the last few months,

101
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,040
a product that has been rising

102
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,520
in the second hand trade

103
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,680
is called the blind box.

104
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,320
Many people would rather spend money

105
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,480
to buy their favorite handkerchiefs

106
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,160
than to bet

107
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,000
on the blind box.

108
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,200
This is the psychological basis of the blind box.

109
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Our game

110
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,680
doesn't want players

111
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,520
to choose their favorite love partner.

112
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,400
Instead, we choose the blind box.

113
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,880
Just like choosing five partners after turning off the light,

114
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,800
only after completing the game task

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,280
and the complete storyline

116
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,760
can we choose again.

117
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,080
But if we want everyone

118
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,440
to share the story of other love types

119
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,000
in a single game line,

120
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,240
we can't...

121
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,040
I see.

122
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,400
Isn't this Cheng Xin?

123
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,200
Yes.

124
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,000
This is Cheng Xin.

125
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,160
They will open new stores

126
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,040
to find the one they like

127
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,280
and keep opening new stores.

128
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,200
In other words,

129
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,400
they will keep completing the game.

130
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,720
Keep spending money.

131
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,640
That's it.

132
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,520
That's it.

133
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,240
Right?

134
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,200
Yes.

135
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,080
Because you will always meet

136
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,240
the one that suits you the most.

137
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,720
It's just a love game.

138
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,080
Why do you have so many partners?

139
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,720
Wait.

140
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,600
I think this game is popular.

141
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,520
Hu,

142
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,280
really.

143
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,840
If it's not popular, I'll just follow it.

144
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,760
I'm not following

145
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,040
the one you choose.

146
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,680
I'm following

147
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,720
the game that I can play

148
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,880
whenever I want.

149
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,880
Right.

150
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,840
Don't you think this game is too low?

151
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,480
It's not.

152
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,600
Is it?

153
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,320
It's not.

154
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:57,960
It's not?

155
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,560
It's not.

156
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,200
It's not.

157
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,800
It's not.

158
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,560
It's not.

159
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,200
It's not.

160
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,920
It's not.

161
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,680
It is.

162
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,680
What kind of

163
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,160
beauty master,

164
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,560
top-notch

165
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,680
and also溫宜 girl

166
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,760
don't sell 검ice in that?

167
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,760
How?

168
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,080
That's great.

169
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,200
Right.

170
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,720
This is a game

171
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,640
that combines reality.

172
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:29,140
It's like

173
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,320
A dream.

174
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,000
is to let everyone experience the joy of joining the game

175
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
after being blinded by the choices.

176
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,840
Has anyone played this game before?

177
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,120
I don't think so.

178
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,360
The game will never be faster than us.

179
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
Do you know why?

180
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,640
Because it's easy to be reported.

181
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,160
Wrong.

182
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
No one played it because no one thought of it.

183
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,520
The only possibility of being reported

184
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,000
is that these people who follow the game

185
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,960
and make it bad

186
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,240
will be completely rejected.

187
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,000
So there is still this risk?

188
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,760
I will keep a good sense

189
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,680
of the game content.

190
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,680
There will be no risk in this regard.

191
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,120
Then let's start.

192
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,040
No.

193
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,160
Can you be a little bit more pursuing?

194
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,800
What are you doing?

195
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,320
You said you wanted to make money back then.

196
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,440
But you were thinking

197
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,960
at least in the most technical aspect.

198
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,960
Now you are trying to make money in a different way.

199
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,880
Let's vote.

200
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,880
Raise your hand if there is no problem with other plans.

201
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,320
I can't continue this time.

202
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,680
Don't be angry.

203
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,920
Are you happy

204
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
to discuss this topic?

205
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
You have seen Xiaojian.

206
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,520
She usually looks so serious.

207
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,520
She just laughed like that.

208
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,520
Is it necessary?

209
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,120
This is a love-hate relationship game.

210
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,320
There are not so many values.

211
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:29,600
Don't be so

212
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,000
frightened.

213
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,120
Really Conscientious.

214
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,120
Why did you ask here?

215
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,840
You are 퀘시�ràmusic's

216
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,440
most important thing.

217
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,600
I'm so hungry.

218
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,520
I am so hungry.

219
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,920
Not yet?

220
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,520
Let's go first.

221
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,720
Want to change the last forward?

222
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,960
Good.

223
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,760
Come.

224
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,320
Dad.

225
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,360
I parked pretty closely at the door.

226
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,360
I explained to you?

227
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,480
Where is he?

228
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,320
Come in.

229
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,240
I need something.

230
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,280
Go ahead.

231
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:00,960
Get out.

232
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,120
You that red-faced.

233
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,560
I'm sorry.

234
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,120
I won't give it to you.

235
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,800
Are you okay?

236
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,560
I'm fine.

237
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,280
Why is it raining?

238
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,240
I wouldn't be able to stop him.

239
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,740
It's raining but층 more and more.

240
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,640
We can call somebody.

241
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,780
My bag.

242
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,760
You plan to use this game to deal with Gao Jianhong?

243
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,920
Just this game.

244
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,160
Li Xun, don't play it too hard. At least it's a atomic bomb.

245
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,040
What are you now? You're just a bullet gun.

246
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,320
You're really making it out of your own will.

247
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,600
This can only show that good works can stimulate humanity.

248
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,160
Whether it's an atomic bomb or a bullet gun,

249
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,160
it's not important.

250
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,200
What's important is that I don't need to defeat him.

251
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,120
I just need to make him afraid that I'll defeat him.

252
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,680
Have you thought about what to do?

253
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,080
I'll tell you.

254
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,880
You're really getting more and more like you. You're so sorry.

255
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,920
Thank you.

256
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,200
I won't help you with this project. Don't even think about it.

257
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,040
I just want to tell you this.

258
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,240
What?

259
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,200
Just continue.

260
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,040
Be your invincible general.

261
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,240
The company wants to be successful. Not only do you need to make money,

262
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,680
you also need to have the attitude to express yourself.

263
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,760
The general is the company's doorstep. You'll know it in the future.

264
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,520
What do you mean?

265
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,480
You're responsible for worrying. I'm responsible for handling everything.

266
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,720
Do you understand?

267
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,320
I see.

268
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,200
Fine, you always understand.

269
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,800
no

270
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,880
I'll play the old straight

271
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,800
Trust me to control time

272
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,000
what

273
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,600
Have you Get my bed destroyed

274
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,320
Have to be responsible

275
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,360
District nine

276
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,180
Open the lock

277
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,600
You asked for the room

278
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,560
Just ten principle

279
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,120
This wide

280
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,740
Then

281
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,540
It will be faster than service

282
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,300
How did he know to rent a room

283
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,520
I had no experience

284
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:19,940
How about you

285
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,680
I'll give you a card number.

286
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,200
Three months of rent.

287
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,200
The landlord is abroad.

288
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,200
An Xingzhou.

289
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,960
You can work in this room.

290
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,040
You can separate work and rest.

291
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,960
Move this table away from this room.

292
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,960
Put it on the bed.

293
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,440
You want to sleep in this room?

294
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,160
Leave it to Hou Ning.

295
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,520
She'll be back.

296
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,400
Let's go.

297
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,560
Where are you going?

298
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,900
This is your place.

299
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,800
Go.

300
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,840
No life suits have been prepared for your opponent.

301
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,200
Can we have one?

302
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,360
Leave your waist.

303
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,240
Do you have to edit it out?

304
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,160
One for each.

305
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,160
What did you buy, Zhezhe?

306
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,800
I bought a pot.

307
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,800
I bought it.

308
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,720
Your shirt is so wrinkled.

309
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,400
I'm a swimmer.

310
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,600
But you didn't wash it.

311
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,400
Why?

312
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,680
I wore it.

313
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,560
So?

314
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,160
So...

315
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,080
So you have to wash it.

316
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,080
Your skin is thin.

317
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,120
I got a news.

318
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,960
But I'm not sure if it's true.

319
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,200
What?

320
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,560
Gao Jianhong and Fang Zhijin

321
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,120
are planning to launch an excuse.

322
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,120
You want to run if you can't stand still?

323
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,760
You want to die?

324
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,440
But if it's true,

325
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,240
they're preparing to hand over the materials.

326
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,440
So?

327
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,920
So if L.P. really goes public,

328
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,520
we can't beat Gao Jianhong.

329
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,440
I'll put it this way.

330
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,600
If I make him go public,

331
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,120
I'll be his son

332
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,840
from the bottom of my heart.

333
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,640
You have a plan?

334
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,240
No.

335
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,080
You really don't have one or you don't want to say it?

336
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,360
Is there a difference?

337
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,480
You should ask your project first.

338
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,440
Li Xun.

339
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,120
I told you everything, right?

340
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,000
Did you tell me?

341
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,520
I guessed it myself.

342
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,000
You guessed it.

343
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,880
But I didn't.

344
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,040
You have to tell me.

345
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,000
What do you want to say again?

346
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,720
We can't make the same mistake again.

347
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,320
No matter how you're going to deal with Gao Jianhong,

348
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,240
you have to discuss with me before you make a decision.

349
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,200
I'll tell you.

350
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,320
We have to communicate.

351
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,000
Li Xun, you're not alone now.

352
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,320
You have to communicate with me.

353
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,680
I understand.

354
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,520
What did you say three years ago?

355
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,760
What are you still saying now?

356
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,680
I'm out of your heart.

357
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,160
Jin Chen.

358
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,640
Jin Chen.

359
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,640
Jin Chen.

360
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,000
Jin Chen, I'm sorry.

361
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,800
I'm sorry.

362
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,200
I like your fans.

363
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,160
Jin Chen.

364
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,360
Jin Chen.

365
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,360
Jin Chen.

366
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,840
Can you sign here?

367
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,920
Jin Chen.

368
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,760
Thank you, Jin Chen.

369
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,960
Don't be so impulsive next time.

370
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,640
Thank you.

371
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,520
Jin Chen, I'll love you forever.

372
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,480
I love you forever.

373
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,240
Look.

374
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,560
I got a new girlfriend.

375
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,160
Jin Chen, I love you.

376
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,720
I love you so much.

377
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,520
Jin Chen.

378
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,440
Jin Chen.

379
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,880
I've told Gao Dao

380
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,760
that you would join

381
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,040
our next show, too.

382
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,720
I'm not going to

383
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,160
be on boring variety shows.

384
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,260
Yes.

385
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:22,920
Yes.

386
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,560
There's only the sí이트 and sofa?

387
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:25,940
Yes.

388
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,680
We have nothing different.

389
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,760
But it's fine, as long as fans like it.

390
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:32,500
In the porcelain!

391
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,700
nutric Ск產

392
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,740
In the downloader!

393
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,500
This doesn't count.

394
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:37,920
Keep away.

395
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,340
You're mad?

396
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,000
I know this song is not good.

397
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,080
But fans like it.

398
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,840
They are willing to spend money to buy an album.

399
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,280
Isn't it good?

400
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,400
Yuan Di, times have changed.

401
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,640
Now it's the trend.

402
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,200
As long as fans think it's good,

403
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,880
it's good.

404
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,080
Everyone is making money.

405
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,280
We don't have to be against the times.

406
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,160
I said don't touch me.

407
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,000
What?

408
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,720
The trending that we had a fight and broke up

409
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,880
is still on the list.

410
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,760
If you keep doing this, we'll be photographed again.

411
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,000
We'll be in the news.

412
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,040
Didn't you buy it yourself?

413
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,040
Trends are overflowing.

414
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,280
The age gap.

415
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,800
Aren't you a regular guest here?

416
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,520
It's all normal operation.

417
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,320
How do I know it's this one?

418
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,640
Maybe

419
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,280
everyone is interested in this topic.

420
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,080
It has to be aboutbanking.

421
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,880
I'm telling you,

422
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,640
i won't give the Blue Reds

423
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,520
performance as

424
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,640
a band that sucks blood.

425
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,140
What do you mean by that?

426
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:17,080
I mean by

427
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,440
pull me out the blue.

428
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,080
You can let anyone go

429
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,840
Not now

430
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,520
I am Qinghong

431
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,700
Oh hi

432
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,680
What can we do for you?

433
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,760
To be провод

434
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,720
software

435
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,800
Let me recommend

436
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,880
구 vitamins

437
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,880
h zusammen

438
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,440
For you

439
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,640
I bought three

440
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,000
is not easy

441
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,640
What if I don't like you?

442
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,640
Since you are so younger

443
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,600
They will give me a littleLEX

444
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,580
You will be fine

445
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,960
You really know to eat

446
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,360
Because of this

447
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,760
I want to confess

448
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,760
The sword on the sword

449
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,760
How can love be unbreakable?

450
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,760
Between the cruel and real sun

451
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,760
Who takes the mask to perform

452
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,760
Between the sad and real breath

453
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,760
The impudent laugh is laughing at me

454
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,760
Between the angry and real darkness

455
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,760
Who is the one who is not born to pretend to be young

456
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,760
Who is the one who is still using soul to make up

457
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,760
I'm blinded by love and hate

458
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,760
Love doesn't always move in the straight line

459
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,760
One day we hate each other

460
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,760
But the next we're doing fine

461
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,760
And the cruel truth

462
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,760
In the blink of an eye

463
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,760
For you to move on

464
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,760
Gotta leave me here behind

465
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,760
With these memories

466
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,760
Reveries

467
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,760
Golden like a treasury

468
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,760
Wish that we could blow a time out

469
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,760
Like a referee

470
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,760
But we can't

471
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,760
I know we had a plan

472
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,760
Supposed to be together forever

473
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,760
But in the end

474
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,400
I'm waiting in the end

475
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,800
So popular

476
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,160
It's been a hot search all day

477
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,760
It's a pity to quit Qinghong

478
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,320
According to the law

479
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,920
Qinghong band belongs to you

480
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,200
I tell you

481
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,160
The car that Jinchen drives now

482
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,760
Is the second one he bought this year

483
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,360
Count his previous ones

484
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,640
He has seven cars now

485
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,240
Five of them are red

486
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,760
He doesn't like red

487
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,160
Because when he bought the first car

488
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,960
He was so popular

489
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,840
He sold all the big orders

490
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,520
He thought red was a good choice

491
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,640
So he bought it

492
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,560
But fans thought he liked red

493
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,200
So he used red as a representative color

494
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,920
He said he was like

495
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,440
A man like a flame

496
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,360
After all these years

497
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,800
He also thinks red is good

498
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,600
But I think he

499
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,680
Actually forgot

500
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,560
What color he liked

501
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,080
Red is good for people

502
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,080
Jincheng is no longer

503
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,640
The little six in the toilet

504
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,640
Yes

505
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,560
It's too fast

506
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,280
Nothing is unchanging

507
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,080
Especially men

508
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,320
Drink

509
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,840
What are you doing?

510
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,240
Want to do another hot search?

511
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,560
Human enemy lovelorn

512
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,840
Qinghong band drummer human enemy

513
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,680
Bar drums

514
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,480
Leave him alone

515
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,600
Come or not

516
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,760
Go

517
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,720
Come on

518
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,240
Empty

519
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,840
Hello, here

520
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,960
Mr. Li, here

521
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,960
Please wait for a moment

522
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,760
Excuse me

523
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,320
Sorry

524
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,360
Can we talk about this matter

525
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,040
Please go ahead

526
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,040
Come here.

527
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,200
Thank you.

528
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,120
Thank you.

529
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,880
Mr. Gao, Luna, look here.

530
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,320
Luna, let's take a picture alone.

531
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,520
This is our first time meeting.

532
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,000
Please take good care of us.

533
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Yes.

534
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,360
Young and promising.

535
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,160
Hello.

536
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,840
Mr. Gao.

537
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,520
Hello.

538
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,280
Long time no see.

539
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,280
Long time no see.

540
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,520
Long time no see.

541
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,760
You guys talk first.

542
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,400
I'll leave you to it.

543
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,400
Okay.

544
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,880
The person you met at the Public Security Bureau last time,

545
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,880
I found out.

546
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,960
His name is Hou Ning.

547
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,960
He's a hacker.

548
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,200
He and Li Xun met in prison.

549
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,080
He's a second-rate employee.

550
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,360
Last time he joined a listed online company.

551
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,360
He got a lot of money.

552
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,880
He was sentenced to seven years.

553
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,280
He can hack into an online company.

554
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,760
He's got good skills.

555
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,040
After he went out,

556
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,840
he's been living with Li Xun.

557
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,280
Last time, when they came out of the Public Security Bureau,

558
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,280
they had a big fight.

559
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,280
It was a mess.

560
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,920
I've never seen this person again.

561
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,920
A mess?

562
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,160
We need to find out this person.

563
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,000
Be careful he's giving us a hard time.

564
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,840
Don't worry.

565
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,360
He knows Li Xun the best.

566
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,280
I found him.

567
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,000
How's your project with Li Xun going?

568
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,280
It's amazing.

569
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,280
I'm impressed.

570
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,280
Last week,

571
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,280
you were working on the tracking and sending system.

572
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,280
He gave me a task

573
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,280
and asked me to do it.

574
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,280
I spent a whole week on it.

575
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,280
I did it.

576
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,280
I showed it to him today.

577
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,280
Guess what he said.

578
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,280
He said he couldn't do it and wanted to redo it.

579
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,280
No.

580
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,280
He's done it.

581
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,280
I spent a whole week

582
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,280
on the work of lighting the nightstand.

583
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,280
He's done it in half a day.

584
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,280
Do you want to keep working?

585
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,280
You've been lighting it for a week.

586
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,280
You can't do it for a week.

587
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,280
He's been doing it for more than ten years.

588
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,280
Maybe you've been doing it for more than ten years.

589
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,280
You're better than him.

590
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,280
Oh my god.

591
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,280
Please forgive me.

592
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,280
Brother Xiu Zhu.

593
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,280
Then,

594
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,280
I'll go first.

595
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,280
Okay.

596
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,280
Why are you here?

597
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,280
Do you remember me?

598
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,280
We haven't seen each other for more than half a month.

599
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,280
I'm worried about my mom.

600
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,280
She's always like this when she's working.

601
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,280
I know.

602
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,280
Don't go.

603
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,280
Get off the building.

604
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,280
What's wrong?

605
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,280
What's wrong?

606
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,280
What can I do to you?

607
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,280
Don't wait for Zhu Yun

608
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,280
to be robbed by someone.

609
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,280
I didn't tell you.

610
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,280
What's going on?

611
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,280
That handsome and handsome

612
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,280
young and promising Tianhua is here again.

613
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,280
He's pulling Zhu Yun down the building.

614
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,280
Don't you know what you're talking about?

615
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,280
He's here.

616
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,280
Are you talking about Mr. Tian Xiu Zhu?

617
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,280
Does it have anything to do with you?

618
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,280
Why are you in a hurry?

619
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,280
Zhu Yun won't rob you.

620
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,280
Can I wear this?

621
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,280
No.

622
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,280
What kind of style is this?

623
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,280
A bear as a bodyguard?

624
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,280
Okay.

625
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,280
Does this show my temperament?

626
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,280
What's wrong with you?

627
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,280
You're not going?

628
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,280
If I had known that you would ignore me

629
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,280
after drawing the poster,

630
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,280
I should have spoken slowly.

631
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,280
I'm too busy at work.

632
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,280
How about I go to you for lunch

633
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,280
and have a meal?

634
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,280
I also want to eat hungry.

635
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,280
You don't have time today

636
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,280
just because you don't practice?

637
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,280
I can't leave today.

638
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,280
I'm also busy today.

639
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,280
Mr. Tian.

640
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,280
Mr. Tian, you're here.

641
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,280
Sorry to keep you waiting.

642
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,280
It's okay.

643
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,280
Let's go upstairs.

644
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,280
Okay.

645
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,280
The way up is this way.

646
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,280
I'm going to work.

647
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,280
Don't bother me.

648
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,280
Let's go.

649
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,280
Mr. Tian.

650
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,280
What's going on?

651
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,280
What's going on?

652
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,280
This way, please.

653
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,280
Please.

654
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,280
You're here

655
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,280
so often today.

656
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,280
Our boss is not here today.

657
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,280
Let me introduce you.

658
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,280
This is our project team leader,

659
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,280
Team Leader Li Xun.

660
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,280
We meet again.

661
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,280
Team Leader,

662
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,280
you can stand up now.

663
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,280
Hello.

664
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,280
Hello.

665
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,280
Come on, this way.

666
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,280
This way.

667
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,280
This way.

668
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,280
What's going on?

669
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,280
I'm better than you.

670
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,280
I'm better than you.

671
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,280
I want to know more.

672
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,120
You asked Tian Xiaozhu to come here?

673
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,280
Yes, I did.

674
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,000
You contacted her in private?

675
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,520
Kind of.

676
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,520
How did you get her contact information?

677
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,120
It's the plan given by Chief Li.

678
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,400
She asked me to leave a message

679
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,400
on the art request.

680
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,680
Are you sure it was Chief Li who asked you to do that?

681
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,480
Yes, I'm sure.

682
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,840
What else did she say?

683
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,520
She said...

684
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,400
She said

685
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,800
our company is on a heavy mission.

686
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,400
We haven't decided

687
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,600
on the art style of the project.

688
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,960
If we don't decide,

689
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,360
first, we'll overwork.

690
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,200
Second,

691
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,320
we'll have to add more employees.

692
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,000
Especially Chief Zhu.

693
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,480
Let's go to the meeting.

694
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,040
I'll go.

695
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,680
Don't use too much.

696
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,200
I remember now.

697
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,160
Before, Chief Li asked me to send her

698
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,000
the second edition of the poster

699
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,560
of Tian Xiaozhu.

700
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,560
I thought she wanted to see the effect.

701
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,400
But the trick was so deep.

702
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,720
I was wondering

703
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,240
why she would give up

704
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,800
the art resources that are hard to add.

705
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,880
I think it's you who sent her the letter.

706
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,640
I think so too.

707
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,240
She was jealous last time.

708
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,920
Now she's not as jealous as last time.

709
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,680
Amazing.

710
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,720
Let me make a bet with you.

711
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,600
What bet?

712
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,040
With your Chief Li,

713
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,480
if our company doesn't

714
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,720
make a fortune in two years,

715
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,840
I'll make a good deal

716
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,880
for you.

717
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,200
No need.

718
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,400
Why did you drive for so long?

719
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,680
What did you say?

720
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,240
You haven't finished yet.

721
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,000
I think she

722
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,880
has no intention of doing anything.

723
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,320
If she didn't know,

724
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,320
she would think they're close comrades.

725
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,040
I'm leaving.

726
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,000
Here, Mr. Tian.

727
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,320
Take care.

728
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:36,880
You've worked hard.

729
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,840
Why do you say I've worked hard?

730
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,680
I've worked hard.

731
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:46,920
Let's go together.

732
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I'll go there to have dinner.

733
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,320
Aren't you free tonight?

734
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,280
I'm taking a leave.

735
00:36:59,160 --> 00:36:59,760
Let's go.

736
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,440
Let's go.

737
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,480
What did you talk about in the meeting?

738
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,000
We talked about

739
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,480
the art style of this game.

740
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,080
And I'll help you

741
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,120
with the setting of several main characters.

742
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,240
This game is really good.

743
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,080
Except for the characters in each scene,

744
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,520
there are different times.

745
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,080
If you can experience each one,

746
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,600
I guess many people

747
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,720
will marry her.

748
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,000
Aren't you an artist?

749
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,280
Do you like this kind of game?

750
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,920
I'm an artist.

751
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,000
But I'm not a Taoist.

752
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,440
If there's a game

753
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,800
that makes you open a blind box,

754
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,760
you'll never know

755
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,800
what kind of person you'll be with

756
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,440
in the next game.

757
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
You won't like it?

758
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,720
I don't like it. I'm not interested.

759
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,800
Thank you.

760
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,680
You really have time to do it?

761
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,280
I've promised her.

762
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,240
You can go back on your word

763
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:25,760
if you agree.

764
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,720
You don't have to sign the contract.

765
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,400
You have to do your best,

766
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,040
Chu Yueyue.

767
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,640
What do you mean?

768
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,960
Your words

769
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,560
are very important to me.

770
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:38,960
Maybe

771
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:39,960
you'll be able to

772
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,880
understand me.

773
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,800
Of course I hope

774
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,920
all the projects we do

775
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,800
are good,

776
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,080
even if it's love,

777
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:45,960
and this kind of thing

778
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:46,880
that I don't like.

779
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,280
But I really haven't

780
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,680
trained Li Xun's level.

781
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,760
What level?

782
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,040
I just don't want to

783
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,320
drag you in.

784
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,040
Chu Yueyue,

785
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:04,960
I'm sorry.

786
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,760
I'm sorry.

787
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,600
I'm sorry.

788
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,480
I'm sorry.

789
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,440
I'm sorry.

790
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,280
I'm sorry.

791
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,080
I'm sorry.

792
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,240
Chu Yueyue,

793
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,000
you should understand

794
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,440
that I'm not helping her.

795
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,680
I'm helping you.

796
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,000
I've said

797
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,320
I hope you can succeed.

798
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,480
Besides,

799
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,520
this job is very simple for me.

800
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,600
The sooner you succeed,

801
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,120
the sooner we can leave here.

802
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,920
I don't want you to die here.

803
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,080
ops

804
00:39:50,000 --> 00:40:09,360
We had a training today with something

805
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:14,360
I know she is very persistent in her work.

806
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,360
But I didn't expect it to be this serious.

807
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:23,360
I think her health is very serious now.

808
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,360
She's holding it all in one breath.

809
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,360
What's wrong with her?

810
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,360
It's not particularly serious.

811
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,360
She just lacks rest.

812
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,360
She used to be like this. Always not resting.

813
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,360
You prefer this kind of life?

814
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:48,360
Actually, the time we spend together is not less than you and her.

815
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,360
It's just not that stimulating.

816
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,360
I prefer a stable life.

817
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:02,360
Because I think it's not easy to live a safe and healthy life.

818
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,360
Okay.

819
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,360
I'm going to France for a painting exhibition at the end of next year.

820
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,360
I hope you can go with me.

821
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,360
Xiu Zhu.

822
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,360
Zhu Yue.

823
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,360
You don't have to answer me so hurriedly.

824
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,360
No one can say anything good about the future.

825
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,360
I'm not going to say anything bad about the future.

826
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,360
Hurry up and eat.

827
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,360
Eat more.

828
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,360
Okay.

829
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,360
I'm going to France for a painting exhibition at the end of next year.

830
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,360
I hope you can go with me.

831
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,360
I'm going to France for a painting exhibition at the end of next year.

832
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,360
I'm going to France for a painting exhibition at the end of next year.

833
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,360
I'm going to France for a painting exhibition at the end of next year.

834
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,360
I'm going to France for a painting exhibition at the end of next year.

835
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,360
I'm going to France for a painting exhibition at the end of next year.

836
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,360
I'm going to France for a painting exhibition at the end of next year.

837
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,360
I'm going to France for a painting exhibition at the end of next year.

838
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,360
I'll go.

839
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,360
Have you thought about it?

840
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,960
Those forced by you

841
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,020
are all suspect

842
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,780
If you risk your life

843
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:13,220
can you see him clearly

844
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,920
Mr.イ

845
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:26,720
please

846
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,900
I还有那么多下visor

847
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,080
now I forget

848
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,220
what I am

849
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:06,420
I'm leaning on your shoulder

850
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:13,340
We will not part

851
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:16,500
Avoid the noisy world

852
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:23,340
Accompany me, I'm your new index

853
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:26,380
I'm bravely moving forward

854
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:33,100
Like the flames burning in the night

855
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:41,140
Cause I believe I love you

856
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:45,620
True love will take its course

857
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:49,460
I'm by your side

858
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,140
I spend a long time with you

859
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:58,660
Cause I believe I want you

860
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:03,100
True love will take its course

861
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:07,020
The burning fire

862
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:16,420
You are always on my side

863
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:24,140

Cause I won the world

870
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:53,300
Always with you

871
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:57,780
I'm by your side

872
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,020
Be brave

873
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:02,620
Every dream I have

874
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:10,180
I will not lose to the world again

875
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:14,820
Cause I believe I love you

876
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:19,300
