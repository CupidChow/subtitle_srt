2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if the light is very bright

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will still watch over that vast vast land

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless atmosphere

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day, the lens is a little bit yellow

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast night?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I burn up the night just for you to remember

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How everything was in the beginning

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The wind is like a wild grass

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The mountain is broken, but you are still by my side

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Everything is the original look

Episode 16

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Are you sure you won't use me again?

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
How about we go to the canteen first and eat something?

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You are back

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Hello

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Hello

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
She is the ordinary classmate you mentioned

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This is Li Xun, my classmate

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This is Tian Xiao Zhu

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Say it

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I won't eat in the canteen

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Wait for you to invite me to a big meal next time

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
No problem, I'll go first

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'll go first

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Li Xun, wait for me

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Which one?

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What is your new project?

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
A car parts company's input and output system

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Is it difficult?

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I didn't say

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You are back so early

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Anyway, I am free

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's better to come back and do something

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
After all, the boss just paid the salary

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I have to show my ability

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Who was it just now?

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
My driver

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Your driver?

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Your driver?

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Do you need someone to carry the bag?

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No, I don't have much money

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And I

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Don't be so rude

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's all because of the late arrival

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I should have left Xiu Zhu

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
At least I can help him

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I should have left her

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
At least I can help him

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You are so polite

59
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You are so generous

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,040
I'll call you

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Hello

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,180
Suddenly you standard

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Am I crazy?

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Back to say this kind of act

65
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Which way to the back door?

66
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,520
Take an Alid...

67
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,460
An alien film...

68
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,860
W Earlier a Soviet Hitler killed the Great 선생님

69
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,140
Wait for me

70
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,580
Take it

71
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,200
Will do

72
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,340
Ok

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,600
Then come and work.

74
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,800
Finally, you're back to work.

75
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,640
But

76
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,240
we still need to have the foundation.

77
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,320
It's not the time to start school yet.

78
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,680
You have no reason to ask me to do so.

79
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,120
You're doing it on purpose.

80
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,440
Really?

81
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,320
I can do it.

82
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,520
But you should be more positive.

83
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,720
I think you don't want to work anymore.

84
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,080
I'll let you go.

85
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,320
You can take a day off tomorrow.

86
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,640
Why?

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,640
You have a driver to accompany you.

88
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,920
Give me the documents and the code.

89
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,880
Are you free now?

90
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,600
He's not my driver.

91
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,240
He's my mother's classmate's son.

92
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,280
And then?

93
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,880
I've known him since I was a kid.

94
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,040
We even ate chicken wings in the competition.

95
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,760
And then?

96
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,760
And then...

97
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,640
And then...

98
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,640
And then he threw up.

99
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,720
And then?

100
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,760
And then he went abroad.

101
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,200
You know everything about it.

102
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,720
He's the warm-hearted man who can draw, right?

103
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,840
You remember it so clearly.

104
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,800
Are you satisfied?

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,200
Can you give me the documents and the code?

106
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,360
Ru Yan.

107
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,880
If you dare to lie again,

108
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,640
you'll be the one to pay for it.

109
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,680
I'm not lying.

110
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,360
I'm not lying.

111
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,040
I'm not lying.

112
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,560
I'm not lying.

113
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,480
I'm not lying.

114
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,400
I'm not lying.

115
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
I'm not lying.

116
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,400
I'm not lying.

117
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,900
야

118
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,920
The door is locked.

119
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,840
Is there a password?

120
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,360
Where's gothat man?

121
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,520
If there's no fan, then ask him to go back early.

122
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,800
I'm sorry.

123
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,640
What's wrong?

124
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,760
You're ordering?

125
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,240
I'm treating you today.

126
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,000
It's a good opportunity.

127
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,960
You finally remember me.

128
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,720
What do you mean by finally?

129
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,160
Listen.

130
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,520
Look.

131
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,880
I've made money.

132
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,440
Of course I have to treat you.

133
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,360
How does it feel to spend your own money?

134
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,560
Do you feel very successful?

135
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,800
I feel sorry for you.

136
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,160
Tell me.

137
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,160
What do you need me to do this time?

138
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,280
You don't have to be so purposeful.

139
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,520
You've put so much effort into it.

140
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,000
You don't want me to add some extra value.

141
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,600
Do you believe it?

142
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,200
I'm very sincere.

143
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,720
We'll have dinner together today.

144
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,400
Order whatever you want.

145
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,240
Okay.

146
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,600
I want this.

147
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,400
The heart is like a knife.

148
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,240
What's this?

149
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,280
It's watermelon juice.

150
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,320
It's such a expensive name.

151
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,080
It's strange that it's not the heart like a knife.

152
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,840
X 속嘴都笑哪

153
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,120
Xiuzhu.

154
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,720
After dinner, you should go back to have a rest.

155
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,920
Why are you back so early?

156
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,040
Something happened to your classmate, right?

157
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,720
Of course not.

158
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,480
I saw your classmate

159
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,680
at the art gallery last time.

160
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,320
Why didn't you say hello to us?

161
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,960
You're so honest.

162
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,880
I'm afraid you'll be scared when you wake up.

163
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,040
What?

164
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,200
Are girls now

165
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,040
all about looking at faces?

166
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,800
I didn't expect you to be so lucky

167
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,480
to be in the class.

168
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,960
So you think he's handsome, too?

169
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,640
You're good at making a point.

170
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,080
You're always so silly.

171
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,840
Apple chicken is easy to eat.

172
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,480
I don't think he's safe.

173
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,440
What do you mean?

174
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,280
I'll be honest with you.

175
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,600
He's too strong

176
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,440
but he's not my type.

177
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,400
You've only met him a few times.

178
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,240
I don't want to talk to someone

179
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,720
like my aunt.

180
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,640
But I don't think he's your type.

181
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,960
You can't change him.

182
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,120
Why should I change him?

183
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,320
Because you'll get hurt.

184
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,880
How can you be sure?

185
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,040
You don't know him.

186
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,480
I don't know him.

187
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,920
But I know you.

188
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,320
Xiu Zhu,

189
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,600
you're really like my mom.

190
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,400
You think you know me well.

191
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,120
You don't like people who are different.

192
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,160
You can't accept others' past.

193
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
No matter if others' past

194
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,240
is in his control.

195
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,920
You can blame others

196
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,200
with your own ideas.

197
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,040
To be honest,

198
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,440
you're really too much.

199
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,000
I hope I'm wrong.

200
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,040
I'm sorry.

201
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,240
I should be the one to say sorry.

202
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,200
You...

203
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,320
Why are you here?

204
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,000
Hello.

205
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,680
Ye Du Constитай,

206
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,320
am I off ?

207
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,960
Thank you for your game, Xiu Zhu.

208
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,000
Have fun today.

209
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,360
I'm sorry for today.

210
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,040
I'll make you more money when you make big money.

211
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,560
It's a deal.

212
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,920
I'm leaving.

213
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,680
If my mom calls, don't tell her you missed it.

214
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,000
I know.

215
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,120
I'm going back. Have a good night.

216
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,520
Bye.

217
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,200
Episode 10

218
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,080
Fang Shumiao.

219
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,240
You're here.

220
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,520
I just met Mr. Lin.

221
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,920
He asked you to his office.

222
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,120
He asked me.

223
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,760
I think he has good news.

224
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,320
I think he's happy.

225
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,680
Why are you here at this time?

226
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,520
The committee of the Education Commission is coming tomorrow.

227
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,560
I haven't finished the homework.

228
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,200
I'm leaving.

229
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,840
By the way, I'm the Minister of Publication of the Student Union.

230
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,840
Please vote for me.

231
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,800
You're promoted.

232
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,120
Of course.

233
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,000
What did you expect me to say?

234
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,840
How can you be so insensible?

235
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,320
I'm happy.

236
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,280
What are you doing?

237
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,760
Let her go.

238
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,240
Where?

239
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,840
Let go of my hand.

240
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,480
Stop.

241
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,160
What's going on?

242
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,960
Next month,

243
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,360
the first round of the Information Security Competition

244
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,760
of Nanhu University

245
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,360
will be held at the Information Science and Technology University.

246
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,560
Do you know that?

247
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,360
It seems to be a big event.

248
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,760
It seems to be a big event.

249
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,320
Of course.

250
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,800
Although this is the first round,

251
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,840
this is the first time

252
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,440
that the College of Education

253
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,440
held a competition

254
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,240
in the whole field of Information Security.

255
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,480
In fact,

256
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,560
your university students

257
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,280
don't have the qualification to participate.

258
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,800
They think your application is good.

259
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,080
Especially,

260
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,600
they think I'm so shameless

261
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,280
and give them the quota.

262
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,920
So many people are looking for it.

263
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,800
I let her go. Look.

264
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,880
She's pushing me away.

265
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,280
You're the representative of the class. You should show your respect.

266
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,680
I have to go. I have to go.

267
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,800
I'm going.

268
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,000
The integration system of the source and the cargo is out.

269
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,280
Who will do it?

270
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,320
Don't be so arrogant.

271
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,680
How much time can it take

272
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,400
to participate in a competition?

273
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,840
Didn't Gao Jianhong sign up?

274
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,680
He's gone.

275
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,960
Can he go alone?

276
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,480
You all have to go.

277
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,280
I have to go, too.

278
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,440
Of course.

279
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,480
Participating in the competition

280
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,960
and opening your eyes

281
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,960
is to let you and the industry,

282
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,000
the academic world,

283
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,200
and the top experts

284
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,880
communicate more

285
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,400
and find your shortcomings.

286
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,160
No need.

287
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,040
What?

288
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,880
What did you say?

289
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,040
No need.

290
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,400
You don't need it.

291
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,080
Mr. Bai.

292
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,040
No.

293
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,160
You said you didn't need it.

294
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,120
Do you think

295
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,440
you don't have any shortcomings?

296
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,120
Yes.

297
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,480
Mr. Bai.

298
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,320
If you want to get the school's name

299
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,680
and make a cover,

300
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,120
I don't think you need it.

301
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,480
Li Xun.

302
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,640
You're too arrogant.

303
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,360
Who do you think you are?

304
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,400
What do you mean?

305
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,120
Let me do it.

306
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,080
I'm telling you.

307
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,680
You...

308
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,360
Mr. Bai, don't be angry.

309
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,360
Don't be like this.

310
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,240
Sit down.

311
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,320
I've seen many

312
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,160
naughty students like him.

313
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,880
I...

314
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,400
Yes.

315
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:41,960
I'm just...

316
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,240
What a great opportunity.

317
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,560
Participating in the competition

318
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,560
is the top expert in the country.

319
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,840
Even the sponsors

320
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,320
are the most capable

321
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,320
in the industry.

322
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,160
Those companies

323
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,480
are waiting for the winners

324
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,120
to announce their work,

325
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,120
cooperate directly

326
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,320
and invest in it.

327
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,080
You've been doing

328
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,200
the foundation project for so long.

329
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,040
You've been doing

330
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,400
the foundation project for so long.

331
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,080
You've improved your professional skills.

332
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,400
You're the boss.

333
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,280
You should be the best.

334
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,320
I know you two are close.

335
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,800
Is it that obvious?

336
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,240
You must convince him

337
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,040
to participate.

338
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,000
I'll try my best.

339
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,560
Not try your best.

340
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,840
You must.

341
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,920
Or I'll take your question.

342
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,680
I must.

343
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,440
He's so temperamental.

344
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,120
He'll suffer a lot sooner or later.

345
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,720
Zhu Yan,

346
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,840
you're the representative.

347
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,880
And he trusts you.

348
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,800
You must keep him in check.

349
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,560
Okay.

350
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,720
Li Xuan.

351
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,920
Don't waste your time.

352
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,400
I know

353
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,440
it's not interesting

354
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,440
for Li Tiancai to take part in the competition.

355
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,560
Others go to learn

356
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,520
when they take part in the competition.

357
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,160
But Li Zhuang goes to work

358
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,480
when he takes part in the competition.

359
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,080
Go.

360
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,200
Just treat it as

361
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,840
training our team.

362
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,440
It's not good to be alone.

363
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,440
You should help him.

364
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,440
He's a good guy.

365
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,280
He's a good guy.

366
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,040
You should help him.

367
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm a good guy.

368
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,200
I'm a good guy.

369
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,320
I'm a good guy.

370
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,560
I'm a good guy.

371
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,640
I'm a good guy.

372
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,880
I'm a good guy.

373
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,160
You should help the team.

374
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,720
You're thinking about Fang Shumiao.

375
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,360
Political Commissar Zhu.

376
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,640
You're thinking about me?

377
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,800
Take it away.

378
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,160
You can not take part in the competition.

379
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,280
But the forum is interesting.

380
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,600
Like Xingchuan Company

381
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,760
is specialized in

382
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,880
shipping goods.

383
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,800
So?

384
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,440
So we go to

385
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,520
check their bugs.

386
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,280
Do you agree?

387
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,040
No.

388
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,440
Then I can't go.

389
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,360
Blind fight.

390
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,160
Blind side.

391
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,200
Blind spot.

392
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,600
Who are you?

393
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,040
You work so hard

394
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,600
to get us a quota.

395
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,000
You should go to a forum

396
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,520
to make him happy.

397
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,240
You're so fake.

398
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,320
What are you doing?

399
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,040
Go with me.

400
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,600
Li Xun.

401
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,840
You should go to the forum

402
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,040
with me.

403
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,200
How's the weather next month?

404
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,160
He really agreed.

405
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,120
Why are you so nervous?

406
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,720
This is the first meal.

407
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,640
The first meal.

408
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,480
Are you afraid that

409
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,520
your work can't be completed?

410
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,240
I just want to ask more.

411
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,160
I feel more at ease.

412
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,080
You're too nervous.

413
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,160
It's not the mental state of the competition.

414
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,080
Relax.

415
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,080
Sometimes,

416
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,000
my mom,

417
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,200
Li Xun,

418
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,160
is arrogant.

419
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,240
But sometimes,

420
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,720
you should learn from her.

421
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,040
Her confidence.

422
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,560
Young people, no matter what they do,

423
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,360
they should be careful about themselves.

424
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,440
Okay.

425
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,040
Mr. Ling.

426
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,640
Since I decided to participate in the competition,

427
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,520
I don't want to be casual this time.

428
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,120
I want to

429
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,880
prove my ability.

430
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,600
If you say so,

431
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,000
it means you're confident.

432
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,120
What's your topic?

433
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,160
Based on the interchanged machine,

434
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,200
the G-Wave ARP attack defense system.

435
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,040
This topic is difficult.

436
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,480
How long do you prepare for this topic?

437
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,280
Two days.

438
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,600
Impossible.

439
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,640
Actually, it's been a while.

440
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,400
I usually organize some materials

441
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,840
and collect some questions.

442
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,280
I was going to

443
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,040
use the materials for the graduation thesis.

444
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,160
Good topic.

445
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,160
It should be a cold topic.

446
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,680
And it's practical.

447
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,720
Remember.

448
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,640
Opportunity

449
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,320
is always left to the prepared.

450
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:24,120
I'm going to the

451
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,120
university.

452
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,120
I'm going to the university.

453
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,120
I'm going to the university.

454
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,120
I'm going to the university.

455
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,120
I'm going to the university.

456
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,120
I'm going to the university.

457
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,120
I'm going to the university.

458
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,120
I'm going to the university.

459
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,120
I'm going to the university.

460
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,120
I'm going to the university.

461
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,120
I'm going to the university.

462
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,120
I'm going to the university.

463
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,120
I'm going to the university.

464
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,120
I'm going to the university.

465
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,120
I'm going to the university.

466
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,120
I'm going to the university.

467
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,120
I'm going to the university.

468
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,120
I'm going to the university.

469
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,120
I'm going to the university.

470
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,120
I'm going to the university.

471
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,120
I'm going to the university.

472
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,120
I'm going to the university.

473
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,120
I'm going to the university.

474
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,120
I'm going to the university.

475
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,800
MUSIC

476
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,560
Here

477
00:22:52,120 --> 00:23:16,400
perfect

478
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,080
here

479
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,720
Okay.

480
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,440
Okay, see you later.

481
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,400
Gao.

482
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,200
Go in there yourself.

483
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,440
Help me report to Zhou Ying.

484
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,080
You...

485
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,160
What about you?

486
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,400
We'll go to the gender biome

487
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,600
and meet with their manager.

488
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,560
They've been wanting to talk to me

489
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,840
about developing the biome database.

490
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,600
You agreed to come here

491
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,720
for the gender biome?

492
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,120
Or what?

493
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,880
You're so stubborn.

494
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,920
What's stubborn?

495
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,560
Where did you get your ass?

496
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,400
Don't forget you're my man.

497
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,440
See you later.

498
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,040
Okay.

499
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,480
See you.

500
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,000
Bye.

501
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,500
Where are some school members?

502
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,480
South Lake University.

503
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,540
Leu Taking Best Second.

504
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,400
At the entrance.

505
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:22,920
Okay.

506
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,360
Thank you.

507
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,000
No problem.

508
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,400
Go and check which school he's from.

509
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,360
He's from C region.

510
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,360
Which school are you from?

511
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,620
Mr. Luável.

512
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,800
You just need to pass him one pass.

513
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,320
Okay.

514
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,360
Why are you standing here?

515
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,000
She has a tendency to write a love letter.

516
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,200
Anything that seems amazing

517
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,280
is Kabbalat Fun.

518
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,520
In my book,

519
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,520
Hello, I'm Gao Jianhong.

520
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,520
I'm Nan...

521
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,520
You're from Nanhu University, right?

522
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,520
Hello, I'm Xu Li Na.

523
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,520
I'm from the Computer Science Department.

524
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,520
I'm also a freshman.

525
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,520
Gao Jianhong.

526
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,520
You should have two more people.

527
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,520
Li Xun and Zhu Yun.

528
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,520
Didn't they come?

529
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,520
They don't participate in the competition.

530
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,520
They only participate in the forum.

531
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,520
Okay, fine.

532
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,520
How did you know me?

533
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,520
I'm also a participant.

534
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,520
The Lan Guan app is about to be uploaded.

535
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,520
You did it, right?

536
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,520
Yes.

537
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,520
You're pretty good.

538
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,520
Only the first-year students can do it.

539
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,520
You can still participate in such a high-quality competition.

540
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,520
It's been a day.

541
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,520
There are very few students in this department.

542
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,520
Let alone the first-year students.

543
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,520
It's mainly our teacher who gave us the strength.

544
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,520
What's wrong?

545
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,520
You're obviously very capable.

546
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,520
But you're not good enough.

547
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,520
You're much better than the boys in our school.

548
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,520
Go and do the paperwork.

549
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,520
We'll talk later.

550
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,520
Okay.

551
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,520
Give him two room cards.

552
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,520
Okay.

553
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,520
Hello, which school are you from?

554
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,520
Middle School.

555
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,520
Give him two cards, too.

556
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,520
Are you free tonight?

557
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,520
Let's go out for dinner.

558
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,520
Okay, you've done a lot.

559
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,520
Okay, basically, it's almost done.

560
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,520
You've worked hard.

561
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,520
See you tomorrow.

562
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,520
Bye-bye.

563
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,520
Sorry to keep you waiting.

564
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,520
No, I just got off the bus.

565
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,520
I've booked the restaurant.

566
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,520
Let's go eat.

567
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,520
Okay.

568
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,520
I'll call a cab.

569
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,520
No, come with me.

570
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,520
Welcome to come again.

571
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,520
See you.

572
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,520
Miss Yu, the seat is reserved for you.

573
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,520
It's still your old seat.

574
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,520
Okay, thank you.

575
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,520
This way.

576
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,520
This way, please.

577
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,520
Please sit.

578
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,520
Thank you.

579
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,520
Please.

580
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,520
Let's go.

581
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,520
If I knew you'd bring me to such an official place,

582
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,520
I should have worn my only suit.

583
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,520
Although everyone said...

584
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,520
Have some water.

585
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,520
Thank you.

586
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,520
Although everyone said

587
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,520
I look like a real estate agent in that suit.

588
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,520
Really?

589
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,520
I'd like to see it.

590
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,520
Actually, it's not that formal here.

591
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,520
Everyone has their own style.

592
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,520
If you wear something really fancy,

593
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,520
it's just to take a picture and post it on WeChat.

594
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,520
Look, the two over there.

595
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,520
Do you want me to take a few for you?

596
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,520
Sure.

597
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,520
Okay.

598
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,520
Let me see.

599
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,520
What are you taking?

600
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,520
I've already transformed.

601
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,520
You've made me look 1.2 meters.

602
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,520
Look at me.

603
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,520
I still have a pearl on my head.

604
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,520
I see.

605
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,520
I'm a little bit delicate.

606
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,520
The best scenery is also a good time.

607
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,520
Let me take another two.

608
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,520
Yes.

609
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,520
A little higher.

610
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,520
One more.

611
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,520
Look.

612
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,520
Much better.

613
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,520
Let's take a selfie.

614
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,520
Stand closer.

615
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,520
Three, two, one.

616
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,520
The two behind are okay.

617
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,520
It's pretty.

618
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,520
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the menu.

619
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,520
Thank you.

620
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,520
This is pretty good.

621
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,520
Stop looking.

622
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,520
The one you took is a lady's menu.

623
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,520
There's no price on it.

624
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,520
How does it taste?

625
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,520
Pretty good.

626
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,520
Cheers.

627
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,520
If we can write codes in such a beautiful place,

628
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,520
it will be very efficient.

629
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,520
Good idea.

630
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,520
Next time, we can try it.

631
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,520
Then we two will become

632
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,520
a beautiful scenery on the outside.

633
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,520
Why is your god Li Xun

634
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,520
always missing?

635
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,520
He's not here.

636
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,520
He's not here.

637
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,520
He's not here.

638
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,520
He's not here.

639
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,520
Why haven't we seen him?

640
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
You're looking for him?

641
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,520
Your Blue Can App?

642
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,520
I heard he's your captain.

643
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,520
Our practice base was built by him.

644
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,520
Blue Can is the project we took on.

645
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,520
I downloaded your app.

646
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,520
It's not about operation, but about creativity.

647
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,520
I think that...

648
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,520
Where's uncomfortable, point where.

649
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,520
That design is very interesting.

650
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,520
Where's uncomfortable, point where.

651
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,520
You're really good at naming things.

652
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,520
To be honest,

653
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,520
my programming is very poor.

654
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,520
Impossible.

655
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,520
The computer department of the Department of Computer Science is very close to the top.

656
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,520
But I'm a special student of the National Dance.

657
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,520
I just got into this major.

658
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,520
I'm not good at math.

659
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,520
I'm in class now,

660
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,520
just like listening to the sky.

661
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,520
Do you understand?

662
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,520
Don't be modest.

663
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,520
You're here to participate in the competition.

664
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,520
All the students in our class look down on me.

665
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,520
They all think I'm an art student.

666
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,520
They don't even allow me to do homework.

667
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,520
I'm here to participate in the competition.

668
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,520
I just want to get a name tag back.

669
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,520
Let them see.

670
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,520
What did you think of the app?

671
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,520
Can you tell me?

672
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,520
You want to hear?

673
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,520
The shopping website has just started these years.

674
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,520
It looks like there are many places to put up the flag.

675
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,520
But it won't take long.

676
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,520
Most resources will be slowly integrated into several large platforms.

677
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,520
The second trend is the popularity of smart phones.

678
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,520
We gave up the large website and chose the app.

679
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,520
It's because the feature of large platforms is wide.

680
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,520
And the features of the app are gold.

681
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,520
You have to be deep and gold in one function.

682
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,520
It meets the needs of the user.

683
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,520
It meets the user's habits.

684
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:56,520
Because in the future, the user interface of the app will be lower than the website.

685
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,520
Why?

686
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,520
Because everyone has a cell phone.

687
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,520
It can be used anytime.

688
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,520
But the computer is not.

689
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,520
So we added a certificate search system based on different user images.

690
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,520
You don't need to know what disease you have.

691
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,520
You just need to enter the certificate.

692
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,520
Secondly, we added the Mockup.

693
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,520
Mockup?

694
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,520
It's the action capture system.

695
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,520
Many Hollywood movies have added this technology.

696
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,520
Our model is also based on this technology.

697
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,520
This is more intuitive than inputting the certificate, right?

698
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,520
How is it?

699
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,520
Very good, dear.

700
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,520
Really, very good.

701
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,520
Actually, there are still many shortcomings.

702
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,520
You are already very good.

703
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,520
You are too modest.

704
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,520
I have a lot to say today.

705
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,520
No, no, you can tell me more.

706
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,520
You still want to hear?

707
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,520
Although the smart phone is not fully popular now,

708
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,520
the internet speed of mobile internet is still very fast.

709
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,520
But in the future...

710
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,520
We have arrived.

711
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,520
Lao Gao, you will win the four-star security contest.

712
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,520
You will definitely win.

713
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,520
Thank you.

714
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,520
I'm leaving.

715
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,520
Go back and rest early.

716
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,520
Good night.

717
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,520
Bye bye.

718
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,520
Good night.

719
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,520
Good night.

720
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,520
You are back.

721
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,520
How was the talk today?

722
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,520
It's okay.

723
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,520
The photo sent by you.

724
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,520
Thank you.

725
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,520
Don't drive and play with your phone.

726
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,520
Go home and talk.

727
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,520
I'm leaving.

728
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,520
Who is it?

729
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,520
It's me.

730
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,520
I'll be right there.

731
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,520
Lao Gao, what are you doing?

732
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,520
Coming.

733
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,520
Good morning.

734
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,520
Good morning.

735
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,520
Can I go in?

736
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,520
Yes.

737
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,520
You are alone?

738
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,520
Yes.

739
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,520
Did you have breakfast?

740
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,520
I don't have the habit of having breakfast.

741
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,520
Lao Gao, can you help me look at my competition project?

742
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,520
Of course. If you don't mind.

743
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,520
I don't ask for free.

744
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,520
Here, reward, osmanthus cake.

745
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,520
Delicious.

746
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,520
Delicious?

747
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,520
The sign of the green waves is delicious.

748
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,520
Help me look at it.

749
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:44,640
This is our software

750
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,640
What are you doing this time?

751
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,640
We are

752
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,520
Introduce yourself.

753
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,520
This is Li Xun.

754
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,520
Hello, Li Xun. My name is Xulina.

755
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,520
I've heard of your name before.

756
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,520
Sorry to bother you.

757
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,520
Li Xun, can you help me look at

758
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,520
Our team's competition project?

759
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,520
Is there anything to be improved?

760
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,520
Look, this is the software's

761
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,520
Reversible Self-Discovery System.

762
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,520
And its principles.

763
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,520
This is not what you did yourself, right?

764
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,520
Li Xun.

765
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,520
How did you see it?

766
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,520
The principle of software company's reversible system

767
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,520
There are only two kinds.

768
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,520
The first one is through the internal digital experiment.

769
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,520
The second one is when the software company is in contact

770
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,520
To grab information.

771
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,520
You are the second one here.

772
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,520
But your two ideas are useless.

773
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,520
The premise of grabbing information is

774
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,520
Your software can cross the front line of Windows

775
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,520
Directly visit the internal data of C盘问32

776
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,520
The internal data of the relevant files.

777
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,520
But you are really Windows system

778
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,520
Personal security and firewall are dry.

779
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,520
Many domestic companies are PPOE

780
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,520
Network of no number

781
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,520
The IP address of the network will change regularly.

782
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,520
However, MAC is after the SNMP service.

783
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,520
Will only show up when it is uploaded.

784
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,520
The rest of the way to take the test

785
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,520
Teach them.

786
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,520
So stubborn.

787
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,520
Li Xun, say less.

788
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,520
Li Xun, do we have an old one?

789
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,520
Because others can't see it.

790
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,520
Find a better way to do it.

791
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,520
Let him follow the first idea.

792
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,520
Reversible

793
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,520
It's easier to avoid this.

794
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,520
Wait.

795
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,520
The first idea you just said

796
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,520
Can you tell me again?

797
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,520
Sorry, I'm not free.

798
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,520
Can I ask you next time?

799
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,520
After I fix this

800
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,520
Let you see

801
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,520
No, I have no obligation to give others a job.

802
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,520
My name is Xu Li Na

803
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,520
I am a software engineer of Sink

804
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,520
She is like this.

805
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,520
Don't mind

806
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,520
She is too awesome.

807
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,520
I will be back.

808
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,520
Hello

You will come back here again.

826
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,520
Win or lose

827
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,520

Ok ok ok

839
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,520
Hello, teacher.

840
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,520
I will find WeChat.

841
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,520
See you later.

842
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,520
I will definitely find WeChat.

843
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,520
See you later.

844
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,520
See you later.

845
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,520
See you later.

846
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,520
See you later.

847
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,520
Brother, can you add WeChat?

848
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,520
Ok, you find me.

849
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,520
You know me.

850
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,520
Your team's project is so great.

851
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,520
Special attention

852
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,520
Only your team can get it.

853
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,520
Thank you.

854
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,520
Which university are you from?

855
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,520
I will keep it in mind.

856
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,520
I am from Nanhu University.

857
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,520
Nanhu University

858
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,520
Your school has a school called Li Xun.

859
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,520
Yes, the blue crown app

860
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,520
Is what we do together.

861
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,520
What about this?

862
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,520
You also do it together.

863
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,520
This project, he didn't participate.

864
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,520
I did it alone.

865
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,520
Xiao Fa

866
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,520
Let's go.

867
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,520
Ok, talk to the teacher.

868
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,520
Is it beautiful?

869
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,520
Ok, thank you.

870
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,520
Nothing.

871
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,520
Brother.

872
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,520
Congratulations.

873
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,520
Thank you.

874
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,520
Congratulations.

875
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,520
Thank you.

876
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,520
Where is Li Xun?

877
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,520
He may be busy.

878
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,520
He is so busy.

879
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,520
No wonder I haven't got his WeChat yet.

880
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,520
You have added his WeChat.

881
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,520
Don't forget, I am a volunteer.

882
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,520
Lao Gao

883
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,520
Can you tell him for me?

884
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,520
Let his friends pass.

885
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,520
Ok

886
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,520
I will treat you to dinner tonight.

887
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,520
I will take some students in the photo.

888
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,520
Let's celebrate together.

889
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,520
Ok

890
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,520
You must let Li Xun come.

891
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,520
I can enter the final this time.

892
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,520
Thanks to him.

893
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,520
I have to thank him.

894
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,520
I will try my best.

895
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,520
Ok

896
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,520
Fang Zhijian

897
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,520
You are the one who is entangled.

898
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,520
I will give Zhang Bao to you.

899
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,520
Let him get dirty.

900
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,520
He killed himself because of you.

901
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,520
You killed him.

902
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,520
Chu Yue

903
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,520
He has a problem in his heart.

904
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,520
Join the competition with me.

905
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,520
To defeat this project.

906
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,520
Not enough.

907
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:07,520
I won the world for me.

908
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:13,520
The car in the city doesn't stop.

909
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:18,520
I lean on your shoulder.

910
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:24,520
We won't be separated.

911
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,520
Avoid the noisy world.

912
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,520
Accompany me.

913
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:34,520
I am your new point of view.

914
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,520
Raise me up bravely.

915
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:44,520
Like the flame of the night.

916
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:52,520
Because I believe I love you.

917
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,520
True love will take its course.

918
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,520
I am by your side.

919
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,520
I spend a long time with you.

920
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:10,520
Because I believe I want you.

921
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,520
True love will take its course.

922
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,520
The firework is always on.

923
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:26,520
You are always the one who keeps me company.

924
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,520
I won the world for me.

925
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,520
The car in the city doesn't stop.

926
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,520
I lean on your shoulder.

927
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,520
Be brave.

928
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,520
Every dream I have.

929
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:21,520
I won't lose to the world again.

930
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,520
Because I believe I love you.

931
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:30,520
True love will take its course.

00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:34,520
I am by your side.

Because I believe I want you.

935
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,520
True love will take its course.

936
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,520
The firework is always on.

937
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:59,520
You are always the one who keeps me company.

00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:07,520

I am by your side.

941
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,520
I spend a long time with you.

942
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,520
Because I believe I want you.

943
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:30,520
True love will take its course.

944
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,520
The firework is always on.

945
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:42,520
You are always the one who keeps me company.

946
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:51,520
The firework is always on.

947
00:47:52,520 --> 00:48:02,520
You are always the one who keeps me company.
