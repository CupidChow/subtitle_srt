2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if the light is very bright

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will still watch over it

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the endless atmosphere

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every scene has a touch of gold

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am the light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast night?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I burn up the night just for you

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This is how everything was at the beginning

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am the light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I will shine like a wild grass

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I will be with you even if the world is broken

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Everything is how it was at the beginning

Episode 16

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Take off your coat

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What's wrong?

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I am using the lighter

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I will go find it

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Wait a minute

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You sit here first, I will help you

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Aunt, have you seen a lighter?

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Golden little

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Lighter

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
No

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
This is my phone

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
If you see it, call me

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Ok, thank you

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Thank you

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I still haven't found it

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But I told them all

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Call me as soon as you find it

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Go

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'll find it again

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Maybe

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's ok, go

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Hello

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I found it

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What?

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You didn't break it

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I am sorry

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I shouldn't have helped you choose the volleyball

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I just want you to move

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I didn't expect you almost sent me away

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Ask me whatever you want

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Is this lighter very important to you?

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yes

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You don't smoke

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You always carry this lighter with you

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Who gave it to you?

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
My dad left it

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
When I was a kid

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
My dad died of car accident

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
When I was in high school

60
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
My family sold houses

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I found this lighter from the bottom of the tree

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
My mom said

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
My dad is a truck driver

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
He is very blind

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
He just gave birth to me

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He asked my mom to hide this lighter

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Where he couldn't find

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
He couldn't find a place

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
He didn't want to smoke

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
He wanted to smoke in his home

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Later, he ran a long way to make money

72
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And he died of a car accident

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So I always carried it

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I think my dad left it to me in the dark

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's like our promise

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
He is gone

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I have to take care of my mom and my sister for him

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But I still failed

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
My mom is gone

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
My sister is a bastard

81
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
She has a harder life than anyone else

82
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I am sorry

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's an old mistake

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Maybe

85
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
My dad wanted to smoke

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I am sorry

87
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I am sorry

88
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I am sorry

89
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I am sorry

90
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I am sorry

91
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I am sorry

92
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I am sorry

93
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I am sorry

94
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I am sorry

95
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I am sorry

96
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I am sorry

97
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I am sorry

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I am sorry

99
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I am sorry

100
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I am sorry

101
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I am sorry

102
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I am sorry

103
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I am sorry

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I am sorry

105
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I am sorry

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I am sorry

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I am sorry

108
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I am sorry

109
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I am sorry

110
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I am sorry

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I am sorry

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I am sorry

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I am sorry

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I am sorry

115
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I am sorry

116
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Poisoned

117
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,680
This is Guo He Purple….

118
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,880
What does it mean?

119
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,880
Ma Yan Traffic dawns…

120
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,420
C

121
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,720
You need this Pam world again?

122
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,720
What the Brand is this?

123
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,760
It may be too much

124
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,600
I'm not sure.

125
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,000
Did you make this?

126
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,240
I'll be a student.

127
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,880
Don't say I'm a chicken who drags you down.

128
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,760
The question mark is here.

129
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,520
You made this for me?

130
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,640
Just practice.

131
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,800
I can make ten of these things a day.

132
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,280
Selfish.

133
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,320
You'll die if you get in.

134
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,680
How can you get into college?

135
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,280
Give me a call.

136
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,400
You're in another class.

137
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,040
Okay, thanks.

138
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,320
You'll find somewhere to stay.

139
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,360
No.

140
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,040
I'm going to the classroom.

141
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,840
Good morning.

142
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,680
Morning.

143
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,400
Oh, I'm staying up late today.

144
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:33,840
However,

145
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:43,300
the

146
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,920
output of Program B

147
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,640
and好吃,

148
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,200
so we will have a

149
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,860
shocking result.

150
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,960
I don't wait any more understanding.

151
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:00,920
After

152
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,760
we take theっと topicль

153
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,000
and let Masterrich

154
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,480
Tell me

155
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,720
It's you personally to do it?

156
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,560
How about you two?

157
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,660
They ready for the

158
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:22,300
new arrangement

159
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,780
I'm looking into Gao Binfa

160
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,440
I've done almost everything.

161
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,440
You can optimize it again.

162
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,840
How long will it take?

163
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,240
Is it necessary?

164
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,400
You have so many codes.

165
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,560
How many users can you handle?

166
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,040
It's easy to collapse.

167
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,920
Lan Guan doesn't have many users.

168
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,920
You thought you had few users at first.

169
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,720
You didn't expect to have so many.

170
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,520
It's the future.

171
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,000
According to our current design,

172
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,120
we need at least 200,000 users

173
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,240
to run the server at the same time.

174
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,320
The program will collapse.

175
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,960
With Lan Guan's popularity now,

176
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,480
where can he find 200,000 users?

177
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,400
You're killing the chicken and the bull.

178
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,800
Lan Guan.

179
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,120
Just listen to me.

180
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,160
I've never listened to you

181
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,400
since the beginning.

182
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,040
You've suffered a lot.

183
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,360
Stop arguing with me.

184
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,840
Li Xun, I know this is your project.

185
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,080
I don't have the right to say anything.

186
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,480
But I don't want to waste my time

187
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,720
and energy on it.

188
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,560
Whatever.

189
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,320
Okay.

190
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,800
You two stop talking.

191
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,440
Li Xun.

192
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:33,840
If you don't take the exam,

193
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,960
others will take it.

194
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:39,880
Gao.

195
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,600
You go back to study first.

196
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,440
I'll help you.

197
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,400
Okay.

198
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,840
Li Xun.

199
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,480
I'll do things well.

200
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,440
But it doesn't mean I agree with you.

201
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,400
I'll do your test.

202
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,880
Eat this.

203
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,240
I think the lighter isn't used to it

204
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,280
It's good enough.

205
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,240
Go back and give it to me.

206
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,120
I'll finish the test and we can academicize it

207
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,440
too.

208
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,200
You...

209
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,200
I'll go back and send the lighter to me. I'll do some research.

210
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,200
Don't be silly.

211
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,200
What if I have a way?

212
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
It's not bad.

213
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,200
I've been working so hard every day. Why am I not hungry?

214
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,200
It's efficient and high in energy.

215
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,200
You've been working so hard all day.

216
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
Why are you so particular?

217
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
You're a reporter.

218
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,200
You're a reporter.

219
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
You're a reporter. You're a reporter.

220
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,200
You've been getting bolder lately.

221
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
When are you going home?

222
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,200
After the exam. I'll be back in two days.

223
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
How about I go with you?

224
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Where?

225
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Go to Lanling.

226
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
No need.

227
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Everyone will go back after the exam.

228
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,200
The fire is tight. You can't come alone.

229
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,200
My car will arrive in three hours.

230
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,200
No hurry. One more person, one more power.

231
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,200
What power?

232
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
The power of the bag?

233
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
We're a team.

234
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,200
You can't just focus on yourself.

235
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,200
You have to focus on the team's construction.

236
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,200
For example, you have to match the work of me and Lao Gao.

237
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
Especially Lao Gao.

238
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,200
You have to let him show himself.

239
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
Don't let the morale drop.

240
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,200
It's really good to be good to everyone.

241
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,200
Zhou Ying.

242
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,200
I'm sorry.

243
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,200
I'm sorry.

244
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
Zhou Ying.

245
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,200
I found that you're really capable.

246
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
Why?

247
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,200
I'm afraid that everyone will be so good to you.

248
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,200
How about this?

249
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
I'll call you Zhu Zheng Wei from now on.

250
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,200
Zheng Wei is Zheng Wei.

251
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
What do I need to be responsible for?

252
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,200
Be responsible for the team's construction.

253
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,200
What's the specific one?

254
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,200
The specific one is that you're responsible for worrying.

255
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
I'm responsible for getting the money.

256
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
Do you understand?

257
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,200
I understand.

258
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Then what do I need to worry about?

259
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
First, worry about your Ma Ying exam.

260
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,200
Then it's settled.

261
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
I'll stay with you after the exam.

262
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,200
Please.

263
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,200
Lao Gao.

264
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
Liu Tao Gao.

265
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,200
Finally finished the exam.

266
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,200
You can order whatever you want to eat today.

267
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,200
Team leader Li said he'll treat you.

268
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,200
The base has just opened half a year ago.

269
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
Is at the end of the year,

270
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,200
team leader Li

271
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,200
should give everyone a little encouragement?

272
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,200
He said that

273
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,200
if you take over the Blue Can.

274
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
We will have a red envelope in the New Year.

275
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,200
Today is a team building.

276
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Do you want it or not?

277
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,520
I don't think I can do it

278
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,640
I can see it

279
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,720
Li Xun is very

280
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,040
Let's go

281
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,840
It's New Year's Eve soon

282
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,040
Go shopping with me tomorrow

283
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,200
I have an arrangement tomorrow

284
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,680
You are out of the organization

285
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,960
What's your arrangement?

286
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,760
I'm going to help Li Xun fix the lighter tomorrow

287
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,200
I knew it

288
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,240
It's still related to Director Li

289
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,680
For him

290
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,640
You can get up earlier than the chicken

291
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,800
Sleep all night

292
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,120
And you can sleep all night

293
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,320
We are women

294
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,240
Can you stop being so sentimental?

295
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,920
Don't talk nonsense

296
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,880
I broke his lighter

297
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,880
I have to fix it

298
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,600
It's been years

299
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,920
You should sell it to him

300
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,040
No

301
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,240
His lighter

302
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,760
It's different for him

303
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,680
I have to find out if there are any accessories

304
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,640
Or find someone with the same principle

305
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,920
I'll take it apart and assemble it myself

306
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,480
Zhu Yun

307
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,880
Political Commissar

308
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,360
The base is really good

309
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,720
You two are a little

310
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,880
That means open a couple shop

311
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,720
I'm back

312
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,880
I'm holding a exhibition in Shanghai

313
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,960
You must come and see

314
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,160
Brother Xiu Zhu

315
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,920
I'm going on vacation soon

316
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,360
Do you want to stay?

317
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,680
The app is about to be released

318
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,280
We will work hard in the end

319
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,880
Work hard together

320
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,360
My cousin gets married this Friday

321
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,480
Didn't your cousin just get married?

322
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,600
Another one

323
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,960
What are you afraid of later?

324
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,960
It's not your birthday

325
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,960
I'm not afraid of you

326
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,960
I'm afraid of you

327
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,960
I'm afraid of you

328
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,800
You don't have to blow the lock alone

329
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,800
I've bought the tickets

330
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,440
What about you?

331
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,400
I'm not a person of the base, okay?

332
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
It's none of my business

333
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,200
Then why don't you eat?

334
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,000
Please be good

335
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,800
Old Gao, what about you?

336
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,320
I decided to quit the base

337
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,200
Is this a joke?

338
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:04,920
Is it funny?

339
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,720
I thought so

340
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,600
What's the matter?

341
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,240
Nothing

342
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,200
I'm planning to attend the competition sometime next semester

343
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,240
So I won't spend all my time

344
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,240
Besides, LiDaShen awesome

345
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,760
Without my spies

346
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,040
maybe I'll be more efficient

347
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,080
Let's go.

348
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,720
I knew you would come.

349
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,440
Gao,

350
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,400
are you really leaving the base?

351
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,080
Am I quite stingy?

352
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,080
We've said

353
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,960
so many times

354
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,360
so many times about this.

355
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,880
Every time I'm angry to leave,

356
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,560
you always come to persuade me.

357
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,720
You're really a good witness

358
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,640
Good evidence

359
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,200
I dare not persuade you

360
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,160
Zhu Yu, do you know

361
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,760
I have been the first place since I was a kid

362
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,200
Not only good grades

363
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,240
My basketball and football are all school teams

364
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,640
I used to hit the ball down every year

365
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,800
Just throw it

366
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,200
Until I went to college

367
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,120
Met Li Xu

368
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,560
I completely became a

369
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,160
Tool to take his light back

370
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,000
As long as I am by his side

371
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,400
No one can see me

372
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,680
But I don't mind at all

373
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,360
I am convinced

374
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,400
He is great

375
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,880
I want to follow him

376
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,240
Learn things

377
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,120
Last time

378
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,880
I quit the base

379
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,080
It's Li Xu Mei

380
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,480
Come to me once

381
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,400
He stood on the rooftop

382
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,800
Tell me

383
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,960
Gao Jianhao

384
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,960
Do you want to do something

385
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,760
Real thing

386
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,280
I want

387
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,440
I really want

388
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,440
I want to dream

389
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,360
You are like this

390
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,560
What is self-esteem?

391
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,160
I know

392
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,800
This time Li Xu for you

393
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,600
Give the software to Zhang Xiaobei

394
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,880
I just found out

395
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,880
This thing

396
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,400
It doesn't belong to me

397
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,200
It belongs to Li Xu

398
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,720
Li Xu

399
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,800
Zhou Yu

400
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,080
I want to do some

401
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,920
Really terminar

402
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,360
Because I belong to me

403
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,000
Can you understand

404
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,880
I understand you

405
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,720
But I still have to apologize to you

406
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,300
We are a team

407
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,840
Apps

408
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,600
It's me and Li Xu

409
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,200
No idea how you feel

410
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,160
Am sorry

411
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,400
No need to apologize

412
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,480
We are good friends

413
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,760
Should

414
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,400
I decided to quit the base after the basket.

415
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,400
I didn't expect that I would be free

416
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,920
after this day.

417
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,040
At least I will do it in the future.

418
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,840
I, Gao Jianhong,

419
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,440
will be the first one.

420
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,480
The first one.

421
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,040
Pass the ball.

422
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,000
Gas-t cotton wool

423
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:58,380
The pine

424
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,380
Can't you upload the logo?

425
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,380
I'll just copy the picture.

426
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,380
You should tell me where the picture is.

427
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,380
The two people from the animation school didn't give it to me.

428
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,380
It's not too late to do it now.

429
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,380
I'll do it in your style.

430
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,380
Forget it.

431
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,380
Then you do it.

432
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,380
Will I do it?

433
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,380
Then why don't you call the senior?

434
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,380
It's too late.

435
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,380
There are still a few days. There will be a way.

436
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,380
Why did you close it?

437
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,380
Go.

438
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,380
Where are you going?

439
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,380
I'm going to have a painting exhibition here these days.

440
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,380
I'll go to the exhibition and invite me to see it.

441
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,380
By the way, I'll find inspiration.

442
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,380
No.

443
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,380
Then go out and walk.

444
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,380
What if you think of something?

445
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,380
I have a very good sense of direction.

446
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,380
The paper I helped Liu Sisi translate last time was his painting.

447
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,380
No time.

448
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,380
Then go tomorrow.

449
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,380
I'll go.

450
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,380
Hello.

451
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,380
Hello.

452
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,380
What's up?

453
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,380
Where are you going?

454
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,380
Museum.

455
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,380
Why go to the museum?

456
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,380
See you at the gate in half an hour.

457
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,380
Really?

458
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,380
You climbed over these two paths?

459
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,380
You dressed up.

460
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,380
You're dressed like this to see your hairpin exhibition.

461
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,380
Go to see my hairpin exhibition.

462
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,380
Why are you wearing such a bad bag?

463
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,380
It seems that your hairpin is not so bad.

464
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,380
The princess is so afraid of cold.

465
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,380
I'm afraid of cold.

466
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,380
I'm afraid of cold.

467
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,380
I'm afraid of cold.

468
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,380
The princess is so afraid of cold.

469
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,380
Do you want me to prepare a carriage for you?

470
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,380
Wait for me.

471
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,380
I'll go change.

472
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,380
Come back.

473
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,380
Come back.

474
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,380
I'm leaving.

475
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,380
You said you wouldn't go yesterday.

476
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,380
Can you wait for me?

477
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,380
No.

478
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,380
You'll die if you wait for me.

479
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,380
Hurry up.

480
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,380
I'm leaving.

481
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,380
I'm leaving.

482
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,380
I'm leaving.

483
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,380
I'm leaving.

484
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,380
I'm leaving.

485
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,380
I'm leaving.

486
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,380
I'm leaving.

487
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,380
I'm leaving.

488
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,380
I'm leaving.

489
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,380
I'm leaving.

490
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,380
I'm leaving.

491
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,380
I'm leaving.

492
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,380
I'm leaving.

493
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,380
I'm leaving.

494
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,380
I'm leaving.

495
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,380
I'm leaving.

496
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,380
I'm leaving.

497
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,380
I'm leaving.

498
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,380
I'm leaving.

499
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,380
I'm leaving.

500
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,380
I'm leaving.

501
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,380
I'm leaving.

502
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,380
I'm leaving.

503
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,380
I'm leaving.

504
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,380
I'm leaving.

505
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,380
I'm leaving.

506
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,380
I'm leaving.

507
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,380
I'm leaving.

508
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,380
I'm leaving.

509
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,380
It's heavy if you puke,

510
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,380
you'll have rằng belonging suffering grip.

511
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,380
It's heavy,

512
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,380
I love you.

513
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,380
I love you.

514
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,380
Only you know it.

515
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,380
For flying holiday,

516
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,380
I crushed everything except my words.

517
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,380
I've just got the plan,

518
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,380
but you made me do it.

519
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,380
Asshole!

520
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,380
I can't allow you to wipe my sw shutter.

521
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,380
It's the ending of this trip,

522
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,380
after learn my story.

523
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,380
You make my mom so comfortable.

524
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,380
You didn't know

525
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,380
it's good to be part of the plan,

526
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,380
but now you saw me going hmm.

527
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,380
So,

528
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,380
what must I do?

529
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,380
I have to make a call.

530
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,340
I can prepare it anyway.

531
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,860
At least it's a date.

532
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,180
Don't you always

533
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,700
keep something in your heart?

534
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,500
Why are you showing off today?

535
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,620
What's this picture?

536
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,700
I don't understand it.

537
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,660
It's too good for us.

538
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,140
This is modern art.

539
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,660
You know it.

540
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,740
I must be in a bad mood.

541
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,580
This is a bad superstition.

542
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,100
This is it.

543
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,380
What are you doing?

544
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,140
I'm taking a picture for Xiu Zhu.

545
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,140
Let me take a picture.

546
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,100
This is what you sent to Xiao Hua?

547
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,620
Yes.

548
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,900
She can't take pictures anymore.

549
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,220
This is carbon painting.

550
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,580
It's not good for her.

551
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,140
Then I won't open the door.

552
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,420
That's not good either.

553
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,380
Lin Xun.

554
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,900
Xun.

555
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,220
What a coincidence.

556
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,380
You like this kind of painting?

557
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,380
It's good.

558
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,580
It's a good painting.

559
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,180
What do you mean?

560
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,380
I can understand it.

561
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,820
There are some abstracts,

562
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,540
some strange things,

563
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,820
and some pictures of the Cangjing.

564
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,100
Where did you get it?

565
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,500
You asked me to

566
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,860
write a homework for Liu Sisi.

567
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,580
I just studied

568
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,580
the painting I taught her.

569
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,580
But I've known her since I was a kid.

570
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,580
I used to play with her when I was a kid.

571
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,020
I didn't think she was that good.

572
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,220
Then she went to France to study.

573
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,220
She opened a gallery when she came home for the New Year.

574
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,340
She's not older than us.

575
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,180
She looks like you.

576
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,580
She's not of the same kind.

577
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,980
What kind of person is she?

578
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,660
The media said she's a genius painter.

579
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,420
What's wrong with being a genius?

580
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,780
I'm still the top in the college entrance examination.

581
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,580
But

582
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,780
the college entrance examination is a water-breakage.

583
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,260
From the moment she finished,

584
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,180
the things that a person can do

585
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,180
are getting less and less.

586
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,180
Are you trying to kill yourself?

587
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,180
Are you trying to kill yourself?

588
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,180
Look at this painting.

589
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,180
Are you trying to kill yourself?

590
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,180
Are you trying to kill yourself?

591
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,180
Who said you're a genius?

592
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,180
Are you trying to kill yourself?

593
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,180
Come back.

594
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,180
Come back.

595
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,180
Come.

596
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,180
Come.

597
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,180
Come and look.

598
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:09,780
I'm not looking.

599
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,780
Keep looking.

600
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,780
Come.

601
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,780
Look.

602
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,780
Come back.

603
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,780
Come.

604
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,780
Come.

605
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,780
Come back.

606
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,780
Keep looking.

607
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,780
Look.

608
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,780
Come closer.

609
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,780
Come.

610
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,780
What are you looking at?

611
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,780
Look.

612
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,780
Come.

613
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,780
Look.

614
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,780
Come.

615
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,780
You go in first.

616
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,780
I'll tell you when the car comes.

617
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,780
What about you?

618
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,780
Wait for the car.

619
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,780
I'll wear it so you won't get fat.

620
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,780
Go.

621
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,780
Go.

622
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,780
Go.

623
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,780
I told you to wear it so little.

624
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,780
I told you to wait.

625
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,780
Here.

626
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,780
Why are you back?

627
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,780
We're so changing.

628
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:47,780
I like to change a minute and a second

629
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,780
I once remember the secret

630
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:54,780
I want to be with you

631
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,780
Okay, okay, okay

632
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,780
Don't think about it

633
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,780
Go, go, go

634
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,780
A few minutes before the end of the day

635
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,780
You run so fast

636
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,780
Cold

637
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,780
Who let you wear so little

638
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,780
I want to be with you

639
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,780
A blink of an eye

640
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,780
The time we lost

641
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,780
Go fast, go fast

642
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,780
You are so good

643
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,780
You are on top of me

644
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,780
Say good night

645
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:25,780
A blink of an eye

646
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,780
The time we lost

647
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,780
Don't be afraid of the world

648
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,780
You are on top of me

649
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,780
Say good night

650
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,780
A blink of an eye

651
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,780
Eat three pieces

652
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,780
What are you doing

653
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,780
Can't eat

654
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,780
I used it for the first time

655
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,780
Eat a few more

656
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,780
I don't understand this little common sense

657
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,780
What planet is this common sense

658
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,780
Water temperature is me

659
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,780
Aren't you in charge of everything?

660
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,780
Boss Li, you're on fire so soon

661
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,780
Yes

662
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,780
The price of the bag

663
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,780
And I wear it

664
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,780
Still making trouble

665
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,780
Who will take care of you in the New Year?

666
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,780
You and your mother

667
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,000
Our son

668
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,780
Hello, Yue Yue

669
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,780
Hello mom

670
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,780
Have you finished the exam?

671
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,780
finished

672
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,780
You have rest, you have returned to the country

673
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,780
Know it

674
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,780
I know

675
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,780
Then you go home early if you are free

676
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,780
You haven't seen each other for several years

677
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,780
Just out of the country for school

678
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,700
I have something to do.

679
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,860
I need to stay for a few days.

680
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:06,860
What is it?

681
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,700
It's Fang Shumiao.

682
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,380
Isn't she the monitor of our class?

683
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,700
Her students need to

684
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,460
ask me for help.

685
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,620
Right, Fang Shumiao?

686
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:16,860
Yes.

687
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,420
Mom, that's it.

688
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,700
It's holiday.

689
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,740
What else?

690
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,020
No.

691
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,180
There are classes in the Han family.

692
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,340
I have to take care of it.

693
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,020
It's good to help organize classes.

694
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,060
It's a good opportunity for me to be a transfer.

695
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,620
When will you finish your work?

696
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,620
At most on weekends.

697
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,420
I'll be free after the weekend.

698
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,780
There are still a few days.

699
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,940
Anyway, when you're done,

700
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,980
go home.

701
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,500
Don't stay at school.

702
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,620
Then I'll stay for two more days.

703
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,100
Anyway, Xiu Zhu's painting exhibition

704
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,180
is in Shanghai.

705
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,380
I'll go back after I finish it.

706
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,700
Done.

707
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,700
It's just a few days.

708
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,940
I'm not a person.

709
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,300
You don't know

710
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,980
I've never lied since I was a kid.

711
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,220
Every time I tell my mom,

712
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,700
she'll take it to heart.

713
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,540
I think I'm just

714
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,180
a system that can't lie.

715
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,420
Then tell your mom the truth.

716
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,700
Working at the base for a few days

717
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,020
is not a bad thing.

718
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,980
My mom blocked the base.

719
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,220
How can I tell her?

720
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,780
I see.

721
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,460
Your mom is afraid you'll be kidnapped.

722
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,140
Poor mom.

723
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,420
What is she afraid of?

724
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,180
Fang Xuniang, you're a mess.

725
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,220
Zhu Yu.

726
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,300
I just cleaned it up.

727
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,980
Fifteen minutes later.

728
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,100
Drive to school tomorrow.

729
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,460
Take Yueyue back with me.

730
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,780
Why?

731
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,060
Didn't you just say you'll be back in two days?

732
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,140
I feel wronged the more I think about it.

733
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,740
He never left home for so long.

734
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,820
He's still unwilling to come back.

735
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,540
I'm worried

736
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,300
it's about the boy at the base.

737
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,940
You're thinking too much.

738
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,580
I'm thinking less.

739
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,740
He said he'd go to Xiu Zhu's art exhibition in two days.

740
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,420
The exhibition is over today.

741
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,820
Xiu Zhu is back.

742
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,460
Okay, I'll go.

743
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,620
Here.

744
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,380
It's my turn.

745
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,300
What are you doing?

746
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,180
It's not good to have too many chestnuts.

747
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,340
ужу

748
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:02,900
I'm sorry.

749
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,180
You sleep here?

750
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,300
Eat while it's hot.

751
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,660
I've done the painting.

752
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,420
You can have a look.

753
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,180
Do it again.

754
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:30,860
The color is vivid,

755
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,620
the composition is ugly.

756
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,380
You didn't find it?

757
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,260
You just want to play, right?

758
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:35,860
You're sick,

759
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,700
but you still talk so much.

760
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,660
As long as the performance is good,

761
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,740
who's staring at the picture?

762
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,660
You talk about performance every day.

763
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,420
Can't you do it better?

764
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,100
If you're not satisfied, you do it yourself.

765
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,500
Okay, put it on.

766
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,580
You're good at talking big.

767
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,340
I'm sorry.

768
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,100
Are you okay?

769
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,980
Is it serious again?

770
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,460
Or we go to the hospital?

771
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,300
Did you get hit?

772
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,620
It's okay.

773
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,460
Are you going home?

774
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,180
Not yet.

775
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,940
You don't go home during the New Year.

776
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,580
Will Lan come?

777
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,860
Why do you have so many questions?

778
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:47,780
Wait for me.

779
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,780
I'll be right back.

780
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,460
Where are you going?

781
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,260
I'll buy you medicine.

782
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,380
No need.

783
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,580
I have to.

784
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,140
What if you can't speak

785
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,300
on the day of the Lantern?

786
00:38:59,060 --> 00:38:59,860
You're here.

787
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:11,760
I don't want to lure you into the

788
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,020
aunt's house.

789
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,180
Wait a minute.

790
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:16,820
I'll be back soon.

791
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,620
So I'll investigate every detail in detail

792
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,620
and flick a target all the time.

793
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,580
Is that clear?

794
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,380
Yes.

795
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:54,620
firm

796
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:55,900
Mom

797
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,260
Yes, today.

798
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,700
Your aunt Jiang said

799
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,300
she hasn't seen you for years.

800
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,180
She misses you.

801
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,460
Tomorrow.

802
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,740
I'm sure I won't make it today.

803
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,340
I didn't buy a ticket.

804
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,660
I'll be home before tomorrow night.

805
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,140
Today.

806
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,460
Your father just went to

807
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,820
a meeting next to your school.

808
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,540
After the meeting,

809
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,500
he'll drive you back.

810
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,020
Pack up quickly.

811
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,380
He should be here soon.

812
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,180
Uncle, thank you.

813
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,500
You're sick?

814
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:30,940
I'm fine.

815
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,220
I have a cold.

816
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,660
Zhu Yin will be back soon.

817
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,740
Your base is doing well.

818
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,500
It's good.

819
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,900
Look, it's holiday.

820
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,900
You're not here.

821
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,140
You're sick.

822
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:50,940
It's hard.

823
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,300
I have no choice.

824
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,060
I won't stop

825
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,020
and wait for your New Year.

826
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,700
You're right.

827
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,020
Li Xun,

828
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,660
I have something urgent.

829
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:05,900
Dad,

830
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,540
you're back so soon.

831
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,020
I'm in a hurry.

832
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,900
I came early.

833
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,060
You'll have to go back to the dorm

834
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,060
to pack up, right?

835
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,220
How about this?

836
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:23,980
I'll drive the car over

837
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:24,900
to save you from moving out.

838
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,460
Okay.

839
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:28,540
Uncle.

840
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:29,940
Have some water.

841
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,220
Goodbye.

842
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:31,780
Bye.

843
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,180
I have something urgent at home.

844
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,180
I'll go back.

845
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:45,980
Okay.

846
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,180
You have nothing to do anyway.

847
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,740
Go home and celebrate the New Year.

848
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:50,820
Every day,

849
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,380
Hope that you can be with your girl

850
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,220
However,

851
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,300
choose a little bit of medicine

852
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,620
at your own risk

853
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,100
I acknowledge you

854
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:01,020
Though I couldn't help with anything

855
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:03,980
Doubets

856
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,820
Your overthing

857
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,780
also got used

858
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,660
so goodbye

859
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,940
Strategic

860
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,820
Yes.

861
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,700
Tell me the result of the orchid at once.

862
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:29,820
Yes.

863
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,940
I'm leaving then.

864
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,820
Yes.

865
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:18,820
Li Xue.

866
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,300
Good luck.

867
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:42,820
Zhou Yue.

868
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,380
Tell me the result.

869
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:49,820
Yes.

870
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:50,820
Yes.

871
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,140
Li Xue.

872
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,660
Was that you?

873
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,820
How do you know where my house is?

874
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:26,260
I've been here before.

875
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:27,660
Wait for me.

876
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,260
Why are you standing there?

877
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:30,980
Come and sit.

878
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,580
This is a single bed.

879
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:54,140
You won the world for me.

880
00:44:55,540 --> 00:45:00,820
The train never stops.

881
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:05,300
I lean on your shoulder.

882
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:11,900
We won't be separated.

883
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:15,260
Get out of the noisy world.

884
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,500
Accompany me.

885
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:21,940
I'm your new index.

886
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:25,020
Raise me up and bravely move forward.

887
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:31,700
Like the flame of the night.

888
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:39,620
Cause I believe I love you.

889
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:44,100
Till love will take its course.

890
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:47,860
I'm by your side.

891
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:52,940
I'll spend the long time with you.

892
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:57,540
Cause I believe I want you.

893
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:01,980
Till love will take its course.

894
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:05,900

895
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:15,260
Cause I believe I want you.

896
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,500
You.

897
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,220
Ha ha.

898
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,420
It's a dream.

899
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:43,860
Em notably.

900
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,260
I will always be by your side

901
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:50,260
Just be brave

902
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:53,260
Every dream I have

903
00:46:53,260 --> 00:47:00,260
I will not, I will not, I will not lose to time

904
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:05,260

912
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:39,260
The firework of the night

913
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:50,260
