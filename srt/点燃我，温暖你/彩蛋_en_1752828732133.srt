00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 16

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,600
Princess, do you have a dream?

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,400
My dream is to have my first love, Chen Zhengguo.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,400
The End

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,400
We're in a flash marriage.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,000
What flash? It's been seven years.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,800
But I think the photos are not as good as the photos in the Treasure magazine.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,400
They're pretty good.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,000
Really?

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
But I was the one who proposed back then.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I feel like I was the one who proposed.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,800
Are you embarrassed?

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,600
Then wait for me.

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,200
Li Xun, do you remember?

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,000
We came here that year.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,600
During the New Year, this office building was lit up.

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,800
I remember.

18
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,600
I remember I told you

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,600
that there will be a familiar name on the building.

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,200
Look.

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,200
I passed through the world

22
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,000
and passed through the night

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,200
You think I don't understand English?

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,400
The people in the mountains are gone

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,000
You're over there in the fireworks

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,400
It's the intuition of a dream

27
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,800
Breaking through the border

28
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,200
A night of rain

29
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,200
A full moon

30
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,200
Then you won the world for me

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,600
The car in the city never stops

32
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,000
I lean on your shoulder

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,200
We will not be separated

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,200
You're writing a white-page novel.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,200
Li Xun, I'm serious.

36
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,200
No matter what you want to do in the future,

37
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,200
whatever your goals are,

38
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,200
you can count me in.

39
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,200
Today I want to tell you

40
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,200
that my goal is

41
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,200
to spend the rest of my life with you.

42
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Because I believe I want to

43
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,200
I can meet you today.

44
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,200
I will take his course

45
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,200
The burning fireworks

46
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:14,200
are always your light.

47
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,200
Because I believe I want to

48
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,200
I love you

49
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,200
I will take his course

50
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,200
I'm by your side

51
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,200
I spend a long time with you

52
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,200
Because I believe I want to

53
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,200
I will take his course

54
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,200
The burning fireworks

55
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:58,200
are always your light.

56
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,200
The burning fireworks

57
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:18,200
are always your light.

58
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,200
Cheers.

59
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,200
I say, guys,

60
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,200
now the two leaders

61
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,200
have fulfilled their wishes.

62
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,200
And now our company is also

63
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,200
on the right track.

64
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,200
I think

65
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,200
at this point,

66
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
if you have any wishes

67
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,200
that haven't been fulfilled,

68
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,200
maybe they will be fulfilled.

69
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,200
Can you call it learning?

70
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,200
You choose to eat, right?

71
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,200
I'm just kidding.

72
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,200
I'm just kidding.

73
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,200
I'm just kidding.

74
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
I'm just kidding.

75
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
I hope that from next year

76
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,200
I can recruit one hundred people for the company.

77
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,200
Then I hope that

78
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,200
our five families can be in the top three in the year.

79
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,200
OK.

80
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,200
This is good.

81
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,200
This is all for you to find.

82
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,200
You come.

83
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,200
Dongdong, you say one.

84
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,200
Say one for you.

85
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,200
I hope this year

86
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,200
can be a top-class driver.

87
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,200
What is it?

88
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,200
No one can do it.

89
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
I'll discuss it with you.

90
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
OK.

91
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,200
Five-star driver, I'll help you.

92
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,200
Then I'll say it.

93
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,200
I hope I can get the offer.

94
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,200
Offer.

95
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
Is it?

96
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
Offer.

97
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Right.

98
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,200
Offer.

99
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
I mean,

100
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
I can get this.

101
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,200
I also want to thank your wife.

102
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,200
If it weren't for you,

103
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,200
I wouldn't have met Mr. Tian.

104
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
I wouldn't have written a recommendation letter.

105
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,200
So thank you.

106
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,200
You don't have to thank me.

107
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
I did it myself.

108
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
I'm done.

109
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,200
I'm done.

110
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,200
I'm done.

111
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
What are you doing?

112
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,200
What are you doing?

113
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
Nothing.

114
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
What are you looking at?

115
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,200
Nothing.

116
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
What are you doing?

117
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
Nothing.

118
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
I'm looking at you.

119
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Are you in love?

120
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
What are you doing?

121
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
I'm the worst.

122
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,200
I'm the worst.

123
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
Are you in love?

124
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
Are you in love?

125
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
No.

126
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
Big news.

127
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,200
It's the top three of the hot treasure.

128
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,200
The boss of LP announced the offer.

129
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Of course.

130
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
What did you say?

131
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
Say the words.

132
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
No.

133
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Until today,

134
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,200
I was called to open up a new site.

135
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,200
But I didn't continue.

136
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,200
I've been afraid to say that

137
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,200
I'll definitely fail to do it for the money I have.

138
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,200
Do you really think you'll make it?

139
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
Big surprise.

140
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,200
Big surprise.

141
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,200
I just should have told you cinnamon.

142
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,480
I've been told that

143
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,600
someone is scolding Zhu Yu

144
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,640
in the comments.

145
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,320
What a coincidence.

146
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,080
Find a way to stop him.

147
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,800
I'm watching.

148
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,200
I'll try my best.

149
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,080
It's the holiday season now.

150
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,360
The speed of rising must be very fast.

151
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,360
Try your best.

152
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,440
It's a big deal.

153
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,600
Come on.

154
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,000
Continue to eat.

155
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:13,960
Come on.

156
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,440
Drink one.

157
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,120
Drink one.

158
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,800
Drink one.

159
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,600
Drink one.

160
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,520
Come on.

161
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,080
What are you doing?

162
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,520
This is what you said.

163
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,360
Don't regret it.

164
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,440
What's wrong?

165
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,080
The red and blue band,

166
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,200
all engaged.

167
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,680
It's a holiday.

168
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,280
Let me tell you.

169
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,120
I want to make a fortune.

170
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,080
Look, they all have it.

171
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,800
Look.

172
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,320
I want to make a fortune.

173
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,200
I want to be a big star.

174
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,600
Come on.

175
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,360
Just because of your popularity,

176
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,880
our company will be in a big trouble.

177
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,640
Yeah.

178
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,560
You said it.

179
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,600
I want to make a fortune.

180
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,400
I want to make a fortune.

181
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,520
Look at them.

182
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Look at them.

183
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,560
No way.

184
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,120
The.

185
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,920
The lid.

186
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,440
Why are you selling these?

187
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:28,400
They'reن

188
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,240
Want to die?

189
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,840
Do you know how dangerous these refertiles are?

190
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,320
These BCG

191
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,200
goes throughı the septic balloons

192
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,640
and bevorf constant pressure.

193
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,520
The highest pressure can be up to

194
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,160
10-15kg.

195
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,760
Why are you doing these little water flowers?

196
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,920
Little water flowers?

197
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,520
The water in front of the police station is very high.

198
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,200
You can try to open it.

199
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,720
Why do I have to open it?

200
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,040
I have to work later.

201
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,280
You opened a computer in the company today.

202
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,880
You opened it quite carefully.

203
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,600
Here.

204
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,240
Here's the water.

205
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,840
Hey.

206
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,960
Come on.

207
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,400
To celebrate your admission.

208
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,400
And then hold the goal of winning back L.P.

209
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,760
You can be with Li Xun as a normal colleague.

210
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,640
And live in peace.

211
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,520
Cheers.

212
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,320
But in fact,

213
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,560
we are not ordinary colleagues.

214
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,840
What?

215
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,480
We are ordinary, upper and lower-level relationships.

216
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,360
Who is upper and who is lower?

217
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,880
I'm lower than him.

218
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,120
I'm the team leader now.

219
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,720
Then it's not ordinary.

220
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,960
Team leader Zhu.

221
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,280
How do you feel about commanding Li Xun?

222
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,520
How can I command him?

223
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,200
But I think he deserves it.

224
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,560
This is his reality.

225
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,400
I like the way he looks at me

226
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,800
and makes me feel uncomfortable.

227
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,680
Interesting.

228
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,960
Interesting.

229
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,520
Try it.

230
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,880
Come here.

231
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,800
I'm heavy.

232
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,800
Do I look like it?

233
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,120
Do you like the air up there?

234
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,920
Not bad.

235
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,800
Not bad?

236
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,440
Is it good?

237
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,600
Yes.

238
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,320
Really?

239
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,560
Li Xun.

240
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,800
I'm sorry.

241
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,560
I'm sorry.

242
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,200
I'm sorry.

243
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm sorry.

244
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,760
I'm sorry.

245
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,520
I'm sorry.

246
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,400
I'm sorry.

247
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,080
I'm sorry.

248
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,520
I'm sorry.

249
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,360
I...

250
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,120
I'm sorry.

251
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,800
I'm sorry.

252
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,520
I'm sorry.

253
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,760
visits you.

254
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,560
Any dream?

255
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,360
No.

256
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,120
How come?

257
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,680
I haven'tiny thought carefully.

258
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
No matter what the price is,

259
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,360
I won't regret it.

260
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,320
Then you've completely

261
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,720
completed

262
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,560
your self-righteous idea.

263
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,600
So I said to continue like this.

264
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,440
Which one do you want to eat?

265
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,000
You cook it for me first.

266
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,600
Okay.

267
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,800
Thank you.

268
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,680
Can't someone grill the ear?

269
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,200
The pot.

270
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,040
Why is the pot so big?

271
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,560
You don't want to eat?

272
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,640
Zh Sí,

273
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,920
Let me twist it for you.

274
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,480
I don't understand you.

275
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,200
It's hot.

276
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,440
Get some water in.

277
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:59,240
Pour some water in.

278
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,740
He is almost freaking out.

279
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,920
I'm so tired.

280
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,680
The End

281
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,680
Little Spider, we can be together in a fair way.

282
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,680
Happy New Year.

283
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,680
Princess, do you need a heart?

284
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,680
Li Shen, choose me. I won't betray you.

285
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,680
Don't be angry.

286
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,680
You worry, I'll take care of everything.

287
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,680
Understand?

288
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,680
Yes.

289
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,680
Happy New Year.

290
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,680
Let's continue.
