2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if the light is very bright

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will still watch over that vast vast land

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless atmosphere

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day, the lens is a little bit yellow

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast night?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I burn up the night just for you to remember

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How everything was in the beginning

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The wind and the color of the night are like wild grass

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I am still by your side

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Everything is the original look

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The King of Blaze

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The King of Blaze

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Miss Yu

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay, just a moment

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Thank you

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Welcome to come again

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Thank you

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You are handsome

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's a good thing.

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Coming.

29
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,760
Lin Xun, I'm Chen Min Min from the outside.

30
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,080
Let's go eat together later?

31
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,360
No.

32
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,200
Are you going back to the dorm?

33
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,800
No.

34
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,160
If you need anything, just tell me.

35
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,160
I don't need anything.

36
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,160
You're so good at acting.

37
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,740
Shin Si Ke

38
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,740
Do you have fun?

39
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,280
I'm not following you.

40
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,360
I'm asked to come here to talk to you.

41
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,280
Really?

42
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,440
Here's the thing.

43
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,280
The department of early childhood is investigating

44
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,040
the early childhood rate of the early childhood.

45
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,240
We're new students.

46
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,200
We just started school.

47
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,240
So the department is keeping a close eye on us.

48
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,040
You're going to primary school or kindergarten?

49
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,840
Do you think early childhood is useful?

50
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,040
It's not about whether it's useful or not.

51
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,400
The school has its rules.

52
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,040
We should...

53
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,560
Give it to me.

54
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,240
An Kong.

55
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,920
What?

56
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,720
What's wrong?

57
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,680
An Kong.

58
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,400
A game?

59
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,120
You have to move up and down.

60
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,720
You have to avoid the ball that's floating up.

61
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,880
You have to go through the river.

62
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,000
You have three chances.

63
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,640
If you don't die, I'll go to the early childhood.

64
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,400
You have a point.

65
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,400
You call this a ball that's floating up?

66
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,800
It's obviously thrown down.

67
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,720
How many balls are there in total?

68
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,280
Three chances, two balls.

69
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,440
I already know the first ball's landing.

70
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,440
The second ball is the landing of the next ball.

71
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,880
The third ball passes the first ball.

72
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,720
It's that simple?

73
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,360
Your ball is too fast.

74
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,760
My hands are the fastest speed keyboard.

75
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,400
You admit defeat?

76
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,920
Isn't there another chance?

77
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,400
Go.

78
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,160
Game over.

79
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,600
What's going on?

80
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,800
Editor?

81
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,960
This is the first chance.

82
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,920
You have to go through the river.

83
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,360
If you get hit by a ball, you'll die.

84
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,440
If you go through the river, you'll die.

85
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,200
Did you get it wrong?

86
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,880
No.

87
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,360
Then I'll die no matter how I play?

88
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,000
Yes.

89
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,240
Then this game is a draw?

90
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:57,840
Yes.

91
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,080
Then why did you let me play?

92
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,240
Because you don't look good.

93
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,000
What?

94
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,360
Because I don't look good.

95
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,640
Why?

96
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,480
You are...

97
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,440
You are...

98
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,480
You are...

99
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,560
You are too fake.

100
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,200
You lost.

101
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,400
Don't come to me for the morning self-study.

102
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,280
And...

103
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,440
This is my place.

104
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,240
You are not allowed to enter the place without my permission.

105
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,160
Why can't you go through the river?

106
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,200
I did.

107
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,120
What's the use of it?

108
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,000
He designed that program.

109
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,400
I can't go through it.

110
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,920
You are playing a fool.

111
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,040
Actually,

112
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,520
the game is quite simple.

113
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,240
Although I don't understand the meaning of the letter,

114
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,440
the code is simple.

115
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,880
Although I don't know how the rich

116
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,200
become rich,

117
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,600
I think the logic is simple.

118
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,240
Fang Shumiao.

119
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,520
Who did I get this humiliation for?

120
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,080
You will get four points tomorrow.

121
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,640
Four points minus four points.

122
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,040
Four points is more than enough.

123
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,880
What's the use of reading it now?

124
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,160
You are familiar with it.

125
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,280
He said I was fake.

126
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,000
I think he just doesn't like it.

127
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,520
He is so bad at making up stories.

128
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,240
What's wrong?

129
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,440
Look at this.

130
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,280
Isn't this Guo He Si?

131
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,640
He said he was a great man.

132
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,720
You are using the same program.

133
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,640
Stop reading.

134
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,200
Don't stay up late. Go to sleep.

135
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,960
Li Xun is so excited about you.

136
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,280
Very excited.

137
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,200
You...

138
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,520
Hurry up.

139
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,240
birthday

140
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,560
Zhou Yu.

141
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,680
Good morning.

142
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,440
You don't have a made-up JD anymore, right?

143
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,480
Yes.

144
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,040
Well,

145
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,240
it's google connection.

146
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,080
Where are you from?

147
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm from Xiao Xin Housing.

148
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I finally got it out of the water room.

149
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Wait for me.

150
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Let's play basketball in the afternoon.

151
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
How about yesterday?

152
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's a bit empty.

153
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Why are you sitting so close?

154
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
The computer is hot and people are easily sleepy.

155
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I won't fall asleep if I sit in front of you.

156
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It seems that you have really gotten into a fight with the leader.

157
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Is it worth it?

158
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I only deducted four points this morning.

159
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Is it worth it?

160
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It must be worth it.

161
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
This professor's surname is Lin.

162
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I heard from my sister that they call him Old Lin in private.

163
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
He has a long history.

164
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
He is considered the oldest in the circle.

165
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Ten horse-drawn, nine rabbit, and a hair-cutting book.

166
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's really not exaggerating.

167
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
This is not here.

168
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The first class of the professional class doesn't understand.

169
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's not as crazy as this.

170
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This computer is broken.

171
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's broken.

172
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yes.

173
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's broken.

174
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's so hot.

175
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
No, no, no.

176
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You are a pervert.

177
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Classmates, who of you has already known C languages before?

178
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Or have you tried to write some small programs in C languages?

179
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Everyone knows that now it's a information society.

180
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The computer is developing very fast.

181
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
The programming language is also developing very fast.

182
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Compared with C languages and the new programming languages,

183
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
it's like I'm standing in front of you now.

184
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What do you mean?

185
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Just like an old aunt.

186
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
There is an old saying that goes,

187
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Jiang is still old.

188
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Old has the benefits of old.

189
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Old, rich, and strict.

190
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
No matter what you want to study in the future,

191
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
or continue to study programming, database, and operating system,

192
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
the C language skills you learned today

193
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
will become the basis for all your programming in the future.

194
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The skills are beyond the skills.

195
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Don't do what good students usually like to do.

196
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
The four books.

197
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Let's talk about C languages.

198
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
First, we need to understand what C is.

199
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Then everyone, tell us what C is.

200
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Raise your hand.

201
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I learned it for so long last night.

202
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You're so stubborn.

203
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Let me see.

204
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Let me see.

205
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What are you talking about?

206
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Looking at the books?

207
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
The notes?

208
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You remember them very well.

209
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
This student, can you answer my question?

210
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
C language is a face-to-face programming language.

211
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's widely used in the base level development.

212
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
C language can be compiled in a simplified way.

213
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It handles low-level storage.

214
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
C language only produces a small number of machine languages.

215
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And it doesn't need any operating environment support.

216
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It can run high-level programming language.

217
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Although C language has many low-level functions,

218
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
it still maintains the feature of this platform.

219
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It can also include similar input processors

220
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
and super computers.

221
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It can be compiled in many operating platforms.

222
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Well said.

223
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Let's give her a round of applause.

224
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Please.

225
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I have nothing to do with death.

226
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Sikersuper.

227
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
What's your name, student?

228
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Zhu Yun.

229
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Good name.

230
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Sounds good.

231
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You are the class representative.

232
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Teacher, I can't.

233
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You can.

234
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Why not?

235
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It seems that you are not only shy but also humble.

236
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's settled.

237
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Don't be modest.

238
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Let's continue.

239
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Let's go.

240
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Let's go.

241
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Teacher,

242
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
you should change the class representative.

243
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Why?

244
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Are you afraid of wasting time?

245
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
No.

246
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I just think it's troublesome.

247
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Troublesome?

248
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
What's the difference?

249
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Don't make a decision yet.

250
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Think about it.

251
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
We have classes tomorrow.

252
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Give me an answer when the time comes.

253
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I have to go to the market.

254
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
The braised pork will be gone soon.

255
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Don't be so angry.

256
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
We will talk tomorrow.

257
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's good to be the class representative.

258
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You are so good at it.

259
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Old Lin is the senior in the circle.

260
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
He will teach us several classes in the future.

261
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I will talk to him.

262
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I will do my best.

263
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Hurry up.

264
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I am waiting for you.

265
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I have been the class representative since I was a kid.

266
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I have been in the language, math, English, biology, chemistry and geography.

267
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I have been in all of them.

268
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
If I am serious, my classmates will be annoyed with me.

269
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
If I am not serious, my teacher will scold me.

270
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I am tired and I can't speak well.

271
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I finally go to the university.

272
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I don't want to be the class representative again.

273
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Are you afraid that the class representative will make troubles for you?

274
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
One of the reasons is that you are the best example.

275
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Some people think that the college entrance examination is the end.

276
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
This is absolutely wrong.

277
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
The college is the place to teach you to be safe.

278
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
So, the college entrance examination is the end.

279
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You can't even be the top student.

280
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You can't be so careful after you enter the college.

281
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's time for you to choose the class representative.

282
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Did you participate?

283
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
No.

284
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
What about the class representative?

285
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
The class representative has the most contact with the teacher.

286
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's also important.

287
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
There was one.

288
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Which class?

289
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
C language.

290
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That's great.

291
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Do your best.

292
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Let the teacher see your ability.

293
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I didn't agree.

294
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Why?

295
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You don't like this class?

296
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Or you don't like to recognize the teacher?

297
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You can't be so willful.

298
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Whether it's study or work,

299
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
it's a very hard and troublesome thing.

300
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Mom, I really don't want to be the class representative.

301
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
No.

302
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Listen to me.

303
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I worked in the school system for a lifetime.

304
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I can tell you responsibly.

305
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You are the class representative.

306
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's only good for you.

307
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
But...

308
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Don't say but.

309
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
When is the next C language?

310
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Tomorrow.

311
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Okay.

312
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Tell the teacher tomorrow that you are willing to be the class representative.

313
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Do you hear me?

314
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Mom.

315
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Do as I say.

316
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I have a meeting soon.

317
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'll talk to you.

318
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Be good.

319
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Do you still have to wash it?

320
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Okay.

321
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Your idea is very good.

322
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
If you don't knock a few keys,

323
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
it can't be an excellent program.

324
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
What?

325
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Ma, you can try it.

326
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Okay.

327
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,640
What are you doing?

328
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,320
Ms. He,

329
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,440
come here.

330
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,800
Give this information to everyone.

331
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,600
Each of you.

332
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,000
Mr. Liu, I haven't decided yet.

333
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:04,960
You do it.

334
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,480
Is Director Liu your mother?

335
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,160
Yes.

336
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,080
Your mother told me

337
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,120
about your worry

338
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,440
through a hospital leader.

339
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,080
Actually,

340
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,080
you don't have to worry.

341
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,400
I asked you to be the class representative.

342
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,240
It means I fully believe

343
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,360
that you have the ability.

344
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,120
Right?

345
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,600
My mother said I was willing to do it, right?

346
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,600
Yes.

347
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,760
Why? Do you have a problem?

348
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,960
No.

349
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,600
Jian Hong said he would organize

350
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,160
a programming interest group.

351
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,320
You also come to participate.

352
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,200
I also want to participate.

353
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,160
Of course.

354
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,880
Even my professional teachers participate.

355
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,960
Can you not participate in the class representative?

356
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,880
Mr. Lin has agreed to be

357
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,520
the instructor of our interest group.

358
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,480
He also said he would give us a place

359
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,440
to do activities.

360
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,320
Let's participate.

361
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,520
So you don't just have to participate.

362
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,560
You also have to be in charge with Jian Hong.

363
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,680
One month later

364
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,600
I finally get you back.

365
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,080
I tried to use C language

366
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,040
to produce a pull-back program.

367
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,560
I have failed to execute it.

368
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,500
I made it up

369
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,800
as you have helped to see.

370
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,760
I have told the个只真

371
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,040
that

372
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,380
we will only need to give sane Henry

373
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,540
can directly operate the Note.

374
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,100
Why?

375
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,740
Because there is a Note in the space of the Graph.

376
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,660
I applied for the Graph.

377
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,500
Of course, I have to give the Note

378
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,700
the space of the memory.

379
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,300
Then why can't you do it correctly?

380
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,740
Because I didn't give the fart needle

381
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,500
the memory space address of the Graph.

382
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,340
You know the answer.

383
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,300
Why do you ask?

384
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,180
Li Xue.

385
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,660
Old Lin promised to give us

386
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,220
a group of interested people as a guide.

387
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,580
And he also gave us the space

388
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,180
to be a venue.

389
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,100
So I participated.

390
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,300
I participated.

391
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,020
So?

392
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,060
So?

393
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,140
I was going to try

394
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,220
Li Xun's C language level.

395
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,220
How is it?

396
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,460
I didn't expect to be fooled by him.

397
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,860
I picked the question myself.

398
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,580
I think Li Xun is a master.

399
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,740
He deliberately guided you to say the answer.

400
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,020
It means he knows the answer.

401
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,740
I think so, too.

402
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,180
Li Xun writes codes in the dormitory every day.

403
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,940
I can't understand what he wrote.

404
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,180
I don't think so.

405
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:37,940
Some people

406
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,140
just pretend to be a gentleman.

407
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,460
They don't know anything.

408
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,780
It's a good thing if you don't know.

409
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,100
Someone was blinded by hatred.

410
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,580
Someone's arms are turned out.

411
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,460
It's hard to tell.

412
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,540
Zhu Yu is right.

413
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:50,980
It's a wheel, isn't it?

414
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,060
Pull it out and walk.

415
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,620
I want to see how Li Xun's level is.

416
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,060
I also want to see what he wrote.

417
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,980
Anyway, the last time he did the crossword,

418
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,300
he wrote it in several classes at the door.

419
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,780
It's the most basic thing.

420
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,980
I don't think so.

421
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,700
Right.

422
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,980
This is the place

423
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,380
Mr. Lin applied for us.

424
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:11,980
In the future,

425
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,220
this is the home of our programming team.

426
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,140
This is where we work.

427
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,460
How is it?

428
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,180
It's quite big.

429
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,060
It's wide.

430
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,140
It's a little dirty.

431
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,260
Clean it up.

432
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,780
It's still

433
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,980
quite clean and neat.

434
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,340
It's a good thing.

435
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:31,940
It's good.

436
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,700
Gao,

437
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,700
why are you so interested

438
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,820
in Li Xun's programming level?

439
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,180
I just want to know

440
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,700
how big the gap between us and the top is.

441
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,580
You don't agree?

442
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,780
No one doesn't want to be the top.

443
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,100
Zhu Yu,

444
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:49,980
do you agree?

445
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,580
Maybe the other top

446
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,580
is a little bigger.

447
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,300
He?

448
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,820
You saw it, right?

449
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,260
I think it's good to be an ordinary person.

450
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,820
You're already very unusual

451
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,100
after you got into Nanhu University.

452
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,380
Did Li Xun teach you

453
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,380
the homework that Mr. Lin arranged for the class?

454
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,700
I didn't teach him in the whole class.

455
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,660
I'm so embarrassed

456
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,020
to explain it to Mr. Lin.

457
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,540
Then you can urge him.

458
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,500
I can urge him.

459
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,060
I can't even avoid him.

460
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,100
Are you afraid that Mr. Lin will hurt you?

461
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,100
I can't help it.

462
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,220
Li Xun is so arrogant all day.

463
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,100
He looks down on you.

464
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,460
He doesn't like you.

465
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,820
Aren't you curious

466
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,020
how good he is?

467
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:52,980
You're so mad.

468
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,740
You're not afraid of being exposed?

469
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,580
Didn't I say

470
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,540
that I shouldn't come up

471
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,660
without my permission?

472
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,820
You didn't teach me

473
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,700
the whole class C language.

474
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,540
I didn't teach you.

475
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,300
I didn't write it.

476
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,580
You can give me your grades if you don't teach me.

477
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,140
Whatever.

478
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,340
Are you afraid to teach me?

479
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,900
I'm not afraid to teach you.

480
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,180
Yes.

481
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,500
You carry this computer every day

482
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,580
and knock it over and over again.

483
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,220
You're like a singer-songwriter.

484
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,220
If everyone sees

485
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,180
the homework you taught,

486
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,460
it will be full of bugs in the code.

487
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,620
Isn't that embarrassing?

488
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,620
You're so annoying.

489
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,660
You're so annoying.

490
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,660
You're so annoying.

491
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,660
You're so annoying.

492
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,660
Isn't that embarrassing?

493
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,660
So the best way

494
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,940
is not to teach me, right?

495
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,620
Yes.

496
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,860
You're so interested

497
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,860
in my programming skills.

498
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,500
What if you're a embroidery pillow?

499
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,300
What's the most important thing?

500
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,900
Find the biggest paper in three numbers.

501
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,660
It's so long.

502
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,500
Why didn't I

503
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,660
finish it on the tenth?

504
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,660
Paper.

505
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,900
You're really like your master.

506
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,660
Here it is.

507
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,140
You got the homework?

508
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,460
I'm sure

509
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,900
it's an embroidery pillow.

510
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,900
How?

511
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,020
The logic of this homework

512
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,020
is very simple, right?

513
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,820
You can get it

514
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,820
with ten codes.

515
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,820
But it's good.

516
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,140
You wrote a hundred codes.

517
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,020
What's the most important thing

518
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,020
in writing codes?

519
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,020
It's the simple one.

520
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,420
You made such a simple logic

521
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,420
so complicated.

522
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,420
You're so confused.

523
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,660
It's not an embroidery pillow.

524
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,700
Imperial Library

525
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,300
Is this virus?

526
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,940
An I TM processor

527
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,980
16G memory.

528
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,500
Girl,

529
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,220
are you from the computer department?

530
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,060
How can you tell?

531
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,860
You're really experienced.

532
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,740
How can a normal student

533
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,940
use such a high configuration?

534
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,460
You spent a lot of money on this selection.

535
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,660
Can you fix it?

536
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,100
Silly girl.

537
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,180
It's just a small virus.

538
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:43,900
It's simple.

539
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:44,820
Five minutes.

540
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,780
I'll fix it in five minutes.

541
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,260
Okay.

542
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,660
Girl,

543
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,260
is Mr. Ling

544
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,700
still the director of our department?

545
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,300
Are you the senior?

546
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,140
I'm the first year.

547
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,540
Are you the new student?

548
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,100
I'm telling you,

549
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,500
you're a bad student.

550
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,220
Our computer department

551
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,140
is a famous profession.

552
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,460
It's convenient to find a job in the future.

553
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,020
I used to work in the factory.

554
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,620
Why didn't you work there?

555
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,100
Well,

556
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,180
the factory sounds nice.

557
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,380
To be honest,

558
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,180
it's an IT master.

559
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,900
No.1 is youth.

560
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:21,860
No.2 is hair.

561
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,500
No.3 is waist.

562
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,740
Each of them

563
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,900
looks like they're in their thirties.

564
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,420
You're out of the office.

565
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,580
You're in the emergency room.

566
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,540
If you don't want to die,

567
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,340
you should change your job.

568
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,260
Who...

569
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,500
Who did this to you?

570
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,860
My classmate.

571
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:43,540
Who?

572
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,700
My classmate.

573
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,700
Your classmate?

574
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,180
It's impossible.

575
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,180
You're in the first year.

576
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,060
You only learned a few lessons

577
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,020
after you learned C.

578
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,380
How could you do this?

579
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,180
Wait.

580
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,900
I have a virus.

581
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,900
Yeah, I can't kill the fat guy.

582
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:10,900
I'll change my job.

583
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,260
Don't worry.

584
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,540
I'll change my job.

585
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,660
I got it.

586
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,380
I got it.

587
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,620
I got it.

588
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,420
It's still not working.

589
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,100
It's still not working.

590
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:24,900
How about this?

591
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:25,660
We can't

592
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,460
restart the system.

593
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,540
What's wrong?

594
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,060
It's so late.

595
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:28,580
Come on.

596
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,700
Hurry up.

597
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,700
Change your job.

598
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,460
Come on.

599
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,220
Use your secret skills.

600
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:33,740
Hurry up.

601
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,660
Brother Cheng, you've done it.

602
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,180
I've done it.

603
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:35,700
No need.

604
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:36,620
Just here.

605
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,220
Just here.

606
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:37,860
You see,

607
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,260
it's out.

608
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:38,780
Is it

609
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,980
the guy

610
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,820
who made it up?

611
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,140
No.

612
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,500
His classmate.

613
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,180
His classmate?

614
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:45,860
Sister.

615
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:46,900
The first-year student?

616
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:47,700
Impossible.

617
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,620
It's impossible.

618
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,220
Yeah.

619
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:49,700
If he...

620
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,460
We can't solve it.

621
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,700
If his classmate is capable,

622
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,980
he won't go to any university.

623
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:53,940
Right?

624
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,460
He's very professional.

625
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,340
He's better than us.

626
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,740
Try again.

627
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,580
Let me teach him.

628
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,460
Let me teach him.

629
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,340
Go.

630
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,060
Okay.

631
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,460
Sister.

632
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,620
It's done.

633
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,100
Not yet.

634
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,620
Can you

635
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,340
call your classmate

636
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,140
here

637
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,380
to introduce us?

638
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,580
Yeah.

639
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,580
Call him here

640
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,820
to discuss it.

641
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,300
Yeah.

642
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,900
Call him here.

643
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,660
I haven't decided yet.

644
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:25,740
Gao.

645
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,460
Here's your practice machine.

646
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,220
Okay.

647
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,020
Oh, no.

648
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,500
It's totally out of focus.

649
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,180
Zhu Yu.

650
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,980
Why don't you find Li Xun

651
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,140
and tell us

652
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,140
how you solved it?

653
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,380
Even if it's a brick,

654
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,500
I won't go to him.

655
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,380
I'll go to the library

656
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,260
to check the information.

657
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,020
I don't believe

658
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,020
there's only one virus.

659
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,780
You're still not convinced.

660
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,220
I think Li Xun is a genius.

661
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,620
He deserves to be the top.

662
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,420
Is Feng Shu and Miao Miao

663
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,300
good-natured?

664
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,460
But

665
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,020
no matter how smart they are,

666
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:40,860
they can't be a big hit

667
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,260
without a good personality.

668
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,140
Yu Yu.

669
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,620
What about your homework?

670
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,060
Oh, no.

671
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,740
The leader is still waiting for me in the office.

672
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,580
You don't want to

673
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,180
write a virus

674
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,580
without a homework, do you?

675
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,580
Don't be so convenient.

676
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:06,860
Let me see

677
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,660
what kind of great virus it is.

678
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,300
Who wrote this virus?

679
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,500
Li Xun.

680
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:44,980
Li Xun.

681
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,900
You wrote this virus yourself?

682
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,740
You brat.

683
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,140
Hurry up.

684
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:58,740
Hurry up.

685
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,460
Sit down.

686
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,540
Sit down.

687
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:04,980
Li Xun.

688
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,300
You'd better

689
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,340
sit down.

690
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,100
Sit down.

691
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:08,980
Sit down.

692
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,740
Sit down.

693
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,500
Sit down.

694
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,100
Sit down.

695
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:11,700
Sit down.

696
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,460
Sit down.

697
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,260
Sit down.

698
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,100
Sit down.

699
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,860
What did you write?

700
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,460
It's a insect.

701
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,660
Insect?

702
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,260
You tricked me.

703
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,060
And you hid it from me.

704
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,340
I just got the supply.

705
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,660
Zero day also repaired.

706
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,100
What else can I do?

707
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,060
You can't rebuild the system.

708
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,540
I got the virus in every plate.

709
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,780
Every plate?

710
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,620
Go on.

711
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,340
I just want to try

712
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,260
whether I can make one

713
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,380
like a panda burn incense

714
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,620
that can infect the system

715
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,420
with EXC,

716
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,020
COM,

717
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:42,700
PIF,

718
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,540
Source,

719
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,540
HTML,

720
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,340
ASP,

721
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,740
and the anti-virus software.

722
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,540
It will also delete

723
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,620
the backup files of GHO

724
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,140
and can't rebuild the system.

725
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,220
You're so scary.

726
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,660
You want to

727
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,860
make all computers

728
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:56,180
in our whole hospital

729
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,140
bankrupt?

730
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,180
But the technology of

731
00:32:59,180 --> 00:32:59,620
the panda burn incense

732
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,460
is still too low.

733
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,780
It's not that clever.

734
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,180
The more hidden the virus, the better.

735
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,780
What are you going to do?

736
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:11,820
Sir.

737
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,060
In fact, the current virus

738
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,060
is for getting user information.

739
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,540
It can intercept the browser

740
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,540
and install software.

741
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,940
Or use it as a machine.

742
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,500
But it's not very valuable

743
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:23,860
to use a single computer as a machine.

744
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,340
What can ordinary computer users

745
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,700
steal?

746
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,220
It has the value of attack.

747
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,100
But there are many things

748
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,820
that ordinary people

749
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,180
don't want to lose in computers.

750
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,780
For example, graduation papers, family photos,

751
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,500
design drafts, company documents.

752
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,660
All these can create the value of exchange.

753
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,660
For example,

754
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,380
the 2008 Confector

755
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,460
is actually the same.

756
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,700
It's just a Internet transmission.

757
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,660
Now, these firewalls

758
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,220
are getting more and more intelligent.

759
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,220
When the system is broken,

760
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,860
it's getting harder to attack.

761
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,820
But the Autorun virus

762
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,340
is still effective.

763
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,620
That's right.

764
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,580
So I want to make this computer

765
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,580
an infector.

766
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,180
It finds different people to break the virus.

767
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,020
Every time it builds a system,

768
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,820
it will connect different disk drives

769
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,260
and can directly get information.

770
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,220
Inst gaator finalize this project and

771
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,300
We'll get data and no trace of you.

772
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,620
No fishing sorrow,

773
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,260
only causing to be caught in the past.

774
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,060
Teacher,

775
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,980
have you also used a hard drive

776
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,220
to launch a system?

777
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,820
I am just letting your devil finance.

778
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,780
Don't worry.

779
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,020
I only wrote32 hardwareq cable,

780
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,340
Not signals andате nordic 2012.

781
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:38,260
Li Xue,

782
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,700
tell them to me.

783
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,700
Now Windows XP still has a hole.

784
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,140
This way, go to this office.

785
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,140
This way, come here.

786
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,260
Add another line.

787
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,780
Then add another line.

788
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,100
Professor.

789
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,060
Your phone.

790
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,540
Your...

791
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,140
Your phone.

792
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,340
Old Lin.

793
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,700
What time is it?

794
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,220
I forgot to bring the key.

795
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,060
Come back now.

796
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,460
Why did you bring the key again?

797
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,580
Okay.

798
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,580
I won't say it anymore.

799
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,780
I'll go back right away.

800
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,740
I'll go back right away.

801
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:26,940
Sorry.

802
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,940
My leader.

803
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,340
How about this?

804
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,460
Let's continue to talk another day.

805
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,260
Okay.

806
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:33,900
Okay.

807
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:40,540
Secretary Ke.

808
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,620
Why haven't you left?

809
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,980
Professor, that virus...

810
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,620
Sorry. Sorry.

811
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:46,860
Yixuan.

812
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,260
Unlock his computer quickly.

813
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,100
Okay.

814
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,140
Goodbye, Professor.

815
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,180
Goodbye. Goodbye.

816
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:02,980
Yixuan.

817
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:04,900
Hello.

818
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,580
Hello.

819
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,300
Li Xun.

820
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,300
Here.

821
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,460
Unlock it.

822
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,060
Forget it.

823
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,380
What time is it?

824
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,220
Don't pull.

825
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,820
Let go, little girl.

826
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,700
Go back. Go back.

827
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,460
Let go, little girl.

828
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,260
Teacher Lin asked you to unlock it for me.

829
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,500
I made it clear in the office just now.

830
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,580
You can't remember it?

831
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,460
I can't understand even if I remember it.

832
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,780
You can't understand it?

833
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,980
I thought the people who can be the class representative are all excellent.

834
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,820
It seems that your interest group

835
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:55,860
didn't teach you anything.

836
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,100
Will you unlock it or not?

837
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,180
What's the point of not unlocking it?

838
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,180
You still have to be a teacher.

839
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,100
Li Xun.

840
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,900
I admit that I'm not as good as others.

841
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,660
I sincerely ask for your advice.

842
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,620
Please help me unlock it.

843
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,220
Okay?

844
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:18,940
Zhu Yin.

845
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,020
Since you're not as good as others,

846
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,300
then learn it well.

847
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,900
I'm not as good as others.

848
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,060
I'm not as good as others.

849
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,260
I'm not as good as others.

850
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,340
I'm not as good as others.

851
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,260
I'm not as good as others.

852
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,140
I'm not as good as others.

853
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,100
By this way.

854
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:47,820
What happened?

855
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,620
Isn't it just an disease?

856
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,100
I can't do that. I can't unlock it.

857
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,060
Why did you pick this one?

858
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,300
Do you want to die?

859
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,780
I'm not calling you.

860
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,580
I'm calling you.

861
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,060
Yes.

862
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,420
Yu, wake up.

863
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,100
I'm not going.

864
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,620
Why can't you?

865
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,020
You're forcing me to do this.

866
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:28,740
No, I'm not.

867
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,420
Wake up.

868
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,180
Come on.

869
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,420
I don't want to go.

870
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,380
Yu.

871
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,540
We have tea class today.

872
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,180
Wake up.

873
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,860
I want to go.

874
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,220
What if you don't go?

875
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,740
You'll deduct my points.

876
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:41,420
I don't want to go.

877
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,500
Get up.

878
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,620
I'll wipe your face.

879
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,940
Get up. I'll wash your face.

880
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,660
What's wrong?

881
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,580
I'm so happy.

882
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,020
I've finally figured it out.

883
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,420
Go wash your face.

884
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,140
Youyou, Beiyang,

885
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,580
Shuhai, Fuyang.

886
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,060
Today's closed time is coming.

887
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,580
Nanhu University Library.

888
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,580
Welcome to your next visit.

889
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,580
I'm so happy.

890
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,580

00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,580
I'm so happy.

898
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,580
I'm so happy.

899
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,580
I'm so happy.

900
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,580
I'm so happy.

901
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,580
I'm so happy.

902
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,580

I'm so happy.

913
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,580
I'm so happy.

914
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,580
I'm so happy.

915
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,580
I'm so happy.

916
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,580
I'm so happy.

917
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,580
I'm so happy.

918
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,580
I'm so happy.

919
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,580

920
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,580

921
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,580

924
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,580
I'm so happy.

925
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,580
I'm so happy.

926
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,580

I'm so happy.

931
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,580
The mutton skewers from A'Dao are delicious.

932
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,580
I'm thanking you.

933
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,580
I've solved the virus.

934
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,580
Didn't you tell Mr. Lin

935
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,580
about the virus?

936
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,580
I've studied it with Gao.

937
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,580
It's really solved.

938
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,580
Although the virus is also

939
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,580
given by you,

940
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,580
but at least it has a profit.

941
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,580
Thank you.

942
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,580
Thank you.

943
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,580
Thank you.

944
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,580
Li Xun,

945
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,580
your grades look good.

946
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,580
In fact, early self-study

947
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,580
is a good time for the students to communicate.

948
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,580
Do you want to

949
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,580
guide the students?

950
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,580
I don't have time.

951
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,580
The bonus I was given

952
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,580
is really meaningful,

953
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,580
not including the teachers and students.

954
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,580
But you're always lacking in love.

955
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,660
If this goes on,

956
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,180
our class can't be in a good shape.

957
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,860
Fang Sheng Miao can't be in the health care department.

958
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,140
She might be upset

959
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,700
because you didn't go to the jujube department.

960
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,700
She's been unhappy for four years.

961
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,540
I know

962
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,260
you don't care about whether you get a point or not.

963
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,660
But we are a group.

964
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,980
You should think about everyone more,

965
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,660
right?

966
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,500
I knew you weren't that cold-blooded.

967
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,700
But many people

968
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,340
are so lazy when they get to college.

969
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,260
They waste their four years in college.

970
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,260
Actually, it's important to study early.

971
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:41,980
Enough.

972
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:44,900
I'm done.

973
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,220
So you agreed?

974
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:51,980
What's the point?

975
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,820
Except for your ten pairs of sunglasses,

976
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:55,860
you have to wear a necklace.

977
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,780
You're leaving so early?

978
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:06,900
It's okay.

979
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,980
I can go back to the dorm.

980
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,100
I forgot my phone.

981
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,580
Open the door.

982
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,340
You're a man.

983
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,380
You don't follow the rules

984
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,740
and let others take the responsibility.

985
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,260
Do you have any responsibility?

986
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,620
Open the door and give me your phone.

987
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:33,780
Open it.

988
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:35,660
You...

989
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,300
Don't answer the phone.

990
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,780
Don't move.

991
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,020
Hello.

992
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,540
Hello, Xinyu.

993
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,740
Do you want to be with me?

994
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,380
Sorry.

995
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,180
Zhu Yu is busy now.

996
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:51,980
Okay.

997
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,060
Sorry.

998
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:53,860
It's okay.

999
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,300
Open the door.

1000
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,100
I'll drag you to the bath today.

1001
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,260
Don't just

1002
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,260
play with me.

1003
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,300
I don't believe you.

1004
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:04,900
If you don't open the door,

1005
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:05,980
how can I wait for you?

1006
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:06,780
Open the door.

1007
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,620
You...

1008
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:05,200
самое Katara

1009
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,520
you don't need to

1010
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,520
Get back to body

1011
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:07,520
We will not be separated

1012
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,520
Escape from the noisy world

1013
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:17,520
Accompany me, I am your new point of view

1014
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,520
Raise me up bravely

1015
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,520
Like the flame of the night

1016
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:36,520
Cause I believe I love you

1017
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:40,520
True love will take its course

1018
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:44,520
I am by your side

1019
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,520
Spending a long time with you

1020
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:54,520
Cause I believe I want you

1021
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:58,520
True love will take its course

1022
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:02,520
That burning fire

1023
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:10,520
Is always on your side

1024
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:16,520
Ah

1025
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:34,200
Its justGG confusing

1026
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,200
I'm sorry.

1027
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,200
I'm sorry.

1028
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,200
