2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if the light is very bright

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will still watch over that vast vast land

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless atmosphere

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day, the lens is a little bit yellow

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast night?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I burn up the night just for you to remember

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How everything was in the beginning

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The wind and the color of the night sky are like wild grass

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The mountains are broken, but you are still by my side

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Everything is how it was in the beginning

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The Long Ballad

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Why don't you answer the phone?

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
If you can't answer the phone, can you find me?

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Tell me, what did you do tonight?

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Nothing to say

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Don't you think you should explain it?

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
While I can still accept your apology now

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Explain what?

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
There is no way

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
There is no way

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I just can't stand people like you

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What kind of people?

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Your mom is right

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
People like us are just trying to be smart

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Trying our best

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What about people like you?

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You are cold and heartless

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
High and high

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You take the country as your teacher

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You always teach others with a good attitude

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So you are deliberately stimulating them?

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yes

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Actually, I am happy to see them

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Just because they let you go abroad with me

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You don't have to pay the tuition

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You are just stimulating them

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No matter if they are my parents

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
This is the first time you meet them in person

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
No matter how I face them in the future

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Will they still accept us?

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Do you think they will?

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Even if I listen to them

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
At least you can try

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You proposed the meeting today

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I really suspect you today

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What do you suspect?

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Tell me what you suspect

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I suspect you are suspicious

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You should tell me what happened in advance

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You will face this sooner or later

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Go home

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What do you mean?

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You mean you understand

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You make my parents angry

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What do I go home for?

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Otherwise?

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You want to stay tonight

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I think I should apologize to you

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
for what happened today

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You can let me go

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But you should think about it

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Will I come back after I leave today?

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That's your choice

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Ok

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You said it

75
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So Li Xun quarreled with your mother

76
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Then?

77
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You quarreled with Li Xun just now

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So amazing

79
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I don't know him at all

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Do you know?

81
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
But I can imagine

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
your mother

83
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Li Xun should be a good son

84
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Mr. Liu is so arrogant

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
He should be punished

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And Li Lan

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You just passed away

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He must have been in the past

89
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You are finding excuses for him

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I tell you

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
He won't explain it to me today

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
He won't let me go back

93
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Will he be in trouble?

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's so abnormal

95
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
There must be a reason

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Did he hide something from you recently?

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Zhou Yue

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Li Xun is going to your home today

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I think he is with Xu Li Na

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He is with me

101
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Where are you going?

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You hit me so fast

103
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No, I have to find a reason

104
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
to ask him

105
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
for the Leonard brother

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I will ask선or

107
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I forget something

108
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What?

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,680
You went to Sikop producer right?

110
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,640
No

111
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,780
Nothing

112
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,560
I've been looking for you for some time

113
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,360
I'm FPS

114
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,600
What are you going to do?

115
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,000
Don't entertainment

116
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,200
I'm changing the profession

117
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:45,920
I'm so welcome

118
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,440
Ok

119
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,040
They are at the paste

120
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,200
They have에서

121
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,520
They are so nice

122
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,640
We can finally show up

123
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,440
In a hurry

124
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,360
Ok

125
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,920
You should't cry

126
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,840
Ok

127
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,920
See you

128
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,880
When the job is completed

129
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,840
I'll take a break

130
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,760
You should go back to Sprint

131
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,440
Yes

132
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:02,800
No

133
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,600
You should take a break

134
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
I'm not in a good mood tonight.

135
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,600
My attitude is a bit bad.

136
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
But you're even worse.

137
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,600
You can be spared from death and live in a difficult place.

138
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
But I can ignore all of this first.

139
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,600
I just want to know

140
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,600
what you did before you went to the wedding.

141
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Didn't you bring the key to the fire?

142
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Is this important?

143
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,600
Do you know the principle of 24 hours in the golden age?

144
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,600
If some misunderstandings are not solved in time,

145
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
it will cause a bigger misunderstanding.

146
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,600
I think I'm not responsible for guessing.

147
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
So can you tell me

148
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,600
where you went and who you met?

149
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,600
Don't think I don't know.

150
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,600
Fang Shu Miao told me everything.

151
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
The bathroom is so far away from our company.

152
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Why is he here?

153
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Why am I here?

154
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
This is not a misunderstanding.

155
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
I'm sorry.

156
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Forget it

157
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Wipe away your tears

158
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Wipe away your tears

159
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,600
Take him away

160
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:56,600
The parallel lines will no longer be worried

161
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Time

162
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Becomes the loneliness of a person

163
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
You're awake.

164
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
What song is this?

165
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,600
I'm writing a new song.

166
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
I haven't thought of a name yet.

167
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,600
Don't be like this.

168
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,600
We'll make up in a few days.

169
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
This song is ready.

170
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,600
I'll give it to you as a graduation gift.

171
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,600
I almost gave it to you on the day of graduation.

172
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Hello

173
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Hello

174
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
I'm Xu Li Na

175
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
I'm looking for Zhu Yun

176
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,600
Zhu Yun

177
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
Looking for you

178
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
I don't answer his phone.

179
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,600
It's Xu Li Na.

180
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,600
Hello

181
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Hello

182
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
Zhu Yun, are you free?

183
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Let's meet.

184
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
Zhu Yun

185
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,600
I don't like you.

186
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
It's okay.

187
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
I don't like you either.

188
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,600
I'm going to graduate soon.

189
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,600
What are you going to do?

190
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,600
What's it to you?

191
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,600
My dad gave me a fund.

192
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,600
I've been coming back and forth in several cities lately.

193
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Check the project

194
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
Make a wrong tune

195
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,600
I prefer those in the conceptual stage.

196
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,600
So I can participate in the process of hatching.

197
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,600
More sense of accomplishment

198
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
And high return rate

199
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Yesterday I heard a pretty interesting start-up plan.

200
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,600
The slogan is called

201
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,600
Increase the IQ of cancer by one percent

202
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,600
I'm quite interested in this company.

203
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,600
LP

204
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
Familiar, right?

205
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
So I came to this company.

206
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
I'm going to be a singer.

207
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
I'm going to be a singer.

208
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
I'm going to be a singer.

209
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
I'm going to be a singer.

210
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
So I asked you to come today.

211
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,600
That's why

212
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,600
I like this company.

213
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,600
Since your parents don't have this vision

214
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
Then I'll vote.

215
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,600
But the condition is

216
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,600
You out

217
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,600
Then you can try it.

218
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,600
If I don't agree

219
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,600
Can you take it away?

220
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
This is not important.

221
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,600
Li Xun has agreed

222
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
What did he agree to you?

223
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,600
Didn't he tell you?

224
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,600
It seems that you are really not important to him.

225
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
If you want to test me

226
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,600
It's ridiculous.

227
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
If you want to control Li Xun

228
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
That's even more impossible.

229
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
He won't accept you.

230
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
He is not subject to anyone at all.

231
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
Then you still don't know him enough.

232
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Have you ever thought about it?

233
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,600
You want to achieve this goal.

234
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,600
How much time and price do you have to pay?

235
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
The development of the Internet technology

236
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
Much faster than you think

237
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,600
As long as we can control

238
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
Lone hand data

239
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,600
Under the big data integration

240
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,600
You will see the value soon.

241
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,600
Where is the data?

242
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
We have mastered

243
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,600
Key hospital

244
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,600
And the diagnosis data of the surgery room.

245
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,600
China is too big.

246
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,600
You only made a few orders

247
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,600
Not know the height and the depth.

248
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
The future road is still long.

249
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
I am willing

250
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
You are willing

251
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,600
Is he willing?

252
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,600
You are so pitiful.

253
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
I don't even know if I'm sold.

254
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Li Xun told me personally

255
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,600
He doesn't want to waste time.

256
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Just want to develop the LPP as soon as possible.

257
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,600
I will remind you by the way.

258
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
We are leaving soon.

259
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,600
What are you going to do?

260
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,600
See my dad.

261
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,600
Let's go.

262
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,600
Come, let's go.

263
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
Li Xun

264
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,600
You get in the car and wait for me.

265
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,600
I will wait for you.

266
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
I will wait for you.

267
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
I will wait for you.

268
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Where are you going?

269
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,600
When are you going to tell me?

270
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,600
After I come back.

271
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
And Xu Linna?

272
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
She said you promised her.

273
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
What did you promise her?

274
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Actually, it doesn't matter if it's Xu Linna.

275
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
Now as long as someone is willing to invest in me.

276
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
I can promise her.

277
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Give up that fifty percent of the shares.

278
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,600
Is that fifty percent of the shares you said mine?

279
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,600
It used to be.

280
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,600
So you decided before you met my parents, right?

281
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
No.

282
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,600
It's from the time you wanted to get back the shares with me.

283
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
You decided to exclude me, right?

284
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
Kind of.

285
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
What if I don't agree?

286
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
From the legal point of view.

287
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
You don't have the right now.

288
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
I don't have the right.

289
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
If you have the right now.

290
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,600
Then you won't even say a word to me.

291
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,600
We are at this point.

292
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,600
Emotional use is a burden to everyone.

293
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,600
We two fight alone.

294
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,600
It looks pretty good.

295
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,600
But if one day because of the capital problem.

296
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,600
When it's divided.

297
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,600
You will regret it.

298
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,600
What do you think of me?

299
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
I just don't want you to regret.

300
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
Whether I regret it or not is my business.

301
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,600
You must leave today, right?

302
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,600
Think about it.

303
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
What do you want?

304
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
Go home.

305
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
Don't let your parents worry.

306
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Li Xun.

307
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
If you go one step further.

308
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,600
We will be completely over.

309
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,600
You will regret it.

310
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,600
What happened?

311
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
Are you hiding something from me?

312
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
What are you planning?

313
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
No chance.

314
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
This is what I want.

315
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
I'm sorry.

316
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,600
I'm sorry.

317
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,600
I'm sorry.

318
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,600
I'm sorry.

319
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
I'm sorry.

320
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
I'm sorry.

321
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
I'm sorry.

322
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,600
I'm sorry.

323
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
I'm sorry.

324
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,600
I'm sorry.

325
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,600
I'm sorry.

326
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,600
I'm sorry.

327
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,600
I'm sorry.

328
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,600
I'm sorry.

329
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,600
I'm sorry.

330
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,600
I'm sorry.

331
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,600
I'm sorry.

332
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
I'm sorry.

333
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
I'm sorry.

334
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,600
I'm sorry.

335
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
I'm sorry.

336
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
I'm sorry.

337
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
I'm sorry.

338
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
I'm sorry.

339
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,600
I'm sorry.

340
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,600
I'm sorry.

341
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
I'm sorry.

342
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,600
I'm sorry.

343
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,600
I'm sorry.

344
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,600
I'm sorry.

345
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
I'm sorry.

346
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
I'm sorry.

347
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
I'm sorry.

348
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,600
I'm sorry.

349
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,600
I'm sorry.

350
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,600
I'm sorry.

351
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,600
I'm sorry.

352
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,600
I'm sorry.

353
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
I'm sorry.

354
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,600
I'm sorry.

355
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,600
I'm sorry.

356
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,600
I'm sorry.

357
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,600
I'm sorry.

358
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,600
I'm sorry.

359
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,600
I'm sorry.

360
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,600
I'm sorry.

361
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
I'm sorry.

362
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
I'm sorry.

363
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
I'm sorry.

364
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
I'm sorry.

365
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,600
I'm sorry.

366
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
I'm sorry.

367
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,600
I'm sorry.

368
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,600
I'm sorry.

369
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
I'm sorry.

370
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
I'm sorry.

371
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,600
I'm sorry.

372
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
I'm sorry.

373
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
I'm sorry.

374
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
I'm sorry.

375
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
I'm sorry.

376
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
I'm sorry.

377
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,600
I'm sorry.

378
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,600
I'm sorry.

379
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,600
I'm sorry.

380
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,600
I'm sorry.

381
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
I'm sorry.

382
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
I'm sorry.

383
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,600
I'm sorry.

384
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,600
I'm sorry.

385
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,600
I'm sorry.

386
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,600
I'm sorry.

387
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
I'm sorry.

388
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
I'm sorry.

389
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,600
I'm sorry.

390
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
I'm sorry.

391
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
I'm sorry.

392
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
I'm sorry.

393
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,600
I'm sorry.

394
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600
I'm sorry.

395
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,840
I'm sorry.

396
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,840
I'm sorry.

397
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,880
I'm sorry.

398
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,600
I'm sorry.

399
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
I'm sorry.

400
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:48,600
I want to give you a little bit of light

401
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:55,600
Just like the shoulder you gave me before

402
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Sometimes I miss you

403
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:07,600
I have to learn to let go

404
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:15,600
I recognize your face

405
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:22,600
The vague clearness and the strong stubbornness

406
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:32,600
Have I ever been by your side all the time?

407
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:40,600
I want to give Zhi'an a little bit of light

408
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:47,600
Just like the shoulder you gave me before

409
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Sometimes I miss you

410
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:59,600
I have to learn to let go

411
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,600
My dad is working there

412
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,600
Are you sure you're not going up there with me to see him?

413
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,600
I'll see you this time

414
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,600
I helped you make such a big lie this time

415
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,600
You owe me a favor

416
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,600
I'll pay

417
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,600
What are you paying for?

418
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:30,600
Why don't you give me a chance?

419
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,600
I know you won't accept my dad to help us

420
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,600
But I can work with you

421
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,600
I can start a business with you

422
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,600
I've already thought about it before I came here

423
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,600
I don't want any clothes, shoes, bags, or cars

424
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,600
I'm going to work hard

425
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,600
Xueling

426
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,600
I haven't finished yet

427
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,600
I can eat with you

428
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,600
I can live in a small house

429
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,600
I can do everything he can do

430
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,600
It's worth a chance

431
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,600
You've made a lot of mistakes

432
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
You're a good girl

433
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
You love to be a wall

434
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
You don't let people go

435
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,600
You don't need me to give you a chance

436
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,600
I'm not qualified to ask

437
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,600
You deserve better

438
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,600
I also rejected others like this

439
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,600
I'm leaving

440
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,600
Li Xun

441
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,600
I can ask you

442
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,600
You're so hard-working this time

443
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,600
What does he want?

444
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,600
I always feel uneasy

445
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,600
Don't think too much

446
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,600
I'm just annoying him

447
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,600
It's that simple

448
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,600
I'm leaving

449
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
I'm leaving

450
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,600
I advise you not to tell him

451
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,600
What you have now

452
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,600
Can have his shares

453
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,600
At this time

454
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,600
You still have the mood to joke

455
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,600
He will definitely know in the future

456
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,600
He will ask me

457
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,600
Ask me what I should say

458
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,600
How should he look at me

459
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,600
I'm not afraid

460
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,600
What are you afraid of

461
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,600
You don't have to be afraid

462
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,600
You can stop thinking

463
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,600
You can stop thinking

464
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,600
But I can't stop thinking

465
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
You don't have to worry about him

466
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,600
He will go abroad

467
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,600
Will leave here

468
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,600
He doesn't need to entangle everything

469
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,600
But this company

470
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,600
I can only rely on you in the future

471
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
I try my best

472
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
Li Xun

473
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,600
Thank you for trusting me so much

474
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
Lao Gao

475
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,600
I have no family

476
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,600
And no friends

477
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,600
You may hate me

478
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,600
But you are the one I trust the most

479
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,600
I can still cancel the competition name

480
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
I can't go

481
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,600
This company

482
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,600
Can make you a place to settle

483
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,600
I believe you will be like us

484
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,600
Move it well

485
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,600
Move it well

486
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,600
How do you plan to deal with Fang Zhijing

487
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,600
I don't know

488
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,600
I agree you go to teach him

489
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,600
Like him

490
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
Should have some means

491
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,600
But if you want to use the same way

492
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,600
I don't think it's necessary

493
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,600
Kill a thousand enemies

494
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,600
Self-harm eight hundred

495
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,600
Is it worth it

496
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
Not worth it

497
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,600
I know you can't

498
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,600
I am also a person

499
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,600
I am also a person

500
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,600
I am also a person

501
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,600
But there are some things

502
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,600
Must do

503
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,600
Lao Gao

504
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,600
Tomorrow is the last day of the information security contest, right?

505
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,600
Correct

506
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,600
I will let you know

507
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
Generic

508
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,600
How

509
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,600
You can

510
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,600
I don't know.

511
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,600
It's not easy for me to get the first prize this time.

512
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,600
You still have your mother's anger?

513
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,600
Yun Yun, you're an adult now.

514
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,600
Sometimes I have to learn to think in a new way.

515
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,600
You have to think about why your parents

516
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
treat you like this.

517
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
And you're doing this for an outsider.

518
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,600
You and your parents are making such a fuss.

519
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,600
By the way,

520
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,600
your mother and I have already spent time together.

521
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,600
This year is the New Year, let's go to Sanya.

522
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,600
That bastard, Wang Zhijie.

523
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,600
He said that Li Lan asked him where there was a cheap hotel.

524
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,600
He kindly helped to introduce the hotel.

525
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,600
I think...

526
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,600
I think he's afraid that you'll trick him in the final.

527
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,600
He deliberately tricked Li Lan and scared you.

528
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,600
He has the guts.

529
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,600
He won't come back in the final.

530
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
Then I'll go to Sanya.

531
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,600
Dad, today is the 18th.

532
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,600
Today is the 18th.

533
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,600
Yes.

534
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,600
What's wrong?

535
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,600
Get in the car.

536
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,600
Yun Yun, where are you going?

537
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,600
Get in the car.

538
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,600
Next, I'll read the winning list.

539
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,600
Anhua University's representative team,

540
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,600
captain Zhao Bin,

541
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,600
Jianfu University's representative team,

542
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,600
Xinxi Engineering University's representative team,

543
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,600
Lengjiang Youdian University's representative team,

544
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,600
captain Zhao Siqi.

545
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,600
Congratulations.

546
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:20,600
Finally, I declare that the first team is

547
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,600
Xinxi Engineering University's representative team,

548
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,600
captain Fang Zhijie.

549
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,600
Please welcome the leaders of the committee to present the awards.

550
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,600
Let's welcome their captain, Fang Zhijie,

551
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,600
to give a speech.

552
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,600
Respectful leaders,

553
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,600
teachers, and classmates,

554
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,600
hello.

555
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,600
Hello.

556
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,600
First of all,

557
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,600
I want to thank the teachers who led the team this time.

558
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,600
Thank you.

559
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,600
Thank you.

560
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,600
Thank you.

561
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:17,600
Thank you, the teachers, judges, and the team committee.

562
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,600
You've worked hard.

563
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,600
Next, I want to thank all the students who participated in the competition.

564
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,600
If you don't pay the monthly fee,

565
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,600
we won't give you the award.

566
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,600
Thank you.

567
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,600
Okay.

568
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,600
I believe that in the future,

569
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,600
the trend of information security development

570
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,600
will be from traditional security

571
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,600
to a wide range of open-source.

572
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,600
With the continuous development of the Internet,

573
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,600
the traditional network boundaries will continue to exist.

574
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,600
The traditional security technology

575
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,600
has been unable to resist the development of the new generation of network security technologies.

576
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,600
Whether it's an enterprise or a company,

577
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,600
the construction of the supply of information security

578
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,600
has been constantly changing.

579
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,600
But it's only because of these changes

580
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,600
that the new network will be able to continue to exist.

581
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,600
It will also bring a new challenge to information security.

582
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,600
But at the same time,

583
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,600
it will also bring new hope to us.

584
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,600
New data, new applications,

585
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,600
new applications,

586
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,600
new computing, and new network

587
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,600
will become the new generation of new technologies.

588
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,600
Xu Wen!

589
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,600

Where are you?

593
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,600
Stop him!

594
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,600
What are you doing?

595
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,600

Master Xu!

646
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,600
Master Xu!

647
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,600
Master Xu!

648
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,600
Master Xu!

649
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,600
Master Xu!

650
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,600
Master Xu!

651
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,600
Master Xu!

652
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,600
Master Xu!

653
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,600
Master Xu!

654
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,600
Master Xu!

655
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,600
Master Xu!

656
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,600

00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,600
Master Xu!

658
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,600
Master Xu!

659
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,600
Master Xu!

660
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,600
1 week later

661
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,600
Yanyan

662
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,600
You've been sleeping for a day

663
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,200
Do you want to eat something?

664
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,600
What are you looking for?

665
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,920
Dad, where's my phone?

666
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,200
I've put it away.

667
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,160
Take a rest at home for a few days.

668
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,000
Don't contact the outside world.

669
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,120
Give me my phone.

670
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,440
Yunyun, you're shouting at me again.

671
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,160
Didn't I tell you that

672
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,360
something bad will happen to Yunyun sooner or later?

673
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,680
Now you see it, right?

674
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,520
Look at what he's done.

675
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,720
He just had a fight.

676
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,160
It's good that he's gone.

677
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,600
He can't quit school.

678
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,600
He doesn't care anyway.

679
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,600
What's so great about it?

680
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,320
What's so great about it?

681
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,400
Yes, Fang Zhijing was rescued.

682
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,520
But his left eye was removed.

683
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,840
Hundreds of people in the whole factory

684
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,040
saw him

685
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,440
and blinded the other person's eyes.

686
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,160
It's so terrible.

687
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,240
I think

688
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,040
his sister was killed by him.

689
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,240
This kind of person is a big deal.

690
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,840
What did you say?

691
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,120
I said it's a big deal.

692
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,440
What's wrong?

693
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,560
Now things are going crazy.

694
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,040
Do you think the Fang family will spare him?

695
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,160
His own child's eyes were blinded.

696
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,640
Look at how they deal with him.

697
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,440
I'll go find him.

698
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,440
What are you looking for?

699
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,240
Where are you going?

700
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,040
You can't go anywhere.

701
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,040
I'm going to find him.

702
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,040
Get out of here.

703
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,240
I'm not going out.

704
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,440
I don't want to go.

705
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,640
Don't you think things are going crazy?

706
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,040
Chongyun, you're an adult now.

707
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,840
Why don't you tell the difference?

708
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,640
Is it a small thing?

709
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,240
His eyes were blinded.

710
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,640
He'll be dead in the next half of his life.

711
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,640
You're still talking for that bastard.

712
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,640
What about Li Xun?

713
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,040
Why don't you think about Li Xun's future?

714
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,640
He?

715
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,640
He did that.

716
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,040
What future does he have?

717
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,840
Whether Fang Zhenjing will live or die

718
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,040
has nothing to do with me.

719
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,640
Don't hit the child.

720
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,840
You can say that?

721
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,240
Yuyi.

722
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,440
You're so stubborn now

723
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,440
that your parents don't recognize you.

724
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,640
No matter what Li Xun did today,

725
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,040
I'll definitely go see him.

726
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,440
Let me out.

727
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,240
I'll go see him.

728
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,240
Let me go.

729
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,040
Li Xun.

730
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,240
On the afternoon of January 18, 2016,

731
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,640
at 15.30 a.m.,

732
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,440
he was beaten by a victim

733
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,440
in the 1st report room of Nanhu University.

734
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:56,040
The victim's face and eyes were badly injured.

735
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,040
According to the forensic evidence,

736
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,440
the victim's double-sided nasal bone,

737
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,040
that is, the central part of the nose,

738
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,640
was badly injured.

739
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,640
The left eye was removed

740
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,640
and was badly injured.

741
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,240
The police thought

742
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,040
the defendant deliberately hurt someone else

743
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,440
and caused serious consequences for the injury.

744
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,840
The criminal act

745
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,440
has been considered as a violation of the Chinese People's Republic's

746
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:28,440
Article 234 of the Criminal Code.

747
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,440
He should be charged with

748
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,440
the crime of hurting someone.

749
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,440
The suspect is sentenced to

750
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,440
3 years or 10 years of imprisonment.

751
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,440
defendant,

752
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,440
do you have anything to say to the victim?

753
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,440
No.

754
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,440
I'm fine.

755
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,440
I'm fine.

756
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,680
After you

757
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,360
I will go too

758
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,320
Should be okay

759
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,320
fatigue

760
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,320
Doctor

761
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:53,960
How is it?

762
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,960
and has the lead of depression.

763
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,960
There are nine out of ten people with depression

764
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,960
who have committed suicide.

765
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,960
During the time, you have to be careful.

766
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,960
Thank you.

767
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,960

768
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,960

769
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,960
I have to go today.

770
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,960
I have to.

771
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,960
I have to go.

772
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,960
I have to go.

773
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,960
Yiyun.

774
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,960
You have been calm for so long.

775
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,960
Listen to me.

776
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,960
I have arranged everything

777
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,960
about your departure.

778
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,960
I have to go.

779
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,960
Listen to me.

780
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,960
Go out and relax.

781
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,960
Change the environment.

782
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,960
Maybe you will be better.

783
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,960
Yiyun.

784
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,960
You don't eat or drink all day.

785
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,960
You torture yourself like this.

786
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,960
If you decide to do it,

787
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,960
destroy yourself for that boy.

788
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,960
Let your parents suffer for a lifetime.

789
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,960
We will let you do it.

790
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,960
You decide it yourself.

791
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,960
Mom.

792
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:56,960
Mom.

793
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,960
Can you promise me one thing?

794
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:22,960
Sit down.

795
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,560
I still have successor to Holland.

796
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,960

797
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,960
Trishou,

798
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,960
we only talk about work in the future.

799
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,960
In the future,

800
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,960
do you still expect me to report work to you?

801
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,960
Industry is none of your business now.

802
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,960
What you've done so far

803
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,960
is because of your selfish reasons.

804
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,960
Breaking the boundary

805
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,960
A night full of rain

806
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,960
A full night

807
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,960
Later won the world for me

808
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,960
Always reach for the unstopping line

809
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,960
I also lean on your shoulder

810
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,960
We won't be separated

811
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,960
Escape from the noisy world

812
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,960
Accompany me, I'm your new point of view

813
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,960
Raise me up bravely

814
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,960

816
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,960

True love will take its course

821
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,960
That burning fire

822
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:23,960
You're always the one to watch over it

823
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:28,960

824
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,960
It's the sense of dream

825
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,960
Breaking the boundary

826
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,960
A night full of rain

827
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,960

Just be brave

832
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,960
Every dream I have

833
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:16,960
Won't, won't, won't lose to the world again

834
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,960
Cause I believe I love you

835
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,960
