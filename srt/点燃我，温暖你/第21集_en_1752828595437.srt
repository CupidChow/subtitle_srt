2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if the light is very bright

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will still watch over that vast vast land

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless atmosphere

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day, the lens is a little bit yellow

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast night?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I burn up the night just for you to remember

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How everything was in the beginning

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The wind and the color of the night sky are like wild grass

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The mountains are broken, but you are still by my side

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Everything is how it was in the beginning

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The Long Ballad

Episode 2

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This is more than 500 yuan per night

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
If it weren't for the meeting, I wouldn't want to live here

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Mingxue, do you know if the hotel here can be refunded?

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Of course, I want to find a cheaper one

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Then do you know any cheap hotels?

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I know a cheap hotel, but it's a bit remote

26
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,680
I want to find a cheaper hotel

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I want to find a cheaper hotel

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Mingxue, in this way

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Dear my neighbor

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,240
The date contains weight.

31
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,460
Humans are robots.

32
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,000
Han Yuanyuan's hand is really stable.

33
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,120
Didn't you think they have

34
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,840
more advanced technologies,

35
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,400
you see?

36
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,200
You read details very clearly.

37
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,640
You're I can't really shoot

38
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,680
How long?

39
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,620
Before his hospitalization

40
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,920
The video should be permanent

41
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,460
Sometimes even thousands of times

42
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,520
Planting the right밭

43
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,360

44
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,420
Do you really want to film?

Director

46
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,760
This is not their equipment

47
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,760
I'm afraid you won't be able to find your sister.

48
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,760
Director Chen,

49
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,760
the surgery video has been successfully uploaded.

50
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,760
You can watch it anytime you want.

51
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,760
I've already seen the whole process.

52
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,760
At the same time, there are many hospitals that are also watching.

53
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,760
This one of yours,

54
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,760
you can watch it anytime you want.

55
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,760
I'm afraid that you won't be able to find your sister.

56
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
Thank you.

57
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,760
The 4G network is just starting.

58
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,760
Currently,

59
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,760
we can only achieve the most basic

60
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,760
live and remote-reviewed operations.

61
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,760
When the physical condition is restored,

62
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,760
the remote-reviewed operations will not be in vain.

63
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,760
The speed of technology development is really fast.

64
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,760
It still depends on you young people.

65
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,760

He's retired.

80
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
Who told him to retire?

81
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,600
The client wants to retire.

82
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
We can't stop him.

83
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Okay, thank you.

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Hello, see you later.

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Okay.

86
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,000
The number you have dialed is currently unavailable.

87
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,200
So expensive.

88
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,800
I can only buy three.

89
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
These are enough.

90
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,200
Thank you.

91
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
Excuse me.

92
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,400
How much is this doll?

93
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
That's 45.

94
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,200
Let's take it together.

95
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
45.

96
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Okay.

97
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
Hello?

98
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
Sister.

99
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,600
Why can't you answer the phone?

100
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Where are you?

101
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
Brother.

102
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,600
Don't be mad.

103
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,000
I... I just

104
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,200
changed to a cheaper hotel.

105
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Where are you?

106
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Let me pick you up.

107
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,200
It's...

108
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Wait a minute.

109
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,200
It's Tian Lin Zhuang.

110
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,800
Wait a minute.

111
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,600
Sister.

112
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Sister.

113
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
Sister.

114
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,200
Sister!

115
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Hello, Gao.

116
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What's wrong?

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Where are you?

118
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Something happened.

119
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Yue Yue.

120
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,200
What are you doing?

121
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
Zhu Yue.

122
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,600
Dad and mom are talking to you.

123
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Don't be a nuisance.

124
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Don't be a nuisance.

125
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
Where are you going?

126
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
Don't be a nuisance.

127
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Go after him.

128
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
It's midnight.

129
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
I don't know where he is going.

130
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
Hurry up.

131
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Yue Yue.

132
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
Zhu Yue.

133
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
Yu Lan has been exposed.

134
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
I'm sorry.

136
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
I'm sorry.

00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,600
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
I'm sorry.

00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
I'm sorry.

144
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
I'm sorry.

145
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
I'm sorry.

147
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
I'm sorry.

148
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
I'm sorry.

149
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
I'm sorry.

150
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
I'm sorry.

151
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,600
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
I'm sorry.

156
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
I'm sorry.

157
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
I'm sorry.

159
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
I'm sorry.

160
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
I'm sorry.

161
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
I'm sorry.

162
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,600
I'm sorry.

163
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
I'm sorry.

164
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
I'm sorry.

165
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
I'm sorry.

166
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
I'm sorry.

167
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,600
Wang Zhi Ji, that jerk.

168
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
The whole time,

169
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Lu Lan told me

170
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
he was on a cheap hotel.

171
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
It was his kindness

172
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,600
that introduced the hotel.

173
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
I think he's afraid

174
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
that after the final,

175
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
you'll make him do something.

176
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
He'll fool Lu Lan

177
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
and scare you.

178
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
That kid

179
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
gave in

180
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,600
and left.

181
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
He knew

182
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
he was the one to do it,

183
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
but there was nothing he could do.

184
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
How could he?

185
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
He won't come back in the final.

186
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Don't say that, Gao.

187
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,600
Brother, this is an accident.

188
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,600
You can't come back to life.

189
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
You still have a long way to go.

190
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Brother, he was fine.

191
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Why did you have to have him operated?

192
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,600
What operation? What operation?

193
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,600
Don't be impulsive.

194
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Don't be impulsive.

195
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,600
Don't be impulsive.

196
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Don't pull me.

197
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Don't be impulsive.

198
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Please take the ashes of the Leilan family tree.

199
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
I'm sorry.

200
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,600
Do you know that

201
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,600
he loves to listen to folk songs?

202
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
Especially those songs

203
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,600
that he wrote.

204
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,600
The old record player in the house is broken.

205
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,600
I can't even put the tape out.

206
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
The road is noisy.

207
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,600
It's all dirty.

208
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,600
I threw away the tape.

209
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,600
I also told him

210
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,600
that he would go to the scene to listen to it when he had the money.

211
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,600
There are some stories that haven't been told.

212
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Then forget it.

213
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,600
Those feelings in the years

214
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,600
Sister.

215
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,600
This is for you.

216
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,600
For me?

217
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,600
Is it handsome?

218
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,600
You are handsome.

219
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,600
Thank you.

220
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,600
I'm sorry.

221
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
I'm sorry.

222
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,600
I'm sorry.

223
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,600
I'm sorry.

224
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,600
I'm sorry.

225
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,600
I'm sorry.

226
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,600
Those songs

227
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,600
They are all old.

228
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Where are they?

229
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,680

233
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,760

00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,760

00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,320
Li H shot

238
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,440
Li H waters

239
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,040
I'm afraid you don't want to go.

240
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,960
My dad is gone.

241
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,480
I want to take care of my mom and sister.

242
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,240
But I failed.

243
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,880
In the end,

244
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,800
this is our destiny.

245
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,040
We have to endure it.

246
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,000
You're old.

247
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,600
You can't be like this because of an accident.

248
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,440
You have me.

249
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,640
It's snowing.

250
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:07,880
Look.

251
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,960
It's 왔.

252
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,600
This isn't scientific.

253
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,120
You can tell because of your face tone.

254
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,880
You're int 10 AND 10.

255
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,880
This is not scientific.

256
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,880
I'm cold-blooded.

257
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,880
Why are you not telling me?

258
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,880
Princess.

259
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
Do you have a dream?

260
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,880
My dream is to...

261
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,880
...become a witness to my first love.

262
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,880
I want to be a witness to your first love.

263
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,880
I want to be a witness to your first love.

264
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,880
So, I don't need to ask you who it is.

265
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,240
My dream is easy to come true?

266
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,880
In case I go astray one day,

267
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,880
I will look for someone interesting.

268
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,440
When today happens to come.

269
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,440
it means I have to go back.

270
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,680
牵手

271
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,440
is careful what you do.

272
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,040
Issue it.

273
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:13,840
What if one day

274
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,600
What if one day

275
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:14,880
death construction .

276
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,880
What do you want to do?

277
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,400
tournament.

278
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,160
What do you lam term you on the hell?

279
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,320
I wish you a blessing

280
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,400
Then you have to remember

281
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,120
It's not what you said

282
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,880
I didn't expect that the words I said by accident

283
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,880
would become so heavy.

284
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,880
Maybe,

285
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,880
I didn't understand what Li Xun meant.

286
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,880
I thought that

287
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,880
this moment was the beginning of our happiness.

288
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,880
But I didn't expect

289
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,880
that this is the end of our happiness.

290
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,880
I thought

291
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,880
that this moment was the beginning of our happiness.

292
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,880
But I didn't think

293
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,880
that this is the end of our happiness.

294
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,880
Yes,

295
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,880
we can guarantee that

296
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,880
the error rate of the system is below one percent.

297
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,880
Yes,

298
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,880
Jiahe Hospital

299
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,880

300
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,880
Okay,

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
I will come over and show it to you.

302
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,880
See you later.

303
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,880

304
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,880
I will go over.

305
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,880
You can go first.

306
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,880
Okay,

307
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,880
I will go over.

308
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,880
Go ahead.

309
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,880

313
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,880
Okay.

314
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,880
Why don't you ask?

315
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,880
Do I need to ask?

316
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,880
Go ahead.

317
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,880
I'm going.

318
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,880
Okay,

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
I'll go.

320
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,880
Okay,

321
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,880
I'll go.

322
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,880
I didn't find you when I returned to the company.

323
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,880
Why are you here?

324
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,340
It's fine.

325
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,340
Are you still acting like this?

326
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,120
Your brother

327
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,260

328
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,040
Why do you suddenly think about

aussi sautés?

330
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,760
I'm wondering

331
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,720
if there's no rhythm

332
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,840

333
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,820
for that.

334
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,720
I'm sorry.

335
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,600
It's too late.

336
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,920
We can't hide forever.

337
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,280
You don't believe me?

338
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,240
Of course not.

339
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,960
It's just that my mom...

340
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,680
I know.

341
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,000
Your parents have a problem with me.

342
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,360
When I see them,

343
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,080
they might be embarrassed.

344
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,400
It's okay.

345
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,560
I'm old.

346
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,880
I don't want to be in the middle.

347
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,200
Forget it.

348
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,800
Just take it easy.

349
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,800
This is a special time.

350
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,520
They're worried about your future.

351
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,480
No matter what we plan in the future,

352
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,280
I have to take the initiative to say it.

353
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,840
Otherwise, we'll look like we're not serious.

354
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,840
Li Lan is gone.

355
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,920
I only have you.

356
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,840
I'm not going to be a bad person.

357
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,040
I'm not going to be a bad person.

358
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,040

I'm not going to be a bad person.

361
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,040
I'm not going to be a bad person.

362
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,040
I'm not going to be a bad person.

363
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040

I'm not going to be a bad person.

373
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
I'm not going to be a bad person.

374

What's the wind blowing you here?

380
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,720
Can't I come and see you?

381
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,000
This is the legendary base.

382
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,440
What's wrong?

383
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,360
Are you moving out?

384
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,040
I'm about to graduate.

385
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,680
The base is going to be disbanded.

386
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,800
Are you really here to see me?

387
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,560
Or are you here to participate in the information competition?

388
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,520
I'm here to see Li Xun.

389
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,880
I heard that you're running a company and are going to start a business.

390
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,400
It's Zhu Yun and Li Xun's company.

391
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,280
I'm alone.

392
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,800
I'm planning to go somewhere else.

393
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,080
Where are you going?

394
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,920
You don't have to worry about that.

395
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,840
Why are you here to see Li Xun?

396
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,880
He invited me here.

397
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,520
He invited you here?

398
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,160
I invited him here.

399
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,040
Gao, wait a minute.

400
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,680
I have something to tell you.

401
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,600
Let's go. Let's go outside and talk.

402
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,760
Let's fry some broccoli.

403
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,680
What's going on?

404
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,040
Don't be late today.

405
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,360
The Minister of Culture of Beijing is here.

406
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,920
Go and drink.

407
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,160
I am going to pay.

408
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,760
Hello, you have arrived. I'm out to pick you up.

409
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,320
Zhu Yun.

410
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,200
So is Li Xun going to your place to see your parents today?

411
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,760
Miao Miao.

412
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,000
Yes, I haveelaed to meet her.

413
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,320
Is she there?

414
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,120
I saw him with Xu Li Na.

415
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:52,760
Don't cry.

416
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,640
You didn't have to pick up your uncle.

417
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,800
He used to form our team long time ago.

418
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,320
Don't change shoes, just come in.

419
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,560
Li Xun.

420
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,560
Li, you're here.

421
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,040
Hello, uncle.

422
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,520
I brought something for you and aunt.

423
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,360
You're so generous.

424
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:18,880
Yes.

425
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,480
Hurry up.

426
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,280
We need to eat for a while.

427
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,040
Well,

428
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,600
go to the study with me.

429
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,320
Let's have some tea and chat.

430
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,320
Okay.

431
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,320
Here.

432
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,320
About you,

433
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,280
I heard from your mom.

434
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,480
Nothing serious.

435
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,240
It's normal for young people to make some mistakes.

436
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,960
As long as it's not bad,

437
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,360
I don't mind.

438
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,560
Li,

439
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,720
you're a smart person.

440
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,520
So I'll be straight with you

441
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,680
about something.

442
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,000
Okay?

443
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,760
If we're partners,

444
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,760
friends,

445
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,960
or relatives,

446
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,240
I can accept it.

447
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
But Yuanyuan is our only daughter.

448
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,560
If you two are together,

449
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,880
and you can't get her mother's blessing,

450
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,560
you won't be happy.

451
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,480
And our family won't be good.

452
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,040
Do you understand?

453
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,360
Yes.

454
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,000
Yuanyuan,

455
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,880
come and clean the table.

456
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,200
I'm starving since I've been working all morning.

457
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,200
You still don't know

458
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,600
what you should do

459
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,800
and what you shouldn't do?

460
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,280
The GIE has signed up for you.

461
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,480
You'll have a second chance

462
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,840
to review the work.

463
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,080
I told you I don't want to go abroad.

464
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,240
I'm Li Xun's girlfriend,

465
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,880
and also a partner of the new company.

466
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,000
Now the company is just getting into the right track.

467
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,240
I can't leave.

468
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,720
Anyway, I don't care if you accept it or not.

469
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,040
I've made my decision.

470
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,440
And I won't change.

471
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,080
You're still young.

472
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,920
Don't say absolutely or sure.

473
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,320
It's not a good word.

474
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,160
You'll know in a few years

475
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,240
how naive and childish you are today.

476
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,400
We've been thinking

477
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,000
about sending Yuanyuan abroad.

478
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,200
But she insists on staying in China

479
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,240
to start a business with you.

480
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,320
And your family

481
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,760
has just been in trouble.

482
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,520
She definitely can't let you go.

483
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,840
It's really hard for us.

484
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,840
Li,

485
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,840
I have a suggestion.

486
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,600
If you two

487
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,040
really want to be together,

488
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,080
why don't you go abroad together

489
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,440
and change the environment together?

490
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,400
You can't be together.

491
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,440
I'll take the responsibility.

492
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,680
Of course,

493
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,840
I'll pay for all the expenses.

494
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,920
So you can accept me.

495
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,360
We still need time.

496
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,240
But the most important thing is

497
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,920
you two need time, too.

498
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,600
Whether you can make it to the end

499
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,280
really depends on the time.

500
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,120
I know.

501
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,120
I'm a little

502
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,840
abrupt

503
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,480
and selfish.

504
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,040
After all, you've just started your business.

505
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,120
I've done some research.

506
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,400
The future is not bad.

507
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,880
But I want to tell you that

508
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,560
there is no chance

509
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,560
for you to make mistakes in this society.

510
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,200
You can't make mistakes.

511
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,600
Yuanyuan is my only daughter.

512
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,680
I can't make mistakes with her.

513
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,680
Do you understand?

514
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,040
So if you really care about Yuanyuan

515
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,160
and really want to be with her,

516
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,440
think about it.

517
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,880
I know you're here

518
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,720
to cook for me.

519
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,840
Come on, sit.

520
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,400
I'll do it.

521
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,480
Come on, let's eat.

522
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,280
Let's talk while eating.

523
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,320
Eat first.

524
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,320
Yes, eat.

525
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,200
It's better than mine.

526
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,280
What does your company

527
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,400
do?

528
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:39,840
Mom.

529
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,480
Didn't you say you wanted me to know more?

530
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,520
We are making a medical system.

531
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,080
You?

532
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,280
Can you do it?

533
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,120
The shrimp is fresh.

534
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,880
Eat while it's hot.

535
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,720
Uncle Zhu, Aunt Liu,

536
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,440
thank you for inviting me to your home.

537
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,080
I'll give you a toast.

538
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,680
Uncle told me a lot just now.

539
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,280
I understand your good intentions.

540
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,760
But I also want to say

541
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,920
that Zhu Ying will be happy with me.

542
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,240
So choosing to start a business

543
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,280
is also choosing to believe in our future.

544
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,560
Please rest assured.

545
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,080
And please believe in your own choice.

546
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,080
Why are you

547
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,640
so stubborn?

548
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,600
You don't want to go abroad

549
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,640
because you are stubborn?

550
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,520
That's right.

551
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,480
Xiaoli,

552
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,720
you're wrong.

553
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,760
What did I tell you in the study just now?

554
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,520
It's very difficult for young people to start a business now.

555
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,040
It's not that you just hit your head, right?

556
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,400
You can do whatever you want.

557
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,720
You agree to go abroad together.

558
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,240
That's what I've discussed with your aunt.

559
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,960
That's our bottom line.

560
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,800
We've already considered your feelings.

561
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,640
In the end, we all have to

562
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,880
help our own daughter.

563
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,040
If you insist on

564
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:52,960
going abroad,

565
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,840
it's like you're making it difficult for Zhu Ying.

566
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,880
If you put her in the middle and make it difficult for both sides,

567
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,080
I'll be suspicious.

568
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,680
What's your intention?

569
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,520
Why are you talking about going abroad?

570
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,400
Dad, mom,

571
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,040
I really don't want to go abroad.

572
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,120
Our company has recently talked to a lot of investors.

573
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,040
It's really incredible that we can get such a result

574
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,200
just after we started.

575
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,600
We're not kidding.

576
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,120
Aunt,

577
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,920
I know you have a prejudice against me.

578
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,960
It's okay.

579
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,280
Since you know my background,

580
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,960
you should know my ability.

581
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,040
If you're willing to help the young people,

582
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,920
I'll help you.

583
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,040
Help?

584
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,080
Okay, tell me.

585
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,480
How are you going to help?

586
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,040
Zhu Ying and I just started our business.

587
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,680
We need connections to do business.

588
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,280
Uncle's company

589
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,440
doesn't focus on restoring medical equipment.

590
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,360
With my ability,

591
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,760
plus your ability,

592
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,160
we can cooperate with each other.

593
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,600
We can cooperate with each other.

594
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,480
We can cooperate with each other.

595
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,040
Help me expand the business to the whole country.

596
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,840
When the company is listed,

597
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,520
we'll be a family.

598
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,240
We'll live happily ever after.

599
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,000
Li Xun, what are you talking about?

600
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,400
What do you think?

601
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,400
We're living like a family now.

602
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,680
A happy family.

603
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,120
You're Clairos de 다시, young man.

604
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:09,200
You have

605
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,720
four years of experience now.

606
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,400
Look, extend your hand.

607
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,200
So, do you think you're the residence leader of your dad?

608
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,440
I've tried hard to make Yue Tan time a little less heated.

609
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,320
I think it's because W 돼요мотря ta Lead the team

610
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,600
keeps saying that Mom isn't in your수jo.

611
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,800
That means he still has a relationship with me.

612
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,400
Yes and no.

613
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,040
We're always at peace.

614
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,360
She's doing very well now.

615
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,440
To be honest,

616
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,080
you're dragging her down.

617
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:47,480
Dad.

618
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,080
Yueyue,

619
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,480
you see it now, right?

620
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,080
You see it, right?

621
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,400
I told you long ago

622
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,520
that a person's nature is hard to change.

623
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,360
Don't think that you're so great

624
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,560
just because you got good grades.

625
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,160
You can't change this person's

626
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,040
greedy, selfish, and pretentious nature

627
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,520
even if you're the top student.

628
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,600
Mom, can you stop talking?

629
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,240
Yueyue, stop talking.

630
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,760
Who is she to you now?

631
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,720
You protect her like this.

632
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,760
Tian water,

633
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,480
A之作,

634
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,280
go ahead.

635
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,720
Our family doesn't welcome you.

636
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,480
Dad.

637
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,640
I thought your eyes

638
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,160
will be longer than yours.

639
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,600
Half a few hours.

640
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,720
Li Xun.

641
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,720
Did you see that, Zhu Yue?

642
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,120
How could we agree

643
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,720
to be with someone like you?

644
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,720
I'm telling you,

645
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,720
something big is going to happen to him sooner or later.

646
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:52,560
Ying Yue.

647
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,320
Where are you going?

648
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,560
What are you doing?

649
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:55,800
Come back!

650
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,400
Zhu Yue!

651
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,720
The End

652
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,760
Why is he here?

653
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,320
Why am I here with you?

654
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,640
It's not a misunderstanding.

655
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,360
Li Xun.

656
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,960
If you go one step further,

657
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,440
we'll be done for.

658
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:33,720
Honey.

659
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,120
I have no family.

660
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,200
I don't have many friends.

661
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,600
But there are some things

662
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,160
you need to do.

663
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:42,880
Kiss me.

664
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,480
Li Xun!

665
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,800
We

666
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,240
won't be separated

667
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,680
from the noisy world.

668
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,840
Accompany me

669
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:27,320
is your new address.

670
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,400
Raise me up bravely

671
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:37,000
like the flame of the night.

672
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,200
Because I believe I love you.

673
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,760
True love will take its course.

674
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,440
I'm by your side.

675
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:58,560
I'll spend the long time with you.

676
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:03,080
Because I believe I want you.

677
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,560
True love will take its course.

678
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,840
The soul that warmshangs

679
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:19,640
will always be you.

680
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,120
I won the world

681
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:57,360
Always wither and never stop

682
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:01,840
I'm also here by your side

683
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,080
Just be brave

684
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,680
Every dream I have

685
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:14,240
I won't, I won't, I won't lose to the world again

686
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,880
Cause I believe I love you

687
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,280
True love will take its course

688
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,480
I'm by your side

689
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,000

Cause I believe I want you

691
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:41,080
True love will take its course

692
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:45,520
The firework that can only be used for love

693
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:56,120
You've always been there for me

694
00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:00,920
Cause I believe I love you

695
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:05,440
True love will take its course

696
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,640
I'm by your side

697
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,200

Cause I believe I want you

699
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:23,200
True love will take its course

700
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:27,680
The firework that can only be used for love

701
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:36,560
You've always been there for me

702
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:41,000
True love will take its course

The firework that can only be used for love

704
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:57,080
You've always been there for me
