1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
She is a girl who is soft and tolerant

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,800
She is a girl who is very independent and strong

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,800
Yixuan

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,960
You choose me

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,280
I will never betray you

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,600
Yixuan is a genius who becomes a genius without any hesitation

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,160
But she is actually very warm inside

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,240
You are responsible for worrying

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,440
I am responsible for getting Yixuan

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,200
How do you understand the cycle of fate?

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,640
They are destined to be together

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,160
No matter what, they will always be together

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,360
Princess

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,120
Do you have a dream?

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,680
My dream is to have my first love, Chen Zhengguo

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,120
The King of Dance

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,120
The King of Dance

18
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,120
Please sit down

19
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,120
OK

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,120
I am Zhang Jingyu, I am the assistant director

21
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,120
I am Zhao Zhilei, I am playing Gao Jianfeng in the drama

22
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,120
I am Chen Feiyu

23
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,120
This is the room

24
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,120
Chen Feiyu sits here, Zhang Jingyu sits here

25
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,120
They didn't say a word

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,040
Many of them are like this

27
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,040
They are all playing with themselves

28
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,040
Chen Feiyu has been sitting here playing with his lighter

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,040
Then Jingyi has been imitating Jingyi

30
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,040
He didn't even knock on the second son's leg

31
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
Just like this

32
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,040
Just a good boy, you know

33
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,040
Maybe everyone is a little afraid

34
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,040
Because if I have new friends

35
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,040
If others don't talk to me

36
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,040
I will never take the initiative to contact others

37
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,040
So I sit there

38
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,960
I am not the kind of person who is familiar with me when I meet

39
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,960
In fact, at first

40
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,960
In my impression

41
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,960
Maybe not as obedient as Li Xun

42
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,960
But then I remember he sat on my right

43
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,960
Then he looked at me

44
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,960
Didn't say a word

45
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,960
At that moment

46
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,960
He is Li Xun, very Li Xun

47
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,960
The game is on

48
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,960
Say a few words

49
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,960
Hello everyone

50
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,960
I am Zhang Jingyi

51
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,960
Then I am very happy

52
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,960
I will spend the next four months with you

53
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,960
I will work hard

54
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,960
I hope we can cheer up together

55
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,960
Just two sentences

56
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,960
Say a few words

57
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,960
Hello everyone, I am Chen Feiyu

58
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,960
Then I played Li Xun

59
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,960
Then please applaud

60
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,960
Thank you

61
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,960
Thank you

62
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,960
Two, three

63
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,960
The first time I met with a real person

64
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,960
Actually it should be at the time of Weibo

65
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,960
At that time, I actually didn't confirm

66
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,960
That we were going to go on a tour together

67
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,960
This play

68
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,960
The first impression is

69
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,960
I think he is very kind

70
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,960
Who called me first

71
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,360
We greeted each other.

72
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,960
Yes.

73
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,760
It was in the elevator.

74
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,160
Then he walked in.

75
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,560
He was so tall.

76
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,160
He stood in front of me like a wall.

77
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,960
In my heart,

78
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,760
it was very early.

79
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,760
When I first met Jingyi,

80
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,960
and when I met the director,

81
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,760
I thought he was a lucky guy.

82
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,360
When I first met He Fei Yu,

83
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,960
I think he really has a lot of

84
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
common ground.

85
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,760
Look at the camera.

86
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,360
He ran and ran.

87
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,360
He ran and ran.

88
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,360
He's so handsome.

89
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,960
I'm so happy.

90
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,160
I'm so happy.

91
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,760
I'm so happy.

92
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,360
I'm so happy.

93
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:20,960
I'm so happy.

94
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,360
Did you feel any pressure?

95
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,960
When you were in charge of this drama?

96
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,760
Instead of saying pressure,

97
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,360
it might be a kind of responsibility.

98
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,160
The pressure is for yourself.

99
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,960
Will you feel stressed?

100
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,760
Of course.

101
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,960
Because everyone has a lot of imagination about him.

102
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,960
Whether it's appearance or character,

103
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,160
including your script,

104
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,360
it's impossible to be very complete.

105
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,160
In the early stage,

106
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,760
Zhu Yun had a lot of scenes.

107
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,560
And it was a big challenge for me.

108
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,360
At that time, I was under a lot of pressure.

109
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,960
He would help me sort things out.

110
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,560
We would go to the acting together.

111
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,760
He would tell me

112
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,960
not to be so stressed.

113
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,160
In fact, you are like Zhu Yun in private.

114
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,160
Do you think he is the Li Xun in your mind?

115
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,760
He is the Li Xun in my mind.

116
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,960
He has shown the Li Xun in my mind.

117
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,160
He might not be as cold as Li Xun.

118
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,360
I think.

119
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,760
Jingyi is very similar to Zhu Yun.

120
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,560
As long as she wants to do something,

121
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,160
she will do her best to complete it.

122
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,160
So I think he is really like Zhu Yun in character.

123
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,560
And he is very brave.

124
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,360
I will never change

125
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,360
With you on top, on the surface,

126
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,960
the eyes are open

127
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,360
Good night

128
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,760
I learned to be a hero

129
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,960
Yuan Fang.

130
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,760
Yuan Fang's heart.

131
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
Wait a minute.

132
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,160
Li Xun has had enough of her chin.

133
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,560
Do you remember the scene of the first kiss?

134
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,160
I remember it was in the studio of LP.

135
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,960
Were you shy at that time?

136
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,560
I was sure at the beginning.

137
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,960
I was sure I would be shy.

138
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Although I was already familiar with Jingyi,

139
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,360
I was still a little shy.

140
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,560
Do you two kiss on the spot?

141
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,360
Or here?

142
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,160
If you don't mind, I will kiss you.

143
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,360
What did the director say to you before the shoot?

144
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,360
Don't be shy.

145
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,160
What does this mean?

146
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,960
What do you think this means?

147
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,360
This is the face of Jingyi's family.

148
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,560
No problem.

149
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,360
I think he is the kind of person who is very shy.

150
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,960
And then he keeps saying that you are shy.

151
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,160
Jingyi is shy and may be easily blushed.

152
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,160
Are you shy?

153
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,360
I am shy and blushed.

154
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,160
Boss.

155
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,160
Brother Xun.

156
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,160
Brother Xun.

157
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,960
I am shy.

158
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,560
But you are staring at him like this.

159
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,560
Isn't it a kiss?

160
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,160
This is how he kisses.

161
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,360
How can you kiss without looking at him?

162
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,960
Why are you all looking at me?

163
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,760
Why don't you all stare at me?

164
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,560
Let's drink.

165
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,760
No effect.

166
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,760
Five minutes.

167
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,160
OK.

168
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,760
Eat garlic.

169
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,560
You eat green onion.

170
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,160
OK.

171
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,960
You eat garlic and green onion.

172
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,760
OK.

173
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,760
I'll eat it now.

174
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,560
OK.

175
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,760
This is how you kiss a girl.

176
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,360
No.

177
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,560
This is tangerine breast Nicolas B Débal.

178
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,360
This is tangerine breast Nicolas B Débal.

179
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,360
This is tangerine breast Nicolas B Débal.

180
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,960
Yes.

181
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,560
No.

182
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,760
Why are you all staring at me?

183
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,560
Didn't you see the heart that is Rosa either?

184
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,760
You're good at chili sauce.

185
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,360
The fire is on fire.

186
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:10,560
That's really hot.

187
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,760
The fire is on fire.

188
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:17,340
I'm

189
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,140
hello

190
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,860
I think a girl

191
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,220
It's really amazing to be able to wear a princess dress and confess.

192
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,300
Yishun,

193
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,140
choose me.

194
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,380
I will never betray you.

195
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,500
Zhu Yuanyuan said a classic line in the book.

196
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,060
It's that you choose me, I will never betray you.

197
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,860
And then I think I still have to be sincere with the other person.

198
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,540
You really have to let the other person hear this sentence.

199
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,380
Let him feel how sincere you are.

200
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:21,140
In fact, there may be a funny part in the script at the beginning.

201
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,060
I even said a sentence.

202
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,140
But actually, when we were acting, we thought it might be better.

203
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:32,060
Compared to the kind of straight and cute that Zhu Yuanyuan was at that time,

204
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,020
I think what I want him to hear more is that I really want to be with you.

205
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,300
But I was impressed because I was in a park that day.

206
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,620
So many people.

207
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,300
There are tourists and various cameras.

208
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,460
Except for the cameras on the scene,

209
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,660
I feel like there are about 80 or 100 cameras.

210
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,220
Let's do it again.

211
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,340
The pressure of going to the scene.

212
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:00,820
Yes.

213
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,980
Will you feel brave after shooting that day?

214
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:05,580
Yes.

215
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,220
I think what is there to be afraid of in front of so many people?

216
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,660
Do you look forward to a certain scene after watching the script?

217
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,140
There is a scene that I look forward to.

218
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:18,140
It's the scene where Li Xun is looking for revenge.

219
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,900
I think this is a turning point in Li Xun's fate.

220
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:29,900
New data, new network, new network, new movement, new energy.

221
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,380
He chose to meet with Fang Zhijing.

222
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,780
He will not hesitate to avenge his sister at all costs.

223
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,620
Li Xun sacrificed his life at this moment.

224
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,860
But he didn't choose to tell Zhu Yun.

225
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,460
He doesn't hate Zhu Yun.

226
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,420
It's because he loves Zhu Yun too much.

227
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,260
He doesn't want Zhu Yun to be sad for him.

228
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,140
He doesn't want Zhu Yun to stop him.

229
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,060
Because he knows that if he tells Zhu Yun, Zhu Yun will definitely stop him.

230
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,020
He would rather let Zhu Yun hate him.

231
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,420
He doesn't want Zhu Yun to suffer with him.

232
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,020
Ma Xiaoling, Ma Xiaoling.

233
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,540
How do you understand this kind of love?

234
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,500
I don't know.

235
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,420
As a girl or as Zhu Yun,

236
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,100
I think I want to know.

237
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,380
I don't want you to bear it alone.

238
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,700
I'd rather face it with you.

239
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,180
I'm going to stick it on.

240
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,820
I went to thetechnical center.

241
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,420
I put it here because

242
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:50,100
people want to use your face to counseling.

243
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,700
You are beautiful.

244
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,260
Is that so?

245
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,860
MAY firstly,

246
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,460
G speaks like he knew about this.

247
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,980
You are beautiful.

248
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,580
G.

249
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,940
I'm a little nervous

250
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,860
I'm a little nervous

251
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,740
I'm a little nervous

252
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,340
Zhu Ying believes Li Xun

253
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,140
She believes it completely

254
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,940
She will think that she did this

255
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,820
It must be

256
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,780
I haven't known the real result yet

257
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,780
The real reason

258
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,100
So I've been waiting for an answer

259
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,460
I'm sure in my heart

260
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,780
She did this

261
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,020
It must not be because

262
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,460
Really want to push me away

263
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,780
In such a long time

264
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,340
I've actually been believing

265
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,180
And waiting for this reason

266
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,380
He's being beaten

267
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,460
You see how the Fang family will deal with him in the future

268
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,300
Then I'll go find him

269
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:42,700
What are you looking for?

270
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,500
I'm being arrested

271
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,180
You two can't go

272
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:44,980
I'm going to find him

273
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,260
Don't let me go abroad

274
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,380
I'm not going abroad

275
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,100
Hurry up

276
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,780
You still try to be not big enough

277
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,300
Finally

278
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,060
You are now an adult

279
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,140
They are not different

280
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,100
Is this a small thing

281
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,660
The child is blind

282
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,940
Ended for a lifetime

283
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,820
You still speak for that bastard

284
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,820
Then you find

285
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,780
Why don't you have one

286
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,260
Think about your future

287
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,860
He did this

288
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,180
What future

289
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,980
Fang Zhijun is blind or not

290
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,540
It has nothing to do with me

291
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,620
Don't beat him

292
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,060
All right

293
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,100
I didn't really beat him

294
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,660
You see who's right

295
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,580
When I was filming this play

296
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,980
In fact, I see that the mood is also very calm

297
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,740
I also asked Mr. Tu to really go

298
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,060
It seems

299
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,540
I didn't hit too hard

300
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,220
The teacher was still afraid of hitting me

301
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,580
Because Mr. Tu thinks he is a boy

302
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,420
It's just that his palm is stronger

303
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,620
But I was still

304
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,740
I've already prepared

305
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,500
Then the teacher didn't really hit

306
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,620
How do you evaluate him

307
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,380
To face your parents

308
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,860
Just for the person you like

309
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,780
Zhuyun really understands Li Xun

310
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,580
He cares about Li Xun

311
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,100
Everyone

312
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,420
No one stands behind Li Xun

313
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,580
To support him

314
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,020
But I know he has his reasons

315
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,700
I am willing to support him

316
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,020
I am his knight

317
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,940
Then on the other hand

318
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,980
In fact, I think this is also Zhuyun's

319
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,300
One time to resist parents

320
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,100
Maybe I have already found myself through Li Xun

321
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,540
Then I want to tell you through this thing

322
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,060
I am such a Zhuyun

323
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,540
It's also a shout of myself

324
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,100
How do you understand

325
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,100
The relationship between Zhuyun and Li Xun

326
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,980
Still run towards each other

327
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,260
In the end, it's still running towards each other

328
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,260
I think the two of them are protecting each other

329
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,660
Warm each other

330
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,220
In fact, to some extent

331
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,100
I think Li Xun was inspired by Zhuyun

332
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,980
Yes, in this university four years

333
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,860
Still after Li Xun got out of prison

334
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,020
In fact, it was all inspired by Zhuyun

335
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,620
What do you think Zhuyun is

336
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,740
At first, let Li Xun feel warm

337
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,860
I can't say this

338
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,060
Because I think Zhuyun's love for Li Xun

339
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,700
He didn't design

340
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,780
It's all his subconsciousness

341
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,340
So there is no point

342
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,500
I think I will make him fall in love with me

343
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,860
How does Li Xun feel

344
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,260
Li Xun is warming him

345
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,060
I think Li Xun is warming Zhuyun

346
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,740
In fact, it's Zhuyun who finds himself

347
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,500
Zhuyun is like a tiger

348
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,140
There may be a layer of shell outside

349
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,020
But in the middle of it

350
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:27,380
There is a precious thing in it

351
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,140
No one is going to break the shell outside

352
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,340
I think it may be Li Xun who melted him

353
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,380
Let him know

354
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,580
I was like this

355
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,460
I can do this

356
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,380
That's what I want

357
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:38,860
Yes

358
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,620
So I think Li Xun melted Zhuyun

359
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,260
It's to let him find himself

360
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,700
It's not that

361
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,540
In one way, Zhuyun loves Li Xun

362
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,940
Or Li Xun loves Zhuyun

363
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,700
It must be

364
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,300
I give you

365
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,260
You also gave it back to me

366
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,740
We are each other

367
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,180
Yes, he can go down

368
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,340
You take it

369
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,260
Then I take it back

370
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:01,940
You can also

371
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,500
I'm here again

372
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,700
Take it back

373
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,660
We are in the new office

374
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,340
Your career has not started yet

375
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,620
It just started

376
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,060
Your career has just started

377
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,380
And the most important thing is

378
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,540
We are all here

379
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,540
You laugh

380
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,380
OK

381
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,660
What are you laughing at

382
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,180
I'm laughing

383
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,500
Wait

384
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,300
Give me a hug

385
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,140
Let's start from here

386
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:37,940
OK

387
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,340
Why are you suddenly like this

388
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,020
You want to let the child deal with you

389
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,020
It's none of your business

390
00:16:48,540 --> 00:17:05,460
Eliwa

391
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,660
I also met with the director

392
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,220
Go to the input

393
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,780
He didn't talk to you

394
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,260
A lot

395
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,860
It's about guidebooks or characters

396
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,380
But he played me a few songs

397
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:23,100
The theme of her song is not the slow and relaxing songs that everyone imagines

398
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,100
She played me a rock song

399
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,580
Instead, Li Xun played me a piano song

400
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,620
How does it feel to shoot a proposal scene on the street?

401
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,100
So this is what it feels like to propose on the street

402
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,660
Do you think rock music and piano songs are a match?

403
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,660
Very match

404
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,180
The two will collide

405
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,180
There must be something sparkly

406
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,700
So am I

407
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,220
So cute

408
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,820
I just woke up

409
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,380
Very cold

410
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,780
You can now start shooting

411
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,700
Don't be a good boy

412
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,380
I'm so happy

413
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,740
Did you get the points?

414
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,740
Yes

415
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,740
How do you call Jingyi?

416
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,740
I call her Jingyi

417
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,740
Sometimes I call her Zhu Yun

418
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,740
If it's Li Xun, I'll definitely call her Princess Zhu Yun

419
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,740
What's your lip-syncing?

420
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,740
I don't have a lip-syncing

421
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,740
Are you sure?

422
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,740
Yes

423
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,740
What's your lip-syncing?

424
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,740
My lip-syncing is...

425
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,740
Do you understand what I mean?

426
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,740
Do you understand what I mean?

427
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,740
Can you?

428
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,740
Really?

429
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,740
How can you?

430
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,740
I think your lip-syncing is...

431
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,740
You often say thank you

432
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,740
You say thank you to a lot of people

433
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,100
Thank you

434
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,100
You're so polite

435
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,100
Who is more childish?

436
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,100
I'll let you answer first

437
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,100
You

438
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,100
I'll let you answer first

439
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,100
Then you say it's me

440
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,100
I think the one who asks this question is the most childish

441
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,100
Yes, you are the most childish

442
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,260
A few weeks later

443
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,260
I feel very tired

444
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,260
Always too tired

445
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,220
It's really dark

446
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,400
250

447
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,280
300

448
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,800
Marinade

449
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,260
The fire is still here

450
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,260
On this step

451
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,440
It's not bad

452
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,380
Thorograeda

453
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,640
You are the department head

454
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,920
How many?

455
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,680
Now is a very mature age

456
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,800
Really?

457
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,600
Come on

458
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,280
Come on, eat it

459
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,720
Sit down

460
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,600
Don't eat

461
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,200
Then look at this environment

462
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,720
Come on, go

463
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,520
Go

464
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,720
It's scary, it's a gray color

465
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,400
Brother, you can come down

466
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,120
Ok

467
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,920
Go, go, go

468
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,840
I have to wear it

469
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,560
Ok

470
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,000
I'll give you a belt

471
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,240
Ok

472
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,080
Slightly south of the chin

473
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,040
Ok, smile

474
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,120
Clasp 1, 2, keep it

475
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,720
One more

476
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,360
Ok

477
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,520
Clasp

478
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,200
I see six teeth

479
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,720
Go, good

480
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,320
I see six teeth

481
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:27,880
Go, go

482
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,320
I'm sorry

483
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,840
Come on, come on, eat it

484
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,080
What are your feelings when you work with me?

485
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,600
Very happy

486
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,960
I think you are very serious

487
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,560
And then

488
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,960
What do you think

489
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,160
I think

490
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,960
It's ok, you say

491
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,760
I think I have learned a lot

492
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,840
And then take care of me

493
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,360
Thank you

494
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,800
Take care of me

495
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,000
Thank you very much

496
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:03,720
Really?

497
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,680
You just said it was true

498
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,240
Really

499
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:05,800
Really

500
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,440
Ok

501
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,720
Look here

502
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,880
Can you look at the world?

503
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,120
Yes

504
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,040
Welcome

505
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,480
Welcome

506
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,760
Please

507
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,400
Please

508
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,360
This way

509
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,320
How do you show

510
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:39,800
Who is it?

511
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,280
You two

512
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,080
You two

513
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:41,960
Let's sit down

514
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,840
You call me

515
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,640
I want you to draw the other person in your eyes

516
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,360
Ok

517
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,520
How is it when you know Chen Weiyun's drawing skill?

518
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,200
Not bad

519
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,400
How do you know?

520
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,240
You'll regret it later

521
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,160
What should I do?

522
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,560
I've drawn the big picture

523
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,800
I don't have a design

524
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,280
I'm so ugly

525
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,360
I'm sorry, I didn't draw well

526
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,160
Like this

527
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,120
Don't you think it's a bit like you?

528
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,680
Don't you think the me you drew is a little angry?

529
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,680
Do my eyebrows look like this?

530
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,880
It's thicker

531
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,640
And your feet are big

532
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,720
Your feet are big

533
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,120
Use a lighter

534
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,360
You look like me

535
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,920
At least the eyes are very similar

536
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,880
Because I usually

537
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,160
Because I usually

538
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,360
I usually draw pictures

539
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,560
I never draw people

540
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,400
So I'm not very good at drawing people

541
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,680
But I tried my best

542
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,000
I think the face shape is very good for you

543
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,720
Plus the hair is very big

544
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,880
And the eyes are like gods

545
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,360
The nose is very high and very straight

546
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,040
Right?

547
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,960
I tried my best

548
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,760
How many points did you give Jingyi?

549
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,640
60

550
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,920
Thank you

551
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,640
10 points for full marks

552
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,920
You give me a 60

553
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,440
Thank you

554
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,000
What did you give Jingyi?

555
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,320
Give Jingyi an 8

556
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,000
What about full marks?

557
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,760
100 points for full marks

558
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,400
What kind of gods do you think Fei Yu drew?

559
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,800
There are five points and hair

560
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,960
That's it?

561
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,960
Not bad

562
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,560
What kind of gods do you think she drew?

563
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,640
I think she drew my hair

564
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,400
Shoes

565
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,800
That's what I'm about to lose

566
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,680
That's hair

567
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:44,540
And the shoes are very

568
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,160
I didn't turn on the air conditioner

569
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,800
I'm going to wash my hair

570
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,640
Are you a little nervous?

571
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,800
Don't be nervous, it's okay

572
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,600
Hot, right?

573
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,320
Hot, hot

574
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,760
It's okay

575
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,720
Come on

576
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,280
Happy New Year

577
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,960

578
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,360
Go on

579
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,400
Go on

580
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,640
Happy New Year

581
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,400

582
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,400

Happy New Year

588
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,400
Why did you arrange it on this level?

589
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,400
Is this light good?

590
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,960
Happy New Year

591
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,360
Thank you

592
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,200
Just look at this

593
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,200
The one with C-shape

594
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,200
It's a chocolate

595
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
No headphones

596
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,200
No headphones

597
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,200
Ok, thank you

599
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,200
Thank you

600
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,200
Thank you

601
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,200
Wait, I haven't finished the next episode

602
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,200
The next episode

603
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
Are you all done?

604
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,200
Ok

605
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,200
Then you do it

606
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,200
Ok

607
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,200
Come on

608
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,200
Come with me

609
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,200
I'm tired

610
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,200
Come on, are you ready?

611
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,200
Give me 10 seconds

612
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,200
Ok

613
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,200
Ok, start

614
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,200
Done

615
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,200
You have to do it again

616
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,200
Then you do it again

617
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,200
Like a girl

618
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,200
I'll do it again

619
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,200
I'll do it again

620
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,200
Are you happy?

621
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,200
No

622
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,200
What do you hope for

623
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,200
If you can give Li Xuanhe another wish?

624
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,200
Maybe they

625
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,200
Will die one day

626
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,200
Thank you

627
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,200
