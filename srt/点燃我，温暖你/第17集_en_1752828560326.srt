00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't want to believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world breaks into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Even if the light is very white

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I want to be there

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless emotion

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day, the end is a little bit panicked

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am the light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast world?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I burn up the night just for you

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This is how everything looks like at first

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am the light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The wind is like a wild grass

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The mountain is broken, but you are still by my side

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Everything is how it looks at first

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The King of Blaze

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Episode 1

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Thank you for your help

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You are welcome

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I have invited many people today

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Come on

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I asked people to go to this crab shell

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This is very delicious

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Absolutely the best in Shanghai

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Come and try it

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Everyone has it

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Come on, this

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Share it

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Come over

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Is it delicious?

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Is it good?

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's not bad

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I think this restaurant is not bad

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
There is another one

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Take it

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Thank you

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Thank you

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Try another one

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Come on

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This one

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I am here to give you a gift

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Thank you very much

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Thank you

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You are welcome

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Thank you very much

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Thank you very much

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You are welcome

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You are Zhu Yun, right?

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I heard from Lao Gao

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You are also the main character of Nanhu University

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Let's add each other on WeChat

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Come on

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
A few days ago, Lao Gao showed me

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Your original code of the pumpkin app

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The original code is simple and accurate

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's a pity that you don't participate in this competition

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But I'm also angry at this competition

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What do you mean?

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Some players

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
For a competition

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's really worth it

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Are you talking about your senior?

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
He is a big star

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Wish to support

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Our school was spreading before

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
His mentor and sponsor have worked together

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Know their latest new office

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I got a few questions in advance

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Almost done

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll do a part for the students

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Sell â€‹â€‹a patent and prove the name

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I really don't admire it

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Rong Huo special attention award

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Fang Zhijing came on stage

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Press the crystal ball with me

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Your senior

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Is it the one we met on the stage today?

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Otherwise, it's him

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Fang Zhijing

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Who are you talking about?

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Junior

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Why don't you call me when you eat?

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
How can you have time to eat with us?

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Zhu Yue

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's really you

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I just remember you in Nanhu University

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
No, why are you here

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Don't you tell me

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Let me be an old classmate

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Good new year's fifth question

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What? Don't you recognize me?

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I am Fang Zhijing

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Long time no see, Fang Zhijing

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You also came to the competition

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I didn't see your name on the list

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You were eliminated

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
This is funny

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Everyone can make two apps

101
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Can't participate in the final

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Then you must be Li Xun

103
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Hello, my name is Fang Zhijing

104
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Your blue-clad love

105
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's really good

106
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
There will be some lags sometimes

107
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It would be better if it could be smoother

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But it doesn't matter

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
After all, you are the first

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's normal to have a little break

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
normal

112
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
After all, the sun is more than the fish

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The server needs to upgrade

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What a pity

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I can't be on the competition this time

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You are going to be on the next

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
OK, you eat first

118
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
By the way, old classmate

119
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Next time let our school

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Remember to tell me in advance

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Look at the way he is so aggressive

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You will kill me sooner or later

123
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yes, I'm here

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You can discuss it directly

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Ok, bye

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What's wrong, old classmate

127
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Is there anything else

128
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
If there is nothing, I will go first

129
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Let's meet another day

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Do you remember Xiao Yan

131
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Of course

132
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I went to see him on the tombstone

133
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
during the New Year this year

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's been so long

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I hope he is doing well in the field

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Dear, I'm here

137
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Let me introduce you

138
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
My old classmate, Zhu Yue

139
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
This is my girlfriend, Wu Yuxian

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Hello, old classmate

141
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Let's eat

142
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Let's eat

143
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm waiting for you

144
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's ok

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Don't talk about the forum

146
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
There is a process of the competition

147
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
What is the process

148
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I wasn't interested in this forum

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But our project group

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Co-operated with the sponsor of this competition

151
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So they invited me to participate

152
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
in this event

153
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I will win the first prize

154
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
in this competition

155
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Ok, stop talking

156
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Goodbye, old classmate

157
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What are you talking about

158
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's ok, they don't want me

159
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You have to be careful

160
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Zhu Yue

161
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Where did you go

162
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What happened

163
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Let's go

164
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Let's go

165
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Let's go

166
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Let's go

167
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Let's go

168
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Say it

169
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Let's go

170
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Let's participate in the competition

171
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
For you

172
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It must be a little bit of a mistake

173
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
As long as you

174
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
take it a little bit back

175
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Winning the competition is too hard for me

176
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Why should I waste time

177
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Doing things like a small dish

178
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yuxuan

179
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Let's participate in the competition together

180
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I think you should go

181
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Why did you change your mind

182
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I just want to participate

183
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Tell me the reason

184
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Tell me the reason

185
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Tell me the reason

186
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Really don't participate

187
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
No

188
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I don't think I can do it

189
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I can't

190
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Can't you stand her either

191
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Why are you so cold-hearted

192
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
No, no

193
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But it's normal

194
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Women can't keep up with her

195
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I tell you, this is normal

196
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What's normal

197
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I tell you

198
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I asked him to help me before

199
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Make a music synthesizer software

200
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
This big brother

201
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I haven't been free for a month

202
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Later I paid him

203
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
He did business for me

204
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
He must be

205
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I want to start my own company

206
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
He is

207
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's not easy to believe others

208
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm sure I won't accept investment easily

209
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So I need to save money myself

210
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
As for

211
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I just want to participate in the competition

212
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I just don't want that bastard to succeed

213
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I can't let him win the first place

214
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Who

215
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Fang Zhijing

216
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
When I was in high school

217
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
My best friend was called Liu Xiaoyan

218
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
When I was in high school

219
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Xiaoyan and a senior walked very close

220
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
He only told me about this

221
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You've drawn it

222
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Where are you going without ice cream?

223
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Who cares?

224
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
No way

225
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
What if someone takes it away?

226
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
He loves vanilla flavor

227
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
He, he, he

228
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Who is he?

229
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Here

230
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I left it for you

231
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Vanilla flavor

232
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Thank you

233
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I haven't finished my homework

234
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm leaving now

235
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Bye bye

236
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Bye bye

237
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The last one

238
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's not easy to find

239
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I said

240
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
We are only together

241
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It was also on that day

242
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Liu Xiaoyan and Fang Zhijing

243
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Secretly dating

244
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It was exposed in the school forum

245
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What's wrong?

246
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Someone posted it in the school forum

247
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I found it

248
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
IP address is our school's address

249
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Our school's people

250
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's all about the people in the school

251
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Or we can say

252
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
We go home

253
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And then my bike broke down

254
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Are you a teacher?

255
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
How can I save my money

256
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
when this kind of thing happens?

257
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
If it weren't for you

258
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
There wouldn't be this kind of bad thing

259
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Fang Zhijing was in the school for two consecutive years

260
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
He was elected to the third position

261
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
If he is elected again

262
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
He can directly send Xing Ke to college

263
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
But the photo

264
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Let Fang Zhijing

265
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
In the school

266
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Received criticism

267
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Fang Zhijing for the sake of sending the quota

268
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
In fact, he made a decision

269
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
He posted the chat information of him and Xiaoyan

270
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
All the responsibilities

271
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
He gave it to Xiaoyan

272
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
At the same time

273
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Xiaoyan became a place of importance

274
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
This is the place

275
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
He has a face

276
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It's him

277
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
What does he look like?

278
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Xiaoyan

279
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You put your QQ chat

280
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
of Xiaoyan

281
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Out of the blue

282
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
What do you mean?

283
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Which eye of yours

284
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Did you see me post it?

285
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Besides, is it related to you?

286
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
But that's not the truth

287
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's you who entangled Xiaoyan

288
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Entangled?

289
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
When did I entangle her?

290
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Xiaoyan is so good to you

291
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You hurt her like this

292
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
If she is really good to me

293
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
What if she sacrifices for me?

294
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Xiaoyan is very sad now

295
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You go see her

296
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It's really not appropriate now

297
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm going to find her now

298
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
What others see

299
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I really can't say it clearly

300
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Then she will sacrifice for nothing

301
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Then at least comfort her

302
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I said we have no

303
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Any relationship

304
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Don't come to help me in the future

305
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Fang Zhijin

306
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
What?

307
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
The statement came out

308
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Fang Zhijin rejected her

309
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
She still loves him

310
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Xiaoyan lived in the dark

311
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
after that day

312
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Fang Zhijin is still

313
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
A good student in everyone's eyes

314
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Xiaoyan became silent

315
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Until one day

316
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Zhou Yue, it's here

317
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Xiaoyan took the sleeping pills

318
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
How is it?

319
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I don't know, it's still in there

320
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Liu Xiaoyan's family

321
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
What's going on?

322
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm that Xiaoyan's mother

323
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
The patient's central nervous system

324
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Received a large amount of sleeping pills

325
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
The brain is too long

326
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Already brain death

327
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Brain death

328
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
No longer

329
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
The meaning of rescue

330
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
How come

331
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Xiaoyan

332
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Xiaoyan

333
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Xiaoyan

334
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Xiaoyan

335
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Xiaoyan

336
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I

337
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Xiaoyan

338
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Xiaoyan

339
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
My child

340
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Fang Zhijin

341
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
My child

342
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
My child

343
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
My child

344
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
What are you doing?

345
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You are so shameless

346
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You know that

347
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Xiaoyan is very shy

348
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
She is a joke to everyone

349
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But she still cares about your feelings

350
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You

351
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
For a treasure

352
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You turned it upside down

353
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And let her be ruined by everyone

354
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Do you have a conscience?

355
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Did I let her eat the medicine?

356
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It's obviously her own heart

357
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
There is a problem

358
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Is it my fault?

359
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I heard her accident

360
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I rushed to the hospital immediately

361
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Am I enough to recognize her?

362
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
She committed suicide because of you

363
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You caused her to

364
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Zhiyue

365
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Does she have anything to do with me?

366
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You can't talk nonsense

367
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
In the fairy tale world

368
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
All the bad guys won't end well

369
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
But we don't live in

370
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
The fairy tale world

371
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
All the bad guys live well

372
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Business is good, love is sweet

373
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It seems that nothing has happened

374
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
No sense of guilt at all

375
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Why?

376
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Good people don't kill

377
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
The disaster lasts a thousand years

378
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
The result is everything

379
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I can't let her

380
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Stand on the stage and talk about her

381
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I can't let her

382
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Stand on the stage and talk about her

383
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I can't let her

384
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Stand on the stage and talk about her

385
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I can't let her

386
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Stand on the stage and talk about her

387
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I can't let her

388
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Stand on the stage and talk about her

389
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I can't let her

390
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Why are you looking for me all of a sudden?

391
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So serious

392
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Lao Gao

393
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I want to join with you

394
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Information security contest

395
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Ok

396
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Didn't you say before

397
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I changed my mind

398
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Ok

399
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Others are all team competitions

400
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
To be honest

401
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I have no bottom in my heart

402
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I was going to find someone to help

403
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Then should I sign up again?

404
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
No need

405
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'll just add your name

406
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'll send you the progress of the project later

407
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Ok

408
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Zhu Yu

409
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Why do you suddenly want to

410
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Join the contest with me?

411
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I want to get the first place

412
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Ok

413
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I'm going to find Mr. Lin now

414
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Let's go together

415
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Go

416
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Look

417
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You did a good job

418
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Why are you panicking?

419
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Do you think it's ok?

420
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's great

421
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
This is the list of all schools entering the final

422
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I printed it out

423
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Take a look

424
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Teacher, you have seen it

425
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Help us analyze the opponent

426
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
What to analyze?

427
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
The one with the ability of computer science

428
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Just a few complaints

429
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And some complaints from the national defense

430
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Nothing to analyze

431
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Remember one sentence

432
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Power is the real chapter

433
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You see for yourself

434
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Power

435
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
There is a group of people in the department of personality

436
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Very powerful

437
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
They have a practical one

438
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I guess they can win more awards

439
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And sell their patents

440
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Is it Fang Zhijing?

441
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
What is their competition theme?

442
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Mr. Lin, the meeting is about to start

443
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Coming

444
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Don't forget to close the door when you leave

445
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
USB smart encryption interface

446
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Fang Zhijing's

447
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Smart USB encryption

448
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Quite practical

449
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
If you do it well

450
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Apply for a patent

451
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
No business will come to rob you

452
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
What's wrong?

453
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Nothing

454
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Our one is not bad

455
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
If you do it well

456
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's competitive

457
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Gao

458
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Let's go to Li Xun

459
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Why do you mention him suddenly?

460
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
He is not interested

461
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I will persuade him

462
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
We can do it

463
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You want to be the first, right?

464
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
If it's Li Xun, we will win

465
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
You are so confident in yourself?

466
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
No

467
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Just the actual results of the final

468
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Or I'm not confident

469
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I don't mean that

470
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Whatever

471
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
You ask yourself

472
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
You should consider another aspect

473
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Defense

474
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
7-file ARPU attacks

475
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
This kind of attack is always

476
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
disguised as

477
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
a network official

478
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
or a certain main base in the network

479
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So you have to deploy some monitoring devices

480
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
in the network

481
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Monitoring fake ARPU data package

482
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
and then

483
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
check the ARPU attacker

484
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
according to the fake ARPU data center

485
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
and fake mic address

486
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Then you can

487
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
punish the attacker

488
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
with a punishment

489
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Then you can punish the attacker

490
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
The first attack

491
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
is a fake ARPU

492
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
The second attack

493
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
is a fake mic

494
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
The third attack

495
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
is a fake mic

496
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
The fourth attack

497
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
is a fake mic

498
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
The fifth attack

499
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
is a fake mic

500
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
The sixth attack

501
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
is a fake mic

502
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
The seventh attack

503
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
is a fake mic

504
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
The seventh attack

505
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
is a fake mic

506
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
The seventh attack

507
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
is a fake mic

508
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
The seventh attack

509
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
is a fake mic

510
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
The seventh attack

511
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
is a fake mic

512
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
The seventh attack

513
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
is a fake mic

514
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
The seventh attack

515
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
is a fake mic

516
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
The seventh attack

517
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,720
Royal Yogaer

518
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,160
The bad alpha arp airlines

519
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:15,700
will

520
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,000
have no agings

521
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
so they can harass our defense movement

522
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,660
I need to do something

523
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,900
I'm...

524
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,100
I...

525
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,660
It's okay.

526
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,420
Can you make the USP device

527
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,580
a sm compositional multi-access port?

528
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:40,740
What?

529
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,060
Can you make

530
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:42,820
the USP device a ...

531
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:47,820
..m eins

532
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,020
It's been a while. What's on your mind?

533
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,020
What's on your mind?

534
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,620
If it's just to achieve the function,

535
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,820
find a single chip machine to make the main processor

536
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,620
and then make an interface chip.

537
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,700
The hardware is not very familiar.

538
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,980
It may take a while.

539
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,860
The software is very simple.

540
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,860
Just deal with the interface components

541
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,140
and the secret management.

542
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,540
Is it difficult?

543
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,300
What's wrong?

544
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,380
The princess is going to borrow the foreign package from the base?

545
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,060
You're good.

546
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,980
You know how to find work for yourself.

547
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,820
Speaking of money,

548
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,220
don't buy the software.

549
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,460
We can't afford it.

550
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,140
How long will it take?

551
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,620
The number of days depends on the price.

552
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,860
What if the price makes you very, very satisfied?

553
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,020
It depends on the requirements.

554
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,580
My requirements are very, very high.

555
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,380
There are so many encryption methods in the world.

556
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,860
Different kinds of frequencies.

557
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:40,860
High-level encryption

558
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,100
can be developed for a long time.

559
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,300
But if it's just to achieve

560
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,580
the function of encrypting the interface,

561
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:47,980
it won't take long.

562
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,260
What's wrong?

563
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,660
These are all common problems.

564
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,100
Why do you ask me?

565
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,060
100,000 yuan.

566
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,260
Not enough.

567
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,340
I mean the deposit.

568
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,660
Don't pretend to be steady.

569
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,740
I know your little difficulties.

570
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,300
Princess.

571
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,580
You don't even have a tenth of the deposit in the card.

572
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,460
What do you give me?

573
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,940
So I'm talking about the deposit.

574
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,540
I'll give you a bill.

575
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,860
The rest of the money,

576
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,420
I save it in the card every month.

577
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,220
I try to save 2,000 yuan every month.

578
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,500
Two, five, ten.

579
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,900
Five months is ten thousand.

580
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,700
Fifty months is one hundred thousand.

581
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,020
If you keep going, you will earn a lot.

582
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:49,940
How about it?

583
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,900
Fifty months?

584
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,540
You want me to wait for him to come?

585
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,460
You want to spend 100,000 yuan

586
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,540
to let me make a USB encryption for you?

587
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,140
No.

588
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,300
This is someone else's guess project.

589
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,340
Everyone is very optimistic about it.

590
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,100
I think you should be more serious.

591
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,100
I want you to take part in the competition with me

592
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,340
and defeat this project.

593
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,860
As long as you sign, we will be friends.

594
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,820
After returning the deposit,

595
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,620
I will leave the salary card with you.

596
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,100
I'll work for you in vain in the future.

597
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,780
Is that okay?

598
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,700
Serious?

599
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,100
Serious.

600
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,700
It's done.

601
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,180
It's done.

602
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:34,820
It's done.

603
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,500
It's done.

604
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,300
I made it.

605
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,380
Zhou Yue, come here.

606
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,660
I made it.

607
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,060
I did a lot of tests.

608
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,820
Whether it's a red flag attack or a fraud attack,

609
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,220
it will be monitored by the system.

610
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,860
And it will automatically isolate the LRP attack source.

611
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,220
It will not affect the normal communication between the host.

612
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,340
You're great, Gao.

613
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,420
If nothing happens,

614
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,820
at least I can win a prize in this competition.

615
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,860
The first prize is not impossible.

616
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,820
Really?

617
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,060
I don't think so.

618
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,180
I think it's possible.

619
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,340
I think it's possible.

620
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,380
But it's impossible.

621
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,380
Really?

622
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,900
Gao, count me in.

623
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,980
Give me a copy of the code.

624
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,060
Judges.

625
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,780
Did I invite you here?

626
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,580
This is my project.

627
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,100
Gao.

628
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:22,860
Didn't we say

629
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,300
we would find Li Xun?

630
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,380
It was before.

631
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,220
Now the project has advanced to this point.

632
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,780
Zhou Yue, have you asked me?

633
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,660
Have you discussed with me?

634
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,820
You made your own decision.

635
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,460
How can I say it?

636
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,540
Who is he?

637
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,460
He's great.

638
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,780
But I don't need him.

639
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,460
What's going on?

640
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,740
Who launched the attack?

641
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,740
I'll check it.

642
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,340
Stop checking.

643
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,540
A red flag attack

644
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,580
will generate a large number of false hardware addresses

645
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,580
on the Internet.

646
00:30:59,220 --> 00:30:59,980
Therefore,

647
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:00,780
you adopted

648
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,700
the strategy of setting up the intercom port

649
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,260
to defend it.

650
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,260
The fraud attack

651
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,700
will disguise as a network official

652
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,660
or a certain host on the Internet.

653
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,140
You chose to deploy some monitoring points

654
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,540
on the Internet

655
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,420
to check the fake ARP data package.

656
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,940
According to the fake MAC address

657
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,180
in the fake ARP data,

658
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,740
check the ARP attacker.

659
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,140
Finally,

660
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,020
deal with the attacker.

661
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,740
It's a complicated idea.

662
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,340
But you're capable of it.

663
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,860
Therefore,

664
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,620
the system has been leaked

665
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,180
from the design of the architecture

666
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,780
to the code.

667
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,980
I just used less than 20 codes

668
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,100
to break through your defense system.

669
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,700
I passed the preliminary round.

670
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,300
The preliminary round is based on the concept.

671
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,460
The final round is the real battle.

672
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,660
You've been doing this for a month

673
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,140
without any result.

674
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,020
You want to get the first prize?

675
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,580
Do you think the judges are jealous?

676
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,300
What do you want?

677
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,500
I want to get the first prize for you.

678
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,620
I don't need it.

679
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,340
You can only win

680
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,260
if you follow me.

681
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,580
So busy and in a hurry

682
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:38,780
Your wife

683
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,540
My wife

684
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,700
He was too panic

685
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,300
will win the competition?

686
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,300
It's possible for anyone to win

687
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,380
and it's possible for them to fail.

688
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,060
I mean

689
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,420
don't put too much pressure on yourself.

690
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,940
You're the first.

691
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,700
You'll have a lot of chances in the future.

692
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,780
Every semester and every year

693
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,020
there are various activities.

694
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,420
You can participate in them.

695
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,940
There will be

696
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,660
regional and regional awards.

697
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,060
You'll have a chance to train.

698
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,780
So, Mr. Yi,

699
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,860
I can't do it without him, right?

700
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,300
Mr. Qian, you...

701
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,100
I'll tell you

702
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,940
my own experience.

703
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,260
I'm the first one in our country

704
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,540
to learn this.

705
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,260
I remember the first time I got a computer,

706
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,740
I was so excited

707
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,860
like I was possessed.

708
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,140
I didn't sleep all night.

709
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,140
So my grades

710
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,820
were also the top in class.

711
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,980
I was in school when I graduated.

712
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,540
I was in school when I graduated.

713
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,420
My classmates were jealous of me

714
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,460
and jealous of me.

715
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,780
They said I was the best way out.

716
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,660
Some classmates who were not as good as me

717
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,660
went to the village later.

718
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,860
For years,

719
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,700
they became the leaders

720
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,460
in IT.

721
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,780
Now, compared to them,

722
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,980
who's the better way out?

723
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,460
Who wins? Who loses?

724
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,300
Who's the higher? Who's the lower?

725
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,940
Jiang Hu,

726
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,980
there's a long way in life.

727
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,380
Don't get yourself involved

728
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,220
in a moment of defeat

729
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:31,700
or confusion.

730
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,060
One day,

731
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,140
I'll let you know

732
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,140
that I'll be better

733
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,540
without him.

734
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,180
Don't waste time.

735
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,500
Tell me how to fix it.

736
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,900
What's your opinion?

737
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,540
I'll just say it.

738
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,980
I'll rewrite it.

739
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,060
You don't need to rewrite it.

740
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,180
If there's anything wrong,

741
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,300
you can do it again.

742
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,740
I must rewrite it.

743
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,820
There's no time.

744
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,900
Your program

745
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,300
is like swimming in a cotton coat.

746
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,540
You can't feel anything at first.

747
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,780
The longer you wait, the more you'll die.

748
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,740
It'll be too late.

749
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,860
I've deleted the previous one.

750
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,700
Rewrite it.

751
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,020
Okay.

752
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:18,820
Gao.

753
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,500
Are you okay?

754
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:21,940
I'm fine.

755
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,940
You want to win, so do I.

756
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,140
He can help us win.

757
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,500
That's great, isn't it?

758
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,060
I've been working late.

759
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,020
I'm a little tired.

760
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,140
I want to go home and rest.

761
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,900
You should go home and rest too.

762
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,580
Go home and rest.

763
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,860
I don't have time to rest.

764
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,580
Li Xun.

765
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,460
You should be nice to Gao.

766
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,820
Am I not nice to him?

767
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,580
He's the leader.

768
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,620
He's the leader.

769
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,820
I'm not nice to him.

770
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,020
I'm not nice to him.

771
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,140
I'm not nice to him.

772
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,180
I'm not nice to him.

773
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,220
I'm not nice to him.

774
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,340
I'm not nice to him.

775
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,940
He's the leader.

776
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,140
He was the one who said that

777
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,500
when we were competing.

778
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,100
Enough.

779
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,660
What are you doing?

780
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,260
Sleeping.

781
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,660
What's this?

782
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,100
You don't know about it?

783
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,100
If you keep sleeping,

784
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,140
it's possible.

785
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,940
Who's more patient?

786
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,380
Can people compete with each other?

787
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:49,940
Come here.

788
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,660
Come here.

789
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,180
Sleep.

790
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,340
Why are you staring at me?

791
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,100
Close your eyes and sleep.

792
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,140
How can I sleep

793
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,420
in your room?

794
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,300
It's given by two men.

795
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,220
Are you still awake?

796
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,380
It's a plan,

797
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:42,900
you can leave it out.

798
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:45,860
The fewer time you have,

799
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,220
the sooner it comes to a plan.

800
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,220
I don't know.

801
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,220
Weixuan.

802
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,220
You must win.

803
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,220
You must win.

804
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,220
Don't worry.

805
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,220
A man's money, a woman's filial piety.

806
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,220
I'm not afraid of anything.

807
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,220
After the competition,

808
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,220
you can do anything for me.

809
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,220
Okay.

810
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,220
You can do anything you want.

811
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:10,220
Write down the words and the words.

812
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,220
But you have one of them.

813
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,220
You said it yourself.

814
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,220
After the competition,

815
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,220
you can do anything for me.

816
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,220
Okay?

817
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,220
What does this mean?

818
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,220
When you save enough money,

819
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,220
let me wait for a few fifty months.

820
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,220
This is enough.

821
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:37,220
You are over there.

822
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:40,220
It's the intuition of the dream.

823
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,220
Breaking the boundary.

824
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,220
A night of rain.

825
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,220
A full moon.

826
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,220
Weixuan.

827
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,220
I'm serious.

828
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,220
No matter what you want to do in the future,

829
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:05,220
you can put me in it.

830
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,220
I'm not kidding.

831
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,220
I'm serious.

832
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:31,220
I know.

833
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:04,220
I will take his course.

834
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:08,220
The burning fire.

835
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:17,220
You are always the one to watch.

836
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:33,220
You made this tofu with ananthelm.

837
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,220
It's a fair insult to the competition.

838
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,220
Are you really sure?

839
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,220
How can you use such a lowly man?

840
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,220
You have to be responsible when you talk.

841
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,220
But why are you doing this?

842
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,220
Because...

843
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:57,220
I want to stand by your side.

844
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,220
Just be brave.

845
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:03,220
Every dream I have.

846
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:10,220
I won't lose to time again.

847
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:15,220
Because I believe I love you.

848
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:19,220
True love will take its course.

849
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:23,220
When I'm by your side.

850
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:28,220
I'll spend the whole time with you.

851
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:32,220
Because I believe I want you.

852
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:37,220
True love will take its course.

853
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:41,220
The burning fire.

854
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:51,220
You are always the one to watch.

855
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:57,220
Because I believe I love you.

856
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:01,220
True love will take its course.

857
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:05,220
When I'm by your side.

858
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:10,220
I'll spend the whole time with you.

859
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:14,220
Because I believe I want you.

860
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:19,220
True love will take its course.

861
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:23,220
The burning fire.

862
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:32,220
You are always the one to watch.

863
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:41,220
The burning fire.

864
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:47,220
You are always the one to watch.

865
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:52,220
To watch.
