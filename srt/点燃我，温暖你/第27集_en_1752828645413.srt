00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if the light is very bright

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will still watch over that vast vast land

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless atmosphere

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day, the lens is a little bit yellow

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast night?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I burn up the night just for you to remember

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How everything was in the beginning

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The wind and the color of the night sky are like wild grass

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The mountains are broken, but you are still by my side

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Everything is how it was in the beginning

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Who is that?

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
No one

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Give me a piece of earth

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yellow

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yellow

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I think the main painting can be

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I think the base color is a little bit

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Look

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yes

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Morning

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Morning

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Give you

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Thank you

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Where is painting

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,880
It's done

64
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,560
Thank you

65
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,240
This is just the draft

66
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,000
You take it to see

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,360
Can this creative be used

68
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,280
There are many details

69
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,200
I didn't do it

70
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,040
Ok thank you

71
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,680
This is a new toothbrush and towel

72
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,760
You take it to wash

73
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,160
After I finish breakfast

74
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,120
After I finish eating with you

75
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,160
I'll send you to work

76
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,080
No need, I'll go by myself

77
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:42,600
Morning

78
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,480
no

79
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,120
no

80
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,040
think it should be

81
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,840
Except You

82
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,360
Too weird

83
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:50,880
no

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,680
This one.

85
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,680
This one.

86
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,200
This...

87
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,680
This is you.

88
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:02,920
I got it wrong.

89
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,720
I got it wrong.

90
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,960
This one.

91
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,560
Amazing.

92
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,080
This painting...

93
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,360
This painting is made of...

94
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,040
It's visual effect.

95
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,640
It's not the view of the first-person view.

96
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,680
Group leader.

97
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,680
Who is this teacher?

98
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,440
Can you take me to meet him?

99
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,120
I must ask him for advice.

100
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,680
Wait.

101
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,520
Tell me first.

102
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,760
How much did you spend on this painting?

103
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,720
It's okay.

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,600
Then you should hire him.

105
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,240
What are you waiting for?

106
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,120
Yes, hire him.

107
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,200
I'll give him the position of art director.

108
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,640
You're quite ungrateful.

109
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,720
Mr. Tian Xiu Zhu helped me to draw this painting.

110
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,520
Mr. Tian?

111
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,480
Wait.

112
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,400
Mr. Tian's painting is more invested than our project.

113
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,480
How did you get it?

114
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,360
Group leader.

115
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,040
I think our company is indebted to you.

116
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,280
Where is Li Xun?

117
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:05,880
Amazing.

118
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,080
Li Xun, where are you?

119
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,680
You should come and see Mr. Tian's painting.

120
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,520
You should give some advice.

121
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,480
Really, it's amazing.

122
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,120
I've never seen such a good painting.

123
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,360
What's wrong with him?

124
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,400
He's angry.

125
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,280
I don't know.

126
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,480
Zhu, he's jealous.

127
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,360
The standard of this poster is enough, right?

128
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,880
There's also publicity.

129
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,720
The promotion fee is definitely not enough.

130
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,680
Who told you money is not enough?

131
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,280
How can my company be short of money?

132
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,400
Zhang Fang, come in.

133
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,800
Chen.

134
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,200
Why is the whole cost not enough?

135
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,200
How can my company be short of money?

136
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,120
Mr. Dong.

137
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,560
I've already paid every penny

138
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,480
on the day of the painting.

139
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,040
Look.

140
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,240
Now we have the account account.

141
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,360
I can move the money.

142
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,600
And 70,000 yuan, 50,000 yuan, 50,000 yuan,

143
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,280
I'm going to put them all on the promotion.

144
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,160
Absolutely enough.

145
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,240
Absolutely enough.

146
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,680
Absolutely.

147
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,480
Did you hear that?

148
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,480
Hello.

149
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,160
Hello.

150
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,640
The president's car, Weining Fu.

151
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,800
Mr. Dong, what should we do?

152
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,440
Get out.

153
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,320
Mr. Dong, I'll be right there.

154
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,640
Okay.

155
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,520
Mr. Dong.

156
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,080
I'll find you a promotion fee.

157
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,280
Why are you pulling me?

158
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,040
Mr. Dong is also a man of dignity.

159
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,120
You can't leave him outside.

160
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,440
I'm the company's financial.

161
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,240
I know the situation of the company

162
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,320
better than you do.

163
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,920
The company has been losing money

164
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,360
since it was founded.

165
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,040
Now it's really not the number you want.

166
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,440
Then take my salary.

167
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,000
Stop it.

168
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,760
I'm serious.

169
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,960
I'm serious, too.

170
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,680
First of all, your company is very sad.

171
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,840
Second, even if you have this passion,

172
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,840
Mr. Dong won't agree.

173
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,560
He doesn't agree.

174
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,480
He said if a company

175
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,960
can only be maintained

176
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,200
by reducing employee salaries,

177
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,920
then there is no need for the company to be in debt.

178
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,360
Dong Siyang said that?

179
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,400
It's just my opinion.

180
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,000
I've also thought about it.

181
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,240
But the problem is that

182
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,000
there is only a little promotion fee now.

183
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,560
How can we do the following promotion?

184
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,400
Look, I think

185
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,760
we should spend our limited money

186
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,320
on the day.

187
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,720
Wait until the day comes

188
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,040
to smash all the money

189
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,760
into the data.

190
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,280
Data?

191
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:34,600
Yes.

192
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,720
We can tie it up at once.

193
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,800
You can find a big amount of money.

194
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,640
There will be other ways to influence it later.

195
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,520
Otherwise, it's useless.

196
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,160
We don't need to

197
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,160
make a data-sharing agreement.

198
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,000
You and I are worried about the salary.

199
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,640
Think of a way.

200
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,680
He rejected me at once.

201
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,480
What kind of employee is this?

202
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,280
You should find a way to solve the problem.

203
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
Hello, Xiu Zhu.

204
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,480
I'll be right out.

205
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,600
This is a brother.

206
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,680
He's really a man of his word.

207
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,680
Xiu Zhu.

208
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,720
Your charger.

209
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
It's all foggy.

210
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,120
I was just looking for it.

211
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,360
That's because you worked hard.

212
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,120
I'm sorry to wake you up.

213
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,480
By the way,

214
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,960
when did you draw that picture of me?

215
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,480
Last night.

216
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,840
I drew it casually.

217
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,240
You didn't tell me even if you drew it.

218
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,960
I thought you just drew a poster

219
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,840
and made a mess.

220
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,840
There's no misunderstanding, right?

221
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,440
No.

222
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,720
When I saw you sleeping last night,

223
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,880
I suddenly remembered

224
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,400
that we've known each other for so long.

225
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,800
I've never changed your clothes.

226
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,680
But,

227
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
remember,

228
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,240
no matter how tired you are,

229
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,440
you should sleep well.

230
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,920
Thanks.

231
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,640
Why did you write it?

232
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,800
The idea of your poster

233
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,720
is his idea.

234
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,560
Ah?

235
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,800
Someone posted a poster

236
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,480
in front of my unit's wallpaper.

237
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,880
I was inspired by that.

238
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,480
Otherwise,

239
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,000
I wouldn't finish work so soon.

240
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,360
Come in.

241
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,960
I was wondering why Xiu Zhu

242
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,840
changed the project's soul so soon.

243
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,280
So it's not the truth.

244
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,320
Sorry to bother you.

245
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,120
But how do you know where I live

246
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,360
and his license plate number?

247
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,760
You pressed the doorbell yesterday.

248
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,440
You asked me?

249
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,960
Do you want to know about the promotion?

250
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,000
But I don't have much money now.

251
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,760
Find a painter.

252
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,200
He likes you.

253
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,360
He's willing to help you in any way.

254
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,960
What are you embarrassed about?

255
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,880
You really don't choose.

256
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,320
What do you mean?

257
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,280
It seems that Miss Zhu

258
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,280
has a bad taste in choosing men.

259
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,560
I think you're almost done.

260
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,640
She's chasing you or you're chasing her?

261
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,360
I said you're almost done.

262
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,880
Are you jealous?

263
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,000
Why are you still so narcissistic?

264
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,360
Did you confess to her?

265
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,120
You didn't seduce yourself, did you?

266
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:51,960
You don't have to

267
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,560
insult others so cruelly.

268
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,440
I'm with her, so what?

269
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,400
I owe you.

270
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,800
I did like you.

271
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,680
So what?

272
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,960
You can ask on the street.

273
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,840
Who still remembers the person

274
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,760
who loved me when I was 18?

275
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:05,960
You...

276
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,600
You fell in love with me when you were in the first grade.

277
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,080
But I didn't feel anything

278
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,960
about you at that time.

279
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,800
Keep pretending.

280
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,760
I only remember

281
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,360
that someone always sat beside me.

282
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,920
From the beginning of the class,

283
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,160
I kept staring at the class until the end.

284
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,920
I drew the schedule on the class

285
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,560
to raise my baby and take it away.

286
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,600
Tell me who that is.

287
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,240
I'm not a child anymore.

288
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,240
I'm not a child anymore.

289
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,240
I'm not a child anymore.

290
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,240
I'm not a child anymore.

291
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,240
I'm not a child anymore.

292
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,240
I'm not a child anymore.

293
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
I still remember

294
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,000
someone secretly ate my meal

295
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,280
in the cafeteria

296
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,480
just to recognize me.

297
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,880
The last class in the program was always the last one to go.

298
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,080
It was to watch me do my homework.

299
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,800
It cost me hundreds of yuan to do my hair

300
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,240
to confess to me.

301
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,200
I was afraid that I would be taken away.

302
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,800
The funniest thing is

303
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,800
someone loves to say these childish words.

304
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,720
You choose me.

305
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,560
I will never betray you.

306
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,000
You should have said that.

307
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,960
If you were me,

308
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,920
you would have been in trouble.

309
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,920
You are really too much today.

310
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,720
You are not a bad girl.

311
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,560
Think about it.

312
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,840
With your condition,

313
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,360
if you were not protected by others,

314
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,800
you wouldn't be able to find a job

315
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,560
and read books here.

316
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,200
Isn't that what others do?

317
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,920
You are not a good girl.

318
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
You are not a good girl.

319
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
You are not a good girl.

320
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,920
You are not a good girl.

321
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,040
You don't know these things.

322
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,080
You just need to buy a new card

323
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,760
and get a salary from us.

324
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,040
You are right.

325
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,840
If someone gives me a piece of silkworm,

326
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,080
I will just cut off his head.

327
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,280
Stop talking nonsense.

328
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,560
You are forced to do your work.

329
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,680
If you get angry with him,

330
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,280
you will be doomed.

331
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,400
They don't know that I live with him.

332
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,520
You want to get back together with him?

333
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,720
I know he trusts me.

334
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,760
He trusts me so much.

335
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,200
to hurt her.

336
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,640
So you did it on purpose?

337
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,080
I know how to hurt her.

338
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,760
Why?

339
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,440
I think if she goes back a little bit,

340
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,520
I can't give her more hope.

341
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,800
You don't want to give her hope

342
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,400
or yourself?

343
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,160
You can just forget the past

344
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,400
and you'll feel better.

345
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,680
You're still so naive.

346
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,000
I'll ask you one thing.

347
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,640
Do you still like her?

348
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,080
No.

349
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,640
Then just be an ordinary colleague.

350
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,120
You're so weird.

351
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,760
Since you don't like her,

352
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,840
why do you care about her and that painter?

353
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,200
Do you have to do this?

354
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,600
I really have no words

355
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,480
for you in this regard.

356
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,480
She worked so hard to help you

357
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
and she was scolded by you.

358
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,600
How can you be satisfied with her?

359
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,120
Ren Di is right.

360
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,720
I'm a jerk who doesn't care about anyone.

361
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,920
I'm not a jerk.

362
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,920
I'm just a jerk.

363
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,920
I'm just a jerk.

364
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,920
I'm just a jerk.

365
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,920
I'm just a jerk.

366
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,920
I'm just a jerk.

367
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,920
I'm just a jerk.

368
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
I'm just a jerk.

369
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,920
I'm just a jerk.

370
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,920
I'm just a jerk.

371
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,920
I'm just a jerk.

372
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,920
I'm just a jerk.

373
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,920
I'm just a jerk.

374
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,920
I'm just a jerk.

375
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,920
I'm just a jerk.

376
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,920
I'm just a jerk.

377
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,920
I'm just a jerk.

378
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,920
I'm just a jerk.

379
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,920
I'm just a jerk.

380
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,920
I'm just a jerk.

381
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,920
I'm just a jerk.

382
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,920
I'm just a jerk.

383
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,920

I'm just a jerk.

442
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
I'm just a jerk.

443
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:02,920
Just like the shoulder you once gave me.

444
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,920
There are some bad things that can't be told.

445
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:14,920
I have to learn to forget.

446
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:32,920
I have to learn to forget.

447
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,920
I have to learn to forget.

448
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,920
I have to learn to forget.

449

I have to learn to forget.

450
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,920
I have to learn to forget.

451
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,920
I have to learn to forget.

452
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,920
Hello, Zhu Yue.

453
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,920
What's wrong?

454
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,920
Why are you calling me?

455
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,920
Hello.

456
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,920
Zhu Yue.

457
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,920
I remember.

458
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,920
What's wrong?

459
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,920
Hello?

460
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,920
Hello, Zhu Yue.

461
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
Hello, Zhu Yue.

462
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,920
Hello?

463
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,920
How long did you call me?

464
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,920
Excuse me.

465
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,920
Everything is fine.

466
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,920
Okay.

467
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,920
I'm at the door right now.

468
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,920
Breakfast is ready.

469
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,920
Plug in the gekommen calls.

470
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,920
Call tons.

471
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
Loop off.

472
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,920
Hey!

473
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,920
Get on the phone.

474
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,920
Hello?

475
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,920
Hello, carefully.

476
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,920
embarrass myself!

477
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,920
At least I don't need to put him out without Amy.

478
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,920
Let him go.

479
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,920
Go, my lady.

480
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,920
Okay.

481
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,920
metabolic stress

482
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,520
you

483
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:45,920
In addition

484
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,000
to the new

485
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,720
Bit of evidence

486
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,220
Hey.

487
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:48,800
What Hungarian

488
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,580
Little bit

489
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,720
With Li Qun

490
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,720
I have to be very careful with him.

491
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,220
Nice and tidy.

492
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,220
I'm sorry.

493
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,220
Where's 316?

494
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,220
Second floor on the right.

495
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,220
This way?

496
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,220
Where's 316?

497
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,220
Second floor on the right.

498
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,220
This way?

499
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,220
Where's 316?

500
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,220
Second floor on the right.

501
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,220
This way?

502
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,220
Second floor on the right.

503
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,220
This way?

504
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,220
Second floor on the right.

505
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,220
This way?

506
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,220
Second floor on the right.

507
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,220
This way?

508
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,220
Second floor on the right.

509
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,220
This way?

510
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,220
Second floor on the right.

511
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,220
This way?

512
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,220
Second floor on the right.

513
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,220
This way?

514
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,220
Second floor on the right.

515
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,220
This way?

516
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,220
Second floor on the right.

517
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,220
This way?

518
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,220
Second floor on the right.

519
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,220
This way?

520
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,220
Second floor on the right.

521
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,220
This way?

522
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,220
Second floor on the right.

523
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,220
This way?

524
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,220
Second floor on the right.

525
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,220
This way?

526
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,220
Second floor on the right.

527
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,220
This way?

528
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,220
Second floor on the right.

529
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,220
This way?

530
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,220
Second floor on the right.

531
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,220
This is the medicine you prescribed for her?

532
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,220
You should ask

533
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,220
how long she took these medicines.

534
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,220
Last night, Zhu Yun drank too much alcohol

535
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,220
and ate too many medicines.

536
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,220
She had a sudden low blood pressure.

537
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,220
Actually, she still hasn't reached her diastolic state.

538
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:43,020
These medicines have serious side effects.

539
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,020
But he took them for three years.

540
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,420
You probably don't know how he lived abroad.

541
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,820
When Zhu Yun was abroad,

542
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,820
he kept spinning like a turtledoves.

543
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,820
He didn't want to stop.

544
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,820
He didn't dare to stop.

545
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,820
One time, he came to my place to work.

546
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,820
I had to take him out for a walk.

547
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,220
He was standing by the sea.

548
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,220
I went to buy him a roll cake.

549
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,220
When I came back, he was standing by the sea.

550
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:33,620
At that moment,

551
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:37,620
do you know what I saw in his eyes?

552
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,620
Relief.

553
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:50,420
I won't let you hurt him again.

554
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:57,020
Master Tian.

555
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:08,620
Thank you for taking care of him.

556
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,620
Thank me?

557
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,620
From what point of view are you thanking me?

558
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,620
Thank you.

559
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:35,620
How are you doing abroad?

560
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,620
I've been through the world.

561
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,620
It's pretty good.

562
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:44,620
It's just that speaking Chinese and English is a little bit awkward.

563
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:49,620
I'm happy to learn what I like to do and what I like.

564
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,420
When Zhu Yun was abroad,

565
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:06,420
he kept spinning like a turtledoves.

566
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,820
He didn't want to stop.

567
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:14,420
He didn't dare to stop.

568
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:17,620
He didn't stop.

569
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:21,620
I'm leaning on your shoulder.

570
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:27,620
We won't be separated.

571
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,620
I'm avoiding the noisy world.

572
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:37,620
Accompanying me is your guide.

573
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,620
I'm bravely facing the dark night.

574
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,620
You're awake.

575
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,620
How do you feel?

576
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,620
I feel like...

577
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:50,620
Do you want to drink some water?

578
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:55,620
Because I believe I love you.

579
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,620
Just love will take you to the other side.

580
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,620
Is it Li Xun?

581
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,620
I'm by your side.

582
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,620
It's him.

583
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,620
Do you want to call him in?

584
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:08,620
I spent a long time with you.

585
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:12,620
I love you.

586
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:41,620
I love you.

587
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:44,620
I love you.

588
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:48,620
Because I believe I love you.

589
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:53,620
Just love will take you to the other side.

590
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:58,620
I'm by your side.

591
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,620
It's him.

592
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,620
I spent a long time with you.

593
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,620
Because I believe I love you.

594
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,620
What's this?

595
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,620
What do these two words mean?

596
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,620
Lucky and Power.

597
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,620
It's a lucky charm.

598
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,620
What?

599
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,620
Isn't it the Princess of Lighting?

600
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,620
The fire has been set on fire.

601
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,620
Compared to the previous game, the weapons are relatively small.

602
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,620
They are typical.

603
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,620
They can't make money.

604
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,620
They did their best.

605
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,620
Especially the plot design.

606
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,620
It's very interesting.

607
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,620
The plot is obviously well-created.

608
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,620
But this is a double-edged sword.

609
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,620
It's a door between the stars.

610
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,620
The players who don't like to think,

611
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,620
are not willing to buy.

612
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,620
So their game is a little hard.

613
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,620
Yes, our obvious is easier to get.

614
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,620
The picture is more exquisite than theirs.

615
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,620
So it's easier to sell out.

616
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,620
When can it be online?

617
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,620
It will be the first of next month.

618
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,620
So slow.

619
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,620
The players are all robbed by the invincible.

620
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,620
We are already very fast.

621
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,620
Look at it yourself.

622
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,620
Everyone is working overtime.

623
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,620
Thank you.

624
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,620
We are after all from the bottom.

625
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,620
I don't care.

626
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,620
I'll give you all the people in the sixth and seventh groups.

627
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,620
Let them put all the work on their hands.

628
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,620
The game will be online on the 20th of this month.

629
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,620
Honey.

630
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,620
The project of the sixth and seventh groups

631
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,620
will be over soon.

632
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,620
That game is more promising than the Seven Kingdoms.

633
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,620
You can't fight against Li Xun.

634
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,620
Put down the company's business.

635
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,620
And disrupt the company's plan.

636
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,620
Think about it.

637
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,620
Li Xun is like this now.

638
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,620
Is it worth to let you die?

639
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,620
Is it worth to let you spend so much money

640
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,620
to deal with him?

641
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,620
Do I need your approval for what I do now?

642
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,620
No, no.

643
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,620
I don't mean that, honey.

644
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,620
Listen to me.

645
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,620
What is the biggest goal of our company now?

646
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,620
Isn't it just to make the company go public?

647
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,620
What does Li Xun count when our company goes public?

648
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,620
He can't even spend his whole life on us.

649
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,620
So, I think

650
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:36,620
we should just keep him in the dark.

651
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:39,620
I can call the game website immediately

652
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,620
and download all the games of their company.

653
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,620
Don't forget.

654
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:46,620
We will be online on the 18th.

655
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,620
Do as I said.

656
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,620
No.

657
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,620
Honey, you can get off work now.

658
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,620
I'm going to the bathroom.

659
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,620
I'll be back soon.

660
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,620
Okay.

661
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,620
I'll be back soon.

662
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,620
Okay.

663
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,620
Bye.

664
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,620
Bye.

665
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,620
Bye.

666
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,620
Bye.

667
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,620
Bye.

668
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,620
Bye.

669
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,620
Bye.

670
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,620
Bye.

671
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,620
Bye.

672
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,620
I'll make you a steamed carp.

673
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,620
Okay.

674
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:35,620
And some stir-fried cabbage.

675
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,620
Stir-fried cabbage.

676
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,620
No.

677
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,620
You can't say that.

678
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:10,620
If you aren't a sweet man,

679
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,620
là Chez Mr. Chen.

680
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,620
I...

681
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,620
It's like you are your father.

682
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,620
I love you.

683
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,620
Please don't cry.

684
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,620
Come on.

685
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:30,460
May I make an appearance now?

686
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:34,340
I can askQu ManorForensic fine You are available

687
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,620
I told you leave the flight free

688
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,460
I won't make you stop

689
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,420
How long?

690
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,540
Six months

691
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,660
So we have ten minutes

692
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,860
The cost of her mother 25,000...

693
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,540
...is Ether Cash.

694
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,860
Sh mehr than 80,000.

695
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,260
Let's go.

696
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,720
Luckily you've come to learn from Mr. Zhao.

697
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,380
After graduation, I haven't contacted cyber teacher on Instagram.

698
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:38,380
His fans are young people who are interested in history.

699
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,780
They are actually the target users of the Wu Di Wu Jiang.

700
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:45,980
We found him and it's considered a double of what we did.

701
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:49,980
I just don't know if what we did back then

702
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,780
has affected Teacher Lin.

703
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:59,180
What are you afraid of? At least he's willing to see us.

704
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,580
Doesn't he like you the most?

705
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,380
You were his class representative back then and you did so well.

706
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,780
Who doesn't know that he likes you the most?

707
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,180
Teacher Lin.

708
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,580
It's really you two.

709
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,580
Hurry and enter the room.

710
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,380
Come. Come.

711
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,980
Hurry.

712
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,780
Hurry.

713
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,780
No need to change your shoes.

714
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,380
Just sit anywhere.

715
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,780
You two are all grown up.

716
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:24,380
Teacher, you still haven't gotten any younger.

717
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,580
I'm old.

718
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,780
Stop looking. Let's eat.

719
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,180
Okay. Hurry. Hurry.

720
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,180
Thank you, Teacher.

721
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:53,180
Thank you, Teacher.

722
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:56,180
After you two picked up the phone that day, Teacher Lin

723
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,180
couldn't find Bei anymore.

724
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:02,580
If you two don't come, I'm going to send him to the hospital.

725
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,180
Sit.

726
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,980
Is the porridge delicious?

727
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,980
Yes.

728
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:17,380
Compared to the porridge I ate in the hospital, it tastes much better.

729
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,180
You're thinner than before.

730
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,780
Yes.

731
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,780
Actually, the inside is pretty good.

732
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,580
There's porridge sooner or later.

733
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:31,380
Two meals a day at noon, and you'll have all the food.

734
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,180
At first, I thought it was pretty good.

735
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:38,980
But after a long time, I couldn't get used to it.

736
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,580
I want to eat it and go to the canteen.

737
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:46,780
Actually, I found that the school is no different from the prison.

738
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:52,380
You... You compared our Nanhu University to a prison.

739
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:56,180
Then what is our teacher? Is it a prison guard?

740
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,380
You're my friend.

741
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,980
Friend?

742
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,580
Hurry and eat.

743
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,980
Why aren't you eating the porridge?

744
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,180
You have something to do?

745
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,780
Oh, right. I do have something to say.

746
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,380
Say it.

747
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:18,980
We recently developed a game. It's a historical game.

748
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,180
I want to ask you to teach me.

749
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,980
No problem.

750
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,380
Leader, can you do it?

751
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,780
No.

752
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,380
No problem. No problem.

753
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,580
Then you two talk. I'll go in and talk.

754
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:44,980
Teacher Lin, where's your private soup?

755
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,980
Stinky brat.

756
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:58,380
But your company's scale is still a bit small.

757
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,380
Small companies are more interesting.

758
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:05,180
You still like to show off like before.

759
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,780
But work is a big thing.

760
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,180
How about this? I have some big companies here.

761
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,580
And some research institutions.

762
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,980
No need to trouble yourself, Teacher.

763
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,380
I'm doing well in this company.

764
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,180
Then I want to ask you.

765
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:28,380
What about the other colleagues in the company?

766
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,380
They are a group of people with true personalities.

767
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,580
I like them.

768
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,980
That's good.

769
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:45,380
Li Xue, it's not easy for you.

770
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,180
Take it easy.

771
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,980
You're stubborn.

772
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:55,180
But there's one thing you must remember.

773
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:00,580
No matter what kind of difficulties you'll encounter in the future,

774
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,580
you must do the right thing.

775
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,580
Don't be willful.

776
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,580
Don't be willful.

777
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,580
Don't be willful.

778
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:18,580
Don't let yourself be fooled again.

779
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,980
Okay.

780
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,580
Don't worry.

781
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,580
Zhu Yu.

782
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,580
Yes.

783
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,580
Be specific.

784
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,380
The opening was set in 239 BC.

785
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,780
Qin Wang was the official.

786
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,780
Yes.

787
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,380
Why did you choose this time?

788
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:54,780
The first important battle we set was Qin Wang against Lao Ai.

789
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:59,180
After this battle, Qin Wang completely removed Lv Buwei's eye.

790
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,180
He started the journey of six states.

791
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,780
We think this is a good start.

792
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:09,180
I'm confusing you to hear that combination.

793
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,780
Why are you asking me?

794
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,780
It sounds like it has come

795
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:29,200
She Bangkok

796
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,160
Yaonan

797
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,980
Mr. Zhao will be the consultant for this project.

798
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,180
You can ask him if you have any questions.

799
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:48,220
When did you get the chance to work with him?

800
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:53,340
He will be releasing a software that promotes games in the next few days.

801
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,340
It will be released based on the game's speed.

802
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:02,340
This project will be promoted through the most historic game in history.

803
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,380
But will he be a game consultant

804
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,820
and affect his image as a scholar?

805
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,460
I don't know.

806
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,660
You don't worry about it at all?

807
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,540
Since you are so worried about affecting his reputation,

808
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,540
why are you still here?

809
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,860
Don't worry. He agreed.

810
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,860
He just wants to help us.

811
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,180
Get in the car.

812
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,780
No. I will walk on my own.

813
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,700
Be careful.

814
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,700
Be careful.

815
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,780
I'm sorry.

816
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,780
I'm not that serious.

817
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,780
You don't have to apologize.

818
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,780
I've always been like this since I was a kid.

819
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,780
I like to fight with myself.

820
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,780
Taking medicine can help me calm down.

821
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,780
You don't have to care about it.

822
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:13,780
I also owe you an apology for what happened before.

823
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:25,780
Last time, you said that you were happy abroad.

824
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,780
I believed it.

825
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:36,780
I didn't think about how you have been these years.

826
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,780
You still feel guilty?

827
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,780
You are much more brave than me.

828
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:54,780
When I was lying in the hospital, I thought a lot.

829
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,780
I thought about why I stayed.

830
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:02,780
I was afraid of thinking about these things before.

831
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:05,780
I also resisted reminding myself

832
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,780
how important you were to me.

833
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:24,780
You don't regret coming to this small company with me?

834
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,780
No. Don't be so arrogant.

835
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,780
I'm not doing this for you.

836
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,780
Actually, I like Fei Yang a lot.

837
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,780
Xiao Jian, although he's very good at drawing,

838
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:39,780
his hair is getting longer to draw concepts.

839
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:43,780
And Zhao Tao, when I first showed him my game plan,

840
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,780
his eyes were about to pop out.

841
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,780
Later, when we opened the battle field together,

842
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:50,780
his eyes instantly lit up.

843
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:54,780
Fei Yang is small, but everyone has a power.

844
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:58,780
No matter how stupid he is, he will still surprise us

845
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,780
if he becomes smarter every day.

846
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:08,780
Even if he's never ready, he will still be able to improve.

847
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:12,780
Master, don't just hold onto him.

848
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,780
It won't be like you did.

849
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:17,780
Just want him to grow old with your thoughts.

850
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,780
Even if it isn't because he doesn't practice,

851
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,780
I still know that when we first met,

852
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,780
it wasn't because he didn't practice,

853
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,780
But you need us too.

854
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,780
I noticed that

855
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,780
you only read about one sixth of the books I gave you.

856
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,780
You are much slower than before.

857
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,780
You finally gave me a chance.

858
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:48,780
Of course.

859
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,780
I've been waiting for this day for many years.

860
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:00,780
Normal colleague.

861
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:05,780
Normal colleague.

862
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:13,780
I'm leaving.

863
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:30,780
The person who really wants to be a witness

864
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,780
never turns back.

865
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,780
He will never doubt himself

866
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:37,780
because of everything I've lacked.

867
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:41,780
Faith, courage, strength, freedom.

868
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:44,780
He will always have a firm direction.

869
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,780
He will never doubt himself.

870
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:50,780
Maybe he is a special existence to me.

871
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:55,780
Maybe everyone has had such a person in their lives.

872
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,780
He has exposed all the wounds

873
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,780
and still gives you a good reputation.

874
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,780
He has turned back.

875
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,780
He is still worth your attention.

876
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,780
I just want to fight for the right to be a witness.

877
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,780
I just want to fight so that he can't turn back.

878
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:27,780
I want him to know that

879
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,780
the current game market is LP.

880
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:30,780
Xu, don't stop me.

881
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,780
I don't want to be in prison anymore.

882
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:32,780
No.

883
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:33,780
Calm down.

884
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:37,780
How many years will the illegal entry into the computer system be sentenced?

885
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:41,780
Yixuan, look at the people around you.

886
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,780
What else do you have to be left behind?

887
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:56,780
The night, the night,

888
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:01,780
then won the world for me.

889
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:07,780
The car in the city never stops.

890
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:12,780
I also lean on your shoulder.

891
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:18,780
We will never be separated.

892
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,780
I will escape from the noisy world.

893
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,780
Accompany me.

894
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:28,780
I am your new compass.

895
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:36,780
I will bravely face the fire like the night.

896
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:46,780
Because I believe I love you.

897
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:50,780
True love will take its course.

898
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:54,780
I am by your side.

899
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,780
I spent a long time with you.

900
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:04,780
Because I believe I want you.

901
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:08,780
True love will take its course.

902
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:12,780
That burning fire.

903
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:20,780
You always shine for me.

904
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:26,780
You are my destiny.

905
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:30,780
You are my destiny.

906
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:33,780
You are my destiny.

907
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:36,780
You are my destiny.

908
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:39,780
You are my destiny.

909
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,780
You are my destiny.

910
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:45,780
You are my destiny.

911
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:48,780
You are my destiny.

912
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:51,780
The night, the night,

913
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:55,780
then won the world for me.

914
00:47:55,780 --> 00:48:00,780
The car in the city never stops.

915
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:05,780
I also lean on your shoulder.

916
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:10,780
I will bravely face the fire like the night.

917
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:17,780
I will never lose to the world.

918
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:20,780
Because I love you.

919
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:24,780
True love will take its course.

920
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:29,780
I am by your side.

921
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:33,780
I spent a long time with you.

922
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:38,780
Because I believe I want you.

923
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:42,780
True love will take its course.

924
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:46,780
That burning fire.

925
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:53,780
You always shine for me.

926
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:02,780
Because I believe I love you.

927
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:06,780
True love will take its course.

928
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:11,780
I am by your side.

929
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:15,780
I spent a long time with you.

930
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:20,780
Because I believe I want you.

931
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:24,780
True love will take its course.

932
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:28,780
That burning fire.

933
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:37,780
You always shine for me.

934
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:42,780
That burning fire.

935
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:46,780
You always shine for me.

936
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:57,780
You always shine for me.
