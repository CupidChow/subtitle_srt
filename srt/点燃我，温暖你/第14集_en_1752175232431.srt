00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't want to believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world breaks into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Even if the light is very white

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I want to be there

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless emotion

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day, the end is a little bit panicked

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am the light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast world?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I burn up the night just for you

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This is how everything looks like at first

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am the light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The wind is like a wild grass

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The mountain is broken, but you are still by my side

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Everything is how it looks at first

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What's wrong? Not happy?

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Can't bear to leave?

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I haven't finished my work yet. I have to work tomorrow.

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Don't worry. Li Xun is a good guy.

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
He can't be delayed.

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Dad, you also think he is reliable?

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
How to say?

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This man, sometimes his intuition is quite good.

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
He is not bad.

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But dad, how do you know where my base is?

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Did my mom tell you?

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I just said how you came to the meeting so coincidentally.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
My mom is really too much.

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But dad, you also saw that I was really working.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Correct.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The work is quite busy.

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I didn't buy anything.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Dad

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yunyun, I told you.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I found you in the class of the school.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Understand?

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I know.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I want to spend a year in peace.

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Brother Xiaozhu, I can't recognize you.

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Long time no see, Zhu Yun.

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You are really a good student.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Long time no see, uncle.

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You are a big boy.

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Let me do it.

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
He is like your brother.

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
He is so good.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
No, I am not.

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I am also a good person.

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Aunt

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yunyun, come here.

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You haven't seen auntie Jiang for four years.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Look, when you come back,

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
she will take care of you and eat with you.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You are so lucky.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
No.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yunyun, your New Year gift.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I am in college and I have a New Year gift.

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I have.

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I specially picked one for you.

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You have a bright face and a good teeth.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You are beautiful and clean.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Look, do you like it?

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Aunt, you have a good taste.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I think your classmates want to buy it.

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Really?

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You can come and prepare the meal.

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Okay.

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yunyun, you and uncle do it.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You young people do it.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You two talk together.

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Okay, we two do it.

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Come on.

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Thank you.

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So many dishes.

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Thank you.

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
One dish and one soup.

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
There are more.

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You tell me.

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We sent them to primary school.

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It seems that it happened yesterday.

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's so big.

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes.

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's so big.

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Come on.

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
One soup.

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Come on.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Do you remember?

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
They two ate chicken wings.

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yunyun won in the end.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Right?

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But she was so hungry.

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
She almost died.

97
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Why don't you reply to WeChat?

98
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Do you remember?

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Really?

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That time,

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
you ate more than fifty chicken wings.

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Stop talking.

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'll kill myself if you say that again.

104
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's a glorious history.

105
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What's this?

106
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Come on.

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Come on.

108
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
To celebrate your return.

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Thank you, uncle.

110
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Welcome.

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What's wrong?

112
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Is there something wrong with the school?

113
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
No.

114
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Whose information are you waiting for?

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm checking the scores.

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The scores for the final exam

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
may be out today.

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Is it the first place again?

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
No.

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
There is a first-class in our class.

121
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's great.

122
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Koke has such a high score.

123
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You are so good at it.

124
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You are so good at it.

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You are so good at it.

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You are so good at it.

127
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The basic principle of Marxism

128
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
is 97.

129
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Isn't it still three points away?

130
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's good

131
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
that it's only three points away.

132
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
After all, the world is not perfect.

133
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I don't know how many points he got.

134
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Ruiyuan,

135
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
you really have to learn

136
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
from Brother Xuzhu.

137
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
He has a lot of works

138
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
to be exhibited all over the world.

139
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yes.

140
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Two days ago,

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
a painting was exhibited

142
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
in the city's art museum.

143
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm sweating.

144
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You went to see it?

145
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Xuzhu,

146
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I didn't hear you say that.

147
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
We didn't meet.

148
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Didn't you say

149
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
you didn't have time to see it?

150
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's delicious.

151
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I heard it today.

152
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
After we finished the exhibition today,

153
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
we went around

154
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
to the art museum on purpose.

155
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
We could only see

156
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
your big poster.

157
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yes, yes.

158
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's a big one.

159
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yes.

160
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Thank you for your praise.

161
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
To be honest,

162
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I hope that in the future,

163
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
our Yunyuan can also go abroad.

164
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It doesn't matter what major you study.

165
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The main thing is

166
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
to go abroad and open your eyes, right?

167
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
If you have any questions

168
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
about going abroad,

169
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
you can ask us anytime.

170
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
If you really have plans,

171
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
you have to prepare as soon as possible.

172
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Right?

173
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I guess Aunt

174
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
hasn't considered these yet.

175
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Can you

176
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
study abroad with me?

177
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Brother Xiu Zhu,

178
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
is the moon

179
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
really rounder abroad?

180
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The moon is

181
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
still the same.

182
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But the food

183
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
abroad

184
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
is definitely not as good

185
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
as the food in our hometown.

186
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Especially the food

187
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
you cooked,

188
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
the Chinese restaurant outside

189
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
is not as good as yours.

190
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You can see that, right?

191
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's the truth.

192
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Right?

193
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I found that

194
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
your cooking skills are getting better.

195
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You must have been cooking

196
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
for a long time.

197
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Should I send him another message?

198
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Do you feel better now?

199
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yes.

200
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The result is out.

201
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm 97.

202
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Are you really sick?

203
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Why are you higher than me?

204
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Hello.

205
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Hello.

206
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Hello.

207
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's me.

208
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Nonsense.

209
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Are you feeling better now?

210
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Are you stupid?

211
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
What?

212
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The medicine

213
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
you bought me

214
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
was from the wind.

215
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I was caught by the cold.

216
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I almost died.

217
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm sorry.

218
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What are you going to do now?

219
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'll ask someone to send you medicine.

220
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
That's good.

221
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Have you eaten?

222
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yes.

223
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Who sent you the medicine?

224
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I have to thank him.

225
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Liu Sisi.

226
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Liu Sisi?

227
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Didn't she go home?

228
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
She's back.

229
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Why?

230
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
To send the medicine.

231
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Okay, I won't say it now.

232
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I have something to do.

233
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Wait, wait.

234
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
She sent the food.

235
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Hello.

236
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Oh, no.

237
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I can't be so careless.

238
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
The first day of the new year.

239
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
We're home.

240
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Classmate Zhu Yu.

241
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
We're not going to the mall

242
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
for the new year.

243
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You're quite creative

244
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
to come here.

245
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Haven't you been back

246
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
for a long time?

247
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'll show you the name card.

248
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Two eggs.

249
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Are you interested in this?

250
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
This is also an art.

251
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You have to see more.

252
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
How much is this?

253
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
One hundred and eighty.

254
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Boss.

255
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Can you see if this can be repaired?

256
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's all so handsome.

257
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What's good about it?

258
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What's good about it?

259
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I was pressed by the car.

260
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I heard that you have

261
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
all kinds of accessories here.

262
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You really found the right person.

263
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The acupuncture point.

264
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's expensive.

265
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
How much is it?

266
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Nine hundred and fifty.

267
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's so expensive.

268
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Can't you be cheaper?

269
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
This is an old item.

270
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's hard to find the parts inside.

271
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I have to take apart

272
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
the other antiques in my store

273
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
and match them for you.

274
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You're really good at

275
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
repairing things.

276
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You can't repair it anywhere else.

277
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Let's go to another place.

278
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
No problem.

279
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Nine hundred and fifty is nine hundred and fifty.

280
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It can be repaired.

281
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
How long can it be repaired?

282
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
When the festival is over,

283
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
it's all down now.

284
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'll give you a thousand.

285
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'll get a pillow.

286
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'll take it today.

287
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Little girl, you're so domineering.

288
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
OK.

289
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'll give you a overtime today.

290
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Then you take your time

291
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
to do what I do.

292
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'll wait for you.

293
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Zhu Yue.

294
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You don't know how to cut down on your family.

295
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Forget it.

296
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Why do you still give people extra money?

297
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You heard it too.

298
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Only he can repair this big machine.

299
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It can't be repaired anywhere else.

300
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Whose big machine is this?

301
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
My classmate's.

302
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Such an important classmate.

303
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Just a normal classmate.

304
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Hello.

305
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Hello, it's me.

306
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
What's wrong?

307
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Nothing.

308
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I just want to ask you

309
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
how's the app of Lan Guan?

310
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Did you submit it?

311
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
OK.

312
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The new year is coming tonight.

313
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Are you still at school?

314
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
No.

315
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm at home.

316
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm going to the school.

317
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'll be back.

318
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'll be back.

319
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'll be back.

320
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'll be back.

321
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'll be back.

322
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'll be back.

323
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'll be back.

324
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'll be back.

325
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'll be back.

326
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Then you're home?

327
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
No.

328
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Then where are you?

329
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Li Xun, hurry.

330
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I can't catch the bus.

331
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You're with Liu Si Si?

332
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm taking the bus back with her.

333
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Anything else?

334
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You...

335
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Bye.

336
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Hello?

337
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Hello?

338
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,500
Early in the morning and late at night

339
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:49,740
the

340
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,200
Alright?

341
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:50,980
No

342
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,180
Left hand drops

343
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,800
Left hand drops

344
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,940
Look

345
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,700
Is it him behind?

346
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,500
Yes.

347
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,260
No, right?

348
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,140
Yes.

349
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,420
No.

350
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,620
The hair doesn't look good.

351
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,780
I think it's almost done.

352
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,060
I have to rely on myself.

353
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,020
Let me see.

354
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,660
Yun Yun.

355
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,140
You don't look familiar.

356
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,620
What if dad falls?

357
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,660
What year will it be?

358
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,460
Be careful.

359
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,820
Why are you looking at your phone?

360
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,660
Look at it yourself.

361
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,620
Is it crooked?

362
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,140
It is crooked.

363
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,260
Where is it crooked?

364
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,140
This way?

365
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,180
The little part of the people who are foreign to the country

366
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,620
still have prejudice against China.

367
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,740
I'm not afraid of that.

368
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,820
In the foreign environment...

369
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,300
Is that person him?

370
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,660
Did he go or not?

371
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,500
Where is he from?

372
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,940
There is no movement again.

373
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,540
Mainly because now

374
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,860
many people's purpose to go abroad is not pure.

375
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,860
They are mixed with culture and culture.

376
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,620
That's right.

377
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,940
It's not the same as the Chinese.

378
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,020
It's the same as the Chinese.

379
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,900
It's the same as the Chinese.

380
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,860
It's the same as the Chinese.

381
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,860
It's the same as the Chinese.

382
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,700
That's for sure.

383
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,380
Not everyone can be like Xiu Zhu.

384
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:58,860
But I think

385
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,420
Yanyun's computer major

386
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,260
still needs to go abroad to study.

387
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,780
Increase a little international career.

388
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,380
Right?

389
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,300
Don't keep looking at your phone.

390
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,340
You also talk about it.

391
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,780
What do you think about going abroad?

392
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,580
I think it's good to be in China.

393
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,620
Our profession is very important.

394
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,700
It's good to work early.

395
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,540
Look, you're wrong.

396
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,220
You go abroad to study computer.

397
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,900
What kind of big companies

398
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,380
like Microsoft and Google can enter in the future?

399
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,140
It's not the same as

400
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,540
you enter a small company in China to study.

401
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,340
It's not the same as you enter a small company in China to study.

402
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:31,860
Right?

403
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,940
People who have been educated abroad

404
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,300
have different views.

405
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,100
Look at the plate Xiu Zhu picked today.

406
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,220
The dumplings are in it.

407
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,220
They all look high-class.

408
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,820
Right?

409
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,500
It's not that exaggerated.

410
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,100
She just accompanied me to fix the lighter

411
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,020
and bought it by the way.

412
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,100
Nothing special.

413
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,740
How can you have a lighter?

414
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,580
And this...

415
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,820
What lighter?

416
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,100
It needs to be fixed.

417
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,420
Let me see.

418
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,580
I'll put it in the spring evening.

419
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,020
Fix it.

420
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,940
I haven't fixed it for a long time.

421
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,340
Is it her?

422
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:19,900
Impossible.

423
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,780
I want to go to the toilet.

424
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,460
What toilet do you want to go to when you eat?

425
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,260
Did I see it wrong?

426
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,780
Hello?

427
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,220
Hello?

428
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,940
Happy New Year.

429
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,100
Happy?

430
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,980
Happy New Year.

431
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,020
Have you arrived home with Liu Sisi?

432
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,260
Not yet.

433
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,620
You haven't come home yet?

434
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,500
You always hear me.

435
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,540
I want to go home with her.

436
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,020
Where are you?

437
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,500
It's snowing.

438
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,220
Li Xue.

439
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,940
Was that you?

440
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,940
閱 junto para mi

441
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,820
How do you know where I live?

442
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,220
I'm not going here.

443
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,220
I'm not going to eat it.

444
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,220
Then wait for me.

445
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,220
Yueyue, where are you going?

446
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,220
You have to eat the apples.

447
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,220
Go eat.

448
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,220
That mother.

449
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,220
I have a delivery.

450
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,220
I'll get it.

451
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,220
No need.

452
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,220
I'll go.

453
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,220
Mom is still hungry.

454
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,220
No.

455
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,220
Uncle Jinxia.

456
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,220
How come there is still a delivery on New Year's Eve?

457
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,220
Is the house big?

458
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,220
It's big.

459
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,220
You must not go.

460
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,220
I just finished eating.

461
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,220
You eat first.

462
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,220
After you eat the fruit,

463
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,220
we will arrange it later.

464
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,220
Let's go see it together.

465
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,220
Come on, eat some.

466
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,220
How many cards are left?

467
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,220
Two.

468
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,220
I won again.

469
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,220
Yueyue, you are not in a good state today.

470
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,220
You haven't won a game.

471
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,220
Where is my mother?

472
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,220
That's right.

473
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,220
We don't know who is the owner of our house.

474
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,220
Why is there no movement?

475
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,220
Then you two are teasing me all night.

476
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,220
Come on.

477
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,220
Come on.

478
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,220
You still come.

479
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,220
You are still here.

480
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,220
I'm sleepy.

481
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,220
You are sleepy.

482
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,220
It's boring.

483
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,220
It's boring.

484
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,220
Now the New Year is getting more boring.

485
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,220
Three people.

486
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,220
Even a table of sesame paste is boring.

487
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,220
It's freezing to death.

488
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,220
What's wrong?

489
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,220
Dad, mom.

490
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,220
I'm going to throw this garbage.

491
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,220
Come on.

492
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,220
Slow down.

493
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,220
Hello, I'm out.

494
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,220
Where are you?

495
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,220
Sister.

496
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,220
It's snowing so hard.

497
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,220
You just came out.

498
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,220
You are here to dig a hole, right?

499
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,220
Sorry.

500
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,220
Then you go back.

501
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,220
Do you know where Lihua Hotel is?

502
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,220
Is it the one near my house?

503
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,220
I live there.

504
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,220
I have time to come.

505
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,220
What do you mean?

506
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,220
Hello.

507
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,220
Hello.

508
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,220
Lihua Hotel.

509
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,220
You want me to find him?

510
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,220
Yueyue.

511
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,220
You have been throwing garbage for so long.

512
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,220
Come back quickly.

513
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,220
I'll be back soon.

514
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,220
It's freezing to death.

515
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,220
How could I go there alone?

516
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,220
I won't go.

517
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,220
I'm sorry.

518
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,220
Will I scare her in the middle of the night?

519
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,220
She's so funny.

520
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,220
Slow down.

521
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,220
I'm sorry.

522
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,720
Careful.

523
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,220
What's the matter with you today?

524
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,220
Extra.

525
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,220
What's this?

526
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,220
I'm here.

527
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,820
This girl is looking for you.

528
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,220
I'm here.

529
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,820
Can you still play this card?

530
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,820
Can you still continue?

531
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,620
Can you still play this card?

532
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,420
Can you still continue?

533
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,420
This girl is beautiful.

534
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,620
Beautiful.

535
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,820
Yes.

536
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,220
Okay, let's play first.

537
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,420
Okay, let's go in.

538
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,620
This girl is very good at it.

539
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,820
Let's go.

540
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,620
Don't just stand there. Let's go in.

541
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,820
Go in.

542
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,220
I...

543
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,820
If I turn around and leave now,

544
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,420
will you be very embarrassed?

545
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,220
You're leaving?

546
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,820
Let me think about it.

547
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,220
Okay, then you take your time to think.

548
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,820
Close the door.

549
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,220
Okay.

550
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,820
What are you doing standing there?

551
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,420
Come and sit.

552
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,620
How do you call me to sit?

553
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,420
Sit here.

554
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,220
This is a single bed.

555
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,420
I let you sit.

556
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,220
I won't let you sleep.

557
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,820
Bye bye.

558
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,060
Excuse me.

559
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,540
Excuse me.

560
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,900
Eating hot soup after new year?

561
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,580
Where's Liu Sisi?

562
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,340
Didn't you go back together?

563
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,140
You must have seen her moments.

564
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,340
You did.

565
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,420
I didn't.

566
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,500
You can't go to the station together.

567
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,820
I came to you on purpose.

568
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,260
怕嗎?

569
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:09,620
Hello.

570
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,020
What are you doing?

571
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,300
f добр

572
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,980
Is this just a mere dream?

573
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,280
Right now, Yiming is ...

574
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,240
You're very eager to leave.

575
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,280
You don't want the red envelope?

576
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,720
Red envelope? What red envelope?

577
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,400
I just received the prepayment today.

578
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,400
I'm here to pay my employees' salaries.

579
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,040
I'm sure you'll be satisfied.

580
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,200
Such a treasured door.

581
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,000
Open it and see.

582
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,320
This will be the salary card in the future.

583
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,000
Do you have a password?

584
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,200
My birthday.

585
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:28,860
A

586
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,160
This is not a gift.

587
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,360
This is the salary.

588
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,120
The gift is this.

589
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,160
What is this?

590
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,480
Open it and see.

591
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,480
The clothes number is on it.

592
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,920
I don't know where I put it.

593
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,320
Lift the umbrella and look.

594
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,000
What was your problem

595
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,680
Any problem

596
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,120
No need to push us so hard

597
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,440
Don't be afraid

598
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,960
Actually, I'm a little hot.

599
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,960
I didn't open the door in the room.

600
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,600
The dress is nice.

601
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,040
In the palace,

602
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,720
you have to wear a dress.

603
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,560
I'll go wash my face.

604
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:46,960
Okay.

605
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,000
How do I give it to him?

606
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,360
How do you thank me?

607
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,040
Let's go put fireworks.

608
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:12,960
Okay.

609
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,080
I'll go in.

610
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:16,960
Okay.

611
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,240
Okay.

612
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:28,920
Almost done.

613
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,440
Okay.

614
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,640
How much?

615
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,120
Okay.

616
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:31,760
Well,

617
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,120
200 yuan.

618
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,040
200?

619
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,040
Okay.

620
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,760
Okay, thank you.

621
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,000
Thank you.

622
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,200
You can put it there.

623
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,400
I'll go to the toilet.

624
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:38,960
Okay.

625
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,040
Zhu Yun.

626
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:44,960
Zhu Yun.

627
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,040
I've bought it.

628
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,760
Which one do you want?

629
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,240
I want the one

630
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,600
that pops out of the sky

631
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,080
and then

632
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,360
bursts into a flower.

633
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:57,840
What?

634
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,200
That pops out of the sky

635
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:00,480
and then

636
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,240
bursts into a flower.

637
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,400
Okay, that's good.

638
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,680
That's it.

639
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,480
Wait a minute.

640
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,560
I need to borrow a lighter.

641
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,000
I have one.

642
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,840
You have a lighter?

643
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,640
Take it.

644
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,960
Great.

645
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,480
It's not easy to fix, right?

646
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,480
It's okay.

647
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,480
Princess.

648
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,480
You've worked hard.

649
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,480
I just want to return the gift.

650
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,480
Don't think too much.

651
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,480
Are you ready?

652
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:21,480
The fireworks are the intuition of dreams.

653
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,480
The window is broken.

654
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,480
A night of rain,

655
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,480
the night is over.

656
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:37,480
Then I won the world for me.

657
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,480
Because I believe I love you.

658
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,480
The old will take his course.

659
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,480
Happy New Year.

660
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,480
Happy New Year.

661
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,480
Spend a long time with you.

662
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,480
Let's forget the tears.

663
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,480
Yixun, happy new year.

664
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,480
Happy new year.

665
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,480
The hot fireworks.

666
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:17,480
You always keep them for me.

667
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,480
Happy New Year.

668
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,480
Happy New Year.

669
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,480
Happy New Year.

670
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,040
Have you ever changed?

671
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,080
Have you ever changed?

672
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,760
Don't know how you've been there

673
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,600
What do you want to do?

674
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,160
Don't know how I've been there

675
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,680
Good night

676
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,120
It's been so long ago

677
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,840
I've been gone so long

678
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,600
Yuanかった

679
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,400
I'm not joy kommen

680
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,880
Yuanyuan

681
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,920
pause

682
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,240
Why haven't get up yet

683
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,240
I didn't sleep late yesterday

684
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,560
You lazy boy

685
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,040
I won't get up beautiful

686
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,840
Look at the weather today.

687
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,080
Hurry up.

688
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,960
Get up and change.

689
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,240
We're going to the New Year's Eve.

690
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,600
I'm going back to school.

691
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,680
See you in college.

692
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,720
See you in college.

693
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,320
See you in college.

694
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,360
I remember you used to like

695
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,840
to drink Yuyuan milk tea.

696
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,280
Thank you.

697
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,080
But I prefer coffee now.

698
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,720
There's always a process of being an adult.

699
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,040
Xiu Zhuge,

700
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,920
how long will you stay here?

701
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,360
What's wrong?

702
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,960
I have a long vacation this time.

703
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,280
More than a month.

704
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,240
More than a month.

705
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,520
Are you curious about

706
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,440
the domestic Yuyuan School?

707
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,280
How about I take you to my school?

708
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,280
Our school is the top university

709
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,360
in the country.

710
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,080
Especially the art school

711
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,040
and the painting major.

712
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,880
It's also very famous.

713
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,880
If you don't go abroad,

714
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,280
you may not get into the school.

715
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,120
You said that.

716
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,960
I'm sure I can't get into the school.

717
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,800
I didn't mean that.

718
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,040
You're such an outstanding artist.

719
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,960
It's my honor to come to my school.

720
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,600
You don't know me?

721
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,080
No.

722
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,840
I didn't mean it.

723
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,160
You're good at painting.

724
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,280
I'm busy today.

725
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,400
Nothing's wrong.

726
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,440
In this case,

727
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,040
I'll pay you a little money

728
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,040
for a good meal next to my school.

729
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,360
What does it smell like?

730
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,600
What?

731
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,720
Can you help me with my math?

732
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,560
Okay.

733
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,440
It's not easy to make you

734
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,040
a little talent.

735
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:18,680
Tell me.

736
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,320
When do you want to go?

737
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,080
Leave it to me.

738
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,080
Thank you, aunt.

739
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,760
Lend me the pig's kidney for a few more days.

740
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,320
It's not over yet.

741
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,440
I'm so embarrassed.

742
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,360
Let me tell you.

743
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,600
Both domestic and foreign universities

744
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,800
are very different

745
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,400
in terms of education

746
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,600
and the atmosphere of the campus.

747
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,320
So I asked Yue Yun to take you

748
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,760
to Nanhu University.

749
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,200
I finally got a leave of absence.

750
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,960
I want to stay at home for a few more days.

751
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,160
I'll be busy

752
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,680
when I come back to school.

753
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,160
Xiu Chu finally came back.

754
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,920
You can go with him

755
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,720
and go back by yourself

756
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,200
to prepare for the next semester.

757
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,240
I'm telling you.

758
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,320
The most important thing in college is self-discipline.

759
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,520
In case you don't get enough grades

760
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,240
when you go abroad.

761
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,640
How about Xiu Chu going by himself?

762
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,840
How can I do that?

763
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,080
You can ask him

764
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,040
more questions these days.

765
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,160
For example,

766
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,760
the channel of the paper.

767
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,560
Right?

768
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,600
I just want to stay with you for a few more days.

769
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,200
We're so close.

770
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,120
I miss you.

771
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,520
I can go to see you anytime.

772
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:25,720
Go.

773
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,640
I'm leaving, then.

774
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:28,520
Go.

775
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:29,960
Bye, aunt.

776
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,320
Drive slowly.

777
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,640
You're a master.

778
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,400
You're good at counter-clockwise operation.

779
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,840
A wise man will be a wise man.

780
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,200
After all, you're the master

781
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,520
of the wise master.

782
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,360
Okay.

783
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,760
I'll pay you a discount.

784
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,880
But I really want to learn

785
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,080
how to make my mom happy.

786
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,640
But to be honest,

787
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,160
this is a talent.

788
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,960
I didn't learn it.

789
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,080
You're right.

790
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,560
You seem to have

791
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,720
a good talent.

792
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,000
You're a couple, right?

793
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,520
Okay.

794
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,440
Go to the airport.

795
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:15,760
Thank you.

796
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,400
Thank you, Brother Xiu Zhu.

797
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,720
Can you find a hotel later?

798
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,360
Really?

799
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,120
You're going to cross the river bridge so soon?

800
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,960
If I'm not busy tomorrow,

801
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,400
I'll definitely accompany you.

802
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,280
It's too late today.

803
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,760
It's tiring to drive.

804
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,680
Zhu Yun.

805
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,840
Are you sure you won't use me again?

806
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,160
How about we go to the canteen

807
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:54,920
and eat something first?

808
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,320
You're back.

809
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:57,920
I'm back.

810
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,520
I'm back.

811
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,120
I'm back.

812
00:42:59,120 --> 00:42:59,640
I'm back.

813
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,320
I'm back.

814
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:00,840
I'm back.

815
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,440
I'm back.

816
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,040
I'm back.

817
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,640
I'm back.

818
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,240
I'm back.

819
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:03,840
I'm back.

820
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,680
You're back.

821
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,840
I'm from the computer department of this school.

822
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,080
I'm also a freshman.

823
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,120
Hello, Li Xing.

824
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,480
I've heard your name before.

825
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,080
I'm sorry.

826
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:44,760
I'm busy.

827
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,120
The one who won the special award

828
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,680
is Fang Zhijing.

829
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,760
Press the crystal ball with me.

830
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,320
The clock is ticking.

831
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:14,760
I lean on your shoulder.

832
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:21,360
We won't be separated.

833
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,760
Avoid the noisy world.

834
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,920
Accompany me.

835
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:31,400
You're the point of my palm.

836
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,520
I'm brave to face the fire.

837
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:41,200
Like the night's flame.

838
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:49,360
Cause I believe I love you.

839
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:53,840
True love will take its course.

840
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,680
I'm by your side.

841
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:02,360
I'll spend the long time with you.

842
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,920
Cause I believe I want you.

843
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,360
True love will take its course.

844
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:15,200
The fiery fire

845
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:24,640
is always on your side.

851
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,240
The fire is always on your side.

852
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:05,720
I'll stand by your side.

853
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,960
Be brave.

854
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,560
Every dream I have

855
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:18,080
will never be lost to time.

856
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:22,720
Cause I believe I love you.

857
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:27,160

True love will take its course.

862
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,400

00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,120
I'll spend the long time with you.

868
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:22,680
Cause I believe I want you.

869
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:27,160
True love will take its course.

870
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:31,600
