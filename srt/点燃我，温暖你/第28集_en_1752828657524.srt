YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't believe that anyone can save anyone

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Until you break into my world

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if this world shatters into darkness

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We will fight in the darkness

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even if the light is very bright

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will still watch over that vast vast land

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see the direction of the boundless atmosphere

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every day, the lens is a little bit yellow

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I am light

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How can I be alone in the vast night?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I burn up the night just for you to remember

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How everything was in the beginning

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I am light

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The wind and the color of the night are like wild grass

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The mountains are broken, but you are still by my side

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Everything is the original look

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The King of Blaze

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Episode 1

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The King of Blaze

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Go

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Go

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's not bad

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Did I break into history?

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I broke into history

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's 11 o'clock now

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I can definitely go back to the treasure house

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Definitely

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The registration number of users has risen

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
More than 40,000

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's almost 50,000

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's almost 50,000

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And you see the taste is very good

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Now 8.9

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Isn't this also watching the broken wine?

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Look at this comment

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The player said this is the most serious game in history I have ever played

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's full

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Someone went out

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Our company has established a new record

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Really

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Congratulations

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So much money

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So much money

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
10 dollars

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What do you want to do?

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I can't even eat spicy food

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That's the first income, right?

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
No matter

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
This is eating meat

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Right

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
10 dollars

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'll add a few

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
OK

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Come

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Good job

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Good good

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Come come

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The biggest winner is our strong woman

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Say a few words

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Correct

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Say a few words

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I won't talk

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I won't talk

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Say a few words

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Say a few words

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Say a few words

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Thank you Zhao Teng Xiao Jian

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'll be busy with the newspaper

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'll take care of your hair and makeup in the future

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
OK

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Good

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Who has a child

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Who has a company

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And thank you Zhang Fang

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Buy buns for us every day

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's our strong backing

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Work

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Lin Xu

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Thank you

82
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You should

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That's it

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
No, you two

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
When you work overtime every day

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Tired

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What's the matter now

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
This time is timid

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Come on, what should I do?

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You two

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Don't you always vote two to one?

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Come on

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Come on

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Come come

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What to do

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yes yes yes

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Come on

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll have a ten-dollar one

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Come on, wait for this

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
This company

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Have the first income

103
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
right

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
We must consume it

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yes yes yes

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Drink a big drink

107
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Drink

108
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You arrange

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Must be arranged

110
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Go

111
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I arrange

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Still in the factory

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yes yes yes

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
My bloodless life

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Adjust my bloodless life

116
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Here's the tea ice

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Fang, this is big

118
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Come on, you are a little bit excited

119
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This is the company's purchase

120
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That one is my shop money

121
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
This is all the office

122
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Learn

123
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Thank you

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I said you two

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What are you still holding on to?

126
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
How to let him

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's all salt water ice cream

128
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It will be salt water if you hold on for a while

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Although we are

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Ignore office romance

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But you two are in this state

132
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Jiang and ice cream

133
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
How do you like ice cream?

134
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I don't know

135
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I don't know

136
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I don't know

137
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
How can you open this ice cream shop?

138
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's better than letting go

139
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
At the worst, we manage the city

140
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
In the future, one eye after the other

141
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Why is this so stiff?

142
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I forgot something

143
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yes

144
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Shouldn't we take a picture together

145
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Remember today

146
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
This historical moment

147
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You take my picture

148
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Come on, let's take a picture

149
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Come on, hurry up

150
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
One two three

151
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm busy with work recently

152
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Wife is particularly busy

153
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Look, I called again

154
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Hello wife

155
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I will end soon

156
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Don't worry

157
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I know

158
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You sleep early

159
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'll be home right away

160
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
How many calls

161
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Tea

162
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What's wrong

163
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Why are you always with my husband?

164
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Interview every day

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What to do

166
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You make everyone very close

167
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Your wife is here

168
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000

00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm sorry

200
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm sorry

201
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm sorry

202
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm sorry

203
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm sorry

204
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm sorry

205
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm sorry

206
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm sorry

207
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm sorry

208
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm sorry

209
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm sorry

210
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm sorry

211
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm sorry

212
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm sorry

213
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm sorry

214
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm sorry

215
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm sorry

216
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm sorry

217
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm sorry

218
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm sorry

219
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm sorry

220
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm sorry

221
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm sorry

222
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm sorry

223
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm sorry

224
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm sorry

225
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm sorry

226
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm sorry

227
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm sorry

228
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You woke up

229
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Why are you up so early

230
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You woke up

231
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I came back too late last night

232
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I didn't disturb you

233
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You didn't disturb me

234
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You always discharge late

235
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm used to it

236
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I have porridge for you

237
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Thank you

238
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Can't drink only milk

239
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Come and have some porridge

240
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,400
Come here. Eat an egg.

241
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,200
Our company's new game is coming out.

242
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
Seven Kingdoms.

243
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,200
Why didn't I hear you say seven?

244
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,800
Are you here to be the game spokesperson?

245
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,600
I haven't been feeling well lately.

246
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,800
I want to rest for a while.

247
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
What's wrong?

248
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Nothing.

249
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm just a bit tired.

250
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Actually, I'm thinking

251
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
other than being the game spokesperson,

252
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
can I do something else?

253
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Something else.

254
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What did you say about the seven Kingdoms?

255
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Are you asking me

256
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
if I'm the same as Li Xun's

257
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
invincible general?

258
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I can tell you

259
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
that you are.

260
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You're exactly the same.

261
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I know you want to play against Li Xun.

262
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
But what's the point

263
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
of you being the same?

264
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I want to beat him so hard

265
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
that he can't turn over.

266
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I want him to know

267
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
that the game market is LP.

268
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Whatever.

269
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm not the spokesperson.

270
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You're not feeling well lately.

271
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Eat an egg.

272
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And replenish protein.

273
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I don't feel like eating this morning.

274
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Thank you. You eat.

275
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm going to take a shower.

276
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Sit down.

277
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Sit down.

278
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Eat an egg.

279
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You won't get fat.

280
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I feed you.

281
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Eat slowly.

282
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Eat slowly.

283
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Eat.

284
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Good boy.

285
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,600
I'll do it for you.

286
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,000
Hurry.

287
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,800
I'll do it for you.

288
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,200
Here. Are you ready?

289
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,400
One, two, three, swing.

290
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,000
One, two, three, swing.

291
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,600
Let's change our facial expression.

292
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,400
Swing.

293
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,200
Miss, I'll get you a shirt.

294
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,800
Here.

295
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,800
Here.

296
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
Thank you.

297
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
You're welcome.

298
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,000
Cappuccino.

299
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,400
No sugar.

300
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,000
Nannan, you've worked hard.

301
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,400
You're very pretty.

302
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,800
Gao, I want to study abroad.

303
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,800
So suddenly?

304
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,200
I'm not sure.

305
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,200
So suddenly? Why?

306
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,600
No reason. You know that.

307
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,200
I've always wanted to study abroad.

308
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,600
Besides, I have a lot of friends abroad.

309
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,800
I also haven't had a chance to go abroad.

310
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,200
It's a kind of remorseful regret, right?

311
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,400
Support.

312
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,200
Very much.

313
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,000
After a few years, I'll retire.

314
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,600
I'll go abroad with you.

315
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,600
We'll have another child.

316
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,000
It'll be a long time.

317
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,200
How about waiting for the end of the Seven Kingdoms War?

318
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,400
Not now.

319
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,200
The company needs you now.

320
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,400
General Manager Group

321
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:52,600
waterside

322
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,800
Chief Sir, we're stocking up amount of goods today?

323
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,600
This the construction capital I usually use here

324
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,800
It's not as good as the material that I usually buy

325
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,600
How will I get valuable funds to stock goods today?

326
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,240
I'm going to make a lot of money

327
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,680
to collect more people

328
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,360
for today.

329
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,440
Good for you, Mr. Zhang Fang.

330
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,600
You're going to spend money.

331
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,160
Collecting is easy.

332
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,960
What?

333
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:16,760
I...

334
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:24,840
Zhang Fang,

335
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,280
you even got the wrong name.

336
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,960
Yeah, I even got the wrong name.

337
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,280
Do you know what you're doing?

338
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,000
You...

339
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,800
Go, go, go.

340
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,600
L.O.P.

341
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,240
Oh.

342
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,360
Let'sés

343
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:49,920
over there.

344
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,840
What's going on here?

345
00:17:34,680 --> 00:18:03,760
He has a good team thick

346
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,760
Ten years

347
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,640
Why are they so shameless?

348
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,240
State of the nation

349
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,240
Person, engine, gameplay, skin

350
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,480
This is all like us

351
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:16,680
If you don't say

352
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,960
I thought it was our turn

353
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,800
Really shameless

354
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,120
You said they did it

355
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,360
So obvious

356
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,040
We

357
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,320
Can we sue him

358
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,240
sue

359
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,320
What to sue

360
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,960
Speaking of which, I still remember

361
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,800
They are not the first time

362
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,680
Did this kind of thing

363
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,040
It's their LP

364
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,560
Famous lawyer team

365
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,400
I guess it's just

366
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,720
I did this kind of thing

367
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,080
I didn't win a family before

368
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,720
Shameless

369
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,040
Did you bring the handkerchief?

370
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:40,800
Handkerchief

371
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,880
In the box

372
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,320
So rough

373
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,880
Just this amount

374
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,520
It's good for others to do it

375
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,240
Put it on

376
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,520
Where is Director Zhu

377
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,360
He is on his way

378
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,000
Call him

379
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,840
Let him not come

380
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,680
why

381
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,720
You all want to sue them

382
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,200
What do you think

383
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,280
Sir, sir

384
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,880
I'm going to two

385
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,480
The signal

386
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,680
Enter the signal

387
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,160
Endure

388
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:20,960
Endure

389
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,760
Over there

390
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,080
Sir

391
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:26,600
Shoot

392
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Good points

393
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,680
Educational Roth 좋아요

394
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,240
instructor

395
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,880
Miss

396
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,480
Take you first

397
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,680
Girl

398
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,520
What are you doing?

399
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,720
Zwilie

400
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,840
===

401
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,340
What are you doing?

402
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,580
I'm bending

403
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,860
I know you didn't mean it

404
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,740
You are the best

405
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,020
It's a coincidence

406
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,660
Big and fragile

407
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,500
Small and strong

408
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,180
It's pretty strong

409
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,860
But I don't know how long it can last

410
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,740
if it is baked on the fire

411
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,940
You can try it

412
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,100
You use the invincible weapon

413
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,940
I thought it was made of ore

414
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,260
I just set a five-power system for the weapon

415
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,540
The higher one is faster

416
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,660
The lower one is slower

417
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,300
Who will play such a miserable game?

418
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,860
What are you talking about?

419
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,380
We have 50 characters in the game

420
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,700
More than 200 weapons

421
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,540
Choosing play style and strategy is the most important

422
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,340
You are so angry

423
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,820
I tried it just now

424
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,100
What do you say?

425
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,020
The weapon is self-cultivated

426
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,660
I just set more skin and props

427
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,580
Try to make the player feel ashamed

428
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,580
Shameless

429
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,780
Yixun, you waste your time

430
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,180
Is it meaningful to work with these brainwaters?

431
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,660
You are more clever than me

432
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,620
I am more clever than you

433
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,660
I can change the creative of the bank

434
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,180
I can earn the money of the users

435
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,180
Shameless

436
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,460
I tell you

437
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,220
We will continue to promote such a good game

438
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,900
We will continue to promote

439
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,900
We will update the program every month

440
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,700
Yes

441
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,580
Good luck

442
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,900
I hope that when the next update is released

443
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,580
someone will remember the invincible weapon

444
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,180
what

445
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,580
Allow the plugin to talked about

446
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,180
Ok

447
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,580
How short it is

448
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:06,980
all right

449
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,580
Yixun, my debt

450
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,420
It doesn't matter

451
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,420
It doesn't matter

452
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,340
Thank you

453
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:15,820
Thank you

454
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,580
You rascal

455
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,380
You watch me

456
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,220
I...

457
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,420
What are you doing?

458
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,420
Who are you

459
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,580
I still can't remember

460
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,320
Not yet

461
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:32,820
Li Xun

462
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:33,980
What time to buy a springbook

463
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:34,780
I have no time

464
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,180
How long does it take to buy a springbook

465
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,180
Ok

466
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,700
Aunt

467
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,620
You still think about that stupid girl

468
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,340
It's obvious.

469
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,100
It's okay.

470
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,980
Tomorrow, they will update the version.

471
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,300
Teacher Duan will have a good show.

472
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,180
Inline.

473
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:35,980
Come on, I'll do it.

474
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,100
They have Officer.

475
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,740
I don't know what is

476
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,820
IMP concerned right now.

477
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,220
Here he is again.

478
00:23:53,580 --> 00:24:01,120
The

479
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,120
it is Li Xun

480
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,120
how do you know

481
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,120
she hid her IP address

482
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,120
but I'm so familiar with her style

483
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,120
then I will go help her

484
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,120
wait

485
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,120
do not care

486
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,120
you need

487
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,120
illegal entry into the computer system

488
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,120
you need to be sentenced

489
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,520
How long will he be sentenced?

490
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,880
Isn't it good

491
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,640
to have Li Xun convicted?

492
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,640
So you want

493
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,520
me to send him back to his hometown?

494
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,320
Now this thing

495
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,600
is so cold.

496
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,640
Do you know what you did?

497
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,920
It's nothing.

498
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,440
Nothing?

499
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,880
You went straight to the server

500
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,080
that's fighting for the country.

501
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,280
Do you really think I can't find out

502
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,120
who you are

503
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:10,840
by looking at those experts?

504
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,680
Try it.

505
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,680
Tomorrow at 8 a.m.,

506
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,400
I'll have them

507
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,080
check the server.

508
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,080
It's not ten days or half a month.

509
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:16,840
Don't think about it.

510
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,840
Did I tell you

511
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,760
that you can't take action

512
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,600
without my permission?

513
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,120
No.

514
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,040
No.

515
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,280
What are you afraid of?

516
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,480
You didn't say

517
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,520
if they could find me or not.

518
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,360
Even if they did,

519
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,360
what could they do?

520
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:29,880
Tong Ning.

521
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,640
You want to go back to the prison.

522
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,480
No one can stop you.

523
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,520
You can leave now.

524
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,720
I saw them

525
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,800
torturing you so badly.

526
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,640
I can't bear to see it.

527
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,600
Do I need to look for you?

528
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,320
Why are you yelling?

529
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:47,880
No.

530
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,080
I just can't figure it out.

531
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,040
We are both capable.

532
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,640
Why would we

533
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,560
have to live in this place?

534
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,160
I'm not a coward.

535
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,960
I'm a coward.

536
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,720
I'm a coward.

537
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,840
I'm willing to be with you

538
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,840
in this shabby place

539
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,240
to cook you this shabby meal.

540
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,800
I don't deserve to live in prison.

541
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,560
I deserve it.

542
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,840
You insist on making yourself strong.

543
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,720
No one can stop me.

544
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,920
Who is making himself strong?

545
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:05,960
Who?

546
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,760
Police.

547
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,760
We are from the city police.

548
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,080
Yuxu, don't stop me.

549
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,160
I don't want to be in prison anymore.

550
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,840
I don't want to.

551
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,560
Calm down.

552
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:15,880
Tong Ning.

553
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,240
Trust me.

554
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,400
I will never be able to

555
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,600
let you in again.

556
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,560
You are looking for Hou Ling, right?

557
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,680
Someone reported that

558
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,000
you illegally entered

559
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,920
the server of the LOP game company.

560
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,320
Please go back to the station

561
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,040
and investigate with us.

562
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,520
He...

563
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,440
He just told the old woman.

564
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,640
What has he done?

565
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,080
He just got into the station.

566
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,120
He seems to be quite good.

567
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,880
He is so arrogant.

568
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,040
Li Xun really cleared the virus, right?

569
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,400
It doesn't matter.

570
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,520
We can make our own losses

571
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,240
without any losses.

572
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,880
Crystal Scream.

573
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,840
You mean

574
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,240
they only got the virus

575
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,880
and cleared the virus, right?

576
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,920
Right.

577
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,600
Our police,

578
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,600
We didn't cause any loss to the LP company.

579
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
I just want to make a misunderstanding.

580
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,600
No loss?

581
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,600
That's not right.

582
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,600
Yixun, you're too cruel.

583
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
Although the virus has been eliminated,

584
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
but the most valuable core user data of our company,

585
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,920
the core user data of the Seven Kingdoms'

586
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,600
has also been deleted by you.

587
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,600
You can't compete with them,

588
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,600
so you started to use these side ways.

589
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,600
You're going to destroy my Seven Kingdoms'

590
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,600
and my Seven Kingdoms' competition.

591
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
Gao Jianhong,

592
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,600
stop making a fool of yourself.

593
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
Who touched your user data?

594
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,600
Comrade police,

595
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,600
this is the data that our security department

596
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,600
has taken.

597
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,600
We have sufficient evidence to prove

598
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,600
that while Yixun is eliminating the virus,

599
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,600
he also removed the most important game

600
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
of our company, the core data assets of the Seven Kingdoms'

601
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,600
and the Seven Kingdoms' competition.

602
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,600
Lawyer Wang.

603
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,600
According to the 285th rule of the National Penal Code,

604
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
it violates the national rule

605
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,600
to enter the computer's

606
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,600
external computer information system

607
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,600
or use other technical methods

608
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,600
to obtain the storage and processing data

609
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,600
in the computer information system

610
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,600
and to process the data.

611
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,600
Or to implement illegal controls

612
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,600
on the computer information system.

613
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,600
If the situation is serious,

614
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,600
there is a criminal record

615
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,600
or a criminal record of more than three years.

616
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,600
If the situation is particularly serious,

617
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,600
there is a criminal record of more than three years

618
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,600
and a criminal record of more than seven years.

619
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,600
To play these tricks of disbanding cases,

620
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,600
to be able to escape from the law,

621
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,600
you guys just wait to be jailed.

622
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,600
Do you have anything else you want to say?

623
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,600
Admit it.

624
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,600
You're a good man again

625
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,600
after a few years.

626
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,600
I'll wait for you.

627
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,600
Your family is here.

628
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,600
I have nothing to say.

629
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,600
He has something to say.

630
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,600
There is a saying in the hacker circle.

631
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,600
Everything is possible.

632
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,600
Whoever enters your server

633
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,600
will leave a mark.

634
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,600
I'm sorry.

635
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,600
I'm sorry.

636
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,600
I'm sorry.

637
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,600
I'm sorry.

638
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,600
I'm sorry.

639
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,600
I'm sorry.

640
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,600
I'm sorry.

641
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,600
Zhu Yue,

642
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,600
what are you doing?

643
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,600
Someone entered your server

644
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,600
through the 1433 port.

645
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,600
Someone?

646
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,600
Isn't this person him?

647
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,600
Is it?

648
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,600
Police.

649
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,600
The 1433 port is CQ SAWA.

650
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,600
The TCB port of CQ SAWA

651
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,600
is used to provide service to the outside

652
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,600
of CQ SAWA.

653
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,600
Li Xun and Hou Ning

654
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,600
used this port

655
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,600
to clear our server

656
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,600
from the outside.

657
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,600
That's right.

658
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,600
When Li Xun entered your server

659
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
and cleared the virus

660
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,600
that Hou Ning was infected with,

661
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,600
you stopped using the 1433 port

662
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,600
from the outside.

663
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,600
You haven't recovered yet.

664
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,600
Yes.

665
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,600
We found someone entering

666
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,600
and closed the 1433 port from the outside.

667
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,600
But before that,

668
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,600
we had a part of

669
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,600
the core user data

670
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,600
deleted by Li Xun.

671
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,600
But according to the server

672
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,600
that Li Xun took,

673
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,600
the 1433 port

674
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,600
was used at 3.17 pm.

675
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,600
And the core user data

676
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,600
was deleted at 4.21 pm.

677
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
How did Li Xun

678
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,600
break through the 1433 port

679
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,600
and enter the server

680
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,600
when the port was used?

681
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,600
How did he delete the core user data?

682
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,600
They have the ability

683
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,600
to enter our server.

684
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
Of course, they can also

685
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,600
modify our daily documents.

686
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,600
It doesn't mean anything.

687
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,600
Mr. Gao,

688
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,600
you are very confident

689
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,600
in our ability.

690
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,600
It seems that we have to

691
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,600
give Mr. Gao a taste of the coffin.

692
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,600
Otherwise, Mr. Gao

693
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,600
will not be tired

694
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,600
without seeing the coffin.

695
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,600
Police,

696
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,600
a port is used from the outside.

697
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,600
It means that no one

698
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,600
can use this port

699
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,600
to enter the computer

700
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,600
from the outside.

701
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,600
Unless...

702
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,600
Unless...

703
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
Unless what?

704
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,600
Unless the port

705
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,600
is used from the inside.

706
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
It's this IP address.

707
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,600
Police,

708
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,600
the R&D department of LP

709
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,600
will definitely find

710
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,600
the person who uses this IP address.

711
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,600
He is the person who

712
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,600
entered the server

713
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,600
of the LP company

714
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,600
through the internal network

715
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,600
and deleted the core user data.

716
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,600
Mr. Jin,

717
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,600
how about this?

718
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,600
I will call our

719
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,600
technology personnel of LP

720
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,600
to make another verification.

721
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,600
We...

722
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,600
No need.

723
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,600
We will go back

724
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,600
and investigate ourselves.

725
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,600
We will definitely punish

726
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,600
the employees who violate

727
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,600
the company's rules.

728
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,600
We will never forgive them.

729
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,600
It's still Mr. Gao who made a mistake.

730
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,600
By the way,

731
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,600
Mr. Jin,

732
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,600
this pig's kidney

733
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,600
was just in front of you.

734
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,600
It was also exposed

735
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,600
to enter our company's internal network

736
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,600
and also deleted

737
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,600
our server's log.

738
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,600
It's illegal.

739
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,600
At least

740
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,600
it's a attempted crime

741
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,600
or a criminal act

742
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
for three years.

743
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,600
Is there any problem

744
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,600
with me entering

745
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,600
the internal network of our company?

746
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,600
Your internal network?

747
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,600
This IP address

748
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,600
is the platform

749
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,600
of our company's internal network.

750
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,600
Just to give you a demonstration,

751
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,600
the date

752
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,600
is only my estimate.

753
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,600
Although we are invincible,

754
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,600
compared to your seven states,

755
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,600
we are nothing.

756
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,600
But we are all game servers.

757
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,600
The principles are the same.

758
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,600
You didn't even see it, Mr. Gao.

759
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,600
Do you want to verify it again?

760
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,600
No need.

761
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,600
I have already checked it.

762
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,600
I have already checked it.

763
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,600
I have already checked it.

764
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,600
No need.

765
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,600
How is it?

766
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,600
Are you all right?

767
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,600
I'm fine.

768
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
Let's go.

769
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,600
I have warned you

770
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,600
not to take his advice again.

771
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,600
Do you know that

772
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,600
if you really cause

773
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
a loss to LP,

774
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,600
you will have to work for a few more years?

775
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,600
I just want to help him.

776
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
You are hurting him.

777
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,600
What right do you have to say that?

778
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,600
If it wasn't for you,

779
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,600
would he have entered?

780
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,600
Enough.

781
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,600
It has nothing to do with him.

782
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,600
It has nothing to do with him?

783
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
It has nothing to do with him.

784
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,600
Isn't it because of him

785
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,600
that you entered?

786
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,600
Shut up.

787
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,600
Let's go.

788
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,600
You promised.

789
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,600
Hong Ning, come back.

790
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,600
Come back.

791
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,600
Come down.

792
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,600
Come back.

793
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,600
Come down.

794
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,600
Xun Lan.

795
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,600
Hong Ning, are you crazy?

796
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,600
Yes.

797
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,600
I'm crazy.

798
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,600
Li Xun.

799
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,600
I'm not going to work for you.

800
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,600
I'm going to work for you.

801
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
I'm going to work for you.

802
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,600
I'm going to work for you.

803
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
I'm going to work for you.

804
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,600
Li Xun.

805
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,600
I'm crazy to live with you here.

806
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,600
Look.

807
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,600
Look at the people around you.

808
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,600
Is it normal for me to be alone?

809
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,600
The college classmates who live with you day and night

810
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,600
now can't wait for you to return to your original self.

811
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,600
And this person.

812
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,600
He doesn't do his job every day.

813
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,600
He just pretends to be you and this woman together.

814
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,600
He's like a pervert.

815
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,600
I'm not going. Who's a pervert?

816
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,600
Shut up.

817
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,600
And this person.

818
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,600
He's like a pervert.

819
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,600
He's been with that woman for a long time.

820
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,600
Can't you see it?

821
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,600
Tell me.

822
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,600
What else do you want to keep?

823
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,600
I've been missing you all.

824
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,600
Including you.

825
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,600
Bullshit.

826
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,600
Am I important to you?

827
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,600
I tell you.

828
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,600
You will come to me.

829
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,600
You will regret it.

830
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,600
Hong Nian.

831
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,600
Let her go.

832
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,600
Drink some hot water.

833
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,600
Don't catch a cold.

834
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,600
Thanks.

835
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,600
You'll catch a cold.

836
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,600
You drink.

837
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,600
Thanks.

838
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
You drink.

839
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,600
You drink.

840
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,600
You drink.

841
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,600
Thanks.

842
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,600
Put it on.

843
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,600
Change your clothes.

844
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
Don't catch a cold.

845
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,600
I'm fine.

846
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,600
What am I afraid of?

847
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,600
Just change it.

848
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,600
I'm fine.

849
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,600
Do you have pants?

850
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,600
Can you wear my pants?

851
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,600
I haven't worn it.

852
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,600
Give it to me.

853
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,600
Are you done?

854
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,600
You'd better let it go.

855
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,600
It's too big.

856
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,600
You still have a long skirt.

857
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,600
You want to try it?

858
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,600
Do you have a hair dryer?

859
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,600
No.

860
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,600
I don't have

861
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,600
something so ordinary

862
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,600
as your girls.

863
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,600
I'm fine.

864
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,600
I'm fine.

865
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,600
I don't have

866
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,600
anything so ordinary

867
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,600
as your girls.

868
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,600
Have a sleep.

869
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,600
Where will you sleep

870
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,600
if I'm sleeping?

871
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,600
I'll be working

872
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,600
in three hours.

873
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,600
Are you coming home?

874
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,600
I'll wait outside.

875
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,600
Change your clothes.

876
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,600
I'm fine.

877
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,600
Good night.

878
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,600
Why does Zhou Ermuxi

879
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,600
always chase us

880
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,600
and don't let us go?

881
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,600
Because of us.

882
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,600
Meixuan.

883
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,600
Have you ever thought about me?

884
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,600
What if I haven't?

885
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,600
I don't believe you.

886
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,600
I don't believe you.

887
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,600
I don't believe you.

888
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,600
I don't believe you.

889
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,600
I don't believe you.

890
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,600
I don't believe you.

891
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,600
I don't believe you.

892
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,600
I don't believe you.

893
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,600
Is it impossible for us?

894
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,600
I'm fine.

895
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,600
I'm fine.

896
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,600

I'm fine.

900
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,600
I'm fine.

901
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,600
I'm fine.

902
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,600
I'm fine.

903
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,600
I'm fine.
