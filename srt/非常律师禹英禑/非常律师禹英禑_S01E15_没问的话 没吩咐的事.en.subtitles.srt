1
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:04,189
Excuse me?
There's no way it says it's sold out.

2
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,192
I checked that it's already been shipped.

3
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,276
Yes.

4
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:11,154
It should arrive sometime in the morning
of the ninth for you.

5
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,697
CHOI JIN-PYO

6
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:13,907
I did check the size.

7
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,117
All right. Have a good one.

8
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,328
Hello, this is Raon.

9
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,245
Gosh.

10
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,330
Yes, ma'am.

11
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:24,000
Yes, the item you returned
was confirmed to be defective.

12
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:25,668
Yes.

13
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,254
CHOI JIN-HO: I REWROTE MY COVER LETTER
LIKE YOU TOLD ME TO!

14
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,508
-That was fast.
-Or would you prefer to get a refund?

15
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,221

00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,246
Hey, Jin-pyo. What's up?

21
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,790
Your cover letter file won't open.
Send it again.

22
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,042
I'll take a look at it at home.

23
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,544
I didn't send it to you.

24
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,337
You didn't?

25
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,056
What?

26
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,100
What?

27
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,020
I'll see you tomorrow.

28
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,982
Mr. Choi!

29
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,116
What?

30
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,118
What?

31
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,248
Jin-pyo.

32
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,125
Jin-pyo?

33
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,294
What's wrong?

34
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,008
Sir, I…

35
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,176
I think they got me.

36
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,469
What do you mean?

37
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:00,972
Spear Phishing.

38
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:13,693
CASE 15
SAYING AND DOING THINGS NOT ASKED

39
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,251
I don't think…

40
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,129
you and I should date.

41
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,221
Why are you saying that all of a sudden?

42
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,057
I'm sorry.

43
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,693
You have to stay strong, okay?

44
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:37,944
I am staying strong.

45
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,029
-I'm fine. Don't worry.
-All right.

46
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,869
Attorney Jung!

47
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,915
What?

48
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,125
Attorney Woo.

49
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,085
What brings you here?

50
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,753
The subway brought me here.

51
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,755
No. I mean…

52
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,009
Why are you here
when you should be at work?

53
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:04,178
Right. I wanted to see you, Attorney Jung.

54
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,598
Because if something goes wrong
and you die,

55
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,517
I won't be able to see you again.

56
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:10,977
Excuse me?

57
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,478
Mom.

58
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,897
Attorney Woo didn't mean it in a bad way.

59
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,357
Say hi. This is my mom.

60
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,527
Hello. My name is Woo Young-woo.

61
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,987
Whether it's read straight or flipped,
it's still Woo Young-woo.

62
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,406
Kayak, deed, rotator,
noon, racecar, Woo Young-woo.

63
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:27,118
-What?
-Mom, I told you.

64
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,162
Korea's number one in the world
in treating stomach cancer.

65
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:32,874
So with surgery,
the survival rate is over 70 percent.

66
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,125
Don't worry.

67
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:38,254
That's because that number
also includes cases of early detection.

68
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,214
With stage three stomach cancer like you,

69
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,966
the 5-year survival rate after surgery
is only 30 to 40 percent--

70
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,303
Shall we go in?

71
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,554
Yes.

72
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,890
Myeong-seok. Hang in there, okay?

73
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,309
-I'll be here.
-I'll see you later.

74
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,353
Please! Come back alive!

75
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,521
Attorney Woo.

76
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,315
Be quiet.

77
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:01,402
Please! Come back alive!

78
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,321
-You got this.
-Be quiet.

79
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,365
Please.

80
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,383
Namu Gwanseeumbosal.

81
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,440
Hello?

82
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,567
Where are you?
Come to the conference room.

83
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,028
We have a meeting
with our newly assigned clients.

84
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,114
I'm not at work right now.

85
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,658
Then hurry up and get here
as fast as you can.

86
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,202
Right, okay.

87
00:06:56,624 --> 00:07:00,294
It's a bit awkward to say this myself,

88
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,757
but certain people are cut out
for certain jobs, right?

89
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:08,302
Hanbada has a lot of good attorneys.

90
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:12,640
But for these corporate cases,
especially in tech, I…

91
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,689
There's another attorney on this case.
She must be here.

92
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,649
Come in.

93
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,320
As I was saying…

94
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,413
Come in already.
Why are you just standing there?

95
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,831
Our clients are here.

96
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:37,790
Right.

97
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,668
The shock of moving
from one space to another

98
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,628
is very overwhelming for me.

99
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,715
If I count to three and take a deep breath
before going in,

100
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,550
it lessens the shock a bit.

101
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,805
That happens to me sometimes too.

102
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,100
It's uncomfortable when
the space I'm in suddenly changes.

103
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,103
She's quite brave.

104
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,356
I don't want other people
to think I'm weird,

105
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,944
so I pretend that I'm not uncomfortable
even when I am.

106
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:10,156
Is something like that
funny to you right now?

107
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,657
Does it make you laugh?

108
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,243
Nothing's changed since we were in school.

109
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,412
I'm always the one
who takes things seriously.

110
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,332
Did you two go to the same university?

111
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,792
No, I didn't go to university.

112
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,545
We went to high school together.
And I graduated from Hana University.

113
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,880
Hana University?

114
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,133
Hey!

115
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,052
I mean, we're alumni.

116
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,098
I was a freshman
at Hana University in 2000.

117
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,476
I was a freshman in '97.

118
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,895
I was a freshman in '13.

119
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:44,357
In '13? Gosh, you're a baby.

120
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,691
Baby?

121
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,402
When I was in school,

122
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,405
you came as a special lecturer,

123
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,740
and it was very inspiring.

124
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,951
I couldn't believe
an alumnus from our school

125
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,495
created the online shopping mall
that the whole country uses.

126
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,747
-Gosh, you flatter me.
-You're really amazing.

127
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,582
Well…

128
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,584
It's not the whole country.

129
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:08,965
Based on a recent survey,
the number of Raon users is 40,954,173,

130
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:12,760
but the total population of Korea
is 51,628,117.

131
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:16,931
Same difference.

132
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,559
It means more than 80 percent
of the entire population uses Raon.

133
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,769
It really is amazing.

134
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,229
Amazing?

135
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,147
We're about to go under.

136
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,987
Shall we get back to business?

137
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:31,904
-Right.
-Yes.

138
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,950
So the employee in charge of the database
received an email from a hacker?

139
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:41,622
The hacker hacked into the inbox
of our employee in charge of the DB

140
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,917
and was aware of everything
he and his younger brother had discussed.

141
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,879
He even sent the email
using the younger brother's exact tone.

142
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,757
If the attachment containing the malware

143
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,884
was an executable installation file,

144
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,679
our DB manager
would have been more careful.

145
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,724
But since it was a document file,
he didn't think much of it.

146
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,769
I didn't know malware could be spread
with Word files.

147
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:04,937
Yes, it's possible.

148
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,856
And since it was malware

149
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,275
that was specially made
to attack a specific target,

150
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,777
it wasn't detected
by the anti-malware software.

151
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,446
Was the hacker caught?

152
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,447
No, the police think

153
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,824
it was done by North Korea's
Reconnaissance General Bureau.

154
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,242
But we're not sure yet.

155
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,161
North Korea's RGB?

156
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,663
Just a moment.

157
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:27,209
Will you take a quick look at this? Here.

158
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,212
Notice anything odd?

159
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,884
-"Prograhm"?
-Yes.

160
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,637
Apparently, North Koreans
spell "program" as "prograhm."

161
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,140
This probably isn't the only reason
they suspect North Korea,

162
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,767
but they're investigating.

163
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,061
If North Korea really is responsible,

164
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,064
it's going to be difficult
to catch the hacker.

165
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,274
Since political issues
will be involved as well.

166
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,694
No, the even bigger problem is
the Korea Communications Commission.

167
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:57,114
They imposed a 300 billion won
penalty surcharge on us.

168
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,034
And that's why we came to you.

169
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:03,871
If you think about it, we're victims
of a North Korean cyberattack.

170
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:08,084
Fining us 300 billion won just because
we couldn't safeguard some personal data?

171
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,044
That's just ridiculous, isn't it?

172
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:14,256
When the hacker broke into
our DB manager's computer,

173
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:19,053
the terminal connecting to the DB server
was up on the screen and still logged in.

174
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:22,765
So from the hacker's perspective,
he didn't have to go through

175
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,684
the trouble of finding out
the manager's ID and password

176
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,978
to connect to the server.

177
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,856
And this is what the KCC
is taking issue with.

178
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,569
That we didn't set an idle timeout
on our DB server properly.

179
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,280
By "idle timeout,"

180
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,700
you mean a "limitation on
the maximum connection time," right?

181
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:42,660
Yes.

182
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,412
After a certain amount of time,

183
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,705
the connection
would be blocked automatically.

184
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,875
You're not connected to the server
any longer than what's necessary.

185
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,671
And Raon's DB server
didn't have this setting in place?

186
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,047
No.

187
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,924
We didn't set it up.

188
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:01,887
From what I see,

189
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:06,642
I think the KCC accidentally added
a few too many zeros.

190
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:07,768
-What?
-What?

191
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:11,564
A few years back, Aha.com
also had a personal data breach.

192
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:15,568
Do you know how much Aha paid
for their penalty surcharge?

193
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,486
No, we don't.

194
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,905
There was an estimated leak
of two million accounts,

195
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,532
and they paid 70 million won.

196
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,741
What?

197
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:26,662
Yes. Meanwhile, JP Communications
had an even bigger breach.

198
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:29,081
Almost ten million accounts.

199
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:33,210
But their penalty surcharge
was a mere 100 million won.

200
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,838
Then why would they ask us
to pay 300 billion won?

201
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,340
Is it because our personal data breach
is the biggest?

202
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,178
Well, the data of more than
40 million people was leaked.

203
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,889
Forty million is nearly the entire…

204
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,686
I mean, it's 80 percent
of the population, right?

205
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:51,770
But…

206
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,982
it's not like we lost
40 million people's assets.

207
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,027
It's just personal data, right?

208
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,739
When most Korean people
make accounts online,

209
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,450
aren't they aware that their personal data

210
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,702
could be leaked?

211
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:09,038
Then why are they being like this to us?

212
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:13,125
The KCC couldn't have made a mistake
by adding too many zeros, right?

213
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,711
Of course not.

214
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:17,796
Well…

215
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,342
I know some people at the KCC.

216
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:26,388
I'll see if I can get the full picture
as to why the KCC did this

217
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,349
and how this is proceeding over there.

218
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,520
By the way,

219
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,565
no corporation has ever lost a trial
against the KCC so far.

220
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,319
The KCC is a government organization,
so they can't hire an expensive law firm.

221
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,781
So they always lose to corporations
that work with major law firms.

222
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,242
It'll be the same this time too.

223
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,785
Don't worry.

224
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:49,537
My fellow alumni.

225
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,307
What? I can't sit here?

226
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,686
There are plenty of other seats.

227
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,146
Okay.

228
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,692
Or you can just sit.

229
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,945
We've eaten together before.

230
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,656
Gosh, you keep changing your mind.

231
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,376
Right.

232
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,128
He and Young-woo broke up.

233
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,339
I didn't realize that Jun-ho
would be eating by himself.

234
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,675
Should we go join him at his table?

235
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,849
I don't think that will be necessary.

236
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,561
Jun-ho. You're eating by yourself today?

237
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,729
Can I sit here?

238
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,939
Sure.

239
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,568
-Jun-ho, you like sausages too?
-Right.

240
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,279
Jun-ho is Mr. Popularity of Hanbada.

241
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,447
He sure is.

242
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,034
Who were you worried about again?

243
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,955
-That color looks so good on you.
-I know, right?

244
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,542
Have some of this too.

245
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,472
A MERE 100 MILLION WON PENALTY SURCHARGE
FOR 7 BILLION PERSONAL DATA LEAKS

246
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,435
Come in.

247
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,400
Gosh, I knew it.

248
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,570
Why are you eating alone
cooped up in your office?

249
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:47,655
Right.

250
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:48,948
I have work to do.

251
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:52,868
That's all the more reason
to go outside for lunch.

252
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:57,122
You should also eat lunch
and have coffee with other guys.

253
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,249
The weather is so nice today.

254
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,132
What happened with Jun-ho?

255
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,260
What do you mean?

256
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,681
I heard you called things off.
Why did you do that?

257
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,227
Well…

258
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,521
You didn't even give him
a proper explanation?

259
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,564
No.

260
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,566
Are you serious?

261
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,610
That's so rude.

262
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,822
You called things off
and you still haven't told him why?

263
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,496
I don't think it's appropriate to discuss
personal matters during work hours.

264
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,248
It's lunchtime right now.

265
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,668
Then should we talk about whales?
Lunchtime is when I usually talk--

266
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,670
No, I don't want to.

267
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:45,879
Just answer my question.

268
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,942
What are you doing?

269
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,157
Lunchtime is now over.

270
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,076
It's work hours again.
No more talking about personal matters.

271
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,871
Hey, Young-woo!

272
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,706
Where are you going?

273
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,291
Hey…

274
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,964
Come in.

275
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,560
What brings you here?

276
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,234
Well…

277
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,071
Attorney Jang.

278
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,698
It's not a mistake
that the KCC imposed Raon

279
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,825
with a 300 billion won penalty surcharge.

280
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,286
Excuse me?

281
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:02,956
The KCC didn't accidentally add
a few too many zeros.

282
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,211
Then what is it?

283
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:12,007
Did you find the answer
as to why the KCC did that?

284
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,895
A MERE 100 MILLION WON PENALTY SURCHARGE
FOR 7 BILLION PERSONAL DATA LEAKS

285
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:28,190
"Over the past decade, there have been
seven billion personal data leaks,

286
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,858
but only light punishment
has been imposed."

287
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,818
"The strengthening of punishment

288
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,529
such as introducing a class action system
and expanding punitive damages is needed."

289
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,241
There are a lot of similar articles.

290
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,118
Public opinion on personal data leakage

291
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,788
is leaning toward the necessity
of strengthening punishment for companies.

292
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:43,831
So what?

293
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,875
The KCC read a few newspaper articles

294
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,003
and raised the penalty surcharge

295
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,798
from 100 million to 300 billion won
out of nowhere?

296
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:53,924
The Act on the Information
and Communications Network

297
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,217
is revised frequently.

298
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,595
Back when the KCC imposed penalties
of 70 million won and 100 million won

299
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,890
on Aha.com
and JP Communications respectively,

300
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,519
the law had set the maximum
penalty surcharge as 100 million won.

301
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,146
However, under the current law,

302
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,023
a penalty surcharge
of up to three percent of sales

303
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,942
related to the violation can be imposed.

304
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,945
Which is why it became possible
to fine 300 billion won.

305
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,958
She's so arrogant.

306
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,170
Sorry? I didn't quite catch that.

307
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,143
This is your first time
working with me, right?

308
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,436
Yes.

309
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,439
From now on,
there's only one rule you have to follow.

310
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,108
Don't say anything you haven't been asked

311
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,651
and don't do anything
you haven't been asked to do.

312
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,445
Understood?

313
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,698
Aren't those two rules?

314
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,159
What's that?

315
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,785
"Don't say anything
you haven't been asked," one.

316
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,454
"Don't do anything
you haven't been asked to do," one.

317
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,455
That's two in total.

318
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,249
Whether it's one or two,
do you understand?

319
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,211
Yes, I understand.

320
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:25,390
I brought some side dishes
for your mother, Attorney Jung.

321
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,393
I run a pub

322
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,521
so it seems like all these side dishes
should go with drinks.

323
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,066
Then she can have a drink with them.

324
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,109
It's hard to look after someone
while sober.

325
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,736
She quit drinking.

326
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:38,779
I see.

327
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:41,740
Thank you so much
for also thinking of my mother.

328
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,283
Gosh. No need to thank me.

329
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,118
I'm just glad your surgery went well.

330
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,496
I'll put the food in the fridge.

331
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,962
What's wrong, Attorney Woo?

332
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,338
Is something bothering you?

333
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,925
-Yes, something is bothering me.
-What is it?

334
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:05,180
I can't tell you the details
because of attorney-client privilege.

335
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,934
Then be vague about it
and don't get into the details.

336
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,227
Well…

337
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,607
What do I do
if a senior attorney on a case with me

338
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,193
will not listen to what I have to say?

339
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,988
Who's the senior attorney
on the case with you?

340
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,031
Attorney Jang.

341
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,366
Damn it.

342
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,664
Well, for your sake,

343
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:34,960
lowering yourself and not doing anything
that might set him off could be a way…

344
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,003
Where are you going?

345
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,337
Gosh.

346
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,882
Young-woo, he didn't mean that literally!

347
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:45,846
But…

348
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,890
you could never do that, right?

349
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,059
You don't even get
what "lower yourself" means.

350
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,770
Then what do I do?

351
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,941
Attorney Woo,

352
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,860
you have colleagues.

353
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:01,945
Talk to them.

354
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,614
If you can't get through
to a senior attorney,

355
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,950
have even more discussions
with your colleagues.

356
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,015
Its name reflects the fact
that it's a cyberattack

357
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:33,143
that targets the weak spot
of a specific individual or organization,

358
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:38,148
much like throwing a spear.

359
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:42,986
The attack on Raon's DB manager,
Mr. Choi Jin-pyo,

360
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,781
was also spear phishing.

361
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:49,951
The hacker used spear phishing

362
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,662
to get malware onto Mr. Choi's computer

363
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,539
and then proceeded with an APT attack.

364
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,501
In other words, the Advanced Persistent--

365
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,877
Plaintiff's counselor.

366
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,214
I appreciate the generous explanation,

367
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:06,885
but the plaintiff, defendant,
and judges here

368
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:09,054
all know what an APT attack is,

369
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,807
so can we move on?

370
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,558
Well…

371
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:18,188
You know what
an Advanced Persistent Threat is?

372
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:23,443
It means to attack the target
in a continuous, sophisticated manner.

373
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,362
Yes.

374
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:28,323
If this were a jury trial,

375
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:30,992
you would have to explain all the details.

376
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,619
But right now, it's just us,

377
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:36,706
and most of the people in the audience
seem to be reporters.

378
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,126
So why don't you just
get to your argument?

379
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:40,794
Sure.

380
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,357
Just a moment.

381
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,986
The tablet.

382
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,114
Jeez, I'm not a mind reader.

383
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:14,035
As such, to impose
such a huge penalty surcharge

384
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,121
of 300 billion won on Raon,

385
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:20,876
who is also a victim of this hacking,

386
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:25,589
is both a deviation and abuse
of discretionary power by the KCC.

387
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,550
It's neither a deviation nor an abuse
of discretionary power.

388
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,427
According to the Act on the Information
and Communications Network,

389
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,471
the defendant can impose on the plaintiff

390
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:38,226
a penalty surcharge of up to three percent
of sales related to the violation.

391
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:42,314
Raon's sales last year
were 30.3 trillion won.

392
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,943
The defendant could have imposed
a penalty surcharge of 900 billion won,

393
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,404
but took into account
the plaintiff's circumstances

394
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:51,323
and imposed only 300 billion won,

395
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,950
which is much less than
the maximum amount.

396
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:59,414
When Aha.com and JP Communications
leaked personal data,

397
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:02,167
the defendant imposed penalties
of 70 million won

398
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,794
and 100 million won, respectively.

399
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:08,840
However, to impose 300 billion won
for the same issue

400
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,801
just because the law was revised

401
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:15,931
is far too unfair.

402
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:20,602
Forty million personal data records
were leaked due to Raon's carelessness.

403
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,438
They leaked the personal data
of the entire country--

404
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:25,607
It's not the entire country.

405
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:29,402
Korea's population is 50 million.

406
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:33,907
It would be more accurate to say
80 percent of the entire country.

407
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,370
Yes, Your Honor. I stand corrected.

408
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:42,999
They leaked the personal data
of 80 percent of the entire country.

409
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,044
How much would be fair then?

410
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,965
-That…
-The leaked data from this Raon incident

411
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,342
isn't just basic personal data.

412
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:56,805
Credit and financial transaction data
of 40 million people

413
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,723
have all been exposed.

414
00:25:58,807 --> 00:25:59,849
But they're saying

415
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:03,937
that the penalty surcharge, which is only
one percent of their sales, is too much?

416
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:08,358
This kind of attitude
shows Raon's low level of awareness

417
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:11,486
of their users' personal data.

418
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,911
That is all.

419
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:35,885
What's important
in this situation is causation.

420
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:36,803
You know the difference

421
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:39,014
between an administrative fine
and a penalty surcharge, right?

422
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,974
No, not really.

423
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:47,105
Not having set up the idle timeout itself
falls under an administrative fine.

424
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,733
It's less than 30 million won at most.

425
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:53,111
But if not having
this idle timeout in place

426
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:56,281
is what caused this personal data breach,

427
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:00,285
then it falls under a penalty surcharge.

428
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:04,539
And the amount would also increase
to three percent of related sales.

429
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,041
All right.

430
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,459
So…

431
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:13,840
if an idle timeout
was set on Raon's servers,

432
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:17,385
could it have prevented
the personal data breach?

433
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,015
That's like asking,
"If the front door was locked,

434
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:26,144
would a thief still have been able
to steal from inside the house?"

435
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,981
It depends on the capability
of the hacker,

436
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:33,443
but we don't know who hacked us
because they haven't been caught yet.

437
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:36,237
But you're an expert.

438
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,198
I'm asking you to take a guess.

439
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:44,746
This is something that will decide whether
it's a 30 million won administrative fine

440
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:48,083
or a 300 billion won penalty surcharge.

441
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,211
Hey, Jin-pyo.

442
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,755
There was a keylogger in the malware
installed on your computer, right?

443
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:54,839
What?

444
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,716
Yes, there was.

445
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,801
A keylogger?

446
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:02,806
If a keylogger is installed,
they can see what is being typed.

447
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:06,101
If Jin-pyo typed his ID and password
to connect to the server,

448
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,644
they could see that too.

449
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:10,480
It would just take a bit longer
for them to get the information.

450
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:16,694
So even if the idle timeout was set,
it couldn't have prevented the hacking?

451
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,988
There's no causation between the two?

452
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,073
That's right.

453
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,620
Excuse me.

454
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,539
I just got a phone call.

455
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:31,835
Our users are filing
a class-action lawsuit against us.

456
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,504
A class-action lawsuit?

457
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:38,216
To claim damages
for the personal data breach.

458
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,677
Which law firm is representing them?

459
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:47,684
What law firm has nothing better to do
than take on this tiresome case?

460
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:48,977
It's…

461
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:50,937
Taesan Law Firm.

462
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,191
Taesan?

463
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:59,320
Apparently, they're recruiting litigants
through a website.

464
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,949
I found the website you just mentioned.

465
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,367
That was quick.

466
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:05,869
It's been less than a month
since the website launched

467
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,370
but there are already a million people.

468
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,708
It seems like they're planning to claim
100,000 won for each victim.

469
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,794
Attorney Jang, what do we do?

470
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,255
The penalty surcharge
isn't important anymore.

471
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:18,840
If they already have a million people
in less than a month,

472
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,217
it's only a matter of time
before they have 40 million.

473
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,595
And if 40 million people
each claim 100,000 won,

474
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:24,971
it's four trillion won in total.

475
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,807
That would be the end of us.

476
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,686
Raon will go bankrupt.

477
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:42,197
Sir, you need to be even calmer
in a situation like this.

478
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,993
This is how it is
for personal data breach cases.

479
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,621
In addition to
the liability under public law

480
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,414
of having to pay a fine or surcharge,

481
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,500
you'll also be expected to
bear liability under the "jurisdiction"

482
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,210
through civil lawsuits.

483
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:57,086
Now--

484
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,297
Please be mindful of your pronunciation.

485
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:09,933
What?

486
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:14,354
The way you pronounced it
refers to "jurisdiction."

487
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:17,816
The last syllable must be stressed
in the Korean word for "private law."

488
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,818
Although the two are spelled the same,

489
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:24,280
they mean completely different things
based on their pronunciation.

490
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,574
Attorney Woo.

491
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,953
Is that something
you should be saying to me right now?

492
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:32,831
Are you teaching me
how to pronounce words?

493
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,377
-Attorney Jang.
-Yes.

494
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,753
May I have a word with you?

495
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,338
-Let's go outside.
-Yes.

496
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,600
I looked into it

497
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,311
and he had been quite active
with Hana University's alumni association.

498
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,605
Who?

499
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,607
Our presiding judge.

500
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,402
Right. Hana University? Yes.

501
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,779
Can we use that to our advantage?

502
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,364
Excuse me?

503
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:09,617
Within the business industry,
we treat each other to dinners.

504
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,537
If things aren't too different
in the judicial world,

505
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,081
I was wondering
if we could benefit from it.

506
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,249
Right.

507
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,794
Yes, that's right.

508
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:25,925
"Raon, who failed to protect the personal
information of 40 million users,

509
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,468
filed a lawsuit
against the penalty surcharge,

510
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,804
which accounts for
only one percent of its sales."

511
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,639
"This fact in itself shows

512
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:35,935
Raon's ridiculous level of awareness
of their users' personal information."

513
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,354
My gosh.

514
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,773
Do you know how many articles
like this are up right now?

515
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,651
It's as if we're doing the trial
to set our client up for criticism.

516
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,278
I'm sorry.

517
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,196
The comments are even worse.

518
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,242
"They make 30 trillion a year,
but they're whining about 300 billion?"

519
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,661
"They leaked the personal data
of the entire country

520
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,039
but are acting like victims
for being hacked."

521
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:59,292
How did you set up your defense
for public opinion to be this bad?

522
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:02,795
The penalty surcharge that was
below 100 million won for a similar case

523
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:05,423
has skyrocketed to 300 billion won
this time.

524
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:09,677
Which is why we pointed out the KCC's
deviation and abuse of discretionary power

525
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,055
and raised the issue of fairness.

526
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,352
We'll find another way.

527
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:19,938
What other way?

528
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,564
We're thinking about claiming

529
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,650
that there is no direct causation

530
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:26,653
between the KCC's grounds
for their disposition and the hacking.

531
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:29,197
You know that the second round,
which is the class-action lawsuit

532
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,240
that Taesan is preparing,
is more important, right?

533
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,159
Yes, I'm aware.

534
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,911
We need to win this lawsuit

535
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:37,330
to have the upper hand
in the class-action lawsuit.

536
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:41,876
It's already bad enough to see
Taesan representing 40 million citizens.

537
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,212
But imagine us losing that fight.

538
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,218
Let's not make that our reality, okay?

539
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,388
Yes, ma'am.

540
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,890
I won't let that happen.

541
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,475
We'll win this.

542
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:58,935
Whatever it takes.

543
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,318
What's so important
about the pronunciation of a word?

544
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,820
What's so important about that?

545
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:09,904
What?

546
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:13,324
Attorney Choi,
you know how to get fired up.

547
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:17,078
Who cares as long as you can understand?

548
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,913
Why would you nitpick about that?

549
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,583
Things are different
from when we worked with Attorney Jung.

550
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,460
They are?

551
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,713
Of course, they are.

552
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,382
Attorney Jung is…

553
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,134
Well…

554
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,344
He's generous with you.

555
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:36,055
He just accepts or moves past
whatever weird thing you say.

556
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,142
"Don't say anything
you haven't been asked,

557
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,643
and don't do anything
you haven't been asked to do."

558
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,353
Yes, that's right.

559
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:43,938
Just stick to that.

560
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:48,818
ATTORNEY JANG SEUNG-JUN

561
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:50,820
Yes, Attorney Jang.

562
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:52,405
Yes, all right.

563
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,073
Okay.

564
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,579
-Where are you going?
-What?

565
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,372
He asked to see me.

566
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,874
Just you?

567
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,876
-Yes.
-Why?

568
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,086
I don't know.
I'll find out when I get there.

569
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,600
Are you sure this will be enough?

570
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,935
Should I have made
a reservation at a hostess bar?

571
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:27,023
We should start off lightly.

572
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,275
There are some people

573
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:32,028
who are uncomfortable
with things like that.

574
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,029
Okay.

575
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,530
Then,

576
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,201
should I not give this to him today?

577
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,957
Goodness. Well…

578
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,212
Why don't we see how things go?

579
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,379
Right.

580
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:51,923
It's this way.

581
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,396
What do you think you're doing?

582
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,525
Sir, as I told you--

583
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,486
You said there was
a Hana University alumnus in a tough spot.

584
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:17,448
Didn't you tell me I would just be giving
some light legal advice?

585
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,577
What kind of person do you think I am?

586
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:26,499
Sir. I am a Hana University alumnus
who's in a tough spot.

587
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,459
Please hear me out…

588
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,879
even if it's just for five minutes.

589
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,720
This is undeniably
an improper solicitation attempt.

590
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,724
Be grateful
that I won't cause an issue with this,

591
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,935
and don't ever do this again.

592
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,897
Sir.

593
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:51,899
Sir!

594
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,192
Your Honor!

595
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,110
Gosh.

596
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:55,820
Your Honor!

597
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,536
Attorney Jang.

598
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,038
What do I do now?

599
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,293
What do I do?

600
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:25,600
Plaintiff.

601
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,853
Do you have anything else to claim?

602
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:41,866
This time…

603
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,122
you go ahead, Attorney Choi.

604
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,334
Right, okay.

605
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:04,972
We admit that the plaintiff
did not set the idle timeout.

606
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:09,018
In other words, a limit
on the maximum connection time.

607
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,605
But this is merely
a violation of protocol,

608
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:15,233
and thus, subject to an administrative
fine of less than 30 million won,

609
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,152
not a penalty surcharge
of 300 billion won.

610
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:23,491
Because there is no causation
between not setting up the idle timeout

611
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,159
and the hacking.

612
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,663
There's no causation?

613
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:29,830
No, Your Honor.

614
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:34,460
There was a keylogger within the malware
that the hacker installed

615
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:35,920
on Mr. Choi's computer.

616
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:40,633
The hacker would have been able to use
this keylogger to track everything

617
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,885
that was being typed
on Mr. Choi's computer.

618
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,972
Therefore, it would have only been
a matter of time for the hacker

619
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,932
to find out the ID and password
to connect to the server.

620
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:48,891
This means that

621
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:52,979
even if the plaintiff had set a limit
on the maximum connection time,

622
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:56,440
they wouldn't have been able
to prevent the personal data breach.

623
00:37:56,524 --> 00:38:00,528
What does the defendant think
about the plaintiff's claim?

624
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,739
The causation between a limit
on the maximum connection time

625
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:07,326
and the personal data breach
is irrelevant.

626
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,705
Whether there is causation or not,

627
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,874
Raon is still subject to
a penalty surcharge.

628
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,877
-Excuse me?
-Irrelevant?

629
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,547
Why is that?

630
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,757
Because the day
the hacker broke into Raon's servers

631
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:25,970
and leaked users' personal data
was January 19, 2022,

632
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,222
which was when the Act on the Information
and Communications Network

633
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,765
was partially revised.

634
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,269
Act on Promotion of Information
and Communications Network Utilization

635
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:35,187
and Information Protection.

636
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:38,107
Article 64-3, Paragraph 1, Item 6.

637
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,235
Before it was revised,
it was the following.

638
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,404
"In the event in which measures
to protect personal data were not taken,

639
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,572
and therefore,
the user's personal information

640
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,533
is lost, stolen, leaked,
forged, altered, or damaged."

641
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,327
Yes, that's right.

642
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,496
Then do you also know how it was revised?

643
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,873
"In the event in which
the user's personal data

644
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:56,584
is lost, stolen, leaked,
forged, altered, or damaged

645
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,794
and no measures
to protect personal data were taken."

646
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,842
What's the difference?

647
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,095
Isn't it just the order of the phrasing
that has changed?

648
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,263
No.

649
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:10,890
Prior to the revision,

650
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:14,101
if the failure to take protective measures
toward personal data

651
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,812
is what caused the breach
of personal data,

652
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:19,106
then a penalty surcharge
would have been imposed.

653
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:23,527
Thus, it was clear that the inaction
had to be the cause of the breach.

654
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:26,447
However, the revised law states that

655
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,908
within a personal data breach,

656
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:33,162
in any event in which protective measures
toward personal data were not taken,

657
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:35,039
a penalty surcharge would be imposed.

658
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:39,794
Thus, if the breach and inaction
are both acknowledged,

659
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,588
the causation between the two
is irrelevant.

660
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,975
The defendant's counselor is right.

661
00:39:55,935 --> 00:40:00,731
The court will also be more careful
in the interpretation of the legal text.

662
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,321
Your Honor.

663
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:15,079
Millions of users are deleting
their Raon accounts every day.

664
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:17,915
And the website
that's preparing the class-action lawsuit

665
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,668
already has more than ten million members.

666
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,629
We're losing users while the compensation
for damages is increasing.

667
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,466
A penalty surcharge of 300 billion won?

668
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:31,303
Was it that wrong for us
to not have set up an idle timeout?

669
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,263
Do we…

670
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:36,559
Do we…

671
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,520
really have to pay this big of a price?

672
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,064
Why don't you calm down?

673
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:45,359
No other company has done its best
to satisfy users the way Raon has.

674
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,405
How are we supposed to stop a hacker
who is determined to break in?

675
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,491
To be disgraced as a company
that leaked the personal data

676
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,910
of the entire country
and to fall apart like this…

677
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,205
is unfair.

678
00:40:59,039 --> 00:40:59,957
It…

679
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,751
It really is…

680
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,087
unfair!

681
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,596
In-cheol.

682
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:19,977
Hey, what did you just swallow?

683
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,896
Spit it out, man. Hey, In-cheol.

684
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,689
What's wrong, In-cheol?

685
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:32,740
In-cheol!

686
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,534
Help!

687
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:37,369
In-cheol.

688
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:38,787
In-cheol.

689
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,791
Help, please!

690
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,418
Go do something. Hurry.

691
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:47,671
-In-cheol.
-Sir.

692
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,298
Spit it out, man.

693
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,467
Someone, please help.

694
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,760
Call an ambulance!

695
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:53,677
Hey, In-cheol.

696
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,012
Is he okay?

697
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:57,097
Please help!

698
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,768
In-cheol…

699
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,917
We've done everything
that was needed for now.

700
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,795
We'll keep monitoring his condition.

701
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,756
Okay. Can I stay here for a little while?

702
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,467
His parents aren't here yet.

703
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,513
And I can't just
leave him alone like this.

704
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,975
The other nurses and I
will be here with him.

705
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:45,062
Visiting hours aren't over yet,
so of course, you can stay.

706
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,205
How is Mr. Bae In-cheol doing?

707
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:06,500
You are his attorneys, right?

708
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,753
We gave him an antidote.

709
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,881
But he swallowed quite a lot of cyanide.

710
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:15,509
Regarding recovery,
we'll have to keep observing him.

711
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:18,804
I'll explain further
once his family gets here.

712
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,014
Thank you.

713
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,394
Jun-ho, you said there were
a lot of reporters outside, right?

714
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:26,478
Yes.

715
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:30,858
Then you should get the car
out to the front.

716
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,819
So we can get in right away
without any reporters stopping us.

717
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:34,903
Yes, all right.

718
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,617
We should go too.

719
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,618
Okay.

720
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,963
Are those reporters out there
all waiting for us?

721
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:57,676
They're probably waiting for an update
on how the CEO of Raon is.

722
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,137
What are we supposed to do
in this sort of situation?

723
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:01,972
What do you think?

724
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,974
Just keep your mouth shut
and don't say a word.

725
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:05,768
All right.

726
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:07,561
Let's go.

727
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,146
What? Okay.

728
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,951
Are you the attorneys for Raon?

729
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,161
How is Mr. Bae doing?

730
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:25,954
When will the trial continue?

731
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,998
Is it true Mr. Bae ingested poison?

732
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,250
How did he bring poison
into the courtroom?

733
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,045
What exactly was the poison
that Mr. Bae In-cheol ingested?

734
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,005
-Give us a comment.
-Is he awake?

735
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,507
Get in!

736
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,717
Excuse me, coming through.

737
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:41,595
-Excuse me.
-Coming through.

738
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:42,930
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

739
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,848
-Give us a comment.
-Attorney Jang?

740
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:48,394
-What the…
-Over here! Hurry!

741
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,481
-Hey, wait. What is he doing?
-What?

742
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:54,066
-Wait.
-Let's go.

743
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,567
What about the other attorneys?

744
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:58,529
It's too late for them. Drive!

745
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:02,366
-What about us?
-We're still here!

746
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:03,826
Attorney Jang!

747
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:04,785
Jun-ho!

748
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:05,869
What about us?

749
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,416
That's so petty of you.

750
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,334
-Let's go.
-This is betrayal.

751
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:13,836
Coming through, excuse me.

752
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:14,878
Please!

753
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,839
Excuse me. Let us through.

754
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:35,566
The food is ready.

755
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:42,531
But why are we the only customers here?

756
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:44,908
So that the three of you
can talk comfortably.

757
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:48,662
We're just being considerate
of our regulars.

758
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,748
We usually don't have any customers
except for her.

759
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,292
But that's strange.

760
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:56,795
Gosh, that's hot.
All of your food is so good.

761
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,589
Especially this fish cake soup.

762
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,174
-My goodness, Hairy Boss.
-Yes.

763
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,301
He likes the fish cake soup.
Make some noise!

764
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:04,094
Then it's on the house.

765
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:06,555
Free food that is more expensive
than the actual menu.

766
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:07,681
I'll go make more.

767
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,641
He's excited.

768
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:11,185
Hey, so…

769
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:23,447
Anyway, what did Attorney Jang say
after singling you out?

770
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,324
Oh, that?

771
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:28,619
It was nothing.

772
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:30,245
Really?

773
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:33,707
I thought it was Hana University alumni
getting together to scheme.

774
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:37,044
Jeez, Attorney Choi. You're so prejudiced.

775
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,838
So it's okay for SNU alumni
to put their heads together,

776
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,924
but when Hana University alumni do it,
it's scheming?

777
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:44,009
Put heads together? When did I do that?

778
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:44,927
You just--

779
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,387
Causation is a principle of law.

780
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:49,932
Are you talking about the case?

781
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,935
"Criminal Law, Article 17, Causation."

782
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:56,563
"Any act which is not connected with
the danger which is an element of a crime

783
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,857
shall not be punishable for the results."

784
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:01,777
That doesn't pertain only to criminal law,
but also to civil law.

785
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,363
Then the administrative punishment
should also be like that.

786
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:06,240
To punish Raon so severely
with a penalty surcharge

787
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:09,493
when there is no causation between
their action and the personal data breach

788
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:11,370
doesn't correspond
to the principles of the law.

789
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:14,831
But no matter how much we claim that,
if the opposing attorney says,

790
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,416
"This trial isn't to debate

791
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,835
the fairness of the Act on the Information
and Communications Network,"

792
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,754
we can't say much else.

793
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:23,006
We're not going to request an adjudication
on the constitutionality of statutes.

794
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:24,758
You're right.

795
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:27,135
Why did the hacker
have to choose that day?

796
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:29,888
If it were a day earlier, it would
have ended with an administrative fine.

797
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,017
"A day earlier"?

798
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,241
Article 64-3, Paragraph 1, Item 6

799
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:51,618
of the Act on the Information
and Communications Network

800
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,745
was revised on January 19, 2022.

801
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:57,249
The day the hacker got into Raon's server
and stole users' personal data

802
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,126
was also January 19, 2022.

803
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,169
Yes, so? What is it?

804
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:04,172
What day did the hacker send
the email to Mr. Choi?

805
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:09,720
January 18, 2022, at 11:14 p.m.

806
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:13,181
Mr. Choi checked his email
and downloaded the attached file

807
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:16,476
on January 18, 2022, at 11:48 p.m.

808
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,729
Wait, so then this…

809
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,397
The hacking started

810
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,026
a day before the Act on the Information
and Communications Network was revised!

811
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:33,243
Do you think this is some sort of game?

812
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,455
The judge doesn't really like us
to begin with,

813
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:39,333
and you want me
to lead with that nonsense?

814
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:41,960
It's not nonsense.

815
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:44,796
According to Article 14, Paragraph 1 of
the General Act on Public Administration,

816
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,506
one may ask for a disposition

817
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,675
based on the law
at the time of the violation.

818
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:55,682
I also know Article 14, Paragraph 1 of
the General Act on Public Administration,

819
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:58,226
and that applies only to facts

820
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:02,522
completed or terminated
before the enforcement of the new law.

821
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:04,900
For Raon,

822
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:08,695
the hacking might have taken place
before the new law was enforced,

823
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:13,617
but didn't the personal data leak
occur after?

824
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,077
Didn't it?

825
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,788
There's still room for argument.

826
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:20,957
According to Article 14, Paragraph 3 of
the General Act on Public Administration,

827
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,543
even in the event in which the law
before the revision needs to be applied,

828
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,254
if the new law makes
the sanctions lenient,

829
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,215
the new law is required to be applied.

830
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:31,385
For Raon, it is much more advantageous
for the plaintiff

831
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,220
if the law before the revision is applied,

832
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,806
so there is room for adjustment
according to the judge--

833
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,307
Stop it already!

834
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:45,524
Attorney Woo.

835
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:49,111
Do you know the law that well?

836
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:52,906
Who do you think you are
to try to teach me?

837
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:56,034
If you're so great,
you can do it by yourself!

838
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:06,795
As of today, Attorney Woo,
you are off this case.

839
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,971
Why are you just standing there?
Get out right now!

840
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:23,186
Attorney Jang.

841
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,438
What do you have to say?

842
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,732
Yes, I'm Attorney Jang. So what?

843
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,567
It's nothing.

844
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,360
We'll be on our way too.

845
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:31,945
But--

846
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,205
What's wrong with you?

847
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,124
If you want to suck up to him,
do it by yourself.

848
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,585
Why are you stopping me
from saying something?

849
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:49,171
Not all of the senior attorneys
we'll be working with

850
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:50,964
will be like Attorney Jung.

851
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:53,133
We have to learn how to act accordingly.

852
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,968
You can learn, Attorney Kwon.

853
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:56,970
Young-woo was kicked off the case
for no reason.

854
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:59,014
Can you still not see that we're different

855
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:00,640
from Attorney Woo?

856
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:02,476
What?

857
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,060
Attorney Woo…

858
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,521
is a genius.

859
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:11,318
She can do whatever she wants
and be kicked out like that,

860
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:14,070
and people will think of her as
a stubborn genius and understand her.

861
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,864
But we're different.

862
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,657
If we act like Attorney Woo,

863
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,701
we'll be treated as juniors
who can't please their seniors

864
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:22,078
and who are difficult to work with.

865
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,752
You're right.

866
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,756
You're so right
that it's getting on my nerves.

867
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:38,762
But can't you just be a fool for once?

868
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:43,934
"Fool"?

869
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,019
For your colleague.

870
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:47,771
For something you believe is right.

871
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:49,689
Can't you put down your tactics
and politics for a bit

872
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,566
and just be brave like a fool?

873
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:52,526
Why…

874
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:55,028
Why should I have to do that?

875
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:56,363
Because…

876
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:02,244
I like guys who are like that.

877
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:53,461
Attorney Woo.

878
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:56,673
Yes?

879
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,969
Why can't we be together?

880
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:05,390
Why on earth do we have to break up?

881
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:09,144
I've been thinking about it.

882
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,481
But I just can't figure out why.

883
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:22,407
I'm…

884
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:28,788
not sure if I'm someone

885
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,373
who can make you happy.

886
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:35,086
I think I'm just someone
you have to take care of.

887
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:41,217
Did you hear…

888
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:47,098
what my sister

889
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,684
said to me?

890
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:54,439
Is that why?

891
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,611
Attorney Woo,

892
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:03,281
I'm happy just being with you.

893
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:07,452
For me to be happy, I have to be with you!

894
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,623
But haven't you ever felt lonely

895
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:14,417
when you were with me?

896
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:24,177
All of my thoughts
tend to center around me,

897
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:28,098
so I make people close to me lonely.

898
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:33,687
I don't know when or why I do that.

899
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:37,649
And I don't know what I can do to stop it.

900
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,235
I…

901
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,406
like you.

902
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,868
But…

903
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:52,789
I'm afraid…

904
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,001
that I'll make you lonely.

905
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:36,624
What are you doing?

906
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:39,044
I want to say bye to Young-woo
before we leave.

907
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:40,045
Say bye?

908
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:43,089
Like "Bye, we're off to the trial
without you"?

909
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:46,384
Just get going.
Why do you care if I say bye or not?

910
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:49,179
Hurry up or you'll be late.

911
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:55,643
Come in.

912
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,022
Young-woo.

913
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:03,109
I'll see you later.
The Raon trial is today, remember?

914
00:56:05,361 --> 00:56:06,196
Right.

915
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:09,032
Should I get you something on my way back?

916
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:11,826
What about Choi Su-yeon gimbap today,
instead of Woo Young-woo gimbap?

917
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:14,204
There's no such thing
as Choi Su-yeon gimbap.

918
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:17,415
No, there isn't.

919
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:19,042
I'm going now.

920
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:21,044
Okay.

921
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,365
Also, the fact that

922
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:37,036
the victims are preparing for
a large-scale compensation lawsuit

923
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:41,624
is an overwhelming mental burden
for the plaintiff.

924
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,293
Of course,

925
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:46,045
with a personal data breach,
liability under public law

926
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,423
and liability under the "jurisdiction"
must both be--

927
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:50,967
Please be mindful of your pronunciation.

928
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,679
Excuse me?

929
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:56,931
You must stress the last syllable

930
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:59,309
when pronouncing the Korean word
for "private law."

931
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:03,021
They mean completely different things
based on their pronunciation.

932
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:04,981
Yes.

933
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:06,399
Continue.

934
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,526
Right.

935
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:10,904
How did I pronounce…

936
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:14,073
Never mind.

937
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,408
I apologize.

938
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,327
I will correct myself.

939
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:38,056
I'm sorry.

940
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:41,184
Your Honor,

941
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:42,519
Article 64-3, Paragraph 1, Item 6

942
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:44,979
of the Act on the Information
and Communications Network

943
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:48,441
was revised and enforced
on January 19, 2022.

944
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:52,195
The hacker also got into Raon's server
and stole personal data that same day.

945
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:55,365
But the day the hacker sent
the email with malware

946
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:57,825
to the DB manager, Mr. Choi Jin-pyo,

947
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:01,037
was a day earlier, January 18, 2022.

948
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:03,164
And?

949
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:06,167
What's your point?

950
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:07,835
I'm saying that the hacking began one day

951
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:10,964
before the Act on the Information
and Communications Network was revised.

952
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:20,390
According to Article 14 of
the General Act on Public Administration,

953
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:24,102
which states new laws do not apply
to facts that were completed

954
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:26,437
or terminated before
the enforcement of the new law,

955
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:27,730
the plaintiff is subject

956
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,857
to an administrative fine,
not a penalty surcharge,

957
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:32,610
in accordance with the Act
before its revision.

958
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,238
Attorney Choi, what are you doing?

959
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:37,490
Can't you see I'm in the middle
of my closing argument?

960
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,243
Stop it. Do you think Attorney Woo
would like this?

961
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:41,828
This isn't about Young-woo.

962
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:43,288
I'm doing what I feel is right.

963
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:48,710
Your Honor, the hacking may have begun
on January 18th,

964
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:52,088
but the leak of personal data happened
on January 19th.

965
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:55,425
After the revised Act on the Information
and Communications Network was enforced.

966
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:57,760
With what standard does
the defendant's counselor determine

967
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:00,555
to be the line between hacking
and the leak of personal data?

968
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:04,392
Doesn't a theft begin
the moment a thief breaks into a house?

969
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:05,893
Choi Su-yeon.

970
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:08,605
One more word and you're off the case.
Am I clear?

971
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:13,443
Your Honor, Article 14 of
the General Act on Public Administration,

972
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:15,695
which the plaintiff's counselor mentioned
as grounds for refutation,

973
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:19,574
only applies to facts
that were completed or terminated

974
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:22,869
before the enforcement of the new law.

975
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:24,954
Please make the judgment based on

976
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:29,584
when the leak of personal data ended,
not when the hacking began.

977
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:30,501
Your…

978
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:32,211
Let go!

979
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:35,548
According to Article 14, Paragraph 3 of
the General Act on Public Administration,

980
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,467
even in the event in which the law
before its revision needs to be applied,

981
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:40,053
if the new law
makes the sanctions lenient,

982
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:42,138
then application of
the new law is required.

983
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,515
In this case,

984
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,267
it is advantageous for the plaintiff

985
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:47,894
if the law before the revision is applied.

986
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:51,522
"When in doubt, rule for the accused,"

987
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:54,484
should not be a principle
that only applies to criminal law.

988
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:56,944
I plead for your broad generosity

989
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:59,614
in understanding
the plaintiff's circumstances.

990
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,127
That is an interesting point.

991
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:16,631
I'll make a decision
after careful deliberation.

992
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:22,470
Thank you.

993
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:24,097
That is all.

994
01:01:46,994 --> 01:01:48,621
WOO YOUNG-WOO GIMBAP

995
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:51,958
There are a few resorts across the country
that can be used

996
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:53,751
with the Hanbada employee membership.

997
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:55,795
Pick whichever one you want,

998
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:59,340
and take a couple of months off
with Young-woo.

999
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:01,551
Think of it as a paid vacation.

1000
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:06,305
Is this really necessary?

1001
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,933
I can stop it for now,

1002
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:12,311
but once the article is out,

1003
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:14,439
reporters will be
all over Attorney Woo too.

1004
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:19,026
Just lay low until things die down.

1005
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,237
She can return to Hanbada afterward.

1006
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:25,032
Return?

1007
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:28,661
Return to Hanbada
after the whole world finds out

1008
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:31,706
that she's Tae Su-mi's daughter
who was born out of wedlock?

1009
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:37,503
Will she be able to have a proper career
with that label on her?

1010
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:41,048
Look.

1011
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:44,719
You said you'd allow it once.

1012
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:49,599
You said you'd allow me to use
Attorney Woo to get Tae Su-mi

1013
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:51,893
in return for giving her a job at Hanbada.

1014
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:53,561
Why are you going back on your word?

1015
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:58,191
Seon-young.

1016
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:00,860
Is there no other way?

1017
01:03:02,653 --> 01:03:06,199
Is there really no other way
besides revealing it to the press?

1018
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:11,412
I've put much thought into it too.

1019
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:15,249
As of right now,

1020
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:19,212
this is the best I can do

1021
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:21,547
for you and Attorney Woo.

1022
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:50,493
Raon, the online shopping mall that had
a personal data breach of 40 million

1023
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:52,078
due to their inability to stop the hack,

1024
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:54,455
has won the lawsuit for the cancellation
of the 300 billion won penalty surcharge

1025
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:58,626
imposed by the KCC.

1026
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:02,338
The Seoul Administrative Court cited
Raon's negligence of access control,

1027
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:07,426
including the absence of a limit
on maximum connection time,

1028
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,053
but recognized that it was not

1029
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:10,888
the direct cause
of the personal data breach

1030
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:12,849
and ruled in favor of the plaintiff.

1031
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:16,394
Meanwhile, Raon's co-CEO, Bae In-cheol,

1032
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:18,938
who collapsed after ingesting poison
during the trial,

1033
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:21,148
is receiving treatment

1034
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:24,235
but has been confirmed
as still being unconscious.

1035
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:27,280
Mr. Bae had complained
of the unfairness by stating

1036
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:30,825
"No other company has done its best
to satisfy users the way Raon has,"

1037
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:34,662
and "How are we supposed to stop a hacker
who is determined to break in?"

1038
01:04:34,745 --> 01:04:37,707
after which he ingested
the poison he had prepared in advance--

1039
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:51,929
The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable.

1040
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,432
Please leave a message after the tone.

1041
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:58,394
Hey, I just saw the news.

1042
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:01,314
Is In-cheol still unconscious?

1043
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:03,274
You told me he was fine.

1044
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,735
You said he was awake now.

1045
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:08,446
Please answer the phone.

1046
01:05:08,946 --> 01:05:11,449
Don't make me have to hack you
to get your location too.

1047
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:13,826
Answer your…

1048
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,041
What is it?

1049
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:21,918
What do you mean?

1050
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,420
I'm home early.

1051
01:05:24,503 --> 01:05:26,422
Let's have dinner together.

1052
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,407
Why did you come to see me?

1053
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:55,576
Because I don't think you'll do
what my mom tells you to.

1054
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:56,535
Me?

1055
01:05:56,619 --> 01:06:00,081
I'm just curious about
what you decide to do, Attorney Woo.

1056
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:05,044
I'll meet with Attorney Tae and ask her
to allow Sang-hyeon to testify in court.

1057
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:08,339
How are you going to convince Tae Su-mi?

1058
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:11,217
Will she even meet with you
when her confirmation hearing is so close?

1059
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,761
You weren't a good mother to me,

1060
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:15,680
but at the very least,

1061
01:06:15,763 --> 01:06:18,099
please be a good mother to Sang-hyeon.

1062
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:23,312
