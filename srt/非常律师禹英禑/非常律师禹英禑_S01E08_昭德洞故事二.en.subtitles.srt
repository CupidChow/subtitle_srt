1
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,646
This is what Haengbok-ro will look like
passing Sodeok-dong.

2
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,068
The fact they decided on a route like this
means that they want us to leave the town.

3
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:11,988
It's splitting the town in half
and isolating each side.

4
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,657
The town is so beautiful.

5
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,242
The town is beautiful,

6
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,578
but the people who live here
are even better.

7
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,121
So then, what's left is…

8
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,831
-What is it?
-Trial.

9
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,167
A lawsuit seeking revocation
of the road zone decision of Haengbok-ro?

10
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,961
That's right.
We're thinking of doing that.

11
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,421
That's Attorney Tae Su-mi, right?

12
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,131
Why is the king here herself?

13
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,800
"King"?

14
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,427
Why are you looking into Tae Su-mi?

15
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,096
I wanted to be like her.

16
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,099
From what I see, I think Jun-ho likes you.

17
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:43,436
If you're not sure,
why don't you try touching him?

18
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,398
I want to check whether or not I like you.

19
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,275
Can you only check

20
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,402
by touching me?

21
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:56,533
Did you give Young-woo a job here
because of Tae Su-mi?

22
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,078
How does your father know the CEO?

23
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,705
Wait. So you did get this job
through connections.

24
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,917
Then have I benefited from nepotism?

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,669
Young-woo!

26
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:08,753
Young-woo!

27
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:16,553
CASE 8
A TALE ABOUT SODEOK-DONG II

28
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,527
Did you sleep well?

29
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,699
No, not at all. It was uncomfortable
sleeping in an unfamiliar place.

30
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,827
I thought so.
You were grinding your teeth last night.

31
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,288
What?

32
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,376
Here's your order
of Dong Geu-ra-mi gimbap.

33
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,796
Just leave it.

34
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,435
Is there no ham and spinach?

35
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,978
What about boiled burdock?

36
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,606
Boil your own burdock.

37
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,900
Eat what you get.
That's the Dong Geu-ra-mi gimbap.

38
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,526
Okay.

39
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,862
Thank you for the food.

40
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,163
-It's good, right?
-Yes, very.

41
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:26,915
It's strange.

42
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,041
Right?

43
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,959
It is strangely good.

44
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,056
Did you fight with your dad?

45
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,767
Well…

46
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,811
-No.
-Then what?

47
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:50,980
Did he tell you to leave?

48
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,608
I left on my own.

49
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,861
Yes, I get that you left on your own.

50
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,488
But why did you leave?

51
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:02,075
I'm going to move out
because I'm an adult.

52
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:05,828
Can you afford to?

53
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,515
That's her, right?

54
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,308
Can you believe this?

55
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,686
Exposing Hanbada's
corrupt hiring practices.

56
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,231
Recently, I found out
that a rookie attorney at Hanbada

57
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,525
benefited from nepotism.

58
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:40,280
Unlike the other rookies,
this attorney joined the firm

59
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,823
after Hanbada's official recruitment
period had ended.

60
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,451
She did not participate
in the training for rookies either.

61
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,413
How is something like this possible?

62
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,709
Wasn't it because this rookie attorney's
father and the attorney

63
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,753
at the highest position at Hanbada
went to school together?

64
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,257
If it weren't for the unreasonable
request of her father,

65
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,468
would that rookie attorney
have been able to work at Hanbada?

66
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:08,266
If someone is given a job because
they know high-ranking personnel,

67
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:11,853
how can we call
that society fair and just?

68
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:16,482
I truly feel robbed seeing someone
use personal connections

69
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,778
to be handed the job
of attorney at Hanbada,

70
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,031
which I gave up my youth to earn.

71
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,493
Come in.

72
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:38,046
I'm sorry to hear that you felt robbed.

73
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:39,505
Excuse me?

74
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:43,468
You wrote the post about Young-woo
on the anonymous bulletin board, right?

75
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,311
Come in.

76
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:05,490
All right, we're all here
so let's start the meeting.

77
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,373
What brings you here?

78
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,544
Take a seat.

79
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,921
Sit down.

80
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,765
I heard the opposing attorney
of this case is Tae Su-mi.

81
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,934
Yes.

82
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,895
It's a lawsuit for the revocation
of the road zone decision

83
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,855
for Haengbok-ro
that's being built by Gyeonghae-do.

84
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,941
We're defending the residents
of Sodeok-dong.

85
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,567
How's it going?

86
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,320
We're having difficulty proving

87
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:47,657
that there's a better alternative
to the current planned route,

88
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,493
but we managed to
find a reason for illegality.

89
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,203
Reason for illegality? What is it?

90
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:55,540
Gyeonghae-do did their Strategic
Environmental Impact Assessment

91
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,500
a bit later than the law allows.

92
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,876
But they did it?

93
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,877
Yes.

94
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:04,298
Then it's not a reason for illegality
for the decision of the route itself.

95
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:08,094
Maybe just a minor procedural mistake.

96
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,639
Are they still
working on the construction?

97
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,183
Yes, we requested a suspension of effect,

98
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,186
but it hasn't been confirmed yet,
so the construction is ongoing.

99
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,981
So you're losing right now.

100
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:26,028
We knew that this wasn't going
to be easy when we started.

101
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,282
This might sound a little odd,

102
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,742
but Sodeok-dong is quite beautiful.

103
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,744
The residents are also easygoing.

104
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:37,290
There's an on-site verification soon,
so we're thinking of using this

105
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,625
to appeal to the judges
to change their minds.

106
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,919
You want to touch their hearts?

107
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,921
-Yes.
-I see.

108
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,215
That's quite…

109
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,261
a romantic method.

110
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,682
But not everything works that way.

111
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:59,479
Come up with a way to solve this
politically and less romantically.

112
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:03,274
Politically and less romantically?

113
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,735
Among the media outlets
that are on good terms with Hanbada,

114
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,696
wouldn't there be someone
who would take interest in this case?

115
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:12,617
Framing this lawsuit
as a fight between David and Goliath

116
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,869
to stir up public opinion.

117
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:17,830
To make the judges feel uncomfortable
to side with Gyeonghae-do.

118
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:23,002
It may not seem like much,
but sometimes things like this work.

119
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,631
A person's heart wavers

120
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:30,384
even over groundless gossip posts
on an anonymous bulletin board.

121
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,094
Doesn't it?

122
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,347
Right.

123
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,434
Anyway, win.

124
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:42,855
-Excuse me?
-Don't lose to Tae Su-mi.

125
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,732
Right. Okay.

126
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,334
Did you see this?

127
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,506
"Exposing Hanbada's
corrupt hiring practices."

128
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,216
Well…

129
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,176
This…

130
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,135
It's you.

131
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,888
-What?
-It's about you.

132
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:19,058
Someone took a shot at you
claiming you benefited from nepotism.

133
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:22,353
How do you know it's me?

134
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:25,773
You were the only one who joined
the firm after the official recruitment.

135
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:29,569
People have been whispering about this all
morning. Didn't you sense anything odd?

136
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,570
Right.

137
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:38,619
It's…

138
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,955
all true.

139
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:45,042
My father and the CEO
are friends from university.

140
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:46,794
I…

141
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,171
benefited from nepotism.

142
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,474
Students with good grades
at SNU law school

143
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:04,353
all do internships at major law firms
and get employed before graduating!

144
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:08,774
You were always the top in school,
but you weren't hired anywhere.

145
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,319
Everyone knew it was unfair.

146
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,822
But they didn't do anything about it
because it was none of their business.

147
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,074
Including me.

148
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,953
Well, since I have autism--

149
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:21,912
Hey!

150
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,169
Discrimination against
the disabled is legally prohibited!

151
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:29,920
You not being employed anywhere
with your grades

152
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,422
is discrimination, dishonesty,
and corruption.

153
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,174
No matter how you got here,

154
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,802
it's only fair that you
joined the firm, albeit late!

155
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,810
I think Attorney Kwon wrote this.

156
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,105
So when it's just the two of you,
smack him on the back of his head.

157
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,690
Or hit him hard in the stomach.

158
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,109
But that's a crime.

159
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,487
Don't just let people
walk all over you, you idiot.

160
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,822
And stop acting pitiful saying
you benefited from nepotism!

161
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,493
You heard the CEO, right?

162
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,912
We should be political too, okay?

163
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,581
Less romantic, okay?

164
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,791
Okay.

165
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,387
-You contacted them, right?
-Yes.

166
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,055
They should be here on time.

167
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:22,765
Gosh, this is a nightmare.

168
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:23,974
Goodness.

169
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,394
-They should be here soon.
-Isn't that their car?

170
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,645
Yes, it is.

171
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,981
Here.

172
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,402
Gosh.

173
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,028
-My goodness.
-My goodness.

174
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,406
-Hello.
-Gosh, welcome.

175
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,200
-Of all days, it had to rain today.
-My goodness, thank you.

176
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:42,451
Thank you.

177
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,369
Gosh, thank you.

178
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,000
Gosh, the weather is awful.

179
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,237
Does Hanbada not have umbrellas?

180
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,156
We look like such a mess.

181
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,908
Yes, we do. Just a moment.

182
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:45,890
What?

183
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,309
Why did Jeongui Ilbo come here?

184
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,935
Hanbada must have called them.

185
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,104
They have a good relationship.

186
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:55,149
I think I've read the friendly articles
they wrote for Hanbada.

187
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,567
They're trying hard.

188
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,903
There won't be anything to cover today.

189
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:12,249
OFFICIAL DUTY

190
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:25,346
Your Honor. Hello.

191
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,681
It must have been exhausting
to come all this way.

192
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:28,641
Yes.

193
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,351
It's quite far.

194
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,979
Gosh. It's pouring.

195
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:42,905
Sir, please lead the way
just like you did last time.

196
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:43,948
Okay.

197
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:45,908
Your Honor.

198
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:52,831
Your Honor, the road
with the red flags is…

199
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,334
-What was it?
-Haengbok-ro.

200
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,795
It's the planned route for Haengbok-ro.

201
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,005
It cuts across the residential area,

202
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,884
so all those people will be kicked out
of town once the construction begins.

203
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,804
Shall we follow the flags?

204
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,807
Yes, let's go.
Since I came all the way here anyway.

205
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,737
Heung-min!

206
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:29,285
Your Honor, the residents of Sodeok-dong
call each other by nicknames.

207
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,496
The person who lives here is good
at soccer so he's called Son Heung-min.

208
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,498
Hello, Mr. Kim Jeong-hwan.

209
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:36,959
Hey, Heung-min.

210
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,461
This is the judge. Introduce yourself.

211
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,840
Gosh, stop calling me that.

212
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,466
Hello.

213
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,885
I'm Kim Jeong-hwan.

214
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,011
Heung-min.

215
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,137
Mr. Kim here consented

216
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,640
to the Land Expropriation Compensation
Amount that Gyeonghae-do newly offered.

217
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,435
This is the consent form
that Mr. Kim signed.

218
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,521
-What?
-What are you talking about?

219
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,106
He's a board member of
the Residents' Countermeasures Committee.

220
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,233
What do you mean
he signed the consent form?

221
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,319
Yes, I did.

222
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,695
I consented.

223
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,156
-Jeong-hwan!
-Well,

224
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,867
the attorneys here came to me and said

225
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,745
Gyeonghae-do might raise the compensation.

226
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,955
They said it would be
twice the original amount they offered,

227
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,000
so I consented.

228
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,670
Heung-min, how could you do this
without saying anything to us?

229
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,423
If I do, would you understand
where I'm coming from?

230
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,426
And you're so well-off.

231
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:30,137
How could you understand wanting
to be paid even the slightest bit more?

232
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,015
The land is going to be taken away anyway.

233
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,185
And I'm not the only one who consented.

234
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,979
Cheol-min over there
consented to this too.

235
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,106
Jang-hoon consented too?

236
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,943
Hey!

237
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,569
Hey!

238
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,279
Jang-hoon!

239
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,239
Did you consent?

240
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,996
Hey!

241
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,165
Jang-hoon!

242
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,839
Mr. Jang also consented to the Land
Expropriation Compensation Amount.

243
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:09,343
If Gyeonghae-do decided
to raise the compensation amount,

244
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:12,471
they should've let the Residents'
Countermeasures Committee know first.

245
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,974
It's unfair for them to discreetly contact
individual households

246
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,517
and get them to sign consent forms.

247
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,812
The decision to raise the compensation
hasn't been confirmed yet.

248
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:24,608
Gyeonghae-do merely
wanted to check beforehand

249
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,903
on how many households would consent
to the increase in compensation.

250
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,656
The consent form
is just a formality to do that.

251
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,449
Then it's an even bigger issue.

252
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,202
You're just feeling the residents out

253
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,204
when you're not actually going to
raise the compensation.

254
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:41,208
Your Honor, this is a trick of the
defendant's counselor to win the lawsuit

255
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,876
by dividing the residents.

256
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,171
The head of the town
has too much power over the residents,

257
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:50,259
so it's hard for the powerless
residents to speak up for themselves.

258
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:54,346
Please understand the wishes
of the brave residents who are expressing

259
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,640
their intentions
through the consent forms.

260
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,350
What?

261
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,728
What do you mean
the head of the town has too much power?

262
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,688
What do you mean
the residents can't speak up?

263
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,523
What are you talking about right now?

264
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:08,193
Out of the 488 households
whose land expropriation has been decided,

265
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:12,031
a total of 343 households
have signed the consent forms so far.

266
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:15,325
Since we started getting their consent,

267
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,579
more than 70 percent of the households
consented within just fifteen days.

268
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:22,166
If this isn't the true intention
of the residents, what is?

269
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,167
Your Honor,

270
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,503
I submit these consent forms as evidence.

271
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:32,092
The consent forms
merely show the residents

272
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,762
consenting to the amount
that Gyeonghae-do might be raising.

273
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,556
The increase in compensation
hasn't been confirmed yet.

274
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,392
There's nothing that the consent forms
can prove, Your Honor.

275
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,978
All right, settle down.

276
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:47,274
We're here for on-site verification today,
so you may submit your evidence later.

277
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:50,402
For now, we'll focus
on looking around the site.

278
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,779
Okay.

279
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:56,283
There's no way for us to know
how many people these attorneys talked to,

280
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,286
so we should probably stop
the resident introductions.

281
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,537
Let's head to the hackberry tree.

282
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,582
Your Honor.

283
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:07,544
We'll take you to a place
where you can view the whole town.

284
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,921
Please come this way.

285
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,476
Something's not working out here, right?

286
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,647
No, the residents used to be united

287
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,608
and it was quite a beautiful town.

288
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,693
They were one-upped by Taesan's plan.

289
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:35,781
They split up the residents
using the consent forms as an excuse.

290
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,033
They did.

291
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,372
Now, we will climb the hill.

292
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,832
Just a bit more to go.

293
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,047
Goodness.

294
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,716
-Goodness.
-Gosh.

295
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,009
Are you okay?

296
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,930
I wore sneakers today,
in preparation for this kind of situation.

297
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,350
So what? Are you bragging right now?

298
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,769
No, I'm not.

299
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,647
Do you want my jacket?

300
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,525
It might be a little small for you,
but if you wrap it around your shoulders--

301
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,734
No, I'm fine.

302
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,488
Please be careful.

303
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:20,242
You need to take extra caution
when climbing up this hill.

304
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,368
Attorney Woo.

305
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,912
Be quiet.

306
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,140
Your Honor.

307
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,142
Have a cup of sikhye.

308
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,440
No, thanks. It's raining and chilly.
Why would I want to drink that?

309
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,989
We'll get started in a moment.

310
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:13,170
Plaintiff, what is it that we're supposed
to see here? Proceed quickly.

311
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,421
Yes.

312
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:20,886
Your Honor,

313
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:26,183
can't you tell for yourself
by being up here?

314
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:29,061
The strain will be immense
on the town residents

315
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:32,022
if Haengbok-ro penetrates Sodeok-dong.

316
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,078
The cups.

317
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,211
-Jeez.
-Goodness.

318
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,089
To be honest,

319
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,216
visiting Sodeok-dong in person

320
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:03,428
makes me seriously doubt if it's right
to acknowledge the plaintiffs' claims.

321
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:07,057
I don't even know who the plaintiffs are.

322
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,017
Is the Residents'
Countermeasures Committee

323
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,271
properly reflecting the wishes
of all the Sodeok-dong residents?

324
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,230
Your Honor.

325
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,107
This is unfair.

326
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,235
The committee has always been
in contact with the residents

327
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,653
and closely communicated with them.

328
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,572
We weren't able to show you
what we're really like

329
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:26,285
because those attorneys
used tricks to try to split us apart.

330
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,163
I will give you an opportunity
to prove what you said.

331
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,416
Both plaintiffs and defendants.

332
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,794
Get the residents' consent forms
by the next hearing date.

333
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,339
I'll have to see for myself
whether there are more residents who agree

334
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:43,385
with the cause of the committee
or follow the decision of Gyeonghae-do.

335
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,762
If the number of residents

336
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:49,099
who are against building Haengbok-ro
according to the planned route

337
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,643
is not the majority
of all Sodeok-dong residents,

338
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:56,023
we will have no choice
but to dismiss the plaintiffs' claim.

339
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,161
My goodness.

340
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,787
Things just got complicated.

341
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:14,916
As of right now, I don't think
there's anything for me to write about.

342
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,754
-Let me know when things get settled.
-I will.

343
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,672
I'm sorry you wasted your time.

344
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,300
No worries. I'm going to get going.

345
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:39,399
So you're saying the houses in blue
are highly likely to side with us?

346
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,609
Yes.

347
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,278
The houses in red are the ones that…

348
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:45,614
What is it?

349
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,700
-Money?
-No, not just any money.

350
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,035
You know, the…

351
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,495
-Com--
-Compensation!

352
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,663
Yes!

353
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,957
They would move out
after receiving compensation.

354
00:22:56,041 --> 00:23:00,045
As expected, the houses that aren't
included in the road zone are mostly blue.

355
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,046
That's right.

356
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,508
The households that are getting
their land expropriated are thinking

357
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:08,095
they can just move with the compensation,
even if it is at a low price.

358
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:11,723
It's especially tempting
since the compensation might be increased.

359
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:12,641
But…

360
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,392
I'm not so sure now.

361
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:18,647
I really thought Heung-min and Jang-hoon
were on our side no matter what.

362
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,982
But they changed their minds so quickly.

363
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,820
There's still time to convince
the residents. Don't worry too much.

364
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,158
I printed out the consent forms.

365
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,493
Nice work.

366
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,411
-Let's get moving.
-Okay.

367
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,080
Okay.

368
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:38,875
I think you should go check outside.

369
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,549
I'll head up.

370
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,343
Wait up!

371
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,764
Okay, let's get a move on.

372
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:59,146
-Let's go.
-Hurry, get moving.

373
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,691
Taesan already has part-timers
out and about?

374
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,317
Should we hurry
and look into hiring people?

375
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,778
Yes. Let's get ourselves moving first.

376
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:07,737
Yes.

377
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,923
If you're getting paid anyway,
you should get as much as possible.

378
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,341
Write down your address here.

379
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,509
All right.

380
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,679
Anybody home?

381
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:35,307
We're from Hanbada Law Firm.

382
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,268
-Is anybody--
-Thank you.

383
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,186
I'm sorry.

384
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,646
-I'll be on my way then.
-Okay.

385
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,232
Excuse me, ma'am.

386
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,455
Hey, hurry up. You two, go right.

387
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,165
Run.

388
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,084
Why am I the only one working? Hurry up!

389
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:14,638
Who's there?

390
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:15,680
I'm from Taesan--

391
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,891
I'm an attorney from Hanbada.

392
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:19,434
Not a part-timer.

393
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:20,518
Hold on.

394
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,646
What are you talking about?

395
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,940
You're doing great. Go to the next house.

396
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:29,194
I'm an actual attorney from Taesan.

397
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,113
Go home.

398
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,323
You go home.

399
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,242
You punk.

400
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,618
-Hello.
-Hello.

401
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:40,747
Here.

402
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,416
Which one's the one offering compensation?

403
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,210
That would be us.

404
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,544
Taesan.

405
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,214
Goodness. Would you take a look?

406
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,548
If you look at this…

407
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,556
Taesan exaggerated so much
about the compensation

408
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,976
that every resident I meet
only talks about money.

409
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:04,187
It wasn't easy for me
to even meet the residents.

410
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,897
We're outnumbered.

411
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,941
How did Taesan get people that fast?

412
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,277
Did you talk to Jun-ho?

413
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,153
Yes, he found part-timers,

414
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,197
but it's going to take some time
for them to get here.

415
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:17,951
Then I'll at least
gather the women's association.

416
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:21,329
Whatever it takes,
all we need are signatures here, right?

417
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,457
I wouldn't say whatever it takes…

418
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:30,755
Thank you.

419
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,434
Everyone wrote their names down, right?

420
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,562
Below is the address.

421
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,856
Write your home address.

422
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,232
What is this?

423
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,817
-It's a…
-Gosh!

424
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:55,113
Why are you asking?
Would I make you do something bad?

425
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,948
-I should know.
-Don't you trust me?

426
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,074
Gosh.

427
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:01,119
Do you not trust this attorney here?

428
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:05,248
Rather than signing it
because you trust us…

429
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,253
Trust us.

430
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:13,131
Trust us.

431
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:15,258
Then, sing us a song.

432
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:19,346
Let me hear how good
attorneys are at singing.

433
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:24,017
-What?
-If you can't sing you can't defend

434
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,853
-Is Jun-ho still on his way?
-Hateful person

435
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:27,937
I'll call him.

436
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:32,400
If you can't sing you can't defend

437
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,695
Hateful person

438
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:39,824
If you can't sing you can't defend

439
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,117
-Hateful person
-Where are you going?

440
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:44,537
To find my bag. I think I left it
under the hackberry tree.

441
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:48,500
Hurry up. It looks like we're going
to have to sing and you're leaving.

442
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,086
Beats! One, two, three, four.

443
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:55,131
-Blown away
-Blown away

444
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:59,135
-By the wind
-By the wind

445
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:03,932
-Was it an empty oath
-Was it an empty oath

446
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,684
What's your address?

447
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:09,687
-On the day of the first snow,
-On the day of the first snow,

448
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:13,358
-In front of Andong Station,
-In front of Andong Station,

449
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,821
-You promised we'll meet
-You promised we'll meet

450
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,989
Your address.

451
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:24,619
-Snow falling
-Snow falling

452
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:28,415
-From early morning
-From early morning

453
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:33,169
-Covers up to my knees
-Covers up to my knees

454
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:42,720
What?

455
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,855
Yes, we're handling it thoroughly.

456
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,190
Don't worry.

457
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,736
Yes, I'll be in touch.

458
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:04,284
You're Attorney Woo Young-woo, right?

459
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,579
Yes.

460
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:08,747
That bag…

461
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,831
Right.

462
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,876
This was yours?

463
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,878
It was under the tree.

464
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,838
It was obviously an attorney's bag,

465
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,758
so I was going to take it down
with me to find its owner.

466
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,303
Thank you.

467
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:31,936
I remember where I heard
your name, Attorney Woo.

468
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,481
What?

469
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:38,526
Didn't you write a statement of opinion
for Chairman Kim Jeong-gu's case?

470
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,988
The wedding at Daehyeon Hotel.

471
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:44,073
The case where
the wedding dress slipped off.

472
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:48,036
Well, yes.

473
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,706
I read the statement of opinion.

474
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,958
Chairman Kim said,

475
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:58,171
"Look, Hanbada easily solved
what Taesan said was impossible,"

476
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,423
and showed it to me.

477
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,761
You claimed special damages, right?

478
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:09,557
The idea was fresh that I remembered
your name, Attorney Woo.

479
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,103
I see.

480
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:16,773
Attorney Woo.

481
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,943
Is it fun working at Hanbada?

482
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,570
Excuse me?

483
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,073
Do you want to come to Taesan?

484
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:35,124
You wanted to show the intangible value
Sodeok-dong has, right?

485
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,419
The residents' love
for their hometown and such.

486
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:42,799
I'm talking about the reason
you requested the on-site verification.

487
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,010
Well…

488
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,471
At times like this, Hanbada is,
how should I put it,

489
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,223
quite naive.

490
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,393
There's nothing weaker
than a person's mind.

491
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,687
Especially in the face of money.

492
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,486
We should stop the conversation here

493
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,113
since we're working
on the same case right now.

494
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:09,909
Once this is over, come visit Taesan.

495
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,704
Hanbada is a good law firm,

496
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:16,666
but I feel like Taesan
could be a better fit for you.

497
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:21,087
Let's win trials together.

498
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,597
TAESAN LAW FIRM

499
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,486
I think this every time I see it,

500
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,572
but this hackberry tree

501
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,659
is amazing.

502
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,414
Yes, it really is.

503
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,216
What did you talk about with Attorney Tae?

504
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:49,759
What?

505
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:53,888
I saw you two talking
under the hackberry tree for a while.

506
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,391
If I tell you what we talked about,

507
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,810
are you going to post it
on the bulletin board again?

508
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:00,395
What?

509
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:04,023
What did I do?

510
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,779
What are you doing?

511
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,864
If you do that one more time,

512
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,701
I'm going to smack you
on the back of your head.

513
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,203
Or hit you hard in the stomach.

514
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,330
I won't let you walk all over me.

515
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,917
How can you be so shameless?

516
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:27,714
Frankly speaking,
it doesn't matter who wrote the post.

517
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,549
At the end of the day, it's all true.

518
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:32,176
Your father and the CEO
are friends from university

519
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,970
and it was nepotism.

520
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,098
So why are you so shameless?

521
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,065
Gosh.

522
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,661
Hey, Young-woo.

523
00:33:58,745 --> 00:33:59,787
You're back home?

524
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,623
I'm going back out.
I just stopped by to get clothes.

525
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,625
Hey, where are you going?

526
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,794
I'm going to move out.

527
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,922
I'll be staying with Geu-ra-mi
until I find my own place,

528
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,507
so you don't have to worry.

529
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,009
Young-woo.

530
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,219
Hey. Young-woo.

531
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,221
-Young-woo. But…
-Don't follow me.

532
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,934
Young-woo, talk to me.

533
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,186
No.

534
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:26,939
How could you decide on something
as big as moving out alone?

535
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,734
I'm going to change firms.

536
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,903
I won't work at Hanbada anymore.

537
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:36,407
Change firms? What's that about?
Where are you going to work instead?

538
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,785
I'm going to Taesan.

539
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,582
I received an offer
from Attorney Tae Su-mi.

540
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:50,838
No.

541
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,840
You can't go there.

542
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:53,925
That woman…

543
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,302
Tae Su-mi is your mom!

544
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,019
What?

545
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,358
Tae Su-mi…

546
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,279
is the person who gave birth to you.

547
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,869
She's your mom, Young-woo.

548
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:36,592
Young-woo.

549
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,302
Young…

550
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,512
Young-woo!

551
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,348
Young-woo!

552
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,245
Young-woo. Are you okay?

553
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:05,746
Are you awake?

554
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,627
My whole body

555
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,671
hurts.

556
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:14,672
Gosh.

557
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,592
They said you were bruised
all over your body.

558
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,761
Does it hurt a lot?
Should I ask them for painkillers?

559
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:21,929
No.

560
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:23,806
It's fine.

561
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,851
Luckily, they said
you didn't hurt any bones.

562
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,020
You'll get better soon
after getting some rest.

563
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:38,613
Gosh.

564
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:42,992
Young-woo.

565
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:45,786
I'm sorry

566
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,372
I didn't tell you sooner.

567
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:54,503
I lied about your mom passing away
while giving birth to you.

568
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,798
I knew that.

569
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:01,344
-What?
-Grandmother told me.

570
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,222
She did?

571
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:07,099
It was when Grandmother and I were alone.

572
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,937
She got very drunk and yelled.

573
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:14,315
"Your mom is not dead."

574
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,276
"She abandoned you and ran away."

575
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,071
"She ruined my son's life and ran away."

576
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:21,906
That's what she said.

577
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,325
I see.

578
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:29,997
Tae Su-mi

579
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,083
and I…

580
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:36,671
lived in different worlds.

581
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,884
I'm the son of a poor farmer.

582
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:45,763
But Su-mi is the daughter
of the founder of Taesan.

583
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,308
Then we met at university

584
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,311
and somehow ended up liking each other.

585
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,564
We were both so new to dating.

586
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,442
You were conceived

587
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,778
when we weren't ready.

588
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,323
But…

589
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,868
once Su-mi found out she was pregnant,

590
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,913
she changed completely.

591
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,837
I guess she wanted to go back
to the world she came from

592
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:22,675
rather than getting married to a man
with nothing and becoming a mom.

593
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,513
Su-mi.

594
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:28,889
-Su-mi.
-Let go!

595
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,725
Are you crazy?

596
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,643
How could you come to my house?

597
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,104
What else am I supposed to do
when you won't see me?

598
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,565
I couldn't reach you.

599
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,068
Just give me a moment. We need to talk.

600
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,696
-Please?
-There's nothing to talk about.

601
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:44,739
Hey, Su-mi.

602
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,032
-Su-mi.
-Gosh, stop!

603
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:01,756
Are you okay?

604
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,091
It's all our fault.

605
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:05,676
What?

606
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,021
Let's have the baby.

607
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:21,692
We've already talked about this.

608
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,820
-That's--
-I promise.

609
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,990
I won't put you in a difficult position.

610
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:32,161
If you just have the baby,
I'll take the baby and disappear.

611
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,539
I'll quit my studies.

612
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,335
I won't take the bar. I won't do anything.

613
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,005
I'll…

614
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:49,053
I'll make sure you never see us.

615
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:54,934
Please, Su-mi.

616
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:56,852
Please?

617
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:58,813
Please, Su-mi.

618
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,530
Please.

619
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:17,081
Eventually,

620
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,583
Su-mi agreed to give birth to you.

621
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:23,212
She spread rumors that
she went to study abroad in the States

622
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:28,801
but actually stayed home
throughout her whole pregnancy.

623
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:34,598
During that time,
I graduated from university,

624
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,268
and as soon as you were born

625
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:40,229
you became mine, as promised.

626
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,367
Woo Gwang-ho?

627
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,285
Yes.

628
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,911
Here.

629
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,004
Take this.

630
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,590
It's a girl.

631
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,722
How about Su-mi?

632
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,599
Is she doing okay?

633
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,058
Don't ask anything about her.

634
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,895
There'll be no need for you
to contact each other ever again.

635
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:57,806
After that, I kept my word.

636
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:02,603
I gave up on taking the bar
so I wouldn't run into her by any chance.

637
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:06,273
I only worked jobs unrelated to law

638
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,442
and raised you.

639
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:11,612
And now,

640
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,282
I regret it a lot.

641
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,954
You regret it?

642
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,790
When I saw you
not being able to get a job anywhere,

643
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,000
I really regretted it so much.

644
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:28,337
I think I was delusional.

645
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:33,133
I thought keeping the promise
I made to the woman I once loved

646
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,928
made me loyal and cool.

647
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:38,889
When all that

648
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,475
really doesn't mean anything.

649
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:46,272
You are loyal and cool. I…

650
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:49,316
I should have become an attorney,
one way or another.

651
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,570
I should've hired and taught you

652
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:55,739
when nobody accepted you.

653
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:00,369
I should have been a competent father

654
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,081
who had a practice
to pass on to his daughter.

655
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:07,668
Young-woo.

656
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,630
I've realized through experience

657
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,593
that everything in life is political.

658
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:18,637
There's…

659
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:22,766
a political reason
for Seon-young hiring you.

660
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,687
And Su-mi abandoning you

661
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,610
wasn't because she hated you.

662
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,529
There were political reasons

663
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,532
that stopped her
from marrying a guy like me.

664
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:43,829
I didn't know
that's how everybody else lived.

665
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:51,086
The foolish guy who went on and on
to himself about promise and loyalty…

666
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:00,095
ultimately…

667
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:04,099
made his daughter

668
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:09,438
pay the price for him
not succeeding in life.

669
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:41,136
Could that have been the case
for the hackberry tree in Sodeok-dong?

670
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,097
What?

671
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:49,478
The first time I heard that a road was
going to be constructed here was in 2016.

672
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:51,605
Gosh, that's already six years ago.

673
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:54,983
When was it? Was it 2016?

674
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:58,112
We asked the provincial office
just in case.

675
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:01,657
But the experts came to check
and said it's not enough to be designated.

676
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,619
They said it's not enough
to be a natural monument.

677
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:14,169
Where is my phone?
I have to call Attorney Jung.

678
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:17,464
At this hour?

679
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,758
Yes. Could you step out?

680
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:23,095
I don't think you should be listening
due to attorney-client privilege.

681
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:25,222
Where is it?

682
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:26,682
All right.

683
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:27,724
Hurry.

684
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:30,477
Here's your phone.

685
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,397
Please hurry up and leave, Dad.

686
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,108
Okay.

687
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:47,536
ATTORNEY WOO YOUNG-WOO

688
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:54,293
Hello?

689
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:58,672
Attorney Jung, my father thinks
everything in this world is political

690
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:01,758
and that every decision
has a political reason hidden behind it.

691
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:05,721
Yes, so what?

692
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:08,390
Isn't it odd?
The hackberry tree of Sodeok-dong.

693
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,684
Why couldn't such an amazing tree
become a protected tree,

694
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:12,436
let alone a natural monument?

695
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,064
Does that have
something to do with the case?

696
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:19,234
If the hackberry tree couldn't
be designated as a natural monument

697
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:22,196
because of a political reason,
then it does.

698
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,489
The Sodeok-dong residents

699
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:26,658
inquired about the hackberry tree
to the provincial office in 2016.

700
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:27,784
But by then,

701
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:31,413
it was secretly known that there could be
a road built in Sodeok-dong.

702
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:33,874
Even the civil engineering
professor knew about it.

703
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,217
Attorney Jung?

704
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,302
Are you asleep?

705
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,224
Hey.

706
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,769
Attorney Woo. Do you know what time it is?

707
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:58,857
It's 3:10 a.m.

708
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:02,528
And isn't everyone asleep at 3:10 a.m?

709
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:05,030
The birds, the lambs,
and even Myeong-seok?

710
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:09,076
-What?
-Even if we try to check whether or not

711
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,161
there was a political reason,

712
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:14,957
shouldn't we do it during the day?
What can we do right now?

713
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:16,667
Right.

714
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:17,834
Yes.

715
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,045
We'll talk tomorrow. Bye.

716
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:21,129
Yes.

717
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,925
What?

718
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:49,783
Attorney Woo, be careful.

719
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,871
-This way.
-Yes.

720
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,459
Hello.

721
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,086
NEW BEGINNING, SOARING KIYOUNG

722
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:03,714
To designate the Sodeok-dong
hackberry tree as a natural monument,

723
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:06,466
we have to ask Gyeonghae-do first.

724
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,719
The Gyeonghae-do Cultural Heritage
Committee does the first review,

725
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:11,054
and if they think
it's worthy of designating,

726
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,556
then they write up a report

727
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:15,684
asking the Cultural Heritage
Administration to designate it.

728
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:19,646
Then did you two ask Gyeonghae-do
yourselves in 2016?

729
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,274
No, we left it to Yu-jin.

730
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:25,402
Yu-jin worked at the Gyeonghae-do
provincial office back then, too.

731
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:28,447
Do you mean the person
who plays the violin?

732
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,574
Yes. Sodeok-dong's Eugene Park.

733
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:33,619
What is Eugene Park's real name?

734
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:34,703
Park Yu-jin.

735
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:35,954
What?

736
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:40,375
That was actually why he learned
how to play the violin in the first place.

737
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,127
He had the same name as Eugene Park.

738
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:43,587
Right.

739
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:46,089
He still works
at the provincial office, right?

740
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,424
Of course!

741
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,259
He should be in the office.

742
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,177
Yes.

743
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,930
We asked the Cultural
Heritage Administration

744
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,807
and they said they never received

745
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,143
any reports on the hackberry tree
in Sodeok-dong.

746
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:01,521
Did the Cultural Heritage
Committee decide to not write a report?

747
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:02,773
Well…

748
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:05,025
It was such a long time ago

749
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:07,527
that I don't remember clearly,
but I think so.

750
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:09,404
What's the reason?

751
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,198
Was the Sodeok-dong hackberry tree

752
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:14,660
deemed not enough to be designated
as a natural monument?

753
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,913
-What? By who? By me?
-What? No.

754
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,707
The Gyeonghae-do
Cultural Heritage Committee.

755
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:25,087
By the Cultural Heritage Committee?

756
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,171
That's what you meant.

757
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,799
How did the whole thing go again?

758
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:32,803
Are there records of the meeting
discussing the hackberry tree?

759
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:35,889
The head of the town told us
that experts came on-site

760
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:37,724
and saw the tree in person.

761
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,268
So there must be materials
like the meeting minutes or reports.

762
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:41,395
Could we take a look?

763
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:42,562
Well…

764
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:45,482
The materials? Right now?

765
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,363
Could the two of you
wait here for a moment?

766
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:53,073
I'll go and find them.

767
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,116
Sure.

768
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:17,764
Did you

769
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,100
get home safely that day?

770
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:25,397
That day?

771
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,606
Yes.

772
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:29,776
In Attorney Jung's office.

773
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:53,717
You just ran out all of a sudden.

774
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:58,847
That day,

775
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,186
my heart rate was really high.

776
00:51:06,062 --> 00:51:08,523
Even though I didn't touch you at all,

777
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:11,401
my heart was beating very fast.

778
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:13,862
So…

779
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,160
I think

780
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,412
I do like you.

781
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,101
Attorney Woo.

782
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:50,065
I…

783
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,483
Running…

784
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:54,903
away?

785
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:58,323
-Sorry?
-Park Yu-jin…

786
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,201
is running away.

787
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:04,871
What?

788
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:06,748
Hey.

789
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:08,458
Excuse me.

790
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:11,795
Mr. Park.

791
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,130
Mr. Park?

792
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,218
Wait, Mr. Park.

793
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:19,594
Wait!

794
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,012
Mr. Park!

795
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:22,764
Mr. Park!

796
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:24,641
Mr. Park, where are you going?

797
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,227
Mr. Park!

798
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,770
Where are you going?

799
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,355
Mr. Park!

800
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:32,691
Mr. Park!

801
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,151
Where are you going?

802
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:39,322
Darn it.

803
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,395
Darn it.

804
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:12,939
Are you all right?

805
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,232
We're sorry!

806
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,281
GYEONGHAE-DO, LAND OF LIFE AND HOPE

807
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:22,616
Mr. Park, are you okay?

808
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,117
Go away!

809
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,077
Why are you acting like this?

810
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,788
What's wrong, Mr. Park?

811
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:34,836
Please stop!

812
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,755
Stop following me!

813
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:38,798
Why are you running away?

814
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:42,802
Mr. Park, answer me!

815
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:45,847
-Mr. Park, stop!
-What's going on? Is he a criminal?

816
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:48,183
Get out of the way, sir!

817
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,487
Sir!

818
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,739
I work here!

819
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:04,199
You work at Gyeonghae-do
provincial office?

820
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:05,825
Then why were you running away?

821
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:08,703
That's what I'm saying.

822
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:10,664
Why on earth did you do that?

823
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:13,708
Why did you run away?

824
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:17,837
I was embarrassed. Okay?

825
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:19,422
What?

826
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:29,599
Then my friend stopped me

827
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,810
saying I was an idiot.

828
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:36,690
He said that subway line ten
was coming into Sodeok-dong soon,

829
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,566
and they were building Haengbok-ro too,

830
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:41,736
so I shouldn't inquire about designating
the tree as a natural monument.

831
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,866
If the hackberry tree had been
designated as a natural monument,

832
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,369
they wouldn't be able to build
the subway or the highway.

833
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:52,163
So what did you do?

834
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:53,248
I just

835
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:57,002
asked some friends
I work with at the provincial office

836
00:54:57,585 --> 00:55:00,130
to act as experts
from the Cultural Heritage Committee,

837
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:04,175
evaluating the hackberry tree
in front of the head of the town.

838
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:06,219
And to say that

839
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:10,223
the tree wasn't enough
to be designated as a natural monument.

840
00:55:10,306 --> 00:55:14,227
So you didn't even ask
the Cultural Heritage Committee?

841
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:16,604
No.

842
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:22,068
Now I know that the subway

843
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,863
and Haengbok-ro aren't good for our town.

844
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:26,156
But back then,

845
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:29,492
I thought two favorable factors popped up

846
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:32,871
in a neighborhood where
the land value never goes up.

847
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:35,915
So, I just…

848
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:40,003
Where did you get that umbrella?

849
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:41,713
This?

850
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:46,760
Yes. That umbrella with an Indo-Pacific
bottlenose dolphin printed on it.

851
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,888
This is Kyungpo Construction's logo.

852
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:52,432
I didn't buy it myself.

853
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:55,643
I went to look at a model house
and they gave it to me.

854
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:08,448
Did you get the consent forms
from all the residents?

855
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,158
What are the results?

856
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:11,409
Your Honor.

857
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:16,539
The population of Sodeok-dong
is 4,176 people with 2,513 households.

858
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,541
We got the consent forms
according to households

859
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:22,962
and 1,557 households have consented
to Gyeonghae-do's decision,

860
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,881
which is more than half.

861
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:28,134
Is the defendant's counselor correct?

862
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,219
Yes.

863
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:31,096
-But the consent form--
-Then

864
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:33,139
as I said during the on-site verification,

865
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:37,560
the court has no choice
but to dismiss the plaintiff's claim.

866
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:41,856
Now, that concludes--

867
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,191
Your Honor,

868
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,568
we would like to file a motion
to challenge the court.

869
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:50,323
Until the acknowledgment
of the motion to challenge is decided,

870
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:52,575
please suspend the proceedings.

871
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:54,619
What?

872
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:57,455
Are you trying to buy time because
your claim is about to be dismissed?

873
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:00,333
On what grounds are you filing a motion
to challenge the court?

874
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:05,630
Do you recall the umbrella you brought
to the on-site verification?

875
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:07,632
Umbrella?

876
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:25,733
There was a dolphin
printed on the umbrella you were holding.

877
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:28,486
You may think it's a bottlenose dolphin,

878
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:31,906
but its body is slimmer and longer
than that of a bottlenose dolphin,

879
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,908
so it's safe to say it's an Indo-Pacific--

880
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:35,660
What are you talking about?

881
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:38,746
Bottlenose dolphin.

882
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,628
-Yes, Your Honor, the dolphin--
-Indo-Pacific bottlenose.

883
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:50,300
The Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin
is a logo of Kyungpo Construction.

884
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:53,511
The umbrella you are holding
in the picture is the umbrella

885
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:56,639
given to visitors at the model
house for Kyungpo Ocean Park Apartments,

886
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:59,142
which is planned to be built
by Kyungpo Construction

887
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:00,977
in the planned city of Hamun.

888
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:07,984
The plaintiff's counselor is saying

889
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:12,405
that I went to the model house
to buy an apartment in Hamun?

890
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:16,576
I don't know how this umbrella
came into my hands.

891
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:19,162
Yes, but just in case

892
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:21,623
you are interested
in purchasing the apartment

893
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:23,958
that is planned to be built in Hamun,

894
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:28,087
there are concerns of an unfair trial,

895
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,839
which is why we are filing the motion.

896
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:33,343
There is nothing weaker
than the human mind in the face of money.

897
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:00,995
There haven't been many cases

898
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:04,749
where you recommended someone personally,
especially a rookie attorney.

899
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,627
I'm curious to see
what kind of person she is.

900
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,129
You'll also find her interesting
once you meet her.

901
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:12,966
She looks naive.

902
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:15,134
But she's kind of a genius.

903
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:20,431
She's already managed
to one-up me several times.

904
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:24,561
It almost makes me feel like
she's the first rookie to do this to me.

905
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,271
Really?

906
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,401
Attorney Woo.

907
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,076
Nice to see you.

908
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,078
It's especially nice
to see you in our firm.

909
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,998
She's the head of our HR team.

910
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,543
I've heard a lot about you.

911
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:51,129
Well…

912
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:57,093
I think I should
speak with Attorney Tae alone.

913
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:00,263
Excuse me?

914
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:03,808
You want me to leave?

915
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:08,271
Why?

916
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:11,774
I was going to make introductions
between you two and excuse myself.

917
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,110
I think only you should hear

918
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:17,739
what I am about to say.

919
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:20,783
What could this be about?

920
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:23,036
We'll talk later.

921
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,746
Yes, all right.

922
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:30,084
Here.

923
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:31,377
This way.

924
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,678
Is there something you would like to say?

925
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:48,394
Do you…

926
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:51,814
not recognize me?

927
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:54,233
What?

928
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:04,327
I'm…

929
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:07,413
Woo Gwang-ho's daughter.

930
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:19,759
Do you not recognize me?

931
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:42,740
I was planning on leaving Hanbada.

932
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:47,161
I wanted to move firms
if Taesan accepted me.

933
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,455
But recently,

934
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,418
I found out who you are.

935
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:57,213
So I don't think I can work at Taesan.

936
01:02:00,925 --> 01:02:04,220
I was trying to leave Hanbada

937
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:06,764
to be independent of my father
and be a real adult.

938
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,600
But I can't leave my father

939
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:14,897
just to join my mother's firm.

940
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:19,569
Especially not when my mother

941
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:25,491
gave birth to me, but abandoned me,

942
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:31,330
and doesn't recognize me at all,

943
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:34,000
even now.

944
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:42,633
Thank you for offering me to join Taesan.

945
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:47,805
But I'm going to continue
to work at Hanbada

946
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,641
and I will stay by my father's side.

947
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:19,086
It looks like the hackberry tree
will be designated as a natural monument.

948
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:22,381
Whether the court changes or not,

949
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:26,135
Gyeonghae-do will have to change
the planned route for Haengbok-ro.

950
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:30,139
This is great news

951
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:32,934
for the residents of Sodeok-dong.

952
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,144
Do you…

953
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:42,109
resent me for what I've done?

954
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:08,511
It was nice

955
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:12,306
when we looked at the tree together

956
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:18,855
on top of the hill in Sodeok-dong.

957
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:29,365
I wanted to meet you at least once.

958
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:35,288
It was nice to meet you.

959
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:36,349
The hackberry tree in Sodeok-dong,
Kiyoung, Gyeonghae-do

960
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,726
has been designated as a natural monument.

961
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:40,686
The Cultural Heritage Administration
explained that this hackberry tree

962
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:43,898
is not only great in its historic,
scenic, and aesthetic nature

963
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:45,566
but also in good condition
in terms of growth,

964
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:48,986
having an exceedingly high value
as a natural monument.

965
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,655
Meanwhile, the residents of Sodeok-dong

966
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:53,741
were in the middle
of administrative litigation

967
01:05:53,824 --> 01:05:56,869
demanding Gyeonghae-do change
the planned route for Haengbok-ro,

968
01:05:56,953 --> 01:06:01,290
claiming that it was designed to not only
penetrate the town but also the tree.

969
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:04,293
The focus is now on whether
the court and Gyeonghae-do

970
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:06,045
will listen to the voices of the residents

971
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:08,965
with the announcement
of the hackberry tree

972
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:10,883
being designated as a natural monument.

973
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:25,314
Bang Gu-ppong.

974
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:27,900
Is Bang Gu-ppong your real name?

975
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:30,778
He took 12 elementary
school kids to a nearby mountain.

976
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:32,738
What did he do
with the kids at the mountain?

977
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,240
They just played.

978
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:36,033
What do you mean
you're the Commander-in-Chief

979
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,368
of the Children's Liberation Army?

980
01:06:37,451 --> 01:06:38,828
That's my job.

981
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:40,329
Eyelashes!

982
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:42,415
That means he really likes you!
Doesn't it?

983
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,125
You're talking an awful lot
about Mr. Bang today.

984
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:45,626
It must be nice for Mr. Bang.

985
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,586
The children understand.

986
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:50,756
The only people who do not
understand Mr. Bang are adults.

987
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:55,970
