1
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,815
Haengbok-ro is a highway that Gyeonghae-do
and Dongbang Land and Housing

2
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:09,527
are moving forward with together
to respond to the transportation demand

3
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,279
of the planned city of Hamun.

4
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,157
This is the overall route.

5
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,493
HAENGBOK-RO ROAD CONSTRUCTION ROUTE

6
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,953
This is what Haengbok-ro
will look like passing Sodeok-dong.

7
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,371
GYEONGHAE-DO, KIYOUNG-SI, SODEOK-DONG

8
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,040
-What?
-What is this?

9
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,208
Wait!

10
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,338
That's not Haengbok-ro
just passing Sodeok-dong!

11
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,298
It's plowing right through the town!

12
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,966
Are you kidding?

13
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,344
Are you trying to
split our neighborhood into two?

14
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:38,264
I mean, how could you
plan a route like that?

15
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:46,606
Gyeonghae-do was in agreement
with this route.

16
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,734
Dongbang is merely
carrying out the business on their behalf.

17
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,994
I'm a representative of Gyeonghae-do's
construction division.

18
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:05,041
We have an obligation to notify residents
of the decided route.

19
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,795
But we can't make changes to the route
through this briefing session.

20
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,006
The route was decided upon by experts
after much consideration.

21
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,301
I'm…

22
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,263
Choi Han-su, head of Sodeok-dong!

23
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:22,725
How has Gyeonghae-do
treated Sodeok-dong so far?

24
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,644
What was it?

25
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,688
-Subway line ten?
-That's it!

26
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:30,692
You kicked dozens of long-time Sodeok-dong
residents out and dug up the entire town

27
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,819
to build subway line ten!

28
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:38,408
And what has Seoul done to Sodeok-dong?

29
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,368
Tell me.

30
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,996
-Tell me!
-The garbage incineration plant!

31
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,039
Right, the garbage incineration plant.

32
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,041
It's not even for our garbage.

33
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,712
They built a garbage incineration plant
in Sodeok-dong for Seoul's trash!

34
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,505
No matter how much we opposed it,

35
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,800
neither Seoul nor Gyeonghae-do
batted an eyelash.

36
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,719
Why is that relevant?

37
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:00,513
We're discussing Haengbok-ro right now.

38
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,474
We're talking about Sodeok-dong right now!

39
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,602
The construction for the subway
just finished, and the construction

40
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,770
for the garbage incineration plant
finished just before that.

41
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,689
But now, again!

42
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,357
What was it?

43
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,734
Haengbok-ro!

44
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,987
Yes! Are you asking us
to let you guys use our land again?

45
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,489
Enough with it already!

46
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,574
Okay?

47
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,620
The people of Sodeok-dong have had enough!

48
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,295
HAENGBOK-RO ROAD CONSTRUCTION ROUTE

49
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:38,176
CASE 7
A TALE ABOUT SODEOK-DONG I

50
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,139
The fact that they decided on this route
means they want us to leave the town.

51
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,518
Imagine cars going up and down
on Haengbok-ro every day.

52
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,980
Residents will be covered
in all that noise, exhaust, and dust.

53
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,984
When we bring this up,
Gyeonghae-do and Dongbang say that…

54
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:56,527
What was it?

55
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,321
-Soundproof wall.
-Yes.

56
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,323
They say a soundproof wall
will resolve it.

57
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:04,577
But if that's put up,
then it's like having a…

58
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,371
What is it?

59
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,040
-Soundproof wall?
-No.

60
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,917
-Hey.
-Retaining wall.

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,337
Right. It's like
having a new retaining wall.

62
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,216
It's splitting the town in half
and isolating each side.

63
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:23,388
Have you spoken to Gyeonghae-do
or Dongbang in regards to compensation?

64
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:27,141
Such as financial compensation
for the difficulties you just mentioned.

65
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,226
Please.

66
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:33,398
They didn't even offer proper compensation
to those whose land was expropriated.

67
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:36,818
Do you think they would pay
for those who stayed behind?

68
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,028
They didn't pay the compensation properly?

69
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,281
Sodeok-dong is a green belt area.

70
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,408
So the appraised land value
is a lot cheaper.

71
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:46,286
Which is why
when they built subway line ten,

72
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,871
the people who had their land expropriated
took a hard financial hit.

73
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,957
Many people lost their houses

74
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,793
but they didn't even
get ten million won in compensation.

75
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,962
Where could someone who lived
in Sodeok-dong all their life go

76
00:04:56,045 --> 00:05:00,174
with money that's not even enough
to pay a rental deposit in Seoul?

77
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,928
We've done everything we can.

78
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:07,724
We've created a Residents' Countermeasures
Committee and submitted petitions,

79
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,559
made hundreds of complaint calls,

80
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,228
and even protested
in front of the provincial office.

81
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,646
But nothing.

82
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,316
Gyeonghae-do has no intention
of hearing us out!

83
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,693
So then, what's left is…

84
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,111
What is it?

85
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,195
Trial.

86
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,073
Well, it's a trial. But the thing…

87
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,116
A lawsuit?

88
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,827
A lawsuit seeking revocation
of the road zone decision of Haengbok-ro?

89
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,662
Goodness.

90
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,457
That's right.
We're thinking of doing that.

91
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,793
Yes. We understand your wishes.

92
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:39,464
But we're not experts
on road construction,

93
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:42,175
so we're going to need some time
to look into Haengbok-ro.

94
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:45,136
Can we investigate before we decide
whether or not to accept this case?

95
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,471
Of course.

96
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,931
But please make the decision quickly.

97
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,351
They started construction
in the planned city a while ago, so…

98
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,312
What is it?

99
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,232
-A shovel?
-A hydraulic excavator?

100
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,068
A digger.

101
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,028
Yes.

102
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:06,574
It won't be long
until the digger comes for our village.

103
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,659
Yes, all right. We'll be in touch.

104
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:09,660
Gosh.

105
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,662
Thank you.

106
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:12,580
All right.

107
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,171
Goodbye.

108
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,720
What do you think?

109
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,181
Why did they plan a route like this?

110
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:33,184
There must've been
ways of taking a detour too.

111
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,769
Probably because of the costs.

112
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:38,648
Going straight through instead of going
around means a shorter road to build.

113
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,734
If this decision was made
solely for the costs, then we could claim

114
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,570
a violation of the Principle of
Proportionality under administrative law.

115
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,906
An administrative agency
has to choose the method

116
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:50,159
that has the least infringement
of rights for the other party.

117
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,453
But even though
Gyeonghae-do had an alternative detour,

118
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,248
they didn't choose it
with costs being the only reason.

119
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:56,791
They violated

120
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,085
the principle of minimal damage
of the Principle of Proportionality.

121
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:02,380
If we calculate the damage
to the residents as social costs,

122
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:05,424
couldn't it be greater than the benefits
from the construction of Haengbok-ro?

123
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,803
Then this planned route
has a conflict of interest.

124
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,055
"It is a violation
of the Principle of Proportionality,"

125
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,765
"There is a conflict of interest."

126
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,600
They're all good points.

127
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,019
But the Judicial Branch
is typically reluctant

128
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,521
to make a judgment
on what the Executive Branch does.

129
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,190
Especially for cases like this
where it gets technical.

130
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,568
It's too much pressure for a judge

131
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,154
to make a ruling
about a field they don't know well.

132
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,614
Maybe it's because of what you just said,

133
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,826
but not many residents have won
similar administrative litigations so far.

134
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,995
I don't think I've heard
of a case like that either.

135
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,832
First, visit some experts
and hear what they think.

136
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,793
Whether this planned route is the best
or if there are any alternative routes.

137
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,545
We have to know that first

138
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,465
before deciding on whether
or not to take this case.

139
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,594
Civil engineers in Korea are so simple.

140
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:54,015
They completely ignored the shape
of the land and drew a straight line.

141
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,850
In Europe,

142
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,686
they consider the way from the airport
to the capital a scenic road.

143
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,022
So they don't build it straight like this.

144
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,274
They make the most
of the natural curves of the land

145
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,943
so that the road winds just enough.

146
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,488
They get people to take their time
and enjoy their way,

147
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,907
creating an idyllic atmosphere
with the road itself

148
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,867
and promoting the image of the country.

149
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,203
This is ridiculous.

150
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:19,624
From a civil engineering perspective,
this planned route isn't that bad.

151
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,125
I know this neighborhood well.

152
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:25,046
I ask my students to do city design
assignments based on this neighborhood.

153
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,008
The first time I heard that a road

154
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,135
was going to be
constructed here was in 2016.

155
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,304
Gosh, that's already six years ago.

156
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,932
What if Haengbok-ro is designed
to go around Sodeok-dong

157
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,600
instead of going through it?

158
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,185
To go around,

159
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:44,148
the road has to be built next to
Pyeonghwa-ro, a highway below Sodeok-dong.

160
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,566
Or right above here,

161
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,486
right next to subway line ten.

162
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:52,281
But to build it near Pyeonghwa-ro,
it'd require a lot of tunnel construction

163
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,825
and it'd be tricky
to build an intersection.

164
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,662
It'd be better to build it
next to subway line ten,

165
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,039
but this is the
University of Defense Security's land.

166
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,624
So it would be difficult.

167
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,835
If going below or above
is difficult, there is another way.

168
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,588
Take it underground.

169
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,132
They're called underground roads.

170
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,926
Wouldn't that cost even more?

171
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,511
No, not really.

172
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,722
In areas where the land is expensive,
building roads underground

173
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,392
costs much less
compared to building it on the surface.

174
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:24,814
And if you build the road underground,
the land on the surface can still be used.

175
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,817
If we consider
the utilization value of the land,

176
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,862
it can offset additional fees that come
from changing it to an underground plan.

177
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,115
If there is no huge difference in costs,

178
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,493
why aren't Gyeonghae-do or Dongbang
considering underground roads?

179
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,828
That's because

180
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,623
everyone who builds roads
is a civil engineering major.

181
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,875
And civil engineering only deals
with the ground's surface.

182
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,628
Taking it underground
is an architectural concept.

183
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,505
It may be simple, but it's still space.

184
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,507
No, that's not true.

185
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,760
You must think objectively.

186
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,513
Is the land in Sodeok-dong
worthy enough of preservation

187
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,974
to build an underground road?

188
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:00,933
The answer is no.

189
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:05,187
Sodeok-dong may be a suburb of Seoul,
but it also has a military purpose.

190
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,856
Lifting the green belt zoning
is not likely.

191
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,191
There's almost no possibility
of it becoming a planned city.

192
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,195
So are you saying

193
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,990
we shouldn't file a lawsuit at all?

194
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,576
From what we've found out,

195
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,494
it would be hard to claim

196
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,247
that there's a better alternative
to the planned route.

197
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,500
Then the chances of winning
the suit are very low.

198
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:30,546
Administrative litigations take
a minimum of three months for a ruling

199
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,465
or up to a year and a half.

200
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,967
We're concerned that
too much time and energy

201
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,763
will be spent on a lawsuit
that has a low chance of winning.

202
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,476
I didn't want to bring this up.

203
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:50,149
But I'm a bit well-off.

204
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,068
What?

205
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,945
He's a great man of wealth.

206
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,323
His family has lived in Sodeok-dong
for generations

207
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,575
and the land he inherited
from his ancestors

208
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,370
is not only in Sodeok-dong
but all over Kiyoung.

209
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:06,457
-You can't pass through Kiyoung
-Gosh, stop.

210
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,459
without stepping on his land.

211
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,086
Right.

212
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,504
This lawsuit…

213
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:13,631
What is it?

214
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,467
You know, that idiom.

215
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,593
Eggs…

216
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,889
Don't put all your eggs in one basket?

217
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:22,848
No, the…

218
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,725
Hitting a boulder with an egg.

219
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,228
That's right.

220
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,980
I know this is like trying
to hit a boulder with an egg.

221
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,232
But we're going to do it.

222
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,860
Even if we lose,
and even if I'm on my own.

223
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,780
I'll pay as much
commission fee as you want.

224
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,867
So could you please stand with the egg?

225
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,744
Well…

226
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,500
Why don't we take this to Sodeok-dong?

227
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,836
-Excuse me?
-I mean…

228
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,462
How can you decide on

229
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,090
whether or not to take this case
without visiting Sodeok-dong?

230
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:59,009
No. The materials
you showed us are enough.

231
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,220
We have a lot to do and so little time.

232
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:05,349
Come on, Sodeok-dong is really close.
It's only an hour's drive from here.

233
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:10,479
Yes, even if you reject us,
do it in Sodeok-dong. Okay?

234
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,357
No, we have something after this,

235
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,900
-so we should…
-Attorney Jung, let's go.

236
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:16,861
Hurry.

237
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,404
-Let's go.
-But…

238
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:19,780
Attorney Jung.

239
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,073
It won't take long.

240
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,034
Right here.

241
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,828
-Hello.
-Hello.

242
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,371
-Get in this way.
-Thank you.

243
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,206
-Hello.
-Hello.

244
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,375
-Is Attorney Jung on his way?
-Yes, he'll be here soon.

245
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,919
-We still have to wait for one more.
-Got it.

246
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,885
They're such a good-looking match.

247
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,597
Don't you think
Jun-ho likes Attorney Choi?

248
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,145
Would you like to change seats with me?

249
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,440
I think the good-looking match
should sit side by side.

250
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,483
Excuse me?

251
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,400
What?

252
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,762
You catch on quick, Attorney Woo.

253
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,430
You do.

254
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,694
You see those red flags over there?

255
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,324
Dongbang sent people over recently
to put them up.

256
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:48,536
They're marking the route
of the construction in advance.

257
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,840
From here, it's Sodeok-dong.

258
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,052
Should we get off and walk for a bit?

259
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,011
Sure.

260
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,115
The town is so beautiful.

261
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,908
The town is beautiful,

262
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,160
but the people who live here
are even better.

263
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,663
Look.

264
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,332
Over there, that's the Kim Jang-hoon
of Sodeok-dong.

265
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,750
Hey!

266
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,587
Hey!

267
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,343
Why is he the Kim Jang-hoon
of Sodeok-dong?

268
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,722
Well, that's his nickname.
He's a donating angel.

269
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:54,018
Every year, he donates
the rice he grows to City Hall.

270
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,395
For those less fortunate in Kiyoung.

271
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,982
-Shall we go?
-Yes.

272
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:11,577
Right.

273
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,539
Heung-min.

274
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,249
Heung-min.

275
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,210
-Is it Son Heung-min this time?
-Yes.

276
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,545
Son Heung-min of Sodeok-dong.

277
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,547
The thing in Kiyoung…

278
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,132
What is it called again?

279
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,759
-An athletic competition?
-Yes.

280
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,469
When we have athletic competitions,

281
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:31,639
we win first place
or second place at events like tug-of-war.

282
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:35,726
But strangely, whenever we play soccer,
we're eliminated in the preliminary round.

283
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,436
We just couldn't get it together.

284
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,856
So we formed a soccer team
and practiced day and night.

285
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,149
And last year, we…

286
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,068
What was it?

287
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,028
-Won?
-No, but close.

288
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,488
-We made it to the semifinals.
-Yes.

289
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,657
And the one who led us there is Heung-min.

290
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,824
-There he is.
-Yes.

291
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,327
-Soccer!
-Hey.

292
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,875
So do you want an autograph?

293
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,090
-No, you fool.
-What?

294
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,175
You've said your hellos.
Now get back inside.

295
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,094
All right.

296
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,014
Goodness.

297
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:17,685
Let's go.

298
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,228
This way.

299
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,188
He's very light on his feet.

300
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,150
Sodeok-dong is full of characters.

301
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,946
There's Kim Jang-hoon and Son Heung-min.

302
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:30,990
-Hello.
-Hello.

303
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,909
-Are you headed to the field?
-Yes.

304
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,454
This house is where the Teresa
of Sodeok-dong lives.

305
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,372
Come here.

306
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,332
Mother Teresa?

307
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,167
Yes, President Teresa
of the women's association.

308
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,961
-I see.
-Hello.

309
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,546
Teresa.

310
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:46,714
My goodness.

311
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,174
You must be the attorneys.

312
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,760
Thank you for coming.

313
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,513
We don't have a public bathhouse
here in Sodeok-dong.

314
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,266
That's why President Teresa
of the women's association

315
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,644
takes all the elders to the one
in the next neighborhood once a month.

316
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:04,857
She scrubs their backs and even takes
them out for seolleongtang afterward.

317
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,983
Gosh.

318
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,068
We do it with the town dues.

319
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:12,823
It's not easy to make the time
and effort to do it every month.

320
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,617
It's only possible because you're Teresa.

321
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,703
Gosh, it's no big deal!

322
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,497
All of you attorneys,

323
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,250
please take good care of Sodeok-dong.

324
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,544
Please.

325
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,757
Take good care of us.

326
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,301
Please.

327
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:37,514
So do you two have nicknames too?

328
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,807
Of course.

329
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,225
I'm the…

330
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,603
-"What Was It of Sodeok-dong"?
-No.

331
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,647
-The Lee Kun-hee of Sodeok-dong.
-Sorry?

332
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,025
I told you, I'm quite well-off.

333
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,818
What about you, Chairman?

334
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,572
I'm the Jang Dong-gun of Sodeok-dong.

335
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:54,782
What?

336
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,993
Why are you so surprised?

337
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,496
This one is handsome
with strong facial features.

338
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:04,333
Whenever single women
of Sodeok-dong pass by his house,

339
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,335
what was it?

340
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,088
They straighten their clothes.

341
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,714
My gosh!

342
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,926
There are no unmarried women
who would do that in Sodeok-dong.

343
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,512
The average age of the residents is 65.

344
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:19,848
I see.

345
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:24,561
So that's why you haven't been able to
get married this whole time.

346
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:28,065
Okay. I think that's enough
of seeing the residents.

347
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,359
Should we go see the town view?

348
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,695
Let's walk to the hackberry tree
on the hilltop.

349
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,499
That's Sodeok-dong's natural monument.

350
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,552
Has it been designated
as an actual natural monument?

351
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,846
No. It's just a natural monument
of Sodeok-dong.

352
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,514
Like the Jang Dong-gun of Sodeok-dong.

353
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,557
Right.

354
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:06,186
When was it? Was it 2016?

355
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,064
We asked the provincial office
just in case.

356
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,609
But the experts came to check
and said it's not enough to be designated.

357
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,530
They said it's not enough
to be a natural monument.

358
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,490
It's so majestic.

359
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,909
I thought it would at least
be a protected tree.

360
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,329
-What a shame.
-So what if it has no title?

361
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,833
There's no one in Sodeok-dong
who hasn't climbed up that tree as a kid,

362
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,211
hosted a party under it
to celebrate something,

363
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,964
or prayed in front of it
when they were desperate.

364
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:37,718
It doesn't have any official title,
but it keeps our town safe like…

365
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,011
What is that called?

366
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,470
A hackberry tree?

367
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,140
A guardian tree.

368
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:47,269
Well, once Haengbok-ro is constructed
that tree will be chopped down as well.

369
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,694
All right, let's go.

370
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,788
We're going to climb up the hill.
Just a bit more.

371
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,550
Attorney Woo!

372
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,762
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

373
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,269
Just a moment. Gosh.

374
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,604
Your jacket got torn.

375
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,189
Right.

376
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,068
Here, put this on for now.

377
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,903
It's fine.

378
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:41,281
You're working right now
and wearing that wouldn't be right.

379
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,001
Here, come. Sit over here. This way.

380
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,335
My goodness, good job.

381
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,840
Be careful.

382
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,262
I'm sure you're all winded
after climbing up the hill.

383
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,973
-Have a cup of sikhye to cool down.
-I'll do it.

384
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,933
Teresa prepared this for us.

385
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,602
-Here.
-It should be really good.

386
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,775
By the way, who is he?

387
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:02,112
Right, he's Eugene Park of Sodeok-dong.

388
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,656
I put in a special request and asked him

389
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,576
to come and play the violin today
because you're visiting.

390
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,120
He's the best talent in Sodeok-dong.

391
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,830
Wait, where is it?

392
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,666
-Gyeonghae-do provincial office.
-That's right!

393
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,710
He works there.

394
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,379
All right.

395
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,693
All right.

396
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,111
Look over there.

397
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:57,709
I put a lot of thought into how to
show you the worth of Sodeok-dong.

398
00:22:58,877 --> 00:22:59,920
The truth is,

399
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:03,048
if you look at just the numbers,

400
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,467
Sodeok-dong doesn't have much
to show for itself.

401
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:10,138
There aren't that many residents
and the price of land is cheap.

402
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,475
But if you see for yourself,
that's not what it is.

403
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,478
It's an amazing neighborhood
where Kim Jang-hoon,

404
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,313
Son Heung-min, Teresa,

405
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:21,399
and Eugene Park live.

406
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:26,154
Although it's not enough
to be a protected tree,

407
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,698
how great is this hackberry tree?

408
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,996
It's not a neighborhood

409
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,332
that can just be torn down

410
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:39,668
and disappear like that.

411
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,152
We have to know everything
about Haengbok-ro.

412
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,279
From the moment
the construction was first planned

413
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:08,947
to when they decided
on the area of the road.

414
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,575
Organize it in chronological order
and look through the materials thoroughly.

415
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,245
Go through everything including
relevant regulations and precedents.

416
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,454
-Got it.
-Got it.

417
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:20,125
Jun-ho said he put the case materials
in my office, so divide them accordingly.

418
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:24,087
I'm sure you'll be able to go through it
quickly since it's the three…

419
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,562
Are these all materials on Haengbok-ro?

420
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,273
I don't think we'll be able
to go through it quickly.

421
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,983
We won't be able
to look through it quickly.

422
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,651
Yes, well…

423
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:47,986
You got this!

424
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,188
Did you eat? You must be so tired.

425
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,318
Those aren't additional materials, right?

426
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,446
Please don't tell me
there's more for us to read.

427
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,949
I'm sorry. They are additional materials.

428
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,494
These are the documents on the complaints

429
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:21,246
the Residents' Countermeasures
Committee sent to Gyeonghae-do.

430
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,039
And these are the responses
by Gyeonghae-do.

431
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,110
-Keep up the good work.
-Thanks.

432
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,664
Do you not know
or are you pretending not to know?

433
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,961
What?

434
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:14,466
From what I see, I think Jun-ho likes you.

435
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:16,676
Right.

436
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,596
I don't think so. I asked him.

437
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,140
You asked him?

438
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,559
What did you ask him?

439
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:30,106
Lee Jun-ho likes Woo Young-woo.

440
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:31,816
Is this true?

441
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,153
Gosh.

442
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,613
You interrogated him.

443
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:39,908
What did Jun-ho say?

444
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,786
That…

445
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:46,081
is too hard of a question

446
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,375
for Director Hwang Du-yong to answer.

447
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:53,755
Jun-ho avoided speaking
on the matter directly.

448
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,883
Gosh, are you in the middle of a trial?
Is love a trial?

449
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,719
What do you mean he avoided
speaking on the matter directly?

450
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:04,182
He changed the subject
without giving a clear answer.

451
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,558
Of course!

452
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:08,019
"Lee Jun-ho likes Woo Young-woo.
Is this true?"

453
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,979
If you asked him like that,
do you expect him to say,

454
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,774
"Yes, that is indisputably true"?

455
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,901
Even I would avoid
speaking about it directly.

456
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,199
What about you?

457
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:22,951
Do you like Jun-ho?

458
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:33,920
It's not easy.

459
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:38,007
It's not easy for someone to like me.

460
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,260
What?

461
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,679
I know that much.

462
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:45,473
You're a good-looking woman, but…

463
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,600
I have autism.

464
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,023
You…

465
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,946
You shouldn't say
those weak-minded things!

466
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,699
What do you mean it's not easy?

467
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,176
So,

468
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:25,054
you want to know

469
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:28,600
-if Woo Young-woo likes Lee Jun-ho?
-Yes.

470
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,770
Jeez, you should ask someone
who knows something about dating.

471
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:32,771
What does she know?

472
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,023
I'm the femme fatale of Ganghwa-do.

473
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,567
I'm the second most fatal thing
after hwamunseok mats.

474
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,780
-Focus.
-Okay.

475
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,449
All right.

476
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,993
Picture Lee Jun-ho now.

477
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,914
-How do you feel?
-Okay.

478
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,416
One, two, three.

479
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,084
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

480
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,461
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

481
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:58,213
-One, two. Now.
-Three.

482
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,255
One, two.

483
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,389
Jun-ho…

484
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,226
is kind.

485
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,104
You're working right now
and wearing that wouldn't be right.

486
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:23,905
He's a warmhearted person.

487
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:28,117
Then what about when you're with him?
Do you get nervous?

488
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,328
Does your heart pound like crazy?

489
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,674
I want an attorney like you

490
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,343
to be on my side.

491
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,184
There was a time when it did.

492
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,102
Gosh!

493
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,271
You're blushing!

494
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,981
Hey, you totally like him!

495
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:01,860
Hey.

496
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:05,363
If you're not sure,
why don't you try touching him?

497
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,115
What?

498
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:10,451
Measure your heart rate to see how fast
it beats when you touch him.

499
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,954
If it's only 150 per minute,
then you're just interested.

500
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:18,126
But if your heart beats like crazy
and it feels like it's about to explode

501
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:21,087
because it's thumping so loud,
then you really like him.

502
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,213
Hey!

503
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,590
What's wrong with you?

504
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,967
Do you hear what you're saying?
That's a crime.

505
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,051
What?

506
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,136
That's right.

507
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,680
You shouldn't touch other people
without their consent.

508
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:32,140
Then ask for his consent.

509
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,605
What?

510
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:55,038
This is the first time we're going
head-to-head with Taesan kids.

511
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,499
Kids? Since when are they kids to you?

512
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,044
I went to law school with one of them,

513
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,338
which means he's a rookie.

514
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,549
And the other one
doesn't really seem that old either.

515
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,134
That's true.

516
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,637
Is it just the two of them
without a senior attorney?

517
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,629
Hello. Good afternoon.

518
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,215
That's Attorney Tae Su-mi, right?

519
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,426
-Why is the king here herself?
-"King"?

520
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,887
She's a king?

521
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,348
Up until recently,
she was the CEO of Taesan.

522
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,558
I heard she resigned
and is active as an ordinary attorney.

523
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,228
It seems like
she personally shows up to court.

524
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,396
Right.

525
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,941
There are rumors that she's a candidate
for Minister of Justice. Is she not busy?

526
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:08,069
Stop with the gossiping
and let's focus on the case. Go.

527
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,546
The planned route for Haengbok-ro,
which the defendant designed,

528
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:30,633
penetrates Sodeok-dong, the plaintiffs'
place of residence, splitting it in half.

529
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:33,052
Please look at this alternative route.

530
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,180
Haengbok-ro can go around
the south of Sodeok-dong,

531
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,808
or the north,

532
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,310
or be built underground.

533
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,438
There are plenty of other alternatives,

534
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,190
but the defendant underestimated
the plaintiffs' rights

535
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,943
and overestimated the benefits
of the construction of the road,

536
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,738
and came to a decision
that has a conflict of interest.

537
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:52,864
That is all.

538
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:53,865
PLAINTIFF

539
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:59,245
Defendant, is the plaintiffs' claim true?

540
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:01,914
Did you not thoroughly review
the alternative routes?

541
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,500
We thoroughly reviewed them, Your Honor.

542
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:08,004
I will personally show you

543
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:10,548
why the three routes
that the plaintiffs have suggested

544
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,508
can't be good alternatives.

545
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:21,476
I apologize.

546
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,978
I got you and the associate judges
to make an appearance

547
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:27,273
without asking
for your consent in advance.

548
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:29,484
Is that us?

549
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,403
The three bobbing their heads
dressed in robes?

550
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,446
Yes.

551
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:37,158
The weather is very nice today.

552
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,495
Since I can't take you outside the court,

553
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:43,498
shall we go for a ride
on Haengbok-ro like this?

554
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:50,588
First, we'll drive through
the first route in the plaintiffs' claim.

555
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:05,645
If Haengbok-ro were to be built
in the south, next to Pyeonghwa-ro,

556
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,731
the road would have to stretch out
for five more kilometers.

557
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,775
That's not the only issue.

558
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:13,820
There's a garbage incineration plant
near Pyeonghwa-ro.

559
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:18,157
The facility is impossible to relocate.
Then what should we do?

560
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:22,286
Tunnels and elevated roadways
need to be built.

561
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:26,457
Not to mention having to build
a sharp curve to connect it to Seoul.

562
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,589
Additional construction
would cost over 300 billion won,

563
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,842
but it's five kilometers longer.

564
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,469
Not to mention, the road is bumpy
like a rollercoaster

565
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:41,389
which will lead to countless accidents.

566
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:45,518
Then what about the second route?

567
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:51,732
If we were to build Haengbok-ro
on the north next to subway line ten,

568
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:55,194
we have to pass land owned by
the University of Defense Security.

569
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,947
But they would not agree
and that would lead to this.

570
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,839
The plaintiffs also do not agree.

571
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:18,759
The University of Defense Security's wish
to not give up their barns is important,

572
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:22,388
but you're ignoring the wishes
of the residents of Sodeok-dong.

573
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:23,973
Your Honor.

574
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:27,059
The planned city of Hamun
starts the move-in process next June.

575
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:31,689
If this lawsuit causes a delay
in the completion of Haengbok-ro,

576
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:35,693
Seoul and Gyeonghae-do will face
the worst traffic situations imaginable.

577
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:40,573
Other towns included in the planned route
of Haengbok-ro understood this

578
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,783
and gladly gave up their land.

579
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:43,868
However,

580
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:48,664
Sodeok-dong, the town with the smallest
population in all of Gyeonghae-do,

581
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:53,586
is being exceptionally uncooperative
and is even bringing up underground roads.

582
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:56,380
This is clearly regional chauvinism, and--

583
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,341
What do you mean regional chauvinism?

584
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,052
How could you
denounce our wishes like that?

585
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:05,306
Other neighborhoods must've received
proper compensation to cooperate.

586
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,142
Their situations are different
from Sodeok-dong.

587
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,310
Right.

588
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,437
I see.

589
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:18,277
Are you proceeding with this lawsuit
to receive more compensation?

590
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:21,113
-You--
-Billions in taxpayer money can be wasted

591
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:24,116
and traffic disruptions
across the entire area are fine

592
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,411
as long as you get paid more compensation?

593
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:30,289
Stopping this even if
it means filing a lawsuit.

594
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,709
Isn't that the very definition
of regional chauvinism?

595
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,127
-It's not like that.
-I mean…

596
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,420
Sit down, it's okay.

597
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,047
Your Honor.

598
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:41,592
Construction for Haengbok-ro
is already substantially underway

599
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,803
with goals to be completed
by end of this year.

600
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:46,055
If this decision is revoked now,

601
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,975
it is evident that
tens of billions of won will be wasted.

602
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:50,810
That is all.

603
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,441
Wait…

604
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,463
Come in.

605
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:23,175
Hey, Young-woo. Eat some bread.

606
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,886
There's a new bakery in the neighborhood…

607
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,681
THE GREAT CEO ATTORNEY TAE SU-MI

608
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:32,351
ATTORNEY TAE SU-MI

609
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,481
What are you doing?

610
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,650
Do you know Attorney Tae Su-mi?

611
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:45,114
She was the CEO of Taesan Law Firm
until she recently resigned.

612
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:48,367
She's the daughter of Taesan's founder,
married the president of Gangcheon Group,

613
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,328
-and has one son--
-Why…

614
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,705
are you looking into Tae Su-mi?

615
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,249
Right.

616
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,794
She is the opposing attorney
of the case I'm on right now.

617
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:00,713
What?

618
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:02,840
I saw her plead her case

619
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:05,760
and even though she's in the opposition,
she was amazing.

620
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,721
I wanted to be like her.

621
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,662
All right. Come here.

622
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:34,872
-Wait.
-Stop!

623
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,457
-Wait!
-Stop!

624
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,125
-Wait!
-Stop!

625
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,169
-Wait!
-Stop!

626
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,631
-Wait!
-What are you doing?

627
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,007
-Stop!
-Stop!

628
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,635
What are you doing?

629
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,595
Who said you could go ahead
with the construction?

630
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:50,763
What?

631
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,306
What do you mean?

632
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,266
This is road construction
conducted by the government.

633
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,518
Look.

634
00:39:56,727 --> 00:40:00,356
We're in the middle of a lawsuit
to stop the construction!

635
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:03,442
-What's that? To stop the construction…
-Suspension of effect.

636
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,653
Right, we applied
for suspension of effect!

637
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:08,322
-What?
-Then take it up with the judge.

638
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,325
-Why are you doing this here?
-This is so annoying.

639
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,745
Look, are you going to take
responsibility if we don't get paid

640
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,122
because we don't finish it on time?

641
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,289
What are you talking about?

642
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,791
I'm talking about going ahead
with the construction.

643
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:21,377
-Sir, lift it up!
-Lift it up!

644
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,045
-Lift it up!
-You punk.

645
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,549
-Goodness.
-Hey! You jerks!

646
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,175
-What are you doing?
-Move!

647
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:37,226
Let go of me!

648
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,227
Wait.

649
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:40,813
Move.

650
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,153
Attorney Jung.

651
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:50,114
When will the suspension of effect
be in place?

652
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,700
The construction workers
barged in through the town's entrance

653
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,410
and are digging up the ground.

654
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:56,495
It's a whole mess here right now.

655
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,206
A decision hasn't been made
about the suspension of effect,

656
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,709
so there's no way to
stop the construction right now.

657
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:05,087
I will request the court
to speed up its decision.

658
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:07,673
All right.

659
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,096
Was that about Haengbok-ro?

660
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:17,183
It seems like they've started
the construction near Sodeok-dong.

661
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:20,269
Does the decision on suspension of effect
take this long?

662
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:22,146
The court couldn't have
forgotten about it, right?

663
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:23,731
There's no way they forgot.

664
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:28,068
I think they're going to hold onto it and
dismiss it along with the original draft.

665
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,071
Which means, to the judge, this case

666
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,407
has almost no possibility
of ruling in favor of the plaintiff.

667
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,452
I'm sure it would put
a lot of pressure on the judges.

668
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:38,537
Whether Haengbok-ro
exists or not would cause

669
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:41,123
drastic differences in the land value
in the planned city of Hamun.

670
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:44,084
If they revoke it recklessly,
they might become a public enemy.

671
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,545
Which is why we have to
find the cause of illegality.

672
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:49,048
The only time the court can revoke
what the government is doing

673
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,717
is when they come
to a judgment that the work is illegal.

674
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:55,596
I found one. A cause for illegality.

675
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:57,681
You did?

676
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,558
What is it?

677
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:03,062
They violated the process of the Strategic
Environmental Impact Assessment.

678
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:06,732
Really?

679
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,860
I saw that they did the assessment.

680
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:13,280
They did, but it's a matter of
when they did it.

681
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,783
According to the Environmental Impact
Assessment Act,

682
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,493
the Strategic Environmental
Impact Assessment has to be done

683
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:21,247
when a plan that impacts
the environment is being established.

684
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,831
However, in Haengbok-ro's case,

685
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:26,418
the plan for the road design
was established in 2017,

686
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:29,713
but the Strategic Environmental Impact
Assessment was done in 2019.

687
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:30,923
Is that right?

688
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:35,344
Then Gyeonghae-do made a mistake.
Good job. Let's lead with this.

689
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:39,598
Shouldn't we put more effort
into our presentation materials?

690
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:43,477
Maybe not the 3D game screen
like Taesan used,

691
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,312
but something flashy.

692
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,566
How could we be flashy about showing

693
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,526
that the Strategic Environmental
Impact Assessment was done late?

694
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:53,445
I heard there are companies
that create presentation materials.

695
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,239
Should I contact one of them and ask?

696
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,784
Well, why don't we go the opposite way?

697
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,163
The more Gyeonghae-do
tries to win over the judges

698
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:06,333
using a major law firm
and flashy materials,

699
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,795
shouldn't we put the sincerity
of Sodeok-dong's residents first

700
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:11,880
and approach this more straightforwardly?

701
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,466
I mean, we're a major law firm too,

702
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,052
but we'll use a more humane approach
compared to Taesan.

703
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,013
An emotional strategy.

704
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,139
Well…

705
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:24,143
Then what if we apply for an on-site
verification for Sodeok-dong?

706
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,228
-On-site verification?
-Yes.

707
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,772
At first, we didn't want
to take on the case.

708
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:31,817
But we decided to accept it
after visiting Sodeok-dong.

709
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:37,031
All right. We don't have a just cause
to do an on-site verification

710
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,199
but let's think about it.

711
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:42,703
Nice work. You did good, Attorney Woo.

712
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:53,797
Gwang-ho.

713
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,509
Gosh, I'm sorry.
Have you been waiting for long?

714
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,054
Was it a long trip out here?

715
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:03,891
What?

716
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,476
What's going on?

717
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:07,811
The case…

718
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:11,106
Young-woo is on.

719
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,402
Are you aware
that the opposing attorney is Tae Su-mi?

720
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,155
Really?

721
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:19,823
You knew it all along, didn't you?

722
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:23,243
-Know what?
-It was strange.

723
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:28,207
That the CEO would make a home visit
to give another opportunity

724
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,292
to a rookie attorney
when she was already rejected.

725
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:33,212
Did I visit just as the CEO of Hanbada?

726
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:37,675
I visited to see you as well.

727
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:38,884
Seon-young.

728
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:43,222
If you really think of me as your friend,

729
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:46,100
be honest.

730
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:50,104
Did you give Young-woo a job here

731
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:53,649
because of Tae Su-mi?

732
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,571
Seeing as you're saying all this,

733
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:04,201
it must mean that the rumor
between you and Tae Su-mi is true.

734
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:06,662
Yes.

735
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,666
I will allow it once.

736
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,376
Allow what?

737
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:15,796
I will allow you to use my daughter
to get to Tae Su-mi, just once.

738
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:18,006
In return for giving her the job.

739
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,717
"In return for giving her the job"?
"Use her"?

740
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:23,804
How could you say that?

741
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,806
You want to make Hanbada number one.

742
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,059
And to do that, you have to beat Taesan.

743
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,854
But it would be a problem
if Tae Su-mi makes her way into politics.

744
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:35,357
Because you won't be able to beat her
even more once she becomes a minister.

745
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:39,361
That's why you gave Young-woo the job.

746
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,363
Is it not?

747
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,992
So you're saying

748
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:47,828
that I gave your daughter the job

749
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:53,041
just so I could tell the whole world that
Tae Su-mi's child out of wedlock is here?

750
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:56,211
If that kind of scheme
is what got my daughter this job,

751
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:57,796
so be it.

752
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:01,091
But just once.

753
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,469
Just once at the most crucial moment.

754
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:06,555
Don't just throw them together

755
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:09,433
in the same courtroom like this.

756
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,397
What are you going on about?

757
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:17,441
Gwang-ho.

758
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:20,903
What kind of a father are you?

759
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:24,698
If you really think
I'm taking advantage of your daughter,

760
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:26,909
you should be stopping me.
Isn't that what parents should do?

761
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,285
If I stop you,

762
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,996
you'll kick my daughter out.

763
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:35,209
You'll make any excuse
to get her to stop working at Hanbada.

764
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:36,877
What?

765
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:38,754
Seon-young.

766
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:43,258
The world doesn't offer Young-woo chances.

767
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:48,180
Even if she graduated summa cum laude
from SNU law school

768
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,683
and got a near-perfect score on the bar,

769
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:55,395
they say they can't accept
people with autism.

770
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:59,149
She applied everywhere,
from law firms to private practices,

771
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:02,027
but never got a chance to interview.

772
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:03,737
Watching my daughter like that

773
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,324
and not being able
to do anything for her was…

774
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,414
I'll just…

775
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,125
be the bad dad.

776
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:21,797
No matter how much
Young-woo resents me, that's on me.

777
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:28,470
Even if I have to collude with
a bad friend who took her in to use her.

778
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:34,101
I want her to have an opportunity.

779
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,243
Wait.

780
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,746
Young-woo.

781
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,791
What are you doing here, Dad?

782
00:47:57,874 --> 00:47:59,543
The thing is…

783
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:01,628
-This is your father?
-Yes.

784
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:02,796
Hello.

785
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:03,922
Yes, hello.

786
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:08,802
I just came by to see someone I know.

787
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,138
I'm going to go.

788
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,097
-Bye.
-Bye.

789
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:14,182
I'll see you later at home.

790
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:15,767
Okay.

791
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,987
How does your father know the CEO?

792
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:27,904
Sorry?

793
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:30,282
He just came out
of the CEO's office and said

794
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:33,827
he came by to see someone he knows.
That means he knows the CEO.

795
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:35,662
What?

796
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,289
Do you know anything about it?

797
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,583
Well…

798
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:43,629
Didn't you say before that
your father graduated from SNU law school?

799
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,464
Right. Yes.

800
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:49,593
Then that means the CEO
went to school with him.

801
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,512
Wait.

802
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:55,057
So you did get this job
through connections.

803
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,141
What?

804
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:57,934
Connections?

805
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,227
I can't believe this.

806
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:01,229
I knew something was off.

807
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,024
You had connections.

808
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,237
You had connections.

809
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,839
Hello.

810
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:31,760
You can take this.

811
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:34,680
No, it's fine. I'm going to make one
for Young-woo too.

812
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:36,640
You're with Attorney Woo?

813
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:41,853
Jun-ho.

814
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,856
You still eat lunch with Young-woo, right?

815
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,608
Yes, that's right.

816
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:50,779
Is it really fun
listening to her talk about whales?

817
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,658
Well…

818
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,034
I was fine with it at first too.

819
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,787
I thought it was great for me
since she tells me all these things

820
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:01,790
when people have to make time
to watch documentaries.

821
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,793
Up to blue whales,
humpback whales, and dolphins,

822
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:07,045
it was honestly fun to hear about them.

823
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:11,299
But when you get to narwhals
and the Yangtze river dolphins,

824
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:13,802
it gets exhausting.

825
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:16,138
I was crying because I failed a test,

826
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:18,014
but then she came in
after getting the highest grade,

827
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,850
talking about how the whale's ancestor
is the Pakicetus.

828
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:21,768
It really made me want to smack her!

829
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:27,023
Look, I haven't even forgotten
about that wretched Pakicetus!

830
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:31,361
Attorney Choi, I'm not sure
I'm following you.

831
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,532
Don't act like you're going to listen
to her whale stories forever

832
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:37,242
and then tell her to stop
not even after a year.

833
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:40,454
If you're going to hurt her like that,
you shouldn't start anything at all.

834
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:42,622
I'm telling you this now.

835
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:45,542
If you think your feelings
are temporary, don't be nice to her.

836
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:48,128
My feelings are not temporary!

837
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,921
Then go tell Young-woo

838
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:51,798
that your feelings are not temporary!

839
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,717
Why are you confusing everyone?

840
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,051
What on earth did I--

841
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,178
Young-woo.

842
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:57,971
Min-woo.

843
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:01,725
Me.

844
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:06,480
We were all confused because of you.

845
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,364
Your Honor.

846
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:20,118
The defendant violated the process for
Strategic Environmental Impact Assessment.

847
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:22,329
According to the Environmental
Impact Assessment Act,

848
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,039
the assessment should be conducted

849
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:27,209
when a plan that would impact
the environment is being established.

850
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,835
But in the case of Haengbok-ro,

851
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:32,589
despite how the road's basic design and
implementation design were made in 2017,

852
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:36,843
the assessment was conducted in 2019.

853
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,970
Therefore, there is a problem
with the timing.

854
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,852
Defendant's counselor, your response.

855
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:49,564
It's true that the assessment
should be conducted

856
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:52,943
when a plan that would impact
the environment is being established.

857
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:56,488
The issue is when exactly that is.

858
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:58,949
This is the Urban Planning
Standard Procedure.

859
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:03,119
We'll put the complicated words
aside for now.

860
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:06,039
Right here. Please look at this part.

861
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:08,834
The determination of the best route

862
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:12,045
is done toward the later stages
of the overall road planning.

863
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:14,965
Haengbok-ro's determination
of the best route

864
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:17,384
was made in October of 2019.

865
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:21,513
The assessment that
the plaintiff's counselor pointed out

866
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:24,057
was conducted in June of 2019.

867
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,434
It is true that
the assessment for Haengbok-ro

868
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:30,689
had been conducted a bit late,
compared to other road plans.

869
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:32,065
However, it was clearly done

870
00:52:32,148 --> 00:52:35,986
before the plan that would impact
the environment was established.

871
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:37,946
This is not illegal.

872
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:02,971
That is not true.

873
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,474
If the defendant's counselor's claim
is right,

874
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:10,145
then when the plaintiffs filed
a complaint, they should've been able

875
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:14,149
to change the road construction plan,
thus the route, before October of 2019.

876
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:17,027
But if you look at Gyeonghae-do's reply
at the time, there's a phrase that says

877
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:21,281
"the design is already complete,
so changing is impossible."

878
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:24,576
Is that so?
Where exactly is that phrase written?

879
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:27,120
There are so many
pieces of evidence submitted.

880
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:39,382
I'm sorry. They are additional materials.

881
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:42,677
These are the documents on the complaints

882
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,304
the Residents' Countermeasures Committee
sent to Gyeonghae-do.

883
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,139
And these are the responses
by Gyeonghae-do.

884
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:48,099
April 3rd, 2019.

885
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:50,644
The second line of the third paragraph
on the response

886
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,312
sent to Sodeok-dong's Residents'
Countermeasures Committee by Gyeonghae-do.

887
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:57,609
"The basic design and the implementation
design have already been completed,

888
00:53:57,692 --> 00:54:00,320
thus the decision of the road's route
cannot be changed"

889
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:01,696
is the phrase.

890
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,740
Plaintiff's Exhibit 4,

891
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:06,117
the reply that was sent in the name
of the governor of Gyeonghae-do.

892
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,256
Yes, that is correct.

893
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:26,012
According to this reply, Gyeonghae-do
had already acknowledged

894
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:29,099
that the route of the road
was decided in April of 2019.

895
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:30,392
That means

896
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:35,105
the plaintiff's counselors' point that the
Strategic Environmental Impact Assessment

897
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,565
was done afterward

898
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,111
seems reasonable.

899
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,658
Good job.

900
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:56,126
Your Honor.

901
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:59,337
We request an on-site verification
of Sodeok-dong.

902
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,381
If you see for yourself how much damage

903
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,717
Haengbok-ro will cause to the residents,

904
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:08,513
we feel like it would be of huge help
to your wise judgment.

905
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:12,976
There's a lot to look at
from the submitted evidence alone.

906
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:15,061
Just submit a picture.

907
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,188
It's too far for me
to personally go there.

908
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:18,565
No, it isn't!

909
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,817
Sodeok-dong is very close to here.

910
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,360
It's an hour's drive.

911
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:25,864
There are definitely things you can
only know by seeing the town in person.

912
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:29,492
Your Honor.
Please come to Sodeok-dong, just once.

913
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,851
You're an attorney at Hanbada, right?

914
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:59,731
We're on the same case
and I don't even know your name.

915
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:00,815
I'm Tae Su-mi.

916
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:04,986
Right.

917
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,530
My name

918
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:11,743
is Woo Young-woo.

919
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:14,496
Whether it's read straight or flipped,
it's still Woo Young-woo.

920
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,873
Kayak, deed, rotator,
noon, racecar, Woo Young-woo.

921
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,376
Woo Young-woo?

922
00:56:21,377 --> 00:56:23,254
Why does that name sound familiar?

923
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,967
Anyway, it's nice to meet you.

924
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:31,054
That was impressive earlier.
You have quite the memory.

925
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:32,847
Right.

926
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:34,766
Yes.

927
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:47,403
Thanks.

928
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:55,954
Attorney Woo, give it to me.

929
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:10,009
Is everyone headed to the office?
I have one extra seat.

930
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,302
You do? Then--

931
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:12,846
Young-woo should get in.

932
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:15,265
You get in.

933
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:49,841
I wanted to get back comfortably.
What's wrong with you?

934
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,218
You should've given up your own seat.

935
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,637
People with rotten instincts
don't deserve to go comfortably.

936
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:57,307
"Rotten"? Are you talking to me?

937
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,601
You're going to take a taxi, right?
I'll get one.

938
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:01,519
By the way, did you know

939
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:04,147
that Attorney Woo's father
graduated from SNU law school?

940
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:06,941
He seemed to be friends with the CEO.

941
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:09,694
How did you figure that out
with those rotten instincts?

942
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:11,029
You think this is funny?

943
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:14,157
Is Attorney Woo getting a job here through
her connections with the CEO funny?

944
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:17,118
Isn't this something everyone
should be furious and nervous about?

945
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:21,331
Why would we all be furious and nervous?

946
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:22,665
It's unfair employment.

947
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,003
What are you talking about?

948
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:29,339
Do you have proof of that?

949
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:32,258
I saw her father
come out of the CEO's office.

950
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,010
Think about it.

951
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:37,222
Hanbada, Taesan,
and all the other major law firms

952
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:39,682
confirm employment
before law school graduation.

953
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:42,435
But she joined the law firm
six months after she graduated

954
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:45,647
and after the orientation and workshop.

955
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,148
Is this not weird to you?

956
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:48,983
It's because she has connections.

957
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:50,902
So what if she does?

958
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:55,323
Are you going to report it
to the police or the audit team?

959
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:58,535
If you put it that way,

960
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:01,329
did the CEO become the CEO
just because of her abilities?

961
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:04,707
Did she not inherit the position
from her father, the founder of Hanbada?

962
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:05,708
So what?

963
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:08,753
Are you saying if we work at a company
where even the CEO is problematic,

964
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:11,172
this level of dishonesty
should be overlooked?

965
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:12,549
Is that what you're saying?

966
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:14,842
Do you feel guilty
because you could've also

967
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,344
benefited from your high-ranking father?

968
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:19,556
Or are you sympathizing with Attorney Woo?

969
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,057
What I'm saying is

970
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:25,103
don't act all self-righteous
when you just want to bully Young-woo.

971
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:28,690
If you really want to make an issue
out of this, do it with the CEO first.

972
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:30,733
Why are you doing this to Young-woo
when you can't even mess with the strong?

973
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,402
Woo Young-woo is the strong!

974
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:34,362
Can't you see?

975
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,783
You said her nickname in law school was
"First Place is Woo Young-woo Anyway."

976
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:41,077
This is an unfair game.

977
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:45,039
Woo Young-woo wins against us every time,
and yet, we shouldn't attack her. Why?

978
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:46,583
Because she has autism.

979
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:49,877
We always have to
be considerate of her and help her.

980
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:52,630
We even have to give up
that one empty seat in the car!

981
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:56,134
Don't think that

982
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:58,469
Woo Young-woo is the weak.

983
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:03,850
Hey…

984
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:42,305
Is something wrong?

985
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:44,015
Right.

986
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:45,683
No.

987
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:09,874
You did good today, Attorney Woo.

988
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:11,918
Yes, you did good today too.

989
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:16,547
Should we head out?

990
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:22,845
Jun-ho.

991
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:25,515
Yes?

992
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,100
Can I…

993
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:29,644
touch you

994
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,729
just once?

995
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:36,734
What?

996
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:42,031
I want to check whether or not I like you.

997
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:47,954
Right.

998
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:50,957
I see.

999
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:01,884
Can you only check

1000
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:03,970
by touching me?

1001
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:06,889
Well…

1002
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,810
I'm trying to check my heart rate

1003
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:13,688
to see how fast my heart beats

1004
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,607
when I touch you.

1005
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:20,319
So…

1006
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:24,824
your heart doesn't race

1007
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:29,203
if we're not touching?

1008
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:37,378
Even when you're with me?

1009
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:48,848
That's disappointing.

1010
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,274
You're home?

1011
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:42,902
I'm home. I'm going to head in first.

1012
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:43,861
Hey, Young-woo.

1013
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:45,822
I have something to say.

1014
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:48,783
Tell me tomorrow.

1015
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:50,535
I'm very tired today.

1016
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:53,204
CEO Han Seon-young
is a friend of mine from university.

1017
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:02,171
We were quite close
when we were in school.

1018
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:06,259
But once we graduated, we lost touch
because we were both busy.

1019
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:10,012
Anyway, she came to see me.

1020
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,060
She offered to give you a job at Hanbada.

1021
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:20,857
What?

1022
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,442
I thought it was time that you know too.

1023
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:27,947
So did I…

1024
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:34,078
get my job through
my connections with the CEO?

1025
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:36,372
Then have I benefited

1026
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:39,125
from nepotism?

1027
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:43,337
Whether you have or not,
I'm grateful to Seon-young.

1028
01:04:44,505 --> 01:04:47,758
You and I both had a hard time
because you couldn't get a job.

1029
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:52,013
You'll understand
when you become a parent yourself,

1030
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:55,766
how painful it is
to watch your child be discouraged.

1031
01:04:58,185 --> 01:04:59,270
Hey.

1032
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:03,190
There's actually another reason

1033
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:07,236
for Seon-young giving you the job.

1034
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:09,196
It's--

1035
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,365
I want to be completely discouraged.

1036
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:13,868
What?

1037
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:18,623
If I have to be discouraged,
I would like to face it

1038
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:22,043
and cope with it myself.

1039
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:25,463
Because I am an adult.

1040
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:26,964
Young-woo.

1041
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:30,676
I don't like it
when you intervene in my life

1042
01:05:32,803 --> 01:05:34,972
and try to prevent discouragement

1043
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:38,643
all the time.

1044
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:41,395
Don't do it.

1045
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:43,773
Young-woo.

1046
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,275
Young-woo.

1047
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:47,526
Young-woo!

1048
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:49,987
Young-woo!

1049

TITLE: HANBADA'S HIRING PRACTICES…

1053
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:45,918
EXPOSING HANBADA'S
CORRUPT HIRING PRACTICES

1054
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:05,021
If it weren't for the unreasonable
request of her father,

1055
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:08,149
would that rookie attorney
have been able to work at Hanbada?

1056
01:07:08,232 --> 01:07:09,984
You not being employed anywhere
with your grades

1057
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:10,985
is discrimination, dishonesty,
and corruption.

1058
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:13,320
It's only fair that you
joined the firm, albeit late!

1059
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:16,073
Are they properly reflecting the wishes
of all the Sodeok-dong residents?

1060
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:19,243
Get the written consent from the residents
by the next hearing date.

1061
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:21,537
I think I do like you.

1062
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:24,623
-I…
-Running away?

1063
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:28,586
-Is there something you would like to say?
-Do you not recognize me?

1064
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:33,799
