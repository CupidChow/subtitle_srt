MATH SUMMARY

4
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,440
Hey, can you take a look at this?

5
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,526
The answer should be this because…

6
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,864
This bus was supposed to
take you to the academy.

7
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,410
It was supposed to
take you to Mujin Academy,

8
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:02,956
which is short for "Mujin Unfortunately
is Just Insufferably Never-ending."

9
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,210
But I, the Commander-in-Chief
of the Children's Liberation Army,

10
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,920
have taken over this bus.

11
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:11,798
This is now a bus
that doesn't go to the academy.

12
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,384
Welcome aboard
the bus that doesn't go to the academy!

13
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,302
Who are you?

14
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,472
I am the Commander-in-Chief
of the Children's Liberation Army.

15
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,890
My name is Bang Gu-ppong.

16
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,226
Is your name
really Bang Gu-ppong, like "fart"?

17
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,562
So his name is basically Mr. Fart?

18
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,689
-His name is Mr. Fart?
-He must be lying.

19
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:30,733
-He must be lying.
-My name really is Bang Gu-ppong.

20
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:31,943
-What?
-Really?

21

00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,156
-Let me see.
-Why?

23
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,490
-I want to see it too.
-Look at this.

24
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,909
-Is it really?
-I want to see it too.

25
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,418
All of you who have boarded
the bus that doesn't go to the academy

26
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,005
are qualified to join
the Children's Liberation Army.

27
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,715
Children who do not want to join

28
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,801
or want to go to the academy
should get off this bus right now!

29
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:06,102
What's the Children's Liberation Army?

30
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,687
Right.

31
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,814
The Children's Liberation Army plays.

32
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:13,484
The Children's Liberation Army plays,
plays, and plays even more.

33
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,863
They play until it's a miracle
that they haven't died while playing.

34
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,156
They play so much

35
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,575
until their guts…

36
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:28,416
until their guts sob from all the fun.

37
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,919
Can I ask my mom?

38
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,003
No.

39
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,425
I'm leaving.

40
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,266
If you don't want to
become a part of the army,

41
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,935
get off this bus right now!

42
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,070
You can't tell your moms, okay?

43
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:02,033
Instead of going to the academy,
would your moms understand our goal

44
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:05,620
of playing, playing, and playing even more
to achieve children's liberation?

45
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:06,579
No.

46
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,872
-No.
-No.

47
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,291
Therefore,
the Children's Liberation Army proclaims!

48
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,169
First, children must play immediately.

49
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,506
Second, children
must be healthy immediately.

50
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,926
Third, children must be happy immediately.

51
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,595
I, the Commander-in-Chief Bang Gu-ppong,

52
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:27,558
will presently defeat the sly demands
of schools, academies, and parents,

53
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,395
and will immediately sing
for happy children!

54
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,688
Children.

55
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,108
Let's play!

56
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,325
-Who here knows how to drive?
-Me.

57
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,202
-I want to drive.
-Me!

58
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,370
-Me!
-Me!

59
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,997
-Put your seatbelts on.
-Me!

60
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,456
-Me!
-Seatbelts!

61
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:56,629
CASE 9
THE PIED PIPER

62
00:04:56,713 --> 00:05:00,466
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

63
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,345
Attorney Woo. Did you arrive at court?

64
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,388
Yes.

65
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,182
I don't think I'll be late to the
judgment of the arrest warrant,

66
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,977
but I'm worried that there won't be
enough time to interview the defendant.

67
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,687
I didn't get to look over
the case materials either.

68
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,815
That's understandable
since you just took on the case.

69
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:19,277
Jun-ho left with the case files,
so you'll be getting them soon.

70
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,653
Right. Okay.

71
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,164
Attorney Woo, here.

72
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,540
Hurry.

73
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,256
The defendant is a 26-year-old male

74
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,508
and he's been arrested
for the kidnapping of minors.

75
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,635
Two days ago,
he hijacked a Mujin Academy bus

76
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:48,514
and took 12 elementary school kids
onboard to a mountain nearby.

77
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,434
I heard the person who asked Hanbada
to take this case

78
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,644
is the director of Mujin Academy.

79
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,981
Yes, it is. The defendant
is the youngest son of the director.

80
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:01,444
In other words, he hijacked the bus
of his mother's academy.

81
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,572
What did he do
with the kids at the mountain?

82
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,491
They just played.

83
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,242
What?

84
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:12,413
Apparently, he did recreational activities
for about four hours with the kids.

85
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,207
And he was arrested after

86
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,834
the academy bus driver
reported it to the police.

87
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:23,466
Attorney Woo, there's…

88
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,467
Yes?

89
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,720
An eyelash…

90
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,442
Just a moment.

91
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,323
Just a moment.

92
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,307
Here.

93
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,435
Your eyelash…

94
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,354
It was hard to grab.
I just managed to take it off.

95
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,731
Right.

96
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,778
Well, I…

97
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,781
I will go meet the defendant then.

98
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,770
Who are you?

99
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,607
Hello.

100
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,151
I am Attorney Woo Young-woo
from Hanbada Law Firm.

101
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,611
Whether it's read straight or flipped,
it's still Woo Young-woo.

102
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,779
Kayak, deed, rotator,
noon, racecar, Woo Young-woo.

103
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,574
Today…

104
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,743
NAME: BANG GU-PPONG

105
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,164
I have been assigned
as Mr. Bang Gu-ppong's…

106
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,002
Mr. Bang Gu-ppong's defense for the case.

107
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,754
I don't need an attorney.

108
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,465
If I don't take on this case,

109
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,468
you will be appointed a public defender
under the jurisdiction of the court.

110
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:31,552
Is that what you want?

111
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,305
Can I be tried without an attorney?

112
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,934
No. We don't have much time,
so I'm just going to ask right away.

113
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,144
Is Bang Gu-ppong your real name?

114
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,395
Why do you ask?

115
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,397
Your name is strange.

116
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,942
I am concerned that
the judge might take it negatively.

117
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,443
When I say my name,

118
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,403
children laugh.

119
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:56,619
But a name like Woo Young-woo
wouldn't make any child laugh.

120
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,123
What was it that you said earlier? Kayak…

121
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,584
Kayak, deed, rotator,
noon, racecar, Woo Young-woo.

122
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,461
The flow is nice.

123
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,880
But it's weak. It's not funny.

124
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,632
Something like…

125
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,551
Woo, Woo, Woo

126
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:16,180
Woo-Woo-Woo, Woo,
Woo-Woo-Woo, Woodpecker's Booger

127
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,100
Woodpecker's Butthole

128
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,561
That's way funnier.

129
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,896
It should at least be something like that.

130
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,398
Excuse me?

131
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,818
Having a name that makes
children laugh and adults angry

132
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,153
and living up to it.

133
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,115
That is the revolution
I'm trying to start.

134
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,409
Nice to meet you.

135
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,119
Let's shake hands.

136
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,997
Shake hands.

137
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,006
Nice to meet you.

138
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,095
Defendant.

139
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,222
What is your name?

140
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,600
Bang Gu-ppong.

141
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,437
Is that your real name?

142
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,023
Did your parents name you that?

143
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,400
I legally changed my name two years ago.

144
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:13,863
Now Bang Gu-ppong is my real name.

145
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,365
What is your occupation?

146
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,076
The Commander-in-Chief
of the Children's Liberation Army.

147
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,244
Objection!

148
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,245
What?

149
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:25,416
What do you mean objection?
We're in the middle of an arraignment.

150
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,670
-Why are you being like this too?
-I apologize.

151
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:35,051
I misspoke because I was
so surprised by the defendant's reply.

152
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,218
Yes.

153
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,554
I'm quite surprised myself.

154
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,764
Your Honor.

155
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,432
I didn't have enough time

156
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,726
to interview the defendant
because I was just assigned this case.

157
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,563
Could I have a quick word with him
so that he can respond properly?

158
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,689
Hurry up then.

159
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:54,945
What do you mean

160
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,114
you're the Commander-in-Chief
of the Children's Liberation Army?

161
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,991
That's my job.

162
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,536
Responding like that
will get you detained.

163
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,872
We have to show
that you are in your right mind

164
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,416
and that you're not a flight risk
and wouldn't destroy evidence.

165
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,169
That is my job.

166
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:14,882
Yes, but the judge will write down
"unemployed" or "unknown" anyway.

167
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,759
Please do as I say.

168
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,888
Let me ask you again.

169
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:22,598
Defendant.

170
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,517
What is your occupation?

171
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:37,863
"Unemployed."

172
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,699
All right.

173
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,453
Or "unknown" shouldn't
be written down, Your Honor.

174
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:51,961
I'm the Commander-in-Chief
of the Children's Liberation Army.

175
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,427
That's my job.

176
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,560
So was my son…

177
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,104
detained?

178
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,605
Yes.

179
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:16,902
Your son is very set in his ways,
so it appears that concerned the court.

180
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,613
He said that his job
is the Commander-in-Chief

181
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,323
of the Children's Liberation Army.

182
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,869
What did he say to the question
regarding his current address again?

183
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:28,372
He said he lives in "children's hearts."

184
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:34,253
I know you were very worried
about your son not being able to adjust

185
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,589
to life at the detention center.

186
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:37,673
I apologize.

187
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,091
No.

188
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,886
It's my son's fault
for responding like that.

189
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,307
What happened to the students
he took to the mountain?

190
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,184
Do they still attend Mujin Academy?

191
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,311
All 12 of them quit.

192
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,730
And I also refunded their tuition.

193
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,857
Word travels fast in this neighborhood,

194
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,193
and they are very sensitive
about reputation,

195
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,613
so there were quite a lot of students
who followed suit.

196
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,115
Goodness, I'm sorry to hear that.

197
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,953
Did you meet with the parents
of the 12 students by any chance?

198
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:12,333
I met them once at the police station
and apologized to them.

199
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,794
After that, I had a lot going on as well.

200
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,631
Should I reach out to them?

201
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:19,798
Yes.

202
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:23,427
If you get a letter of non-punishment
from the parents,

203
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,055
it could help a lot
in reducing your son's sentence.

204
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:29,099
Of course, the parents
might request settlement money.

205
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,976
I expected as much.

206
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,480
Then I'll prepare the settlement money

207
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,524
and try to get
the letter of non-punishment.

208
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,984
All right.
We'll prepare well for the trial.

209
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,949
It hasn't been easy at all

210
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,160
raising my three boys

211
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,955
after their father passed away early.

212
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,165
Still,

213
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:57,044
I am a mom who sent all three sons
to Seoul National University.

214
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:01,757
And I started Mujin Academy
based on my personal experience.

215
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,094
What's the point
of only my kids succeeding?

216
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,179
Other kids should also succeed with them.

217
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,515
But it seems as though

218
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,978
I was too busy
taking care of other people's kids

219
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:18,649
that I didn't realize my son
had headed down the wrong path.

220
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,322
Attorney Jung.

221
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,409
I can pay however much you want
in commission fees.

222
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,328
We couldn't stop him from being sent
to the detention center,

223
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:35,708
but my son shouldn't be sent to prison.

224
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,588
Please help.

225
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,048
Of course.

226
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:53,225
Here is the Woo Young-woo
seaweed-sushi you ordered.

227
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,768
I didn't order a beer.

228
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,896
-That's for me.
-Right.

229
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,193
Well…

230
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,279
So listen.

231
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,492
If someone said they like someone
and that person doesn't say anything back,

232
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,870
that means they're just
not going to answer, right?

233
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,456
Someone said they like someone? Who?

234
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,583
-Me.
-To Lee Jun-ho?

235
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,542
Yes.

236
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,835
Unbelievable!

237
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,879
Look at you, Woo to the Young to the Woo.

238
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,173
They always say it's the quiet ones.

239
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,591
Hairy, did you hear?

240
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:30,262
Gosh, even Young-woo's out there
expressing her feelings to a guy

241
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:34,266
while I'm back here doing the dishes.

242
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,102
What are you saying? I'm the one
who did all the dishes today too.

243
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,524
By the way,
you're not at all how you seem.

244
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,692
You're very brave.

245
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:46,987
What exactly did you say?

246
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,989
You didn't say
anything weird again, right?

247
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:51,909
That day,

248
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,870
my heart rate was really high.

249
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,957
Even though I didn't touch you at all,

250
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,250
my heart was beating very fast.

251
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,210
What the…

252
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,671
Are you shooting
some kind of medical drama?

253
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:07,633
Why did you go tell him
all that heart rate stuff we talked about?

254
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,426
So…

255
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,595
I think

256
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,806
I do like you.

257
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,225
What's wrong with that?

258
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,103
At least her feelings were
well conveyed. Right?

259
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,981
"My heart beats fast when I see you."

260
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,065
"I like you."

261
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,441
They all mean the same thing.

262
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,776
What did Jun-ho say?

263
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,028
Attorney Woo,

264
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,199
I…

265
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,617
Running…

266
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,954
away?

267
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,416
"Attorney Woo, I…"

268
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,625
And then what?

269
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:46,463
And then, we had to run after
Mr. Park Yu-jin who was running away,

270
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,173
so we didn't get to finish talking.

271
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,467
And he hasn't said anything after that.

272
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,845
Nothing so far? Why?

273
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:53,887
Well…

274
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,223
I'm not sure.

275
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,225
Perhaps because he doesn't like me?

276
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,310
I don't think so.

277
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:04,189
From what I saw before,
he seemed to like you a lot.

278
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:08,819
Jun-ho is still kind and warmhearted.

279
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,239
He smiles when he sees me
and removes the eyelash on my face.

280
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,366
What? Eyelashes?

281
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,035
Eyelashes!

282
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,370
That means he really likes you!
Doesn't it?

283
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,206
How can you touch someone's lashes
if you don't have any feelings for them?

284
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,584
You can pick off eyelashes on someone
without liking them.

285
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,793
It doesn't mean much.

286
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,838
After all, it could blind the person
if it gets in their eyes the wrong way.

287
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,633
Should I ask him again about how he feels?

288
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,094
-No. Are you crazy?
-I don't think you should either.

289
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,057
What if you be nice to him too?

290
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,519
Be really nice to him without saying
anything so he can also be confused.

291
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,065
Be nice to him so that he gets confused?

292
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,192
How do I do that?

293
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:52,154
If you want to date someone,
what do you do to be nice, Hairy?

294
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,489
Well…

295
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,325
I pull out their seat for them,

296
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,786
open the car door for them,

297
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:03,499
make sure they walk
on the inside of the sidewalk,

298
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,666
and carry their things for them.

299
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,349
Did you get beaten up
in the detention center?

300
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,685
Or did you get into a fight?

301
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,562
It's the milky way.

302
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,066
All right.

303
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:30,651
Well…

304
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,319
Mr. Bang Gu-ppong.

305
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:36,031
It's true that you kidnapped minors,

306
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,866
but you didn't particularly harass them.

307
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,993
You can get a reduced sentence.

308
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:44,039
But in order for that to happen,
you must acknowledge your wrongdoings.

309
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,542
The phrase, "minor,"
doesn't sit well with me.

310
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,794
-Excuse me?
-Minor…

311
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,505
Right.

312
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:55,467
What did you do after you took
the victims to the mountain?

313
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,344
The term, "victims," is also a bit…

314
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,055
How about this?

315
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,599
Since they all joined
the Children's Liberation Army,

316
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,060
we'll call them
the Children's Liberation Army.

317
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,728
Well…

318
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,855
No.

319
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,690
I'll call them children.

320
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,944
What did you do with the children
after you kidnapped them to the mountain?

321
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,115
We had an enlistment ceremony.

322
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,398
The enemies of the children of Korea

323
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:54,443
are schools, academies, and parents.

324
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,821
They don't let children play.

325
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,449
They are afraid of happy children

326
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,869
and healthy children.

327
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,997
They want anxious children,

328
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,124
suffering children,

329
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,710
and obedient children.

330
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,923
They manipulate the law
and institutions of Korea

331
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,175
to make children busier and worse

332
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:22,763
so they turn their backs on the world
even before they become adults.

333
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,306
-I agree!
-Right.

334
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,390
You agree?

335
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,558
What's your name?

336
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,809
Lee Se-won!

337
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,311
Did you just approve of me?

338
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,771
-Approved!
-Okay!

339
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,606
The Children's Liberation Army proclaims!

340
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,318
First, children must play immediately.

341
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,200
Hey, you have to do it with me,
it's embarrassing.

342
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,744
-All right.
-Okay.

343
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,496
Repeat after me. First.

344
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,289
-"First."
-"First."

345
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,375
Children must play immediately!

346
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:55,045
-"Children must play immediately!"
-"Children must play immediately!"

347
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,213
Second!

348
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,422
-"Second!"
-"Second!"

349
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,175
Children must be healthy immediately!

350
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,887
-"Children must be healthy immediately!"
-"Children must be healthy immediately!"

351
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,847
-Third!
-"Third!"

352
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,392
Children must be happy immediately.

353
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:14,064
-"Children must be happy immediately!"
-"Children must be happy immediately!"

354
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,358
I, the Commander-in-Chief Bang Gu-ppong,

355
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:20,195
will presently defeat
the sly demands of schools,

356
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,365
academies, and parents,

357
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:27,035
and will immediately sing
for happy children.

358
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,538
When I say "Kids,"

359
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,999
you say "Let's play," okay?

360
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,083
-Okay.
-Okay.

361
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,043
Kids!

362
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:41,717
-Let's play!
-Let's play!

363
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,885
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

364
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,105
-Freeze
-Freeze.

365
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,399
-Red light, green light.
-Come on.

366
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,900
Red light, green light.

367
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,944
I'll peel it for you.

368
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,447
-Hold it here. It's hot.
-It's hot.

369
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,240
It's hot.

370
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,826
It's hot!

371
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,369
It's hot!

372
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:54,456
Who doesn't like milk?
Yes, I don't like milk either.

373
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,666
I don't like it,
but I don't dislike it either.

374
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,251
Hey, what are you doing?

375
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:59,920
You gave it to me first.

376
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:06,134
I guess you didn't do
anything incredibly original.

377
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,888
The thought that playing
has to be original

378
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:13,600
is what creates gimmicky children's
camp field trips without the field part.

379
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:16,686
Taking the children here and there,
making them do this and that

380
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,481
so that they can experience something
novel and educational.

381
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,941
That's not playing.

382
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,077
Even if all they're doing
is looking up at the sky

383
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,122
and snickering at the clouds floating by,

384
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:39,376
as long as the child is smiling
and is happy in that moment,

385
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,336
that's what playing really is.

386
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:52,222
You seem to have your own philosophy
on children playing.

387
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,890
But I'm not sure

388
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,852
if that will be of help
in getting your sentence reduced.

389
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:00,814
A reduced sentence
is what my mother wants, not what I want.

390
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,694
What I want is…

391
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,617
Come closer.

392
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,204
Children's liberation.

393
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,664
Gosh.

394
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,834
What's wrong with this guy?

395
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,676
Once, Mr. Bang Gu-ppong said,

396
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,261
my name should at least be
Woodpecker's Booger

397
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:34,556
or Woodpecker's Butthole
to make children laugh.

398
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,600
One day, if I find myself
defending a child,

399
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,351
I should change my name temporarily.

400
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,313
You're talking an awful lot
about Mr. Bang today.

401
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,231
But not one word about whales.

402
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,774
It's not like you.

403
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,484
Well…

404
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:49,362
Mr. Bang seems like
an even stranger person than I am, so…

405
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,531
So?

406
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,450
It's nice when I'm with him.

407
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,873
It must be nice for Mr. Bang.

408
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:04,044
This is the first time I've ever seen you
smile like that talking about someone.

409
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,806
Please sit here.

410
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,476
What? Why…

411
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,979
Isn't it hard to pull the chair out
when you have the tray in your hands?

412
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,356
Sit here.

413
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,943
Right, okay.

414
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,152
Thank you.

415
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,669
Right! Do you like pickled radish?

416
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,545
Do you want some of mine?

417
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,047
No, that's okay.

418
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,007
I have enough.

419
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,720
All right, then enjoy your meal.

420
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:13,571
My whole body felt groggy
after drinking misugaru.

421
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,116
And when I came to,

422
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:19,369
the bus was parked
at the foot of the mountain.

423
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:23,707
I was so startled that I checked my phone
and saw that four hours had passed.

424
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:27,335
So did you call the police
as soon as you woke up?

425
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,253
Yes.

426
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:33,216
The police arrived
and I was explaining the situation when…

427
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,552
Children must play immediately!

428
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:40,307
-"Children must play immediately!"
-That guy was coming down the mountain

429
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,476
with all the kids behind him
like some sort of pied piper.

430
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,104
And that's when the police
made the arrest.

431
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,607
When the defendant
handed you the misugaru,

432
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:53,236
were you aware that he was the son
of the director of Mujin Academy?

433
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,237
Yes.

434
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:58,742
He came to the academy
a few times before too.

435
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,453
Now that I think about it,

436
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:04,247
it might have been to find out information

437
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,875
regarding the academy bus schedule.

438
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,877
Objection, calls for speculation.

439
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,253
Sustained.

440
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:13,256
Witness, do not speculate,
and only state the facts.

441
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,632
All right.

442
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,927
Anyway, the people at the academy

443
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:21,473
told me he was
the director's youngest son,

444
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,516
so I knew who he was.

445
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:28,229
That's why you drank the misugaru
that was handed to you by the defendant

446
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,773
without any suspicion, correct?

447
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,149
Of course!

448
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:35,570
Who would have thought
that the director's son

449
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,198
would put something in the misugaru?

450
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:39,866
Objection!

451
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,243
It is also speculative of the witness
that the defendant did that.

452
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,745
It's not a proven fact.

453
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:45,830
No, there's no objection.

454
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,082
-What?
-What?

455
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,877
Defendant, what did you say?

456
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,338
Attorney Woo might have an objection,

457
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:54,881
but I don't.

458
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:59,636
Defendant, you do realize
that the attorney is on your side, right?

459
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:04,516
About the objection
that was brought up earlier.

460
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,185
I have no objections
regarding that either.

461
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:10,772
-Your Honor?
-What the driver said is all true.

462
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:14,067
And I did visit Mujin Academy
to find out the academy bus schedule.

463
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:18,113
And I did spike the misugaru
with sleeping pills and gave it to him.

464
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,994
I put you in an awkward situation,
didn't I?

465
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,205
I apologize.

466
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,790
But there was no other choice

467
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:32,710
for the liberation of children.
I ask for your generous understanding.

468
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,255
Well, I don't…

469
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:36,840
All right.

470
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,676
Record everything the defendant said,
word for word.

471
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,232
Yes.

472
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,025
Yes, all right.

473
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,196
Was that the director of Mujin Academy?

474
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,117
Yes. Apparently, she couldn't get
a single letter of non-punishment.

475
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,786
Not a single one out of the 12 children?

476
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:10,290
Yes. It's not certain yet,
but according to the director,

477
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:12,792
the parents of the victimized children
are planning

478
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,711
to file a class-action lawsuit
against Mujin Academy.

479
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,713
That's not good.

480
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,673
Well…

481
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,509
What if I meet with the children?

482
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,554
What?

483
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,723
What Mr. Bang did

484
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:30,226
may be upsetting enough for the parents
to think of filing a lawsuit,

485
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:34,397
but it could be a fun and exciting memory
for the children.

486
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:37,150
If they find out that Mr. Bang
is going to be punished,

487
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,360
the children might persuade their parents.

488
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:43,114
We'll be in trouble if the parents
find out about that.

489
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,950
They must already be sensitive
about their kids' safety.

490
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,994
What if I don't approach them hastily,

491
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,332
but instead approach them naturally
as if I ran into them while walking?

492
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:57,253
Will approaching them naturally
as if you ran into them while walking

493
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,297
even be possible? Considering it's you.

494
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,382
-Sorry?
-What?

495
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,467
What?

496
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,930
You should go with Attorney Woo.

497
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:08,848
Right.

498
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,683
Sure.

499
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,644
Okay then. You two go together.

500
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,146
Don't try too hard to persuade them,

501
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,817
and just find out
what the kids think about the case.

502
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,569
Okay.

503
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,949
The kids usually all do the same thing
after academies let out,

504
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:27,826
so let's go to where the academies are.

505
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,246
-Let's take a cab.
-Okay.

506
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,174
What's going on?

507
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,343
Walk on the inside.

508
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,971
Hypothetically, if a car drove
onto the sidewalk,

509
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,597
being on the inside is safer.

510
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,015
Right.

511
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,268
Hypothetically, in that case,

512
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,770
wouldn't it be better
if I walk on the outside?

513
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:59,983
I think I'd be able to avoid it
a bit faster than you.

514
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,839
Gosh.

515
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:23,923
Get in.

516
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,133
Well…

517
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:26,885
My goodness.

518
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:32,140
Yes, thank you.

519
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:51,951
Attorney Woo.

520
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,796
Are you Kim Min-ji?

521
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,926
You're a third-grader
at Hanti Elementary School, right?

522
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:12,221
-Well…
-Do you know Mr. Bang Gu-ppong?

523
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:14,682
I do.

524
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,477
We're friends of his.

525
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,270
I see.

526
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:23,858
Are you eating dinner now?
It's already past 9 p.m.

527
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,818
I'm eating early today.

528
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:29,155
When I went to Mujin Academy
I couldn't eat anything until 10 p.m.

529
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,868
All the classes at Mujin Academy
are locked classes.

530
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,621
Locked classes? What are those?

531
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:37,914
Well…

532
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:41,167
No one is allowed to go outside
until the academy is over for the day.

533
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,044
There's no break time at all,

534
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,754
so we can't even go
to the convenience store.

535
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,465
And we need to get permission
to go to the bathroom.

536
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:51,469
That sounds like prison, not an academy.

537
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:55,264
We want to ask you something
regarding Mr. Bang.

538
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,683
Do you have time?

539
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,812
Oh, no. I'm doomed.

540
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,564
I'm late. I have to go to the study cafe.

541
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,650
The study cafe? At this hour?

542
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:08,486
I can't fall behind
while I look for a new academy to go to

543
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:09,904
since I quit Mujin Academy.

544
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,949
My mom said I should go to the study cafe
in the meantime.

545
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:17,203
By the way,
did Mr. Bang Gu-ppong go to jail?

546
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:21,457
He's in the detention center,
but not in prison yet.

547
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,167
I see.

548
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,130
I still have this with me.

549
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:31,342
I picked it up
when we went to the mountain.

550
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:35,054
I threw away everything else except this.

551
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,772
There's a convenience store
across the street.

552
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,816
There are a lot of kids there.

553
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:49,527
I'm sure some of the kids who went
to the mountain that day are there too.

554
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,987
Ask them.

555
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,201
Welcome.

556
00:33:58,745 --> 00:33:59,746
Hello.

557
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,956
Excuse me.

558
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,626
Do the students who go to academies nearby

559
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,712
come by after 10 p.m.?

560
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:08,671
Sorry?

561
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:12,884
Well, yes. That's when the academies end.

562
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,678
-I see.
-They should be swarming in anytime now.

563
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,764
It's a whole battle when they do.
A battle over dinner.

564
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:21,017
So the students don't have dinner
until after 10 p.m.?

565
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,477
It seems like it.

566
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,353
You would think that

567
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:28,441
these kids from filthy rich families
would eat something special,

568
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,777
but that's not the case at all.

569
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:35,198
They eat noodles, triangular gimbap,
sausages, and other things like that.

570
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,784
Sweet, savory, spicy instant foods.

571
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,410
There they come.

572
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,080
Be careful.

573
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,208
Be careful.

574
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,853
-Are you paying for everything?
-Yes.

575
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:06,771
All right.

576
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,691
Do you know what these kids look at
when they choose drinks?

577
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,568
The amount of caffeine.

578
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,445
The higher, the better.

579
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,491
There's this coffee-flavored milk
with a lot of caffeine.

580
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,245
Even elementary school kids
drink it like it's water.

581
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,247
It's a little hard to watch.

582
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:28,417
If they're drinking them now,
how will they get through high school?

583
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,545
Don't forget your card.

584
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:38,594
There are noticeably short kids
who always look tired.

585
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:43,307
They're always the kids who are preparing
to attend science or gifted high schools.

586
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,976
It's partly what they eat,

587
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:48,771
but their lack of sleep makes them small.

588
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:50,773
Do you see them?

589
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,359
Just like them.

590
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,197
What? An acorn!

591
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,199
-An acorn.
-What?

592
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,077
It's okay.

593
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,288
Gosh, stop crying.

594
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,874
I said stop crying.

595
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:08,916
Why are you crying?

596
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,795
Do you know Mr. Bang Gu-ppong?

597
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,799
We're friends of Mr. Bang Gu-ppong.

598
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,259
I know Bang Gu-ppong.

599
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,761
-Me too.
-Right.

600
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:24,891
I made this with the acorn I picked up
when we went to the mountain.

601
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,435
And he made this.

602
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,730
That's so cool. You did a great job.

603
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,732
Why were you crying?

604
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,984
Because he got an "undecided" today.

605
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,110
"Undecided"?

606
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,404
What's that?

607
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:41,782
If you're not done with the mission
by ten, you get an "undecided."

608
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,868
What kind of mission?

609
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:46,412
A mission to solve math problems.

610
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:51,209
We started at three,
but I'm the only one who couldn't finish.

611
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,377
It's too hard.

612
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:58,007
It's an elementary student's mission
to solve math problems from three to ten?

613
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,800
That's my mom's car.

614
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,594
I'm going to go now. Bye.

615
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,846
Wait.

616
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,058
Do you want
Mr. Bang Gu-ppong to go to jail?

617
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,268
No.

618
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,312
No.

619
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:15,524
Then do you want to play with him again?

620
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,197
Hey, let's go.

621
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,200
What are you doing?

622
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,369
Hey, Lee Se-won!

623
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,846
Children who are only 10 and 11 years old
are stuck inside schools and academies

624
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,767
studying for 12 hours every day,
not being able to properly eat or sleep.

625
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,519
They're like dolphins

626
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,480
that are trapped inside small tanks,
doing shows and eating only frozen fish.

627
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:59,860
Orcas that live in tanks have dorsal fins
that bend to the side like this.

628
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,737
It's because they should be
swimming around in the open sea,

629
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,656
but, instead, are trapped
in narrow spaces and are abused--

630
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,700
That's very…

631
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,576
unfortunate.

632
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,662
What is it that you're trying to say?

633
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:13,207
What if we claim that Mr. Bang
had rescued the kids

634
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,835
who were being abused
and was taking emergency measures?

635
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,044
Abused?

636
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:21,007
So you're saying that sending kids
to school and academies is abuse?

637
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:24,176
Then he should've reported it
to the police instead of kidnapping them.

638
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,429
Above all,

639
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:30,308
the motive or purpose doesn't matter
in the kidnapping of minors.

640
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,185
It's a crime, no matter
how good the intentions are.

641
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:37,315
Then what if we claim that this is a case
where he had the children's consent?

642
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,943
At the time of the incident,
the door of the academy bus was wide open,

643
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:45,573
and Mr. Bang told them twice to leave
if they didn't want to go with him.

644
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,617
The consent of minors is not enough.

645
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,037
He should've gotten the consent
of their legal guardians as well.

646
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:56,667
Attorney Woo,
I do feel bad for the defendant.

647
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,670
He just took the kids to play
and they've detained him for it.

648
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,297
It does feel unnecessarily harsh.

649
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,884
But the more we feel like that,
the more focused we need to be.

650
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,720
Are you going to be swept up
by the defendant's strange logic

651
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,347
and keep saying odd things?

652
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,559
Attorney Jung.

653
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,342
What…

654
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,718
Why…

655
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,096
Are you going somewhere?

656
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,890
Where are you going?

657
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,267
To a blind date.

658
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,435
Blind date?

659
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,312
What about Jun-ho?

660
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,733
You're still on about Jun-ho?

661
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,194
Gosh, you and your rotten instincts.

662
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,614
I'm going to live aggressively
from now on.

663
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:10,491
If you know someone nice,
introduce me to him.

664
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:11,951
Because I'm going to win him over.

665
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,454
You're going to aggressively
win someone over?

666
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:19,583
I'm sure even you, Attorney Kwon,
must know at least one good guy.

667
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,085
Can't you think of anyone?

668
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:24,088
"Even you, Attorney Kwon"?

669
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,465
I can think of someone.

670
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,886
He knows a lot about being nice.

671
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,638
He pulls out seats, opens car doors,

672
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,598
makes the person walk on the inside
of the street when walking together,

673
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:35,891
and carries their things.

674
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,017
Really?

675
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:40,813
Yes, and he makes good seaweed-sushi.
I will introduce you to him next time.

676
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,782
We're lucky that the police arrested him
when they did.

677
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,451
What if they didn't come on time?

678
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:57,079
Something terrible could've happened.

679
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,289
Rapist!

680
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:01,167
He could have turned into a rapist!

681
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:06,005
We fully understand
your anger and concerns.

682
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,256
But…

683
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,176
a lawsuit requires
a lot of time and energy.

684
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:13,345
And it doesn't guarantee that the result
will come out in your favor.

685
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,682
What if you tell us what you want,

686
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:19,727
without having to go
through the trouble of a lawsuit?

687
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:25,483
Director Choi Seong-suk is ready
to give you her sincerest apologies.

688
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,861
What's the point of
only the director apologizing?

689
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:32,114
That Bang Gu-ppong or whatever
is nothing but confident.

690
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,700
Did you hear what he said
at the police station?

691
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:38,204
He treated us like shameless parents,
who disregard their kids' happiness

692
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:41,290
and are only bent on
sending them to college.

693
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,917
I was angry about that too.

694
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,544
Do we make them suffer because we want to?

695
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,546
We do it for their future.

696
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,216
What will become of their lives
if you let them play as much as they want

697
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:53,719
at a time when they should be
developing study habits?

698
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,513
-That would be a problem.
-She's right.

699
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:59,517
-We're helping them study.
-We put in so much effort.

700
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,062
-It's not easy.
-People will never understand.

701
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,825
-What is she doing?
-What are you doing?

702
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,412
My son

703
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:23,249
is mentally unwell and lacking.

704
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,335
He probably doesn't even know
what he's saying.

705
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,339
We're all moms raising children.

706
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:36,136
Please, just this once, forgive my son
with the generous heart of a mother.

707
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,848
I will make sure
nothing like this happens again.

708
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:43,602
Director, aren't you the one who said
you're a mother of successful sons?

709
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:47,940
You promoted your academy
saying you sent all of them to SNU.

710
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:51,527
-Yet now your kid is unwell and lacking?
-I was arrogant.

711
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,654
It's my fault.

712
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,865
I will apologize
if an apology is what you want,

713
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,577
and give you settlement money
if that's what you want.

714
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:01,954
My son

715
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,456
is too fragile

716
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,459
to handle life in prison.

717
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:10,296
I'm pleading with you

718
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,801
because if he gets sent off to jail,

719
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,887
he might do the unthinkable.

720
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,017
I beg you.

721
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,563
I beg you.

722
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,150
I beg you.

723
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,997
I checked all 11 of them.

724
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,582
Each one was signed and sealed.

725
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:53,922
This is all thanks
to your heartfelt plea, Director.

726
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,049
Thank you.

727
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,594
Thank you all as well.

728
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:01,388
We'll be on our way then.

729
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,182
Okay.

730
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:06,268
I'm going to sit here for a little longer.

731
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:24,828
Director Choi.

732
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,205
Yes?

733
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:30,668
What you said about Mr. Bang Gu-ppong
being mentally unwell and lacking,

734
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,963
and how he probably doesn't even know
what he's saying.

735
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:40,511
As his attorney, that is not what I think.

736
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:43,180
Then

737
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,225
do you think he's normal?

738
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,895
You've only met him a couple of times

739
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:51,563
so you're seeing him in a positive light.

740
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:54,692
I see him in a positive light
when I've only met him a couple of times,

741
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:57,861
but as his mother,
shouldn't you do so even more?

742
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:01,073
Shouldn't you listen to him

743
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:05,202
at least once with an open heart?

744
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:12,501
The children laugh at just the name
"Bang Gu-ppong."

745
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:16,630
They understand
the meaning of liberation of children

746
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,674
that Mr. Bang is claiming.

747
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:22,511
The only people who do not
understand Mr. Bang…

748
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:25,431
are adults.

749
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:32,271
Then do you want to play with him again?

750
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:33,647
Hey, Lee Se-won!

751
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:38,777
I want to play all day, every day.
I want to be liberated.

752
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,962
Witness, how would you diagnose
the defendant?

753
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,757
The defendant suffers
from a delusional disorder.

754
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:04,136
Megalomania, to be more specific.

755
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,181
So then, is the defendant's claim

756
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:10,350
that he is the Commander-in-Chief
of the Children's Liberation Army

757
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,644
a symptom of megalomania as well?

758
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,188
Yes, that is right.

759
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:17,441
Patients who suffer from megalomania

760
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:22,279
believe they hold an important position
in an institution or an organization…

761
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,095
That is all.

762
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:31,890
Wait…

763
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,353
I would like to ask further questions.

764
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,441
Attorney Woo.

765
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,990
Mujin Academy,
where the 12 students used to attend,

766
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,534
is famous for running locked classes.

767
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:52,536
Do you know what the locked classes are?

768
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:53,745
Locked classes?

769
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:55,706
No, I don't.

770
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:56,999
Locked classes mean

771
00:47:57,082 --> 00:48:00,168
that students are kept there all day long
and are forced to study.

772
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:03,505
The children who attend Mujin Academy
are not allowed to go outside

773
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,007
until 10 p.m.

774
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:08,760
They are not given any time
to take breaks or eat.

775
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:10,846
They even have to ask for permission
to go to the bathroom.

776
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:14,516
And children who go to the bathroom
more than two times a day are sent home,

777
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,184
saying they don't have
the right mindset to study.

778
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:17,561
JURY

779
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:22,691
Mujin Academy is known for getting
parental consent forms saying that

780
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:25,277
children who do not do their homework
can be punished,

781
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:29,114
but the popularity
of Mujin Academy among parents

782
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:30,949
is at an all-time high.

783
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,748
Despite this fact,
do you still believe that

784
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:40,959
the defendant's interpretation of reality
and beliefs are distorted enough

785
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:42,919
to be seen as a patient
with a delusional disorder?

786
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,049
-Attorney Woo, what are you doing?
-Attorney Jung.

787
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:49,926
Can't we let her go on a bit more?

788
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:53,472
Wait…

789
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:55,974
Look at my son's face.

790
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:57,684
Excuse me?

791
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:02,939
What does he want to say
that would make his face look like that?

792
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:06,777
Children who are only 10 and 11 years old
cannot properly eat, sleep, rest, or play

793
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,279
because they have to study
for 12 hours every day.

794
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:12,074
And yet, you're saying the enemies
of the children of Korea

795
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:14,034
aren't schools, academies, and parents?

796
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,082
Counselor.

797
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:22,751
The defense requested the witness.

798
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:27,130
Why are you trying to get
a testimony that would be disadvantageous?

799
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:30,300
I'm not trying to get a disadvantageous
testimony for the defendant--

800
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,260
What is it that you're trying to prove?

801
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:36,223
Is what you want to hear that
the defendant's interpretation

802
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:40,686
of reality and beliefs has no issue,
so he doesn't have a delusional disorder?

803
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:43,480
Yes, that is right.

804
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:46,942
You do realize that could be
a disadvantageous testimony

805
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:48,276
for the defendant, right?

806
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:50,195
Your Honor,

807
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:55,367
the defendant is a person
who committed a crime

808
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:59,037
by seeking reformation with a belief
that's against the existing social system.

809
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,415
In other words,
he is a political offender.

810
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:05,877
He is not a heinous criminal
who should deserve moral criticism.

811
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:08,839
If he is diagnosed as a patient
with a delusional disorder,

812
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:11,717
it might help in getting
his sentence reduced.

813
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,052
But it would insult
the defendant's ideology

814
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,054
of the liberation of children.

815
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:20,058
As the defendant's attorney,

816
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,477
I am trying to defend

817
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:25,063
the defendant's ideology itself.

818
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:29,401
This trial is being held
to inquire about the defendant's crimes,

819
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:32,362
not to spread the defendant's ideology.

820
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:37,534
Regardless of what you wish, Counselor,
the question I want to ask

821
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:40,912
and should ask as the judge is clear.

822
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:42,914
Defendant,

823
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:46,585
do you feel remorse for your actions?

824
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:53,717
Your Honor.

825
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,928
I would like to remind the defendant
of his right to refuse to testify--

826
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:57,888
No.

827
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,558
I do not feel remorse.

828
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:08,482
Then are you going to commit
similar crimes to this?

829
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:20,202
Yes.

830
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,346
Attorney Jung.

831
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,807
Are you going to
let it slide with Attorney Woo?

832
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:45,101
Didn't she ruin the trial
with her outburst?

833
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:48,104
I'll have to talk to her
and give her a warning.

834
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:50,941
You're only going to give her
a warning again and no penalty?

835
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,528
It's not like she made a trivial mistake.

836
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,905
She made a mistake that could overturn
the outcome of the trial.

837
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:59,658
Didn't we have this conversation before?

838
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:03,954
You said Attorney Woo deserved a penalty
for her unauthorized absences, right?

839
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:07,833
Attorney Kwon,
you must really like penalties.

840
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:11,211
Is that why you wrote
that kind of post on the bulletin board?

841
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:18,760
I mean,

842
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,555
if you have conflicting opinions
while working,

843
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:24,099
you need to talk it out
with each other and resolve it.

844
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,811
Giving rewards or punishments over
who's right and who's wrong

845
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:30,397
is not how I work.

846
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:03,013
There was a difference in opinion

847
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:05,307
between the attorneys
about the defense strategy.

848
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:09,019
I apologize for not being able
to coordinate this before the trial.

849
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,938
I apologize.

850
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,315
Thank you.

851
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,401
Thank you, Attorney Woo.

852
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,821
What did my mother say?

853
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:22,198
Thankfully, your mother understood.

854
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:23,283
Right.

855
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:25,327
Really?

856
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:27,495
Yes.

857
00:53:31,207 --> 00:53:34,711
Getting the letter of non-punishment
is advantageous to reduce your sentence.

858
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,630
But your testimony
that you don't feel remorse

859
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,590
is a factor for additional punishment.

860
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:41,384
And I don't think the judge
will consider the circumstances.

861
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:43,261
In this regard…

862
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:47,223
probation could be a long shot.

863
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:48,725
It doesn't matter.

864
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:54,606
But could I ask you both for a favor?

865
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:56,858
A favor?

866
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:58,735
On the day of my final testimony,

867
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:01,655
please invite the Children's
Liberation Army to the trial.

868
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:04,950
Excuse me?

869
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:14,584
I wanted to give them a happy memory
by letting them play as much as they want,

870
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,963
but I'm afraid
that they'll remember it as,

871
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:20,715
"So the price of playing as much as I want

872
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:24,052
is a prison sentence."

873
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:30,684
As the Commander-in-Chief
of the Children's Liberation Army,

874
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:35,271
even if I get punished, I want them
to see me getting punished with dignity.

875
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:42,404
I want them to see that I never felt
ashamed of what I did.

876
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:56,084
This is out of the blue,
but I studied well in school.

877
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:57,544
What?

878
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:01,631
I graduated from SNU
and passed the bar before graduating.

879
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:03,675
I see.

880
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:07,012
Where did you graduate from, Attorney Woo?

881
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:08,680
What?

882
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:13,059
Right. I also graduated
from Seoul National University.

883
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:13,977
And?

884
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:15,687
And?

885
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:17,564
And…

886
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:22,068
I also graduated
from Seoul National University Law School.

887
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,946
Right, she graduated
summa cum laude from both.

888
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:33,997
Looking back, I think dreaming of becoming
an attorney at an early age

889
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,625
was the secret to my good grades.

890
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,461
Isn't that right, Attorney Woo?

891
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:42,881
Yes.

892
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:44,758
I think that was it for me too.

893
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,301
Is that so?

894
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:49,429
If Min-ji attends this trial,

895
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:53,641
it would help a lot with improving
her grades and motivating her.

896
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:57,520
It's not every day that she gets to see
the judge, prosecutor, and attorneys

897
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,022
work right in front of her.

898
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:02,067
That's right. By attending this trial,

899
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,986
Min-ji will naturally want to go
to Seoul National University.

900
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:05,904
Yes.

901
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:08,198
And don't worry about the kids' safety.

902
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:09,908
The other attorneys and I

903
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:12,452
will personally chaperone them
and take them to court.

904
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:13,578
Goodness.

905
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:14,954
You will?

906
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:16,581
Gosh.

907
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:19,793
I thought my daughter was leaning more
towards the sciences.

908
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,921
Gosh, what if she suddenly says
she wants to go to law school?

909
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:31,221
-Gosh, what am I going to do?
-Right.

910
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:46,778
Attorney Woo.

911
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:50,240
The Director of Mujin Academy
said she'll lend us the academy bus.

912
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:52,784
I think we can use the bus
to take the kids to court.

913
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:54,494
Okay.

914
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,249
Wait.

915
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:00,500
I'll carry it.

916
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:04,212
-What?
-Where to?

917
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:16,975
Attorney Woo.

918
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:19,227
Why are you doing this to me?

919
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:20,854
What?

920
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,063
You're being…

921
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:25,024
nice to me.

922
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:29,487
Pulling out my chair, making me
walk on the inside of the street,

923
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:32,657
opening the car door,
and now carrying my things.

924
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:35,952
What's going on?

925
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:38,121
Did I do something wrong?

926
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:41,583
No, it's nothing like that.

927
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:44,043
I just…

928
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,758
like you.

929
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,306
I was being nice to you
because I like you.

930
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,236
REORGANIZATION CLAIM, REORGANIZED
SECURED CLAIM, INVESTIGATIVE CASE

931
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,740
-Tomorrow, suddenly.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

932
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:15,366
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Take this.

933
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,827
-It got cut off.
-Really?

934
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,871
She continued it after it got cut off.

935
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:20,955
Hey, everyone.

936
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:22,582
We're going to get going, okay?

937
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,709
-Okay!
-Okay!

938
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:26,002
Mister.

939
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:29,088
What's your name?

940
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,925
Do you also
have a weird name like Mr. Fart?

941
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,886
No, I don't.

942
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:37,972
My name is…

943
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:40,099
Lee Butthole.

944
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:46,231
Is it really Lee Butthole?

945
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:48,858
Yes, because we're friends of Mr. Fart.

946
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,110
This is Lee Butthole,

947
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:56,658
and I am Woo, Woo,
Woo-Woo-Woo, Woodpecker's Booger.

948
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:01,412
What about you guys?

949
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:02,455
What are your names?

950
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:05,667
-Well…
-Well, we're just…

951
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:10,171
Attorneys.

952
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:12,423
-Jeez.
-Gosh.

953
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:13,508
I'm…

954
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,886
Kwon Poop.

955
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,058
What kind of name is that?

956
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,978
I'm…

957
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:31,442
Jung Fart-fart!

958
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:41,327
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

959
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,162
That is all.

960
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,376
Defendant.

961
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:51,212
Is there anything you would like to say?

962
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:00,430
Yes, first…

963
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:04,183
I would like to speak to the adults
who are raising children.

964
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:08,855
Children have to play right now.

965
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:11,441
Later is too late.

966
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:14,777
It's too late
after getting into university,

967
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:16,029
after getting a job,

968
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,323
and after getting married.

969
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:24,037
Playing with marbles, tag,
Red Rover, double dutch.

970
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:26,914
Later is too late.

971
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:29,917
In a life full of anxiety,

972
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,629
it'll be too late to find the only way

973
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:34,547
to happiness.

974
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:42,680
First!

975
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,725
Children must play immediately.

976
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:55,860
"First, children must play immediately.'

977
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:03,409
Second, children must be healthy
immediately.

978
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:04,911
-"Second,"
-"Second,"

979
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:08,665
-"children must be healthy immediately."
-"children must be healthy immediately."

980
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:09,707
Third.

981
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:11,125
Everyone be quiet.

982
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:15,088
No one else can speak
aside from the defendant.

983
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,133
Your Honor.

984
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:22,637
These children
are the victims in this case.

985
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,889
With the permission
of the presiding judge,

986
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:28,267
the victims have the right
to state their opinions during a trial.

987
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:30,478
Can't you accept the children

988
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:32,897
reciting the Declaration
of the Children's Liberation

989
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,774
as a victim's statement of opinion?

990
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:39,904
First!

991
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:41,781
-"First!"
-"First!"

992
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,659
Children must play immediately.

993
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:48,287
-"Children must play immediately."
-"Children must play immediately."

994
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:50,164
Second!

995
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:51,582
-"Second!"
-"Second!"

996
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:54,252
Children must be healthy immediately.

997
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:58,256
-"Children must be healthy immediately."
-"Children must be healthy immediately."

998
01:01:58,339 --> 01:01:59,340
Third!

999
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:00,383
-"Third!"
-"Third!"

1000
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:03,219
Children must be happy immediately!

1001
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:07,473
-"Children must be happy immediately!"
-"Children must be happy immediately!"

1002
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,312
I, the Commander-in-Chief Bang Gu-ppong,

1003
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:18,901
will presently defeat the sly demands
of schools, academies, and parents,

1004
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:27,368
and will immediately sing
for happy children!

1005
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:32,123
Kids!

1006
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,083
-Let's play!
-Let's play!

1007
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:39,213
-Let's play!
-Let's play!

1008
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:55,104
Bang Gu-ppong, look at this.

1009
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:57,398
-Look at mine too!
-I have it too!

1010
01:02:57,482 --> 01:02:58,941
That's so cool.

1011
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:00,693
Let's all hug.

1012
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:06,384
Do you want chili powder
on your jjajangmyeon?

1013
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:08,010
Yes.

1014
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:10,555
Do you want me to pour the sauce
on the sweet and sour pork?

1015
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:11,806
Yes.

1016
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:15,601
-Who is it?
-What?

1017
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:18,604
Who's the person that you like
if it's not Choi Su-yeon?

1018
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:22,441
Does it really matter who it is?

1019
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,944
I can only help if I know who it is.

1020
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:27,989
I can tell something's not going well.

1021
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:32,451
The way you're sighing like a sick dog.

1022
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:41,836
It's just hard for me to imagine
what happens next.

1023
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:44,922
What?

1024
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:48,467
What happens after liking each other.

1025
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:50,761
It feels like

1026
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:53,598
this is a big deal.

1027
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:56,809
Like I should have
some sort of great determination.

1028
01:04:58,019 --> 01:05:00,646
It's scary to think that
if we start things…

1029
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:03,190
it might make things difficult

1030
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:05,234
for both of us.

1031
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:08,529
Are you getting married?

1032
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:10,907
Why are you taking this so seriously?

1033
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:13,451
Date her and then if it doesn't work out,
you can just end things.

1034
01:05:13,534 --> 01:05:17,413
With this person, I can't start anything
with the mindset that it won't last.

1035
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:21,584
So you think it won't last?

1036
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:24,712
No, I don't think that!

1037
01:05:27,214 --> 01:05:29,425
Go, then. You have your answer.

1038
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,678
-Go?
-Go.

1039
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:41,562
Hey, wait. Where are you going?

1040
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:44,565
You're really going?

1041
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:46,067
I meant it

1042
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:49,904
as a metaphorical expression
for advancing the relationship.

1043
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:53,699
Does he not read?

1044
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:23,020
One, two, three.

1045
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:27,024
One, two, three.

1046
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:31,404
One, two, three.

1047
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:32,905
One, two. What?

1048
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:37,451
One, two, three.

1049
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:39,787
What? One, two.

1050
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:44,333
One, two, three.

1051
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,460
One, two, three.

1052
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:54,719
Oh.

1053
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:57,388
Thank you.

1054
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:04,603
I have something to say.

1055
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:19,785
I like you.

1056
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:27,752
I like you so much

1057
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:30,504
that it feels like…

1058
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:34,717
I'm sick inside.

1059
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:09,085
I'm sorry. We're not…

1060
01:08:20,971 --> 01:08:22,139
Can I come in?

1061
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:53,587
She's here alone at a gimbap restaurant
without a secretary at this hour.

1062
01:08:57,716 --> 01:08:58,801
Hold on.

1063
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:01,512
Woo Young-woo…

1064
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:04,849
That Hanbada attorney?

1065
01:09:32,793 --> 01:09:35,462
It's an illegal arrest
if you don't have an arrest warrant.

1066
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:36,839
Are you an attorney or something?

1067
01:09:36,922 --> 01:09:39,508
Where did you pick up
such a troublesome case like this?

1068
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:42,261
I picked it up on subway line two.

1069
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:43,888
Truly loving a person
with an intellectual disability.

1070
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:45,514
Is it that hard to believe?

1071
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:50,102
Do you want Mr. Yang to be punished
for sexually assaulting you?

1072
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:51,937
-I love him.
-What?

1073
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:53,522
Please don't let him go to jail.

1074
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:56,525
If you have a disability,
I think merely liking someone

1075
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:58,652
is not enough.

1076
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:04,992
