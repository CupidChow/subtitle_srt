1
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:05,648
Now, lastly, the bride and groom
will bow to the guests.

2
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,831
Now, this will be the first time
the two will be taking their steps

3
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,958
into the world as a married couple.

4
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,586
All the guests, please rise

5
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:29,881
and give a big round of applause
to congratulate the bride and groom.

6
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,513
Bride and groom, march!

7
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:45,623
What?

8
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,709
What is that?

9
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,171
My goodness.

10
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,339
Dear Lord.

11
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,593
Jeez, that scared me.

12
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:17,780
CASE 2
THE WEDDING DRESS THAT SLIPPED OFF

13
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,700
WOO YOUNG-WOO GIMBAP

14
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,581
That's pretty.

15
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:30,084
Did you change the ham in the gimbap?

16
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,169
What?

17
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,879
Yes. Why?

18
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,757
It doesn't taste good.

19
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,427
Is that right? Just eat it.

20
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,348
You're grown enough
to make food for your dad.

21
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,183
But instead, you're complaining?

22
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,020
Gosh.

23
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:51,856
When are you going to
grow up and get married?

24
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:57,278
Don't you want to wear
a wedding dress like that, Young-woo?

25
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,453
Do you want to wear
a wedding dress like that, Dad?

26
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,372
No.

27
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,749
It's not that I want to wear it.

28
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,544
It's a typical father's dream

29
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,882
to walk his daughter down the aisle.

30
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,219
To humans, weddings are a ritual
through which mating

31
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:24,722
and independence from the parents
are accomplished at once, but for whales…

32
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,143
What's this now?

33
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,020
You stopped the whale talk
all by yourself?

34
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,439
Do you want to hear more?

35
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,233
No, well…

36
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,235
it's out of character.

37
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:42,490
From now on, I won't talk about whales
to people who don't want to listen.

38
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:45,326
Because I have someone
who offers to listen now.

39
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,494
Really?

40
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,496
Who is it?

41
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,331
I'm late.

42
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,333
All right.

43
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,546
Here.

44
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,339
See you later.

45
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,049
-See you later.
-Okay.

46
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:07,932
Gosh.

47
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,004
Nice to meet you. I'm Han Seon-young.

48
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:39,922
I'm Jung Myeong-seok.

49
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,300
I'm Kim Jeong-gu.

50
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:45,678
We're all busy people,
so let's get straight to the point.

51
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,596
Yes.

52
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,394
My youngest daughter was born
when I was at the late age of 47.

53
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,146
She recently got married

54
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,940
to the son of Daehyeon Construction's CEO
at Daehyeon Hotel.

55
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,150
Congratulations.

56
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,443
Nonsense!

57
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:05,198
Gosh, those bastards at Daehyeon Hotel.

58
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,867
There was an incident at the wedding.

59
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,163
The chairman's daughter
was wearing a strapless wedding dress,

60
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,666
but when the bride and groom
were walking down the aisle,

61
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:17,960
the dress slipped down.

62
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:20,797
How low?

63
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,007
Down to here.

64
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,011
The undergarment didn't slip, right?

65
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,809
Do you have any idea
how much this wedding costs?

66
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,269
The hotel said they would
take care of everything,

67
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,189
so I asked for the best
and it cost me 230 million won.

68
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,982
Do you know how many guests we had?

69
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,652
A thousand very important people.

70
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,028
I spent 230 million won

71
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,489
just to be humiliated
in front of a thousand people!

72
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,241
That must've been really hard.

73
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:51,369
So how much should I get
from those Daehyeon Hotel bastards?

74
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,454
For the damages?

75
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,750
We'll have to look into it more
for the exact amount, but…

76
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,127
250-300 MILLION WON

77
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,130
-Approximately--
-Wait.

78
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,926
If the number you're thinking about
is less than a billion won,

79
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,136
don't even say it.

80
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,514
A billion?

81
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,853
Have you spoken
with Daehyeon Hotel by any chance?

82
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:20,982
Daehyeon Hotel offered
a full refund for the wedding.

83
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,359
And they also mentioned
gifting the bride and groom

84
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,695
a voucher to Daehyeon Hotel
worth ten million won.

85
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,865
Okay, so if we convert that to cash,
they've offered 240 million won.

86
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,533
That's not bad.

87
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,493
What? Not bad?

88
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,454
I was humiliated!

89
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,038
Relatives, friends, and clients.

90
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,709
I brought them all together just to
show them my daughter's naked body!

91
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,462
I can't show my face anywhere
because I'm humiliated!

92
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,131
And you're saying 240 million isn't bad?

93
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,426
Are you saying my pride
is only worth that much?

94
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,802
No, that's not it.

95
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:54,182
What you just said
legally falls under compensation.

96
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:58,686
Instead of paying for damages of assets,
it's for psychological distress.

97
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,899
But according to actual precedents,
it's not easy to get approved

98
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,192
for compensation.

99
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:07,695
Even if it's approved,
the amount is usually not that great.

100
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,114
Daehyeon Hotel offered
to refund all expenses of the wedding

101
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:14,035
and an accommodation voucher
that acts as compensation.

102
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,329
In all honesty,
their offer is quite reasonable.

103
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,999
But since you want another wedding,

104
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:23,461
I think we could argue for their full
coverage of the new wedding as well.

105
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,509
Hanbada is no different
from Taesan after all.

106
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,017
-Pardon?
-The land I own

107
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,478
is 6,000 pyeong in Garak-dong alone.

108
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,480
Which means I go through
a lot of lawsuits.

109
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,441
I gave it all to Taesan this whole time.

110
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,903
They're the number one
law firm in Korea, right?

111
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:52,240
But when something big happens,
these bastards just duck out.

112
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,824
They say the same thing as well!

113
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,911
"The compensation is usually not great."
This nonsense!

114
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,788
I came here

115
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:02,708
because I couldn't stand listening to that
anymore when I made Taesan a lot of money.

116
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,627
I thought Hanbada might be different.

117
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,672
Hanbada is different.

118
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:08,965
What's different?

119
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:12,343
"It's not easy. It can't be done."
You're saying the exact same thing!

120
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:18,391
What is the exact amount you want, sir?

121
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,768
The price of having been made a fool of.

122
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,145
Shouldn't I get at least a billion won?

123
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,490
We'll make it happen.

124
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:39,787
We'll show you that Hanbada can do
what Taesan couldn't.

125
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,919
I'm counting on you.

126
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,339
Make sure you pay them
a generous commission fee!

127
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,299
Goodness.

128
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,344
DAMAGES

129
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,638
What are the types of damages?

130
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,473
According to the theory
of three divisions of damages,

131
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,142
there are active damages, passive damages,

132
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,518
-and--
-Compensation.

133
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,896
Active damages are when
there is a loss in assets owned.

134
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,567
Passive damages are when someone is unable
to obtain an asset they could've gained.

135
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,651
-And compensation--
-Compensation

136
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,612
is reparation for psychological distress.

137
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,950
Attorney Jung, you've been
an attorney for a long time,

138
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,369
but how do you still not know
the types of damages?

139
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,121
I didn't ask because I don't know.

140
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,124
I asked to teach.

141
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,375
Right.

142
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:28,544
Is that so?

143
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,005
Yes, it is so.

144
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,799
So according to the theory
of three divisions of damages,

145
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:38,721
the 230 million won already paid
for the wedding is active damages.

146
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,307
The 230 million won required

147
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,769
for another wedding with the same
conditions are passive damages

148
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:48,022
since they wouldn't have had to pay it
if it weren't for the incident.

149
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:52,985
Actually, this doesn't really make sense
because it's double compensation.

150
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,236
But our client…

151
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,530
wants a billion won.

152
00:10:57,114 --> 00:11:02,328
Ultimately, we have to demand compensation
of a minimum of 500 million won.

153
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:05,039
But according to the method of calculation
of compensation by the supreme court,

154
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:08,751
the most someone can receive even when
they die of a car accident is 100 million.

155
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,003
But this case is defamation at best.

156
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,714
And it falls under normal damages,
not serious damages.

157
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,008
Then the most
we could go for is 50 million.

158
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,301
That's correct.

159
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,594
But in life,

160
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:21,847
you'll come across clients like this
who make such ridiculous demands.

161
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,308
Since we're in charge
of the case, let's find a way.

162
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,478
Daehyeon Hotel integrated
all wedding-related work

163
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,688
when they created a wedding business team.

164
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:34,151
It's a relief since renting the venue and
wedding dress are usually done separately

165
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,112
which makes it difficult
to ask for responsibility.

166
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,447
But in this case, everything
was done by Daehyeon Hotel.

167
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:42,618
Most importantly,
is this really Daehyeon Hotel's fault?

168
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,286
Whether intentional or accidental,

169
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,540
we have to find the attributable reason
to show the hotel is to blame.

170
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,502
Without it, this entire claim
for damages will be meaningless.

171
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:56,215
Attorney Kwon and Attorney Choi, have you
ever done an undercover investigation?

172
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,591
-What?
-No.

173
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:01,303
The hotel will never give up information
on what kind of mistakes were made

174
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,347
during the process of preparing the dress.

175
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,433
We have to find out on our own.

176
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,101
You two go to Daehyeon Hotel

177
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:10,104
and try on a wedding dress,
pretending to be the bride and groom.

178
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:11,647
Okay.

179
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,859
And Attorney Woo,
go meet the couple with Jun-ho.

180
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,152
Okay.

181
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,571
Is it okay if I go to Daehyeon Hotel

182
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:22,199
with Jun-ho, not Attorney Kwon?

183
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,367
Why?

184
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,328
You don't think Attorney Kwon
is husband material?

185
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,246
No.

186
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,497
What? Gosh.

187
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,083
I don't like Attorney Choi either.

188
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,753
I'll meet with the bride
and groom with Attorney Woo.

189
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,841
-You're okay with that, right?
-I also prefer to be alone with Jun-ho,

190
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,342
but I'll yield.

191
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,803
What do you mean
you prefer to be alone with Jun-ho?

192
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,930
Are you guys close?

193
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,140
Well…

194
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,185
If the definition of "being close"

195
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:52,354
is "having a specific topic
to discuss when alone,"

196
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,899
then yes, we're close.

197
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:10,748
She won't come out of her room
ever since the wedding.

198
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,838
The attorneys are here.

199
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,549
Right.

200
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,263
I'm Kwon Min-woo from Hanbada Law Firm,
the attorney assigned to your case.

201
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,307
Here.

202
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,228
What are you doing? Say hi.

203
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,896
Right. Hello.

204
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,816
You need to introduce yourself.

205
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,734
Right.

206
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:39,860
My name is…

207
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,449
Whether it's read straight or flipped,
it's Woo Young-woo.

208
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,952
Kayak, deed, rotator,
noon, racecar, Woo Young-woo.

209
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,495
What?

210
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:52,248
I'm sorry. She's new to the firm.

211
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,125
-Yes.
-Right, sure.

212
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,086
Have a seat.

213
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,343
Thank you.

214
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,689
You must be very upset.

215
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:17,606
Well…

216
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,149
Yes.

217
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,903
Have you been staying
with your parents since the wedding?

218
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,822
What about your husband?

219
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,408
It's become a bit awkward
between us since the incident.

220
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,871
Our place is empty.
He's also staying with his parents.

221
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,665
Do you plan on having another wedding?

222
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:35,916
I'm not sure.

223
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,085
You should ask my dad.

224
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:42,172
-Your dad?
-Both families have different opinions.

225
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,592
This marriage is complicated.

226
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,636
Jin-uk's grandfather used to adore me.

227
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,265
He's a church elder
and conducts the choir.

228
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,226
And I play the piano accompaniment.

229
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:59,523
He's the one who introduced me to Jin-uk,
and we ended up getting married.

230
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,860
But I heard he was very disappointed in me
because of what happened at the wedding.

231
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:05,195
Apparently, he mentioned
breaking off the marriage.

232
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,741
Disappointed in you because of
what happened at the wedding?

233
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:09,909
Why?

234
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,370
I have a tattoo of Guanyin Bodhisattva.

235
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,331
I see.

236
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:16,916
Guanyin Bodhisattva.

237
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,419
So when did you find out
there was an issue with the dress?

238
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,379
The morning of the wedding.

239
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,799
It was tight during the dress fitting.

240
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,719
-But that morning, it felt a bit loose.
-This feels like it's gotten very loose.

241
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,096
Did you tell the Daehyeon Hotel
employees about it?

242
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,473
Yes, I did.

243
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,808
-To the girl who helped me get dressed.
-That can't be.

244
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,269
But she just said it's probably
because I lost weight

245
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,772
and put more pins
on the inside of the dress.

246
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,650
Did you lose weight
at the time of the wedding?

247
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,651
No.

248
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:50,032
Is there anyone around you
who can testify about the situation?

249
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,369
Like a friend who overheard
you worrying about the dress being loose.

250
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,455
No, none. My acquaintances
didn't come to the wedding.

251
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,415
But it was your wedding.

252
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,584
My dad took care of the guest list.

253
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,586
So it was his guests.

254
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:04,922
Right.

255
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,591
Do you have any questions, Attorney Woo?

256
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:08,592
I do.

257
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,427
Ms. Kim Hwa-yeong.

258
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,429
Do you love your husband?

259
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,015
Pardon?

260
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:16,767
I'm sorry.

261
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,686
You call that a question?

262
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,354
Yes.

263
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,023
There are a lot of pictures in this room.

264
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,611
Lots of self-portraits of Ms. Hwa-yeong
and pictures with her friends and family.

265
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,739
But there isn't
a single picture of your husband.

266
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,325
Right.

267
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,203
They must all be back at our place.

268
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,206
There's one right there.

269
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,050
And your wedding ring is on your vanity.

270
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,094
Not your finger.

271
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,139
Ms. Kim Hwa-yeong.

272
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,101
Do you love your husband?

273
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:07,067
My father-in-law sure is odd.

274
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:11,947
I don't even want to think about that day
and I don't get why he's even suing them.

275
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,615
And Daehyeon Hotel at that.

276
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,870
It's as if he's trying to start a fight
between the two families.

277
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,706
Do you not want the lawsuit to happen?

278
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,542
It makes me mad
when I think about what happened.

279
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,962
How could this be a wedding service
prepared by a five-star hotel?

280
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,088
However,

281
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,968
Daehyeon Hotel and Daehyeon Construction
are affiliated with the Daehyeon Group.

282
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,971
So isn't it basically
a disgrace to our family?

283
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:40,059
Is it true that your family brought up
breaking off the marriage?

284
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,393
Is that what Hwa-yeong said?

285
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,146
Gosh.

286
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,440
My grandfather liked Hwa-yeong

287
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,567
and was very enthusiastic
about this marriage.

288
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,736
He introduced her to me

289
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,446
and even convinced my parents.

290
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,032
And then…

291
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,869
You know about Hwa-yeong's tattoo, right?

292
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,748
Yes, she told us about it.

293
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:07,044
She said she got it done as a joke
back when she was immature.

294
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,712
So I thought nothing of it.

295
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:12,007
I mean, it's hard to remove it
and it's not out in the open.

296
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:16,345
But my grandfather
went so far as to feel betrayed.

297
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:20,516
He's old and a devout Christian.

298
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,893
He said I can't get married
to someone like her

299
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:26,688
and told me to quit it since we haven't
even registered our marriage yet.

300
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,440
So are you going to?

301
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,025
I'm not sure.

302
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,153
We'll have to wait
and see how the adults feel about it.

303
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:37,199
Have you discussed breaking off
the marriage with Ms. Kim Hwa-yeong?

304
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,368
It's been a while
since we last saw each other.

305
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:43,080
She's gotten sensitive
and sees a psychiatrist.

306
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,916
We fight whenever we meet.

307
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,042
Psychiatrist?

308
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,962
Ms. Kim Hwa-yeong
gets psychiatric treatment?

309
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,505
She didn't say?

310
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,465
From what I know,

311
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,093
she's been seeing a doctor
since the incident.

312
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:04,101
There must be some kind of law
that says rich people can't mature.

313
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,727
No, there's no such law.

314
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,274
I see.

315
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,400
That was a joke.

316
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,860
Gosh.

317
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:18,448
How are they getting married
when they are still kids? Don't you agree?

318
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,535
Psychological independence
from parents is necessary for marriage.

319
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,912
They don't know how to
do anything for themselves.

320
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:28,584
Even at that age, they probably never even
prepared a meal by themselves.

321
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,627
Attorney Kwon.

322
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,965
Have you prepared a meal on your own?

323
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,008
Of course.

324
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,178
You haven't?

325
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,015
I guess not.

326
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,779
So what should we call each other?

327
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,032
I'm not sure.

328
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:01,783
Maybe…

329
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,454
I should just call you by your name.

330
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,538
Jun-ho?

331
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,042
Okay, then I'll call you by your name too.

332
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,921
I don't think we should
call each other by name.

333
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,881
We don't know what could happen.

334
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,674
You're right.

335
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,426
Then…

336
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,720
Sweetie?

337
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,564
ATTORNEY WOO YOUNG-WOO

338
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,608
Yes, Attorney Woo.

339
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,861
Jun-ho, do you also think an adult
should prepare their own meals

340
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,155
and be independent of their parents?

341
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,531
Well…

342
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,201
I'm not sure, but it would be nice.

343
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:48,038
But killer whales stay
with their mothers their whole life.

344
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:51,208
According to human standards, they are
all mama's boys and mama's girls--

345
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,252
Hey, Young-woo. What are you doing?

346
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,837
Su-yeon?

347
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,340
I'm on the phone.

348
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,426
Is this what you were referring to
by having a specific topic with Jun-ho?

349
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,428
You can't do this during business hours.

350
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,639
You shouldn't keep
a busy person on the phone.

351
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,642
-Right.
-I'm fine.

352
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:13,188
I'm a bit preoccupied at the moment,
so I'll call you back later.

353
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,314
Okay.

354
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,234
ATTORNEY WOO YOUNG-WOO

355
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,986
Does Young-woo do this often?

356
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,153
No.

357
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,406
Just sometimes.

358
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,955
ATTORNEY WOO YOUNG-WOO

359
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,169
Yes, Attorney Woo.

360
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,965
Have you ever heard that we know
more about the dark side of the moon

361
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,009
than we do about the deep sea?

362
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,721
-What?
-Just seeing how no one's ever witnessed

363
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,265
a blue whale giving birth
is proof of that.

364
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,809
One might think it's not difficult
to see a blue whale that is the size

365
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:54,855
of a plane to give birth to a calf
as heavy as a hippopotamus.

366
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:57,190
But that's because the ocean
is so vast and deep

367
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,735
that it's keeping the whales' secrets.

368
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,529
Right.

369
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:03,655
I see.

370
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,826
Attorney Woo, I'm in the middle of…

371
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,329
Hello?

372
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,414
Attorney Woo?

373
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,753
-The feces of a blue whale is red.
-You scared me.

374
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,339
It's because krill,
their staple food, are red.

375
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,174
Right. I see.

376
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,218
The whale's feces acts as a kind of pump

377
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:29,264
that pulls nutrients from the deep parts
of the ocean up to the surface of the sea.

378
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:33,727
Whales feed in the deep ocean and come up
to excrete on the surface of the sea.

379
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:37,105
And the feces
become nutrients for phytoplankton.

380
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,149
Right. I see.

381
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,943
The right whale is a migratory animal.

382
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,905
But the 400 right whales
that live in California

383
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,948
stay in one place all year long.

384
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,660
They're fast enough
to go through California in six days,

385
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,037
but they don't move at all.

386
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,413
I see.

387
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:57,626
Attorney Woo, should we go through
the revolving doors? It's been a while.

388
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,670
No, I'm working overtime today.

389
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:01,713
What?

390
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,132
So,

391
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:07,594
you came all the way
down here to talk about whales?

392
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,138
Yes, goodbye.

393
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,226
How is that sometimes?

394
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,894
She's been following you around
this whole time.

395
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,562
It's fine.

396
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,190
The more I listen,
it's all useful information, and…

397
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:23,151
Who else would listen to
that talk if I don't?

398
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,736
It's nice if at least I do.

399
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,864
Are you going to listen to her forever?

400
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:29,324
What?

401
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:32,702
If not, you should be
the one to set boundaries.

402
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,455
That seems like
the right thing to do for her.

403
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:44,965
Are you okay?

404
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,843
What?

405
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,144
I'm okay.

406
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,842
Gosh, please.

407
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,468
-Goodness.
-Thank you.

408
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,012
Thank you.

409
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,070
No.

410
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,115
Not yet.

411
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,417
Attorney Woo.

412
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,175
How did you get here?

413
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:11,718
I took the subway.

414
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,553
I see.

415
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,263
I have to meet with Attorney Choi.

416
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,184
I can't say why I'm here.

417
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:21,645
Especially, not to you.

418
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:26,107
Okay, I think Attorney Choi
is in the restroom over there.

419
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,027
Okay.

420
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:41,957
Su-yeon, is that you?

421
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,044
Su-yeon, is that you?

422
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:49,714
Over here.

423
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:51,883
Did you bring it?

424
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:52,968
Give it to me.

425
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:02,769
What the…

426
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,271
Young-woo, are you kidding me?

427
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,856
There weren't any suit pants in my closet?

428
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,941
There were.

429
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,527
Then why did you bring this one?

430
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,112
You told me to bring anything.

431
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,281
That one looked the most comfortable,
and it didn't have a label.

432
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,116
Gosh, this can't be happening.

433
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,134
Do you want me to
bring you something else?

434
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,520
I'm out, anyway.

435
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,064
You have to…

436
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:50,608
get married.

437
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,488
We decided to call each other sweetie.

438
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,992
Calling him by his name is also fine,

439
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:02,829
but it could be dangerous to keep saying
our names in front of others.

440
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,084
The reason we're in a hurry to get married

441
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,380
is because I'm expecting.

442
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,216
So before I start showing,

443
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:19,429
wearing the most
beautiful dress in the world

444
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,556
and getting married
at Daehyeon Hotel is my…

445
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,144
No, it's your dream.

446
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,271
By "expecting,"

447
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:32,692
you don't mean "regarding something
as likely to happen," right?

448
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,319
No, I'm not.

449
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:37,364
-So then--
-We slept together, before marriage.

450
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:41,826
So Jun-ho's baby is here.

451
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,250
Take good care…

452
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,128
of Jun-ho.

453
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,857
How's Attorney Choi? Is she all right?

454
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,444
-She's out.
-What?

455
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,446
You have to marry me, Jun-ho.

456
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,616
I mean, Sweetie.

457
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:31,000
Then should we get going?

458
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:34,212
Our reservation is at three,
and we're really late.

459
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,005
Okay, Sweetie.

460
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,889
You said the wedding is next week?

461
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,516
Yes.

462
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,519
I'm glad that the reservation
was made even though it was last minute.

463
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:50,937
I know.

464
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,941
People usually have to wait around a year
to reserve our wedding venue.

465
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,693
You two were very lucky.

466
00:28:56,776 --> 00:29:00,029
We're hurrying with the wedding
because we're expecting.

467
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:03,700
Excuse me?

468
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:06,619
And by "expecting,"
I'm not referring to the definition of

469
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,581
"regarding something as likely to happen."
Do you get it?

470
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,417
Of course, Sweetie.

471
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,754
I'm sure she knows what you mean.

472
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,005
All right.

473
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,966
What kind of style
do you want for the dress?

474
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,050
Let's take a look.

475
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,191
My goodness.

476
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,067
This one looks nice.

477
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,321
Right?

478
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,698
It's pretty, but…

479
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:48,203
To be honest,
this design is a little out of fashion.

480
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,872
There are a lot of things
to mind when putting it on too.

481
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,958
Well, my sweetie is too thin.

482
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,877
What if it slips off when she wears it?

483
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,670
That sometimes happens, doesn't it?

484
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:01,216
A wedding dress slipping off?

485
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,095
Gosh, that could never happen.

486
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:09,057
We do very thorough fittings.

487
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:13,186
I would like to try this dress on.

488
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,313
I guess she's determined to try this one.

489
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:20,068
You must like bold styles.

490
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,195
I guess that's probably why
we got pregnant.

491
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:24,280
That's why we got pregnant.

492
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:38,753
Okay, then.

493
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,172
Should we get you fitted in this one?

494
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,800
-Okay.
-The groom can wait here for a second.

495
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,427
Ji-hye.

496
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,431
Ji-hye!

497
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,393
Ji-hye's not back yet.

498
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:56,020
Where did she go?
It's still working hours.

499
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:56,938
What?

500
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,108
You sent her out on an errand earlier.

501
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,070
The bakery…

502
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:09,158
She said they have freshly baked bread
at four and sent me to get them.

503
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,536
Am I her errand girl or what?

504
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,622
That's what I'm saying!

505
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,250
If Ju-hui were here
she would've said something for me!

506
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,460
What? You didn't know?

507
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,880
Ju-hui was fired.

508
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,047
That incident…

509
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,342
That incident when the dress slipped off.

510
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,305
Whatever. Errand girl is off now.

511
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,432
I have to get it to her
while it's still fresh and hot.

512
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,350
Bye.

513
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:45,069
Jun-ho. It's me, Su-yeon.

514
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:48,489
I think an employee named Ju-hui
was fired because of the dress incident.

515
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,825
I overheard someone on the phone.

516
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:55,121
If she's an employee there,
she'll show up with bread.

517
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,165
Bread?

518
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:27,987
Excuse me.

519
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,072
Yes?

520
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:30,823
Hello.

521
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,450
I was wondering

522
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:35,912
if you know where Ju-hui is.

523
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,622
Ju-hui…

524
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,249
Bae Ju-hui?

525
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,835
Yes, I think it was maybe
three months ago?

526
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:47,465
I had a consultation with her,
and it seems like she's not here today.

527
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,009
She resigned.

528
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,845
What's this about?

529
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,099
It's a long story.

530
00:32:57,266 --> 00:33:00,311
Could I get her contact information?

531
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:01,771
Well…

532
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,108
I'm sorry, I can't hand out
her private information.

533
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:06,776
I'm sorry.

534
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,820
-Well--
-We're ready.

535
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:15,076
Gosh, you look beautiful!

536
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,369
Your waist is so tiny!

537
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:17,662
Yes, Attorney Choi.

538
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,248
I looked into it, but I don't think

539
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,833
-it'll be easy.
-We're ready.

540
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,993
How do you feel?

541
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,745
It's extremely uncomfortable.

542
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,788
It feels like
it's only made out of labels.

543
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,958
Gosh, look at his face.

544
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,710
He's totally in love.

545
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,297
Did you fall in love?

546
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:22,810
COURT

547
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,313
The wedding dress slipped off
during the ceremony.

548
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,107
Just the thought of it is alarming.

549
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:32,320
But is it really this big of a deal?

550
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,655
It's an incident
that could've been laughed off.

551
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,075
But now, there are seven attorneys
from major law firms involved,

552
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,785
fighting about a billion won.

553
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,913
I'm concerned
this is a waste of judicial power.

554
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:46,042
The plaintiff, Ms. Kim, has been seeking
psychiatric help for over two months

555
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,502
because of this incident.

556
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,712
She's experiencing discord
with her husband,

557
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,422
and there are even talks
about breaking off the marriage.

558
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:55,134
The defendant, Daehyeon Hotel,
received a large sum of 230 million won

559
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,136
from the plaintiff
and organized the wedding.

560
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,305
And if the result
of it is a broken marriage,

561
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:01,015
the damages cannot be overlooked.

562
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:05,061
We believe it is not an incident
that can just be laughed off.

563
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:07,563
The incident
where the wedding dress slipped off

564
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:10,858
is due to the plaintiff's carelessness,
not Daehyeon Hotel's fault.

565
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:14,028
Therefore, the plaintiff's
psychiatric treatment and her marriage

566
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:17,532
being on the verge of breaking off
aren't the hotel's responsibility.

567
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:21,285
It's not going to be easy
to prove who is in the wrong.

568
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,455
Are you inclined to settle reasonably?

569
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:28,209
Daehyeon Hotel offered compensation
right after the wedding,

570
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,378
but the plaintiff refused.

571
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,214
If they want to go
so far as filing a lawsuit,

572
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,174
Daehyeon Hotel can't back down either.

573
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,469
Because our honor
as a five-star hotel is on the line here.

574
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:41,013
Through your fair judgment, Your Honor,

575
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:44,725
we hope to gain recognition that
this incident was not the hotel's fault.

576
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:51,399
If I had to name her illness,
it's post-traumatic stress disorder.

577
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,152
The incident at the wedding
has traumatized her,

578
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,570
continuing to distress her.

579
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,364
She's doing much better now,

580
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:01,200
but right after the wedding,
her insomnia, eating disorder,

581
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,618
and social phobia were quite severe.

582
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:06,581
Could PTSD be a reason
for her marriage breaking up?

583
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:10,960
You two are attorneys, so you should know.

584
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:14,797
As a doctor, I have a duty
to protect my patient's privacy.

585
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,424
I'm going to be honest with you.

586
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,802
We need a professional's opinion
that states her PTSD could be the cause

587
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,304
of their marriage being in crisis.

588
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,390
Could you testify in court?

589
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:26,851
It's for Ms. Kim's sake.

590
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,312
For Ms. Kim's sake…

591
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,397
Are you sure?

592
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:38,446
I don't think I can testify.

593
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,447
I'm sorry.

594
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,375
Thank you.

595
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:07,433
Whipped cream
contains about 30 percent fat.

596
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,977
-Really?
-Yes.

597
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,439
The milk of right whales and other whales
is much thicker than whipped cream

598
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:16,317
since it contains 30 to 50 percent fat.

599
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,071
A blue whale mother produces 200 kilograms
of this high-fat milk every day.

600
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,241
So then how much weight
would the whale calf gain

601
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,951
after drinking that for six months?

602
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,661
I don't know.

603
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,287
Seventeen tons.

604
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,046
Don't you have

605
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,758
anything else to say to me
besides whale talk?

606
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:42,593
No.

607
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,929
Right. You don't?

608
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:45,972
No, I don't.

609
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,020
From now on,

610
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:57,108
what if we set up a specific time
to talk about whales?

611
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,442
Instead of talking about whenever.

612
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,278
Right.

613
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,115
All right. What time do you prefer?

614
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,534
How about lunchtime? Is that okay?

615
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,577
We can talk while we eat together.

616
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:09,620
Okay.

617
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,373
So when it's not lunchtime…

618
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,375
We talk about anything other than whales.

619
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,669
"We talk about anything
other than whales."

620
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,131
Well…

621
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:24,135
What if we're in a situation
where whale talk is necessary?

622
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,177
Well…

623
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,388
Then we talk about whales.

624
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:31,434
Yes. "Then we talk about whales."

625
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:55,916
Hello, Ji-hye.

626
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,668
-Are you here to buy bread?
-What?

627
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,670
What are you doing here?

628
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,255
We would like to know
Bae Ju-hui's contact information.

629
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,675
It's not anything weird.

630
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,678
I'm sorry, I don't think
I should be giving it out like that.

631
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,723
An incident where the wedding dress
slipped off happened two months ago.

632
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,935
We would like to
talk to Bae Ju-hui about it.

633
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,313
What do you want to know?

634
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,357
What really happened.

635
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,318
Are you two here to investigate?

636
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:27,156
Did you know the bride, Kim Hwa-yeong,
is still receiving psychiatric treatment?

637
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,827
Her marriage is about to be
broken up due to the incident.

638
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:35,039
We'll proceed quietly
so no harm comes your way.

639
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:35,998
Please, help us.

640
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,250
Even if I give you her number,

641
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,045
reaching her won't be easy.

642
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:43,714
Ju-hui

643
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,800
left the country.

644
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,025
WITNESS

645
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,527
DEFENDANT

646
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,487
PLAINTIFF

647
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,072
Is the witness here?

648
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:12,076
She's traveling from far away,
so I think she's running a little late.

649
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,994
Could you please give us some more time?

650
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,455
Far away? Is she traveling from overseas?

651
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,791
How much longer do we have to wait?

652
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:24,964
We'll take note of the witness' absence
and set up another interrogation date.

653
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,572
Witness Kang Ji-hye has arrived.

654
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:50,865
Come up to the front.

655
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,673
"I solemnly swear that
I will tell the truth, the whole truth,

656
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:10,676
and nothing but the truth,
and agree to receive punishment

657
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:13,137
in accordance with perjury
should there be any falsehood."

658
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,848
Plaintiff's counselor,
you may begin questioning the witness.

659
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:16,974
Yes, sir.

660
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:21,687
On the day of Ms. Kim's wedding,

661
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,772
what was your job?

662
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:26,692
As an employee of the wedding
business team at Daehyeon Hotel,

663
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:29,695
my role was to assist
the bride with the dress.

664
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:30,821
On the wedding day,

665
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:34,617
do you recall what Ms. Kim said
after putting the wedding dress on?

666
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,993
Yes.

667
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:39,371
This feels like it's gotten very loose.

668
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,582
What did you say in response?

669
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,292
That can't be.

670
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,794
You must've lost a lot of weight.

671
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,463
Why did you come to that conclusion?

672
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:50,674
Brides usually lose a lot of weight
before the wedding day.

673
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,385
It's partly because of dieting

674
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,596
but also because they just slim down a bit

675
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,723
from not drinking water all day
before the ceremony.

676
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:01,977
The tailor of the wedding business team
is very experienced and skilled.

677
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:06,774
so I didn't think the tailor
would've slacked on the fitting

678
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:09,902
for the dress to slip off
because of some weight loss.

679
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,448
Do you still believe that?

680
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:20,120
Witness?

681
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:23,040
Please respond. Do you still believe that?

682
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:32,716
No.

683
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,261
Why is that?

684
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:37,888
After the wedding was over,

685
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:40,891
I found out
there was a mix-up in the dress.

686
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,316
On the morning of the wedding,

687
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,278
the dress that was fitted
for Ms. Kim had been torn.

688
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:57,324
It was a mistake made by Bae Ju-hui,
a coworker who was with us back then.

689
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,243
-You don't deserve to cry!
-I'm sorry.

690
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,580
What are we going to do?

691
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,040
Since there was no time to fix it,

692
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,669
they took out another dress they had.

693
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:13,048
It was the same design
but slightly bigger.

694
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:18,220
So the employees

695
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:22,141
of the wedding business team
hid this fact from Ms. Kim?

696
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,475
The team director

697
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,979
told us after firing Bae Ju-hui

698
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,274
that she'll also fire us
if we don't keep quiet.

699
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:36,322
I came here today
knowing that I might have to quit.

700
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:40,326
I had no idea the bride
was having such a hard time.

701
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,537
I'm sorry

702
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:46,165
for not speaking up sooner.

703
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:50,794
That's all.

704
00:43:59,011 --> 00:43:59,845
WITNESS

705
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:06,143
Plaintiff, are you having
a hard time since the wedding?

706
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,394
What?

707
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,315
-Yes.
-How so?

708
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:13,567
Objection.

709
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,904
The defendant's counselor is badgering
the plaintiff with vague questions.

710
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,365
Not so far as badgering, but sustained.

711
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,741
Ask specific questions.

712
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,369
Okay, I will ask specific questions.

713
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:24,870
Plaintiff.

714
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,290
Are you aware
of the online community called Wagle?

715
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,710
Wagle.co.kr.

716
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,089
-Yes.
-You wrote a few posts on Wagle

717
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,424
with the username, Sally Ride.

718
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,426
Is that correct?

719
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:43,013
Please respond. Is that correct?

720
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,100
Yes.

721
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,853
Title, "How I ruined my wedding."

722
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:53,649
This is a post you wrote on Wagle

723
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:56,902
on September 8,
which was a week after the wedding.

724
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:59,780
Could you please read aloud
the underlined part right here?

725
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,784
Should I read it?

726
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:11,625
"His family is talking about
breaking off the marriage."

727
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,669
"It's rather a good thing."

728
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:16,505
"If I hide behind my trauma
for a little longer,

729
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:18,632
I might not have to get married."

730
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:22,803
"I won't have to live a fake life
with a man I barely know."

731
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:27,307
This whole time the plaintiff argued that

732
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,768
she is receiving psychiatric treatment
and that this is the reason

733
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,354
for her marriage
being on the verge of ending.

734
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:35,065
And then she asked
for the large sum of a billion won

735
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,526
as compensation from Daehyeon Hotel.

736
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,361
Is this correct?

737
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,447
But in this post, you said,

738
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:46,410
"It's a good thing that they are talking
about breaking off the engagement."

739
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:49,746
And "If I hide behind
my trauma for a little longer,

740
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,458
I might not have to get married."

741
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:56,712
Of these two, which is the truth?

742
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:01,550
You said you have been
having a hard time since the wedding.

743
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,760
Why is that?

744
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:06,763
Your Honor.

745
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:10,642
I submit the plaintiff's posts
as evidence.

746
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:15,731
ANOTHER WEDDING
WITH A PERSON I DO NOT LOVE

747
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,528
BUT HOW LONG
CAN I KEEP RUNNING AWAY LIKE THIS?

748
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:33,665
If you don't speak,

749
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:36,210
we can't help you.

750
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:38,128
My dad…

751
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,465
was really happy about this marriage.

752
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:44,510
He was thrilled to become an in-law
of the Daehyeon Group family,

753
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,011
but then there were also gifts.

754
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:47,804
Gifts?

755
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,975
Jin-uk's grandfather
owns some land in Dogok-dong,

756
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,436
and he said he'll give it
to me once we're married.

757
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,146
As a wedding gift.

758
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,483
My dad was the one
who was more excited about that.

759
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,568
He had all these plans

760
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,362
as to how to put the land to use.

761
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:05,697
But…

762
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,743
I'm not so sure.

763
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:16,041
Is it right to be forced
into a marriage like this?

764
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:19,920
Jin-uk and I don't care about each other.

765
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,631
Does everyone else live like this too?

766
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:26,218
Most people don't get land
as a wedding gift.

767
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:27,302
And it's Dogok-dong--

768
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:36,937
Here.

769
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:45,737
Even with the lawsuit.
I think my dad is doing it out of spite.

770
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:49,950
Because he won't get to be
an in-law of a chaebol family,

771
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:52,661
he's trying to put them
through trouble before ending it.

772
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:59,501
It's not like I thought
I could get married with just love.

773
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:02,754
But it's my life.

774
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:07,634
I really don't know what I should do.

775
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,033
This is good!

776
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:37,164
It's good that it was a gift of land.

777
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:40,292
What?

778
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:43,462
Damages can be divided into three

779
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:46,173
according to the theory
of three divisions of damages,

780
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,924
but it can also be divided into two.

781
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:50,927
Are you aware?

782
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:54,473
Are you quizzing me
thinking I wouldn't know the answer?

783
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,519
Are you talking about general damages
and special damages?

784
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:00,520
Yes.

785
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:05,984
General damages are those recognized
to occur ordinarily,

786
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:10,572
and special damages are those occurring
due to special circumstances.

787
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:14,117
In this case, the cost of the wedding
falls under general damages.

788
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,494
But it's only 230 million,

789
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:18,413
making it difficult for the client
to ask for one billion won.

790
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,457
But then, it turns out Ms. Kim

791
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,543
had a special circumstance
that is the gift of land

792
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,672
or in other words, the donative
promise of land. How good is this?

793
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,299
Yes, that's right.

794
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,635
This marriage
isn't just an ordinary marriage

795
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:34,179
but a marriage with the donative promise
of land as a condition.

796
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:36,181
Hadn't the wedding dress slipped off,

797
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:39,476
Hong Jin-uk's grandfather, Hong Ju-myeong
wouldn't have seen Ms. Kim's tattoo

798
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:40,977
and thus, he would not
have been disappointed

799
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:43,438
and the donative promise of land
would've been fulfilled as expected.

800
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:45,190
If we argue the value of the property

801
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:47,776
that Ms. Kim wasn't able to receive
from Hong Ju-myeong

802
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:50,779
due to Daehyeon Hotel's mistake
as special damages,

803
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:53,865
we'll be able to seek
a much larger sum of damages.

804
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:57,494
Above all else, I'm glad we won't have to
hang onto compensation now.

805
00:49:57,577 --> 00:50:00,914
Because whether or not her psychological
distress is from her marriage breaking off

806
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:03,291
has nothing to do
with this special damage.

807
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:08,755
Attorney Woo, why don't you go write up
a statement of opinion on this?

808
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,633
Since it's a suggestion
of changing the purpose of the claim,

809
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:14,886
we'll show it to the CEO and the Chairman
and discuss it together.

810
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,304
Yes, sir.

811
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,351
Oh, the statement of opinion…

812
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:33,321
So how much are you saying you'll get me?

813
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:37,868
Do you happen to know how much
the property that Mr. Hong Ju-myeong

814
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,620
-promised to bestow is worth?
-Of course.

815
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,790
I asked the appraiser
who helps me with my work.

816
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,126
How much was it exactly?

817
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:48,837
-It's 33.2 billion won.
-Right.

818
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:54,551
That means we can demand
compensation of 33.2 billion won.

819
00:50:56,386 --> 00:51:01,433
Because Mr. Hong was aware Ms. Kim
would gain property worth 33.2 billion

820
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,560
should the marriage go through.

821
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:05,604
We can argue, "Give me the same amount

822
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:09,441
of the wedding gift worth 33.2 billion
because it's your fault I can't get it."

823
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,152
Of course,

824
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:15,071
this exact amount won't be recognized.

825
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:17,908
Legally it makes sense,
but realistically it doesn't.

826
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:23,622
The amount is too much
for the judge to make a ruling on.

827
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:27,709
If you were a judge, would you give a
verdict of damages worth 33.2 billion won

828
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:30,504
for the mistake of giving
the wrong wedding dress?

829
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,423
So what's going to happen?

830
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:36,092
If we demand that they compensate
for 33.2 billion won,

831
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:39,638
Daehyeon Hotel will contact us to settle.

832
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:44,142
Then, you settle for a reasonable sum.

833
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,478
Reasonable sum? How much would that be?

834
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:52,067
We're planning to start

835
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:56,238
at 3.32 billion won,
10 percent of 33.2 billion won.

836
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:57,364
What do you think?

837
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:13,296
This is the statement of opinion
that has everything we just said.

838
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,391
PLAINTIFF'S ATTORNEY
HANBADA LAW FIRM, ATTORNEY WOO YOUNG-WOO

839
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:29,521
My goodness!

840
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:31,189
Look at that.

841
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,941
You said Hanbada is different.

842
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:35,569
And you really do amazing work.

843
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:39,197
I told you to get me a billion won
and you're going to bring me 3.32 billion.

844
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,788
Is my opinion not important?

845
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:51,418
It's my case.

846
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:54,087
I don't want it.

847
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,590
You keep quiet. The adults are talking.

848
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,341
What's so great
about my dress slipping off

849
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,176
and ruining my wedding to do all this?

850
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:04,097
Are you trying to get their money
because you're upset about the free land?

851
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:07,017
What difference does it make
if you get that money?

852
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,811
Please stop now, Dad!

853
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,813
Please proceed with this.

854
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,732
I'm counting on you.

855
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:17,485
Let's go.

856
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:47,432
Defendant, you were also there
when the two families met, right?

857
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,060
Yes.

858
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:52,938
Because while I'm the chairman
of Daehyeon Hotel,

859
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:55,065
I'm also Jin-uk's uncle.

860
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:58,526
I gladly treated them to a meal.

861
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:02,822
That day, Mr. Hong Ju-myeong
promised the plaintiff a wedding gift.

862
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:05,408
-Do you recall?
-Wedding gift?

863
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,369
I'm not sure.

864
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:09,120
Were there talks of a wedding gift?

865
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:12,749
Mr. Hong Ju-myeong promised
the plaintiff his property in Dogok-dong.

866
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:18,088
You heard this and complimented him
by saying, "You are too generous."

867
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:22,384
It wasn't a compliment.

868
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:25,095
I just spoke the truth.

869
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:29,015
It's not easy to give land
worth tens of billions of won,

870
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,810
no matter how much you like
your granddaughter-in-law.

871
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:36,398
So you were aware of the fact
that Mr. Hong Ju-myeong promised to

872
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:40,318
gift the plaintiff property that is worth
tens of billions of won, right?

873
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,243
Is this correct?

874
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:49,953
Well…

875
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:51,663
Yes.

876
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:04,926
Where are you going?

877
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,094
Your Honor.

878
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:08,763
The plaintiff had special circumstances

879
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:11,683
of a donative promise of land
as a condition of the marriage,

880
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,351
and the defendant knew about this.

881
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,979
Therefore, the plaintiff
asks for 33.2 billion won,

882
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:19,858
which is the appraised worth
of the property she would've gained

883
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:22,068
if it weren't
for the defendant's negligence

884
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,653
as compensation from the defendant.

885
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:28,658
Please allow the change of the purpose
and the cause of the claim.

886
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:30,368
Well…

887
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:32,454
I see no reason not to.

888
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:35,123
Submit the change application in writing.

889
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:36,374
Yes, sir.

890
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:44,049
Is there nothing else
that needs to be said today?

891
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:45,884
-Then…
-I do!

892
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,768
Plaintiff, do you have something to say?

893
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,688
I would like to withdraw the lawsuit.

894
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:01,649
Excuse me?

895
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,030
I'm withdrawing the lawsuit.

896
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:10,700
Wait.

897
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,420
How do I put a stop to this?

898
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:27,258
What do I have to do to drop the charges?

899
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,677
The word "charge"
is only used in criminal cases.

900
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:32,722
In this case, you should say
"to withdraw the lawsuit."

901
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:36,601
Okay, so how do I withdraw the lawsuit?

902
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:39,229
Withdrawal is still considered a win,
so the commission fee is very high.

903
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:40,355
Are you okay with that?

904
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:44,067
Yes, of course.
I'm not worried about the money.

905
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:46,736
There are two ways. Which one--

906
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:47,821
The simple one.

907
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:51,199
Say, "I would like to
withdraw the lawsuit"

908
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:52,700
to the judge during the trial.

909
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:55,745
That's it?

910
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:57,997
Yes.

911
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:00,375
That's easy.

912
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:01,960
Yes.

913
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:04,963
Why didn't I do this sooner?

914
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:11,886
Because you weren't psychologically
independent from your father.

915
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,640
Those were Attorney Kwon's words.

916
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:17,016
In Attorney Kwon's eyes,

917
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,602
I would seem that way as well.

918
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:25,108
Have you ever prepared
a meal on your own, Ms. Kim?

919
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:32,907
Who said you could withdraw the lawsuit?

920
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,159
What are you doing?

921
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,369
Who said you could withdraw?

922
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,871
The plaintiff.

923
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,289
Calm down and take a seat.

924
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:40,874
Take a seat.

925
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:45,587
Plaintiff, if you withdraw the lawsuit,
it will be as if you never made

926
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,172
the initial claim.

927
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,090
Do you still wish to withdraw?

928
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:51,301
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

929
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:54,679
Defendant, do you agree
to the withdrawal of the lawsuit?

930
00:57:58,391 --> 00:57:59,809
Yes, I agree.

931
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:04,647
The lawsuit is closed
as the plaintiff withdrew the lawsuit.

932
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:05,773
Court is adjourned.

933
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,785
What do you think you're doing?

934
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,913
Are you determined
to humiliate your father?

935
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:24,250
My tattoo.

936
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:27,295
I didn't get it as a joke
when I was immature.

937
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:30,465
I'm Buddhist.

938
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:32,175
What?

939
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:34,469
I even have a Buddhist name. Bo Deok-sim.

940
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,305
It means the heart of Guanyin Bodhisattva.

941
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:38,932
What is she saying?

942
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:41,059
Are you kidding me?

943
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:42,519
It's my lawsuit,

944
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:45,271
my marriage, and my life.

945
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,940
You little…

946
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,817
-Calm down, Chairman.
-Do you know why I'm having a hard time?

947
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:52,403
Or why I'm seeing a psychiatrist?

948
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,198
You'll always be oblivious.

949
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:59,118
We've been inseparable for the past
ten years, yet you don't even have a clue.

950
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:03,373
She isn't just my friend.

951
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,292
She's not just my school friend.

952
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:13,424
Bride and groom, march!

953
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:44,998
If I have to get married,

954
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,292
it'll be with her.

955
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:53,381
With the person I love.

956
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:01,931
-Chairman.
-Chairman.

957
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,057
That way.

958
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:05,059
That way.

959
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:37,592
What happened?

960
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:39,093
Did you empty your bowels?

961
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:41,721
You missed something amazing.

962
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:44,265
What is it? What happened?

963
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,267
It was great.

964
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:47,435
Yes, it was.

965
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:48,978
What was?

966
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:51,356
Tell me!

967
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:07,246
Hello, ma'am.

968
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,374
Hey. You can sit and eat.

969
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:10,625
Come sit over here.

970
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:12,251
I'm sorry for being so late.

971
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,962
-Did you eat?
-Yes, I did.

972
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:21,886
What are you two eating?

973
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:24,347
I keep having an upset stomach.

974
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:25,932
So I'm having crabmeat porridge.

975
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:29,435
I like seaweed sushi,
so I'm eating seaweed sushi.

976
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:32,313
I mean…

977
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:34,982
I understand, but still.

978
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:36,901
It's my treat today.

979
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:38,778
And you're eating crabmeat porridge
and seaweed sushi

980
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:41,072
instead of the 300,000 won course meal?

981
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:43,783
Our team is very…

982
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:46,077
colorful.

983
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,621
Yes, colorful indeed.

984
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:51,582
Enjoy your food.

985
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:54,293
Anyway, you all did well.

986
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:56,212
It was an absurd request,

987
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:58,756
but you all did your best
and came up with a solution.

988
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,634
I wish we could've pushed it
all the way to settlement.

989
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:02,635
It's a shame.

990
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,220
That's not our fault.

991
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:06,347
It's the daughter who changed her mind.

992
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:09,684
But Chairman Kim must've
been impressed by your dedication.

993
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:11,686
He gave us new cases.

994
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:13,104
Let's do great from now on.

995
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:14,647
Is that right? That's good.

996
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:17,775
Well done, everyone. Let's keep it up.

997
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:19,360
Shall we drink to it?

998
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:20,987
Good work.

999
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,405
-Good work!
-Good work!

1000
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:23,448
Good work.

1001
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:24,949
Thank you for the food.

1002
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:27,118
You don't have to drink if you can't.

1003
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:46,596
Attorney Woo!

1004
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:11,829
Goodness.

1005
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:13,289
I'm home.

1006
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:14,749
You're back.

1007
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:17,794
Hey, I almost died from being hungry.

1008
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,504
What is this?

1009
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:22,715
It was a restaurant where the course
meal was 300,000 won per person.

1010
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,717
Goodness. Really?

1011
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:31,098
My daughter bought home food for her dad.

1012
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:34,018
I can't believe I lived to see this day.

1013
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:37,230
I'm all grown now.

1014
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:40,566
Let's see.

1015
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,532
My goodness.

1016
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:49,283
My Young-woo

1017
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:51,494
bought seaweed sushi.

1018
01:03:52,119 --> 01:03:55,206
-Yes.
-For her dad who made gimbap all day,

1019
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:57,291
she bought seaweed sushi.

1020
01:03:58,376 --> 01:03:59,627
Yes.

1021
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:03,506
At a restaurant that sells
300,000 won course meals,

1022
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:04,632
my Young-woo

1023
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,009
bought seaweed sushi.

1024
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:09,303
Yes, enjoy.

1025
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:27,154
It's highly likely that I won't be able to
get married since I have autism.

1026
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:34,120
But if I ever do meet a person I love
and have a wedding,

1027
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:36,747
we will walk down the aisle together.

1028
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:39,917
Not have you walk me down the aisle
then hand me off to my partner.

1029
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:42,211
Because I would be
getting married as an adult.

1030
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,048
Right.

1031
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:47,008
Really?

1032
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:50,970
Instead, I will give you the bouquet.

1033
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:52,513
What?

1034
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:55,391
Because as a single father,
you've never been married before.

1035
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:58,269
After I get married,
I would prefer for you to get married

1036
01:04:58,352 --> 01:05:00,229
than for you to live alone.

1037
01:05:03,357 --> 01:05:04,442
My Young-woo,

1038
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:07,028
you've been thinking a lot, haven't you?

1039
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:09,155
Yes. I'm going to go shower.

1040
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:03,751
My time as the CEO
of Taesan Law Firm has been valuable.

1041
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:08,714
But the thought of going back to
being an active attorney in the field

1042
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,508
makes my heart race.

1043
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:12,218
It feels as if I'm getting younger.

1044
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:16,013
You say that, but you voluntarily
resigned from the position.

1045
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:18,391
That's a very brave
and respectful decision.

1046
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:21,268
With Taesan being the number one
law firm in the country,

1047
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:22,979
I think your decision will set

1048
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:25,690
a good example to other
law firms that haven't been able to

1049
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:27,566
break away from a hereditary structure.

1050
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:31,654
I'm extremely proud
of my father for founding Taesan

1051
01:06:32,446 --> 01:06:36,117
and I'm grateful to have followed
in his footsteps to become an attorney.

1052
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:41,706
But I have no intention of forcing
my own son to walk the same path as us.

1053
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,041
What is your son's dream?

1054
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:49,088
I'm not sure. I think
he's taking his time to find one.

1055
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:52,842
From a mother's perspective,
it can be frustrating

1056
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:54,844
because he's on his computer all the time.

1057
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:57,972
I think that's enough for the interview.

1058
01:06:58,597 --> 01:07:00,599
Thank you so much for your time today.

1059
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:04,395
I'll count on you to write a good article.
I mean, you always do.

1060
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:06,313
Of course. I'll see you next time.

1061
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:07,606
-Thank you.
-Yes.

1062
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:08,774
Good work today.

1063
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:21,954
Chairman Kim Jeong-gu
withdrew all of the cases he had with us.

1064
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:24,415
To switch to Hanbada.

1065
01:07:24,498 --> 01:07:25,499
Why?

1066
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:30,046
Is he still upset that we didn't
get him that one billion won compensation?

1067
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:32,006
Yes, it seems like it.

1068
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:34,467
Jeez, that man.

1069
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,385
Changing law firms won't change that.

1070
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:39,472
Did Hanbada say
they'll get the money for him?

1071
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:41,015
Well…

1072
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:42,016
No way.

1073
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:42,975
Did they…

1074
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,770
say they will get him a billion won?

1075
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:49,315
Apparently, they even said
33.2 billion won is possible.

1076
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:56,405
PLAINTIFF'S ATTORNEY
HANBADA LAW FIRM, ATTORNEY WOO YOUNG-WOO

1077
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:58,491
Woo young-woo? Who's Woo Young-woo?

1078
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:00,242
Their rookie attorney.

1079
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:09,001
There was a donative promise of land
as a condition of the marriage.

1080
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:11,962
And they're arguing
for special damages based on that.

1081
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:13,923
This is interesting.

1082
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:16,509
Just the idea a rookie would have.

1083
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:19,095
How did we miss
bringing in someone like her?

1084
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:21,305
Should I check if she
applied to Taesan as well?

1085
01:08:22,139 --> 01:08:24,016
No, that's not necessary.

1086
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,935
What should we do about Chairman Kim?

1087
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:28,145
Let him go since he says he's leaving.

1088
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:31,315
When something upsets him at Hanbada,
I'm sure he'll come back to us.

1089
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:43,619
HANBADA LAW FIRM
ATTORNEY WOO YOUNG-WOO

1090
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:54,130
But it seems as though the younger son
beat the older son to death.

1091
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:56,799
And the Chairman
and his wife witnessed it themselves.

1092
01:08:58,050 --> 01:08:59,385
Do you know what he's saying?

1093
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:02,555
I have to communicate with a 21-year-old
autistic man, but it's difficult.

1094
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:03,597
What should I do?

1095
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:04,557
-Peng-ha!
-Peng-ha!

1096
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:05,808
You be quiet!

1097
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:07,434
You're autistic yourself!

1098
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:11,605
I'm asking whether or not the defendant's
attorney, Woo Young-woo, has autism.

1099
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:13,149
Attorney Woo!

1100
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:18,696
I'm not an attorney
who is helpful to the defendant.

1101
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:23,784
