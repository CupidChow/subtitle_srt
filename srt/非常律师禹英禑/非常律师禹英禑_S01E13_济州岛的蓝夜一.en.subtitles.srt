1
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,822
Hello, Mr. Woo.

2
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:14,824
Hello.

3
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,745
What brings you here
this early in the morning?

4
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,331
We're here because I heard
there's an attorney here.

5
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,290
Excuse me?

6
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,250
This is my father.

7
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:28,546
I told him one of my tenants
is an attorney and he wanted to meet them.

8
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,756
Right.

9
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:30,840
-Hello.
-Hello.

10
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,176
My daughter is an attorney, but…

11
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,678
Why do you want to meet her?

12
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,476
Miss, are you the attorney?

13
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:45,271
I'm Attorney Woo Young-woo
of Hanbada Law Firm.

14
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,689
Whether it's read straight or flipped,
it's still Woo Young-woo.

15
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,275
Kayak, deed, rotator,
noon, racecar, Woo Young-woo.

16
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,529
Gosh, you're so clever.

17
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,781
This is the first time
I'm seeing your daughter.

18
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:58,326
I heard she's a genius who graduated
summa cum laude from SNU.

19
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,370
Is there really a law
that states that even those

20
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,248
who did not visit a cultural heritage
must pay the admission fee?

21
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:04,916
Excuse me?

22
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:07,585
Why don't you take a seat first?

23
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,589
Gosh, you see…

24
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,175
Recently,

25
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,594
my father moved.

26
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:21,015
So I visited to see his new house.

27
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:25,061
We were driving on the road
toward Hanbaek Mountain

28
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:29,899
when this man came out of nowhere
and blocked our car.

29
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,902
He said a temple called Hwangjisa
is a famous cultural heritage site

30
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,864
and that we should pay
the cultural heritage admission fee.

31
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,783
Cultural heritage admission fee?

32
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,911
Yes, so we told him

33
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,706
that we were on our way
to Hanbaek Mountain, not Hwangjisa.

34
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,000
So why would we pay admission fees

35
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,210
when we're not even
going to see Hwangjisa?

36
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,378
Goodness.

37
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,755
Then this man went on to say

38
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:56,092
that it's legal to collect admission fees.

39
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,468
Is this true?

40
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,847
The act of collecting
admission fees itself is legal.

41
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,099
"Article 49 of the
Cultural Heritage Protection Act."

42
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,977
"An owner of any State-designated
cultural heritage

43
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,271
who opens it to the public
may collect admission fees from visitors."

44
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,983
So we still have to pay the admission fee
even though we didn't see it?

45
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,277
Just because we were near it?

46
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,112
Well…

47
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:20,116
That is debatable.

48
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,830
If I go to trial with this,
will I get my money back?

49
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,374
How much was the admission fee?

50
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,169
Three thousand won per person.

51
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,921
Then even if you win,

52
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,632
the money you will receive
will also be 3,000 won.

53
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,800
It will cost much more to file a lawsuit,

54
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,761
so going through with it would be a loss.

55
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,262
That's what I said.

56
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,056
Father, you heard her, right?

57
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,099
The attorney said it'd be a loss.

58
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,185
If they were being reasonable,

59
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,604
I wouldn't mind paying 3,000 won
or even 300 million won.

60
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:52,649
But they're not being reasonable at all.

61
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,359
They brought up the law first,

62
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,277
so I'm going to retaliate using the law.

63
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,197
Regardless of how much the lawsuit costs,

64
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:04,118
I want my 3,000 won back,
even if that means going to trial.

65
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:08,248
Then I'll have to look into
the details of the case.

66
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,166
Where is Hwangjisa located?

67
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,961
It's a temple on Hanbaek Mountain at Jeju.

68
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,798
-What?
-It's on Jeju Island.

69
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,634
Jeju Island?

70
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,971
Where Sampal, Chunsam,
and Boksun were released

71
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,722
due to a Supreme Court ruling

72
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:28,017
after being trapped in an aquarium
and forced to perform dolphin shows,

73
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,354
and are now swimming with baby dolphins?

74
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,231
Yes.

75
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:35,942
Yes.

76
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:46,119
CASE 13
THE BLUE NIGHT OF JEJU I

77
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:52,792
DEPARTMENT OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTION TESTS

78
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,307
Mr. Jung Myeong-seok?

79
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,100
Yes.

80
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,395
You came for your test results, right?

81
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,604
Yes.

82
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,356
You can go on in.

83
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,316
Okay.

84
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,804
Right, we were supposed to have
a meeting today.

85
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:47,847
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,936
Yes, come in.

87
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,491
May I go on a business trip?

88
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,658
A business trip?

89
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,036
Where to?

90
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,663
Jeju Island.

91
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:16,834
Where Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins
live in the nearby ocean.

92
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,754
Specifically, Daejeong-eup, Seogwipo-si,
where baby dolphins are often spotted

93
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,798
and is known to be
the main habitat for dolphins

94
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,091
where they raise their young--

95
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:24,509
That's enough.

96
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,053
What's the case?

97
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,347
-What's the case about?
-Right.

98
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,600
A claim for a return of undue profits.

99
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,519
The claim is for the return
of the 3,000 won that Hwangjisa,

100
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,437
a temple on Hanbaek Mountain in Jeju,

101
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,898
collected from a passerby
as a cultural heritage admission fee.

102
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,066
Three thousand won?

103
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,569
Gosh, a belly button
bigger than the belly.

104
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:50,993
Are you okay?

105
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,538
How did you get this case?

106
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,791
How did I get it?

107
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,459
Who is the client?

108
00:06:59,085 --> 00:06:59,919
Right.

109
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,839
Mr. Kim Yeong-bok, the father
of the landlady of the building

110
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,257
that my father and I live in.

111
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,760
He made it clear that he doesn't care
how much the lawsuit costs.

112
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,053
Is that so?

113
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,223
Then…

114
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,977
Why don't we go to Jeju?

115
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,524
You're also going to go?

116
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,068
Why don't we all go?

117
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,571
It's fate that we're
all here together right now.

118
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,156
-What?
-What?

119
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:29,824
Sounds good, right?

120
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:34,203
We can move around our schedules
to make time, right?

121
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,872
It's not like anyone here
is busier than I am.

122
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,249
No, but…

123
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,292
Jun-ho.

124
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:40,793
You should come too.

125
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,754
I'll speak to the team leader
of the litigation team.

126
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,798
Right, well…

127
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,341
Okay.

128
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:51,220
Then, Attorney Woo,
go ahead and take the case

129
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,723
and share the schedule for Jeju
when everything's set.

130
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,766
All right.

131
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:05,902
What? Right, the meeting.

132
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:11,699
Boat tours that chase dolphins to see them

133
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,285
eventually reduce the dolphin population.

134
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,245
Because their fins can get hurt

135
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,789
and the birth rate goes down
due to the stress.

136
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:22,293
In other words, these businesses
are abusing endangered animals

137
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,754
under the guise of tourism.

138
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:25,963
Attorney Woo.

139
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,300
I'm still upset with you.

140
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,593
What?

141
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:35,431
Right.

142
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,350
Because I said last time

143
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,394
that we're not dating yet?

144
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,729
Yes.

145
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,689
Right.

146
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,691
With that being said,

147
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,860
when we go to Jeju

148
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,780
let’s not just see
Sampal, Chunsam, and Boksun.

149
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,658
Let's go see Seung-hui and Jeong-nam too.

150
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,369
Seung-hui and Jeong-nam?

151
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,205
Yes. Those are the names
of my older sister and her husband.

152
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:00,957
They live in Jeju.

153
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,714
Then we'll proceed with it as you said.

154
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:09,840
All right.

155
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,176
I almost forgot.

156
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,346
About the Hwangjisa case.

157
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,264
Yes?

158
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:20,017
Do you have to go to Jeju too?

159
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,895
The claim for that case is only 3,000 won.

160
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,105
Right.

161
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:27,400
The amount is small,
but we're getting a proper commission.

162
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:32,697
But to go to Jeju just for that
is a bit inconvenient.

163
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,033
Should I hand over this case
to Attorney Jang?

164
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,411
He happens to have
a few Jeju cases right now,

165
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,829
so he can take this--

166
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,205
I'll go.

167
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,375
Are you sure?

168
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:48,796
I know it's a small claims case,
but you never know.

169
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,300
Sometimes small cases become big cases
and can even become new cases.

170
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,885
I'll do my best to earn my keep

171
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,388
since I'm taking
several rookie attorneys with me.

172
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,472
Don’t worry.

173
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,311
Attorney Jung, something seems…

174
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,521
different about you.

175
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,522
I wonder why.

176
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,320
You flatter me.

177
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:18,451
Then have a good trip to Jeju.
Enjoy the food there too.

178
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,202
Yes, ma'am.

179
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:28,085
So you said you guys aren't dating yet
and Jun-ho got upset?

180
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,086
Yes.

181
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,089
Then tell him you're dating now.
Problem solved.

182
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,883
Well…

183
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,260
Why? You don't want to date him?

184
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,388
It's not that, but…

185
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,310
-What is dating?
-What?

186
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,939
Jun-ho and I have lunch together every day

187
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,776
and go home together
unless we work overtime.

188
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,778
We also go on dates on our days off.

189
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,156
Sounds like you're having a good time.

190
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:00,868
If we officially date, what changes?

191
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,164
Meeting Jun-ho's sister
and brother-in-law?

192
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,583
-So what I'm trying to say is--
-Wait.

193
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,752
You're meeting his sister
and brother-in-law?

194
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:10,795
Yes.

195
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,130
I'm meeting them
during the business trip to Jeju.

196
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,174
-Jun-ho's sister and brother-in-law--
-Wait.

197
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,676
Business trip to Jeju?
You're going to Jeju?

198
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,470
-Yes.
-With who?

199
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,972
Jun-ho, Attorney Jung,

200
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,474
Attorney Kwon, and Su-yeon.

201
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,392
Kwon Min-woo?

202
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,144
-The good-looking guy?
-What?

203
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,773
I see Su-yeon is also going.

204
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,066
Hold on.

205
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,068
How should I explain this to you?

206
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,195
What are you talking about?

207
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:39,240
She's going to meet his family
while they're in Jeju for a business trip.

208
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,658
She's doing just fine on her own.

209
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,535
Yes, that.

210
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,371
You do know this isn’t just casual, right?

211
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,164
Not casual?

212
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:51,544
This isn’t simply meeting
Jun-ho's sister and brother-in-law.

213
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:55,047
There's a lot that you should be aware of
when meeting future in-laws.

214
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,633
What should I be aware of?

215
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:00,386
First off, say things
that they would want to hear.

216
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,391
When you enter their house,
"Gosh, your house is hella gorgeous."

217
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,726
When they serve you food,

218
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,440
"Gosh, this is freaking delicious.
Your cooking is great."

219
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,358
And when they give you fruit,

220
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:18,696
"I'll do it. I'm great at peeling fruit."

221
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:20,948
Like this.

222
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,619
Those are like lines
straight out of old soap operas.

223
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,247
Well, it's because I heard them
in old soap operas.

224
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:33,502
Anyway, whatever you say,
it really depends on the situation.

225
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:37,965
Most of all, you have to really
enjoy the food that they give you.

226
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,676
You can't ask for gimbap, okay?

227
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,802
No whale talk either.

228
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:45,264
Don't ask for gimbap
and no talking about whales.

229
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:49,351
Good. And most importantly
you have to be lively.

230
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,063
Just keep smiling.

231
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,231
Smile.

232
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,942
Smile.

233
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,360
Yes, try it again.

234
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,320
Smile.

235
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,697
You're close.

236
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,699
So cute.

237
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:04,658
Wait.

238
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,244
Why aren't we going
on a business trip to Jeju?

239
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,497
Why would we?

240
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,248
We should go on a business trip too.

241
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,625
Business trip, my foot.

242
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,586
What if customers come while we're gone?

243
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,796
What on earth are you talking about?

244
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,674
She's the only customer we ever have.

245
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,886
Our only customer is going to Jeju
and you're just going to stay here?

246
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,679
We have to go with her.

247
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,431
-We're not going.
-Let's go.

248
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,933
-We're not going.
-Why not?

249
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,476
-I don't want to.
-Let's go!

250
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,188
-No!
-Let's go to Jeju! Business trip!

251
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,150
I know. Jedol.

252
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,402
That was too easy.

253
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,988
The number "one" is right there
on its dorsal fin.

254
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,366
It was a practice question.

255
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,411
Chunsam?

256
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,788
Wrong.

257
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:52,915
Give me a hint.

258
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,250
Well…

259
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,628
This was the first out of the ones
that have been released from captivity

260
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:01,090
that was confirmed
to have successfully bred out in the wild.

261
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,051
You told me this before.
What's its name again?

262
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,763
It has a unique scar below its dorsal fin.

263
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,723
Was it Sam…

264
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:10,975
What are you two doing?

265
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:11,934
Hey.

266
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,938
We're training to identify dolphins
by the shape of their dorsal fins.

267
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,440
We're going to see
Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins.

268
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,734
We should be able to tell them apart.

269
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,821
-Attorney Kwon, would you like to join?
-No.

270
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,781
-What about you, Su-yeon?
-No.

271
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,067
You're all here.

272
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,946
Attorney Jung, you look so cool.

273
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,281
You think so?

274
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,909
Do I look cool?

275
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:12,828
Hey!

276
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,955
Woo to the Young to the woo!

277
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,832
Dong to the Geu to the Ra-mi

278
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,768
Mr. Woo? No, you're not.

279
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,895
Gosh, long time no see.

280
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,650
We're going on a business trip too.
A business trip to Jeju for Hairy's Pub.

281
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:46,654
This is Mr. Hairy Boss.

282
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,948
Hello.

283
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:52,242
My name is Kim Min-sik of Hairy's Pub,

284
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,536
and I'll be your chef for this trip.

285
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,246
Hello.

286
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,582
Min-sik, it's been a while.

287
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,250
Right.

288
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:04,171
Are they coming with us
on the business trip?

289
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,006
Well…

290
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,466
Is that how it is?

291
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,634
What?

292
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,888
Well, who cares.

293
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,932
Ms. Dong Geu-ran, why don't you join us?

294
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,226
Yes!

295
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,814
Jeju.

296
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,858
-Jeju.
-Stop it. Now stop.

297
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,444
-Jeju.
-Stop it. Let's go.

298
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,404
Let's go.

299
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,321
That's a cute hat.

300
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,747
Let's get away

301
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:40,624
Together

302
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:45,045
Let's leave everything behind

303
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,839
Under the stars

304
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,383
Of the blue night of Jeju

305
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,303
From now on

306
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,140
I don't want

307
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:59,560
To be tied up anymore

308
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,187
Under the stars of the blue night…

309
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,480
Moving to another country?

310
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,233
It's just a trip to Jeju.
What's with the big suitcase?

311
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,527
If you're not going to help,
get out of my way.

312
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,653
I'll help you.

313
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:11,613
What?

314
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,583
Aren't you going to sit?

315
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,376
I am.

316
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,132
I don't get what we're all doing.
I'm already busy as it is.

317
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:34,261
We're calling it a business trip, but
isn't this an excuse to go on a vacation?

318
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,846
Even Attorney Woo's friends are here.

319
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,765
It's not too late to get off.

320
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,850
If you're so busy, why did you even come?

321
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:43,312
Why would I skip out on this opportunity?
The firm is paying for this trip.

322
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,236
Rather than the brick walls
Of an apartment

323
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,741
I prefer a window
Where you can see the ocean

324
00:17:55,824 --> 00:18:01,163
Let's tend to the kumquat
And tangerine orchid together

325
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,998
Sir, could you please fold the table?

326
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:03,999
I'm sorry.

327
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:09,296
The airplane is one of the safest
transportation methods

328
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,339
invented by mankind.

329
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,591
The possibility of dying
in an airplane accident

330
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,927
is only one-sixty-fifth
of that of a car accident.

331
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,845
The possibility of an airplane accident

332
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,014
is merely 1 out of 120,000 flights,

333
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,808
and the possibility of dying
in an airplane accident

334
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,684
is 1 out of 11 million people.

335
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,813
You should still
put your seatbelt on right.

336
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,231
Okay.

337
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,709
Are you okay? Do you want the headphones?

338
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,878
No. Yes.

339
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:51,755
What?

340
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,300
Planes are so scary.

341
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,428
What? You just said
it's the safest transportation method.

342
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,277
This is weird.

343
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,280
Planes are so weird.

344
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,127
GUREUM CAR RENTAL

345
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,176
That's the car we rented.

346
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,222
Ours is that one.

347
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,394
Yes!

348
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,271
Awesome!

349
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,073
I want to…

350
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,328
-ride in that one.
-Hairy's the best.

351
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,496
-What?
-Hairy's the best.

352
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,249
We're all headed to
Haengbok Noodles, right?

353
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,167
Yes.

354
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,877
First, we're taking
Local Highway Number 3008

355
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,003
which leads to Hwangjisa,

356
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,172
and then we’ll go
to the meat noodle restaurant

357
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,049
you recommended from there.

358
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,510
Then, that means
I can ride in that car, right?

359
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,512
Right? Yes, okay.

360
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:23,472
Mr. Hairy.

361
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:24,932
I'm coming with you.

362
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,230
You're so good at that. Me too.

363
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,690
I should have gotten a van
with an open roof too.

364
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:34,816
That's impossible.

365
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,902
There are no vans with open roofs.

366
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:38,737
Right.

367
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,424
-Let's get away
-Let's get away

368
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,884
-Together
-Together

369
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,262
-Let's leave everything behind
-Let's leave everything behind

370
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,846
-Behind!
-Under the stars

371
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,390
-Jeju!
-Of the blue night

372
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,268
-Blue night!
-Of Jeju

373
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,770
-Rather than the brick walls
-Rather than the brick walls

374
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,313
-Of an apartment
-Of an apartment

375
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,065
-I prefer a window
-I prefer a window

376
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,109
-Where you can see the ocean
-I prefer!

377
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,527
Let's tend…

378
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,280
-Three omegi-tteok for 1,800 won
-Four hundred won

379
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,157
Three omegi-tteok for 1,800 won

380
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,075
Jungwon Roasted Chicken

381
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,660
Jungwon Roasted Chicken
There are three chicken legs

382
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:30,163
Eighteen thousand won

383
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:33,250
HWANGJISA TICKET BOOTH

384
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,253
HWANGJISA TICKET BOOTH

385
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,425
DO NOT ENTER

386
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,972
Hello. I'm collecting the cultural
heritage admission fees for Hwangjisa.

387
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,599
It's 3,000 won per person
and there are 4 of you.

388
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:50,851
That will be 12,000 won.

389
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,937
We're not going to Hwangjisa.
Do we still have to pay?

390
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,231
Yes, you have to pay to get on this road.

391
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,607
This is a lawful collection.

392
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,903
A lawful collection? Based on what law?

393
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,739
The Cultural Heritage Protection Act.

394
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,741
Gosh, you're holding up
the car behind you.

395
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,451
Just hurry and pay 12,000 won.

396
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,453
"Article 49 of the
Cultural Heritage Protection Act."

397
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:12,456
"An owner of any State-designated
cultural heritage

398
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,666
who opens it to the public
may collect admission fees from visitors."

399
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,667
Is this what you're referring to?

400
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:17,878
According to the Cultural Heritage Act,

401
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:20,422
you can collect admission fees
from visitors.

402
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,133
We said we don't have
any intention to visit Hwangjisa,

403
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,093
yet you're going to collect from us?

404
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,722
Well, how am I supposed to know
whether you're going to visit or not

405
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,099
based on what you tell me?

406
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:36,438
Hwangjisa is a huge temple
with three smaller temples within it.

407
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:40,984
It's that big,
and I can't just follow you around

408
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:45,322
and check if you visit or not.

409
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:49,743
Then you should install the ticket booth
right in front of Hwangjisa.

410
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,286
Goodness.

411
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,955
We’ve been collecting
admission fees here for years.

412
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:58,418
The government is aware that Hwangjisa's
ticket booth is here and has permitted it.

413
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:01,755
If you have a problem with it,
you can turn around and go back.

414
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,090
How are we supposed to?

415
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,050
This road doesn't even allow a U-turn.

416
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,469
Then pay up.

417
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,553
Gosh.

418
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,264
Wait, hang on.

419
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,392
What are you doing? Are you filming?

420
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,852
Are you serious?

421
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:16,853
Open the window.

422
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,065
Open the window.

423
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,235
Hey.

424
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,319
Open it more.

425
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:25,946
What are you filming? Let me see.

426
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:27,864
What are you doing?

427
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,284
You said this is a paid tourist spot.
But we're not allowed to film?

428
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,954
Let me see if you filmed this place or me.

429
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,832
-We said we didn't film you so why--
-Okay. Fine.

430
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,209
Since you're not letting us through,
we'll pay.

431
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,669
How much was it again?

432
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,795
It's 12,000 won.

433
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,673
-Receipt, please.
-Right.

434
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,593
Here's your card.

435
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,345
Thank you.

436
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:57,769
I'm collecting the cultural heritage
admission fees for Hwangjisa.

437
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,437
It's 3,000 won per person.

438
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,606
-But…
-I'll pay for this.

439
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,400
Here you go.

440
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,820
-Goodness.
-Okay.

441
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,282
Yes, thank you.

442
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,326
This isn't easy.

443
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,495
Unless you make an illegal U-turn,

444
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,331
there's no way
to get through without paying.

445
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:30,969
ROAD TO HWANGJISA

446
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,527
It's beautiful.

447
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:49,696
It's beautiful.

448
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,452
It's so pretty.

449
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,167
Wait? Isn't that Haengun Noodles?

450
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:47,379
HAENGUN NOODLES

451
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:51,216
The place we're headed to
is Haengbok Noodles and it’s further in.

452
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:52,759
Right.

453
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:55,136
Haengbok, Haengun…

454
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,513
Gosh, this is confusing.

455
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:00,558
Haengbok Noodles must be
better than Haengun Noodles.

456
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,519
To me it was.

457
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:06,106
But Haengun Noodles
seems to have more customers.

458
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,109
I'm so hungry.

459
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:21,413
Hurry.

460
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,714
Gosh. They're not open.

461
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,757
HAENGBOK NOODLES
MEAT NOODLES

462
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,718
It looks like it's been closed
for quite some time.

463
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:35,677
Maybe they went out of business?

464
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,594
CLOSED FOR THE TIME BEING
WE'RE SORRY

465
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:40,765
There was a place called Haengun Noodles
on the way here. Should we go there?

466
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,434
Goodness.

467
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,311
Haengbok Noodles
makes the best meat noodles.

468
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,147
-Is this place that good?
-Well…

469
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,942
"Bejigeun" is an expression used
in the Jeju dialect.

470
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,820
It's used to describe meat broth
that is rich and greasy

471
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,488
while having a great, deep flavor.

472
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,949
Their soup is exactly like that.

473
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:04,039
The flavor is deep, rich, and heavy,
but without the smell of pork.

474
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,792
That bejigeun soup is their secret recipe.

475
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:11,588
Hearing you talk about it
really makes me want to try the broth.

476
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:15,342
And the owner was very generous
with the amount of meat he gave.

477
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:18,553
He gave a lot of huge chunks
of boiled pork with the noodles.

478
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:22,974
It was literally
half meat and half noodles.

479
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,642
But they're closed.

480
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:28,146
Let's just go to Haengun Noodles.
I'm starving.

481
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,109
Sure. We'll just have to go there.

482
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,171
Hello. I'm collecting the cultural
heritage admission fees for Hwangjisa.

483
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:56,049
It's 3,000 won per person
and there are 4 of you.

484
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,258
That will be 12,000 won.

485
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,011
We're not going to Hwangjisa.
Do we still have to pay?

486
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,971
Yes, you have to pay to get on this road.

487
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,348
This is a lawful collection.

488
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,975
We said we don't have
any intention to visit Hwangjisa,

489
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,144
yet you're going to collect from us?

490
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:11,231
We’ve been collecting
admission fees here for years.

491
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:15,026
If you have a problem with it,
you can turn around and go back.

492
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,154
How are we supposed to?
This road doesn't even allow a U-turn.

493
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,323
-Then pay up.
-What…

494
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,491
Gosh.

495
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,326
What are you doing?

496
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,703
Are you filming?

497
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,873
-What are you doing?
-What are you filming? Let me see.

498
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,876
You said this is a paid tourist spot.
But we're not allowed to film?

499
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:59,154
This was filmed when the plaintiff's
counselors were passing by

500
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,488
the Hwangjisa ticket booth.

501
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,408
It's similar to what the plaintiff,
Mr. Kim Yeong-bok, experienced.

502
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:06,453
Despite clearly stating
that they wouldn't be visiting Hwangjisa,

503
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,037
the admission fees were collected

504
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,708
in a threatening manner
without a convincing explanation.

505
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,587
The fee collector's manner
might have been a bit overbearing

506
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:19,215
but Hwangjisa is lawfully collecting
cultural heritage admission fees

507
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,676
based on Article 49
of the Cultural Heritage Protection Act.

508
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,845
According to Article 49
of the Cultural Heritage Protection Act

509
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,222
admission fees may be collected
from visitors.

510
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,266
The plaintiff was not a visitor.

511
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,769
He had no intention to visit
any cultural heritage that Hwangjisa owns

512
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,645
nor did he actually visit them.

513
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,565
The plaintiff was merely a passerby

514
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,192
who just happened to be on
Local Highway Number 3008.

515
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,528
Your Honor, could you please
look at this map?

516
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:45,074
Everything inside the red lines
is under Hwangjisa's control.

517
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,076
A large portion
of Hanbaek Mountain National Park

518
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:51,915
that Local Highway Number 3008
passes through is owned by Hwangjisa.

519
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:55,543
Is the defendant's counselor admitting
that Hwangjisa has been collecting

520
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,505
toll fees under the guise
of cultural heritage admission fees?

521
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:02,967
Local Highway Number 3008
is a tourist road that was built

522
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:06,095
so that people who were visiting Korea
for the 1988 Seoul Olympics

523
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:09,724
could conveniently tour the area
around Hwangjisa on Hanbaek Mountain.

524
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,310
People use roads just to use them.

525
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:16,439
They don't look into the original purpose
of why the road was built before using it.

526
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,776
The plaintiff just drove
following the directions of his GPS.

527
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,445
He did not choose the road
with the intention

528
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:23,947
of visiting the Hwangjisa area.

529
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:24,989
Is that really the case?

530
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,159
When the plaintiff paid, he was aware that

531
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:33,414
he would be given the opportunity
to visit the site that the defendant owns.

532
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,083
What are you saying right now?

533
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,961
Didn't you see what the attorneys filmed?

534
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,921
He appeared out of nowhere
and blocked our way,

535
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,382
telling us to pay 3,000 won each.

536
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:46,678
So I just paid because I didn't want
the trip with my daughter to be ruined.

537
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,559
I understand the positions of both sides.

538
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:55,895
The defendant applied for a witness

539
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:59,482
so we will proceed with this case
and set the next court date.

540
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,901
All rise.

541
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:19,043
Is everyone here from Seoul?

542
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:20,712
Yes.

543
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,089
Have you been to Hwangjisa?

544
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:24,966
No, not yet.

545
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,719
Then would you like to visit today?

546
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:33,182
Today's the day monks at Hwangjisa
give prayer to Ksitigarbha.

547
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,518
Today?

548
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,512
What are you doing?

549
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,246
Get up and bow.

550
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,249
We bow 158 times to offer our sincerity
with utmost conviction and devotion.

551
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,127
Bow 158 times?

552
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,131
-Goodness.
-What? Do what 158 times?

553
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,467
-Bow.
-Bow?

554
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,399
How many more?

555
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,150
We have 155 bows left.

556
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,318
That many?

557
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:18,913
Now it's 154.

558
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,207
You have 155 bows left.

559
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,960
You started later than Attorney Jung.

560
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,298
Why are you keeping track?

561
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,259
Keep going.

562
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,146
Why aren't you bowing?

563
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:46,524
I'm Catholic.

564
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:47,442
Right.

565
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,403
Why aren't you bowing?

566
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,530
I'm also Catholic.

567
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:53,614
Just like that?

568
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,242
What's your baptismal name?

569
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,660
Mine is Gabriel.

570
00:33:59,037 --> 00:33:59,954
Mine is…

571
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,915
-Jennie.
-Je…

572
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,876
What is Jennie…

573
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,336
Are you the Saint of BLACKPINK?

574
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,089
Keep bowing.

575
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,720
The sound of the temple block
keeps making me…

576
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:18,347
-Keeps making you, what?
-It makes me want to move my body.

577
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:19,849
What on earth are you saying?

578
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,528
Why are you…

579
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:44,540
No, stop. Don't do this.

580
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:45,750
Settle down.

581
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:58,387
Local Highway Number 3008
has frequent car accidents.

582
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:04,060
Not only people but also wild animals
often get hit and killed by cars.

583
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,022
Not to mention

584
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:11,150
the countless trees that were cut down

585
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,653
to build the road to begin with.

586
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:17,406
The prayer to Ksitigarbha
that you gave just now

587
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:22,662
is a prayer to comfort the souls
who left this world like that.

588
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:28,376
Because the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva
is the one who leads the dead to paradise.

589
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,003
That’s very meaningful.

590
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:34,215
And you just had to dance
during such a meaningful activity.

591
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,675
What else was I supposed to do

592
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:38,219
when the temple block
was bringing out the moves in me?

593
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,512
Seriously!

594
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:43,391
Sir.

595
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,061
I hear there's a famous
cultural heritage in Hwangjisa.

596
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,522
A famous cultural heritage?

597
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:51,107
Are you talking about
the Gwaebultaeng of Guanyin

598
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,316
that's been designated as a treasure?

599
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,153
Guanyin? Gwaebultaeng? Tang tang?

600
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,863
That's…

601
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:59,782
A Gwaebultaeng is
a large Buddhist hanging painting

602
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:02,785
that is hung in the front garden
of a temple during a ceremony or ritual.

603
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,580
The Gwaebultaeng of Guanyin at Hwangjisa
is a painting of Avalokitesvara

604
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:08,541
and is 10.8 meters in length
and 7.3 meters in width.

605
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,251
It was created in the 14th year
of Jeongjo's reign in the Joseon--

606
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,253
Oh, 10.8.

607
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:14,922
Is that long?

608
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:15,840
Well…

609
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,300
To make it easier for you,

610
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:19,594
it's longer than the average length
of the common minke whale

611
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,596
and shorter than the average length
of Baird's beaked whales.

612
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,389
That’s even harder to understand.

613
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:26,225
And why are you explaining it to us
when the Abbot is here?

614
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:27,643
Right.

615
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,898
I appreciate you explaining it
so that it can be easily understood.

616
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:37,153
Now then, shall we head over
to where the treasure is?

617
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,113
What? We get to see a treasure?

618
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,865
I'm really good at treasure hunting.

619
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,408
What?

620
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,285
Come with me.

621
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:12,813
Would you like to see
if you can find the treasure?

622
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,109
You said it's a painting…

623
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,320
Is it that one?

624
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:23,741
That painting is much shorter
than 10.8 meters.

625
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,869
It's only about the average length
of an Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin.

626
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,872
Gosh, then where could it be?

627
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,256
I don't think there's
a painting that big in here.

628
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,216
There is.

629
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,343
Right over there.

630
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:50,977
This box?

631
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,604
This is called a Gwaebulgwe.

632
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,483
It's a box that stores a Gwaebultaeng.

633
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:01,612
The Gwaebultaeng of Guanyin
is inside this one.

634
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:02,947
I see.

635
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,199
Can we not open it?

636
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:08,536
The Gwaebultaeng of Guanyin
used to be taken out once a year,

637
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,455
on Buddha's Birthday.

638
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:16,502
But since ten years ago, we don't even
take it out for Buddha's Birthday

639
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:19,755
because we're worried
the Gwaebultaeng will be damaged.

640
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,008
It's a national treasure.

641
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,051
We have to take caution
in its preservation.

642
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,303
What?

643
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,305
Then why did you say you'll show it to us?

644
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:30,933
Well, I didn't say I'll show it to you.

645
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,436
I just said let's go
to where the treasure is.

646
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:37,273
What you see isn't everything.

647
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:40,818
Don't be blinded by what you can see.

648
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:45,239
Keep in mind the essence
of what lies beyond that.

649
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,744
That's…

650
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,762
If I cut into this, the pain--

651
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,222
Be quiet. They're all working.

652
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:30,868
Why don't we…

653
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:35,873
What?

654
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,043
Why don't we just hang out?

655
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:42,380
It's our first day in Jeju.
Having a meeting is ridiculous.

656
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,090
Don't you think so?

657
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,133
Olé!

658
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,551
I'm changing the dinner menu

659
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,595
to food that goes well with alcohol.

660
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,515
Then should I get some drinks?

661
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,058
Drinks would be great.

662
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,727
Then I'll come with you.

663
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,605
Why? It's okay.

664
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:02,358
The store seemed quite far.
How will you carry everything?

665
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,152
I can do it on my own.

666
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,446
I'd rather go alone,
even if I have to carry it on my head.

667
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,240
Then carry everything on your head.

668
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:10,533
That'd be a sight.

669
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:15,329
What's going on with you two?
Did you fight?

670
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,372
-No.
-No.

671
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:19,375
Then the two of you should go
since you didn't fight.

672
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,220
No working right now.
We're not having the meeting.

673
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:42,231
Hey.

674
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,109
Do you want to check that out? It's shiny.

675
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,821
But that's the long way back.
They're all waiting for the drinks.

676
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:52,825
Who cares if they wait.
We have the drinks right here.

677
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,711
Shouldn't this be a perk we get?

678
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,546
Hold this.

679
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,393
So annoying.

680
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,249
Stand there. I'll take a picture for you.

681
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,335
No, it's fine. I don't need a picture.

682
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:46,170
Put that down and stand over there.

683
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:47,588
This is so random.

684
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,174
Okay.

685
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,854
You want your picture taken like that?
Your hair looks like a bird's nest.

686
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,690
I don't want my picture taken!

687
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:10,486
Just a moment.

688
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,114
Yes, Father.

689
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,742
That…

690
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:18,661
I'm looking into it.

691
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,372
I'll take care of it one way or another.

692
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:25,125
So don't worry about it
and just take care of yourself.

693
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,210
All right?

694
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:27,795
Okay.

695
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,297
Okay. Good night.

696
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:31,840
Bye.

697
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,765
Why? Is there something wrong?

698
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:44,061
You don't have to concern yourself
with my family's pathetic story, Princess.

699
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,729
What do you mean, "Princess"?

700
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,356
Why would you call me that?

701
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,571
Judge Choi.

702
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,698
He was promoted recently, right?

703
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,367
What? My dad?

704
00:42:58,951 --> 00:42:59,994
He's a Supreme Court Justice now.

705
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,538
Gosh, now you're keeping tabs
on the promotions of other people's dads?

706
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:08,127
If you have such a powerful father,
you can live as a princess forever.

707
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,044
What…

708
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,505
I thought

709
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:17,886
I'd have more freedom
until I hit about 30, you know?

710
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,598
But my parents' health
won't allow me that freedom.

711
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,021
I really have to make a lot of money.

712
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,064
I'm the breadwinner of my family.

713
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:35,029
Why are you acting
like a grown-up all of a sudden?

714
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,533
I'm not acting like a grown-up.

715
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,037
I am one.

716
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,844
Mr. Hairy, your cooking is amazing.

717
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,639
-We're back.
-You're here.

718
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,559
Did you go to a brewery or something?

719
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:08,812
It was painful being sober.

720
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:09,772
Sorry.

721
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,899
You two should hurry and eat.

722
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,151
Mr. Hairy's food is really delicious.

723
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:18,238
I'm so happy
that you're enjoying the food.

724
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,699
What were you talking about
while we were gone?

725
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:24,203
We were listening to the story
about how Attorney Jung's wife left him.

726
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:27,539
What? You were married, Attorney Jung?

727
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:31,460
Yes, he got married when he was 30
but his wife left him 8 years later.

728
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,962
Stop saying his wife left him.

729
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:36,298
She did leave me.

730
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:38,717
We honeymooned in Jeju.

731
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,719
Maybe that's why I keep thinking about it.

732
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:45,182
Wait, did people go to Jeju
for honeymoons then too?

733
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:47,935
Wasn't Jeju the honeymoon spot
for our parents' generation?

734
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,062
You're right.

735
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:54,483
My generation went to places like Hawaii,
Guam, or the Maldives.

736
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:57,403
We went to Jeju because of my job.

737
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,988
I had just as much work then as I do now.

738
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:03,117
I had to be able to answer my phone
even when I was on my honeymoon.

739
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:07,538
And if something happened,
I would have to go straight to Seoul.

740
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,665
Gosh, that's so sad.

741
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:11,375
Working even during your honeymoon.

742
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:14,044
Looking back,

743
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,964
I think that's when it all started.

744
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,675
This whole time,

745
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:22,886
I thought our issue was that
we fought a lot before the divorce.

746
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,472
But that wasn't it.

747
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:28,058
It started with the honeymoon.

748
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,520
Ji-su.

749
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,898
Okay. One…

750
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:40,654
Okay. One…

751
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,448
Hold on, I'm sorry.

752
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,617
Hello?

753
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:47,035
Yes.

754
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,079
It's fine, go ahead.

755
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:53,750
Hey, are you not going to take a picture?
There's someone waiting behind you.

756
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,837
I'm sorry. Go ahead.

757
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,130
I'm sorry.

758
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:02,468
Right. It seems like things haven't been
straightened out with the client.

759
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:07,389
Yes. Then I'll email you
the additional materials tonight…

760
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:12,019
I'll have him thoroughly ready
by the next trial.

761
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,228
Yes.

762
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:14,313
Yes, all right.

763
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,025
Enjoy the food.

764
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,276
Thank you.

765
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,070
Honey, the raw fish is here. Let's eat.

766
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:24,364
Okay.

767
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:25,991
What are you doing?

768
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:28,827
I have an important email to check.
Give me a second.

769
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:30,871
Eat first. The food's going to get cold.

770
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:36,960
Eat. The food's getting cold.

771
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,047
What do you mean it'll get cold?
It's raw fish.

772
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:42,591
It will get cold! Raw fish gets cold too!

773
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,439
I'm done.

774
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:06,782
Ji-su.

775
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:08,325
Are you asleep?

776
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:11,620
You're just going to sleep?

777
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:17,459
What time is it?

778
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,587
It's…

779
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:30,055
Right.

780
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:32,474
It's really late.

781
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,102
I'm sorry.

782
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:50,033
I wonder why

783
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,411
I lived like that.

784
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:05,340
I'm killing the mood, right? I'm sorry.

785
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:06,592
Have a drink.

786
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,572
What now?

787
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,660
The clock is too loud.

788
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:34,995
Damn it.

789
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:37,247
You’re such a princess, Young-woo.

790
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,499
"The floor is hard."

791
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,335
"Light is showing through the window."

792
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:42,919
"The covers are rough."

793
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,921
"The temperature of the room isn't right."

794
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,757
All that complaining,

795
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,426
and now the clock is too loud.

796
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:50,344
Gosh.

797
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,804
I tried to sleep through it,
but it's just so loud.

798
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:54,806
Listen carefully.

799
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:06,068
I think it's the one in the living room.

800
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:08,987
The second hand is going "tick, tock."

801
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,907
"Tick, tock."

802
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:14,743
If the second hand is going "tick, tock"

803
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:16,995
then you should "tick, tock" off to sleep.

804
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:27,547
What are you doing?

805
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:28,465
Get up.

806
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,592
You said it's in the living room.

807
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:32,969
Let's go kill it.

808
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:36,932
Right.

809
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:46,149
Okay.

810
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,700
Is it that bastard right there?

811
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:56,451
Yes, I think so.

812
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:15,721
What?

813
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:16,722
I killed…

814
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:23,979
What's wrong with him?

815
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:25,897
Does he have to poop?

816
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,941
Should we go ask him what's wrong?

817
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:35,282
No.

818
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:38,118
Let's just leave him be.
I think that's for the best.

819
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,202
Yes.

820
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:40,662
Okay.

821
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,679
Gosh.

822
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:58,722
Darn it.

823
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:01,641
Are you going to keep popping the guts?
What a waste.

824
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:03,935
You told me to cut the mouth.

825
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,396
What am I supposed to do when the mouth
and gut are stuck together?

826
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:08,148
This is so stressful.

827
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:11,485
Are we having abalone for breakfast?

828
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,779
Yes, I thought I'd make abalone porridge.

829
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:16,281
They were selling some nearby,
so I went and got some.

830
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:17,783
This early?

831
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:19,242
I know, right?

832
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:20,577
That's what I said.

833
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,580
He woke me up at the break of dawn
to go buy this.

834
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:27,125
Gosh, thank you. You two are spoiling us.

835
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:30,462
Gosh, please.

836
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,256
Su-yeon.

837
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,176
Do you know what kind of sandwich
abalones like the most?

838
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:39,095
-Excuse me?
-Here we go again.

839
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:40,639
Baloney.

840
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:44,142
-What?
-A baloney sandwich.

841
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:45,894
Abalone. Baloney.

842
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:54,528
I should cut off the mouth.

843
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,530
I should cut off the mouth.

844
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,615
I should cut off this mouth!

845
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:00,742
-And pop its guts!
-Good morning.

846
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:04,996
Flowers?

847
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:08,542
They're so pretty.

848
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,168
Did you go buy these, Jun-ho?

849
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:11,670
I bought them.

850
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:17,634
I was out jogging earlier and an old lady
was selling them on the street.

851
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:19,678
What's wrong?

852
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:23,849
Are they suddenly not as pretty
since I bought them?

853
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:26,810
You just said, “They're so pretty."

854
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:30,021
I never said it like that.

855
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,523
You're so annoying!

856
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,819
What's going on? Did you two fight?

857
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:36,736
I don't know.

858
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:48,748
I think we're taking the fact
that Candidate Tae Su-mi used to be

859
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,167
the CEO of Taesan Law Firm too lightly.

860
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:53,503
I'm very concerned about this.

861
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,421
Right.

862
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,756
Of course, she did voluntarily resign

863
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,426
before she became a candidate
for Minister of Justice,

864
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:01,052
but it's also true that she became the CEO

865
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:03,972
through hereditary succession
as the daughter of Taesan's founder.

866
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:04,931
Right.

867
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,434
And isn't Taesan
a business-friendly law firm?

868
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:12,105
Also, Candidate Tae Su-mi's husband is
Gangcheon Group's chairman, Choi Gyu-ho.

869
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:15,066
Korea's Minister of Justice
being the spouse

870
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:18,153
-of a major corporation's CEO?
-It's time for SpongeBob SquarePants.

871
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,405
I don't know how I feel about that.

872
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:22,824
Young-woo, SpongeBob.

873
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,160
-You're not going to watch?
-Later.

874
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:46,556
Once again, fill your body with fresh air.

875
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:51,645
Exhale slowly and let that air out.

876
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:58,860
Relax your face and body.

877
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:02,197
Breathe in,

878
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:05,367
breathe out.

879
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:13,917
Attorney Woo, I just spoke to my sister
on the phone.

880
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:17,629
Would this be enough to go see
the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins?

881
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:20,215
In case I'm not able to see them
because of the sun,

882
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:22,634
I put on a hat and anti-glare stickers.

883
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:25,095
I also have a pair of binoculars
that counteract hand tremors

884
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:28,098
and can also zoom in ten times,
and a camera that has burst mode.

885
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:32,352
Well, yes. I think that's enough.

886
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:36,773
But Attorney Woo…

887
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:42,487
I think my sister and her husband
prepared a lot for us.

888
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:43,947
What?

889
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:48,201
It was supposed to be a casual meetup
to have some tea together.

890
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:52,497
But Seung-hui hasn't seen me
in such a long time

891
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:56,751
and since you're coming with me,
I guess she didn't want it to be just tea.

892
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:59,671
So she said she prepared a lot of food

893
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:01,965
and told us not to have lunch
before coming over,

894
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:07,804
but I don't think she made any gimbap.

895
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:09,389
Well…

896
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:12,559
Then what kind of food
would she have prepared?

897
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:15,437
Well, I think she prepared meat

898
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,690
and also got some raw fish.

899
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:19,899
I see.

900
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,443
Meat and raw fish.

901
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:22,610
Yes.

902
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:27,824
Should I call her and say
we're not eating with them?

903
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:29,284
No.

904
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:30,410
Meat and raw fish.

905
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:34,581
Though I really don't want to,
I'll eat what is prepared.

906
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:36,082
And enjoy it.

907
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,792
You don't have to force yourself.

908
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,127
I'll just call her and…

909
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,211
No!

910
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:41,296
Don't worry.

911
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,423
But…

912
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:03,151
Dolphins and sharks compete for food.

913
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:06,279
But the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins
are settled on the coast of Jeju,

914
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:09,657
so when sharks approach,
they drive them away in groups.

915
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:12,786
Thanks to that, haenyeos of Jeju
are safe from sharks

916
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,454
while they work in the waters.

917
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,040
But there are times
when dolphins steal the seafood

918
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:19,959
that haenyeos worked so hard to catch.

919
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:22,087
I see.

920
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:32,680
Why isn't a single dolphin showing up?

921
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:37,268
We need to head over to Seung-hui's now.

922
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:01,876
Seung-hui.

923
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,545
Jeong-nam.

924
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:04,963
Hey, Jun-ho. You're here.

925
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:07,382
It's been a while, Jun-ho.

926
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,136
It’s not much but we picked this up
on our way here.

927
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:13,054
You shouldn't have.

928
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:14,889
-Is this…
-Right.

929
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,308
Hello, I'm Woo Young-woo.

930
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:19,018
Whether it's read straight or flipped,
it's still Woo Young-woo.

931
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,229
Kayak, deed, rotator,
noon, racecar, Woo Young-woo.

932
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:25,567
Gosh. I see.

933
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,528
The interior design
of your house is hella gorgeous.

934
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:32,449
You can see the inside?

935
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,537
Shall we?

936
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,164
-Yes, come here.
-Yes, sit here.

937
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:40,623
There.

938
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:44,961
Seung-hui prepared all this for days
since she heard you two were coming.

939
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:45,920
Gosh.

940
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:49,674
She prepared so much.
You must have worked so hard on this.

941
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:52,302
No worries. We have fruit
to eat after dinner too.

942
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:54,053
Fruit!

943
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:57,724
I'll do it.
I'm really good at peeling fruit.

944
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:04,647
Right.

945
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,358
Let's eat.

946
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,527
Enjoy the food.

947
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:11,404
Thank you.

948
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:41,309
You must not have seen much of the island
since you're here on business.

949
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:42,477
Right.

950
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:46,356
We still went to a few places
like Hanbaek Mountain and Hwangjisa.

951
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:48,983
And before we came here,
we went to the beach at Daejeong-eup.

952
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:51,945
But there weren't any dolphins
in Daejeong-eup--

953
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,572
No. You can't talk about them.

954
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,032
What?

955
00:58:57,158 --> 00:59:00,078
You're not allowed to talk about whales
in a situation like this.

956
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:01,621
You can't ask for gimbap either.

957
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:05,124
I see.

958
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,377
Young-woo, are you all right?

959
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:10,004
You look like you're forcing yourself
to eat something you don’t want to.

960
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:12,549
Attorney Woo, you don't have to
push yourself too hard.

961
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,050
Don't eat if you don't want to.

962
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,185
I'm fine.

963
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,980
Gosh, this is freaking delicious.

964
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,567
Your cooking is great.

965
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:52,422
What's taking Attorney Woo so long?

966
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:54,841
Maybe she can't find the bathroom.

967
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,802
Hey, are you babysitting?

968
00:59:57,885 --> 01:00:00,597
Our house isn't a maze.
Why wouldn't she be able to find it?

969
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,099
She's right, Jun-ho. You said she's smart.

970
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:06,269
And what's with "Attorney Woo"?

971
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:08,730
All that extra respectful language
you use with her.

972
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:10,898
I thought you two were dating.

973
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,860
It's because that's how we
talk to each other at work.

974
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:15,486
It's going to change eventually.

975
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,033
You're not going to
tell our parents, right?

976
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:22,869
-Tell them what?
-That you're seeing Young-woo.

977
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:26,122
-Why?
-What are you thinking?

978
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:27,915
Do you want to see them faint?

979
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,127
You're not going to marry her
so don't make them worry.

980
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:34,589
What are you talking about?
Why would they faint?

981
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:38,426
Honey, we can talk about this
some other time. Young-woo might hear.

982
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:40,678
You’re in such a difficult relationship.

983
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:43,139
I'm your sister and I'm upset about it.
If our parents find out--

984
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:44,098
Seung-hui!

985
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,016
Lee Jun-ho!

986
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,186
We just want you to be happy.

987
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:52,190
You should bring home a girl
who can make you happy.

988
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:54,192
Not someone you have to take care of.

989
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:57,236
How could you say that?

990
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,740
It's your first time meeting her.
You think you know everything about her?

991
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:03,201
Anyway, don't tell our parents.

992
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:04,869
You just don't know her yet.

993
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:06,746
Don't think of her that way!

994
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:21,594
The plaintiff claims that he merely
passed through Local Highway Number 3008

995
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:25,348
and that he didn't visit
Hwangjisa's cultural heritage.

996
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:27,141
Witness, what do you think of this claim

997
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:29,602
as a Buddhist cultural heritage expert?

998
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,854
I think it's an argument that he can make

999
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:35,358
only because he doesn't understand
traditional mountain temples.

1000
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:36,317
Why that…

1001
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:39,696
Why do you think that?

1002
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:42,532
Many people think that
the Gwaebultaeng of Guanyin

1003
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:45,451
is the only cultural heritage
of Hwangjisa.

1004
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,286
Since it's been designated as a treasure.

1005
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:50,039
But the true meaning
of temple cultural heritage

1006
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:52,250
is the surface area.

1007
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,585
The surface area?

1008
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:56,921
That's right. The surface as a whole.

1009
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:59,716
It means that it's not
a movable cultural heritage

1010
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:01,175
like a painting in a museum.

1011
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:04,387
Rather, it spans all of the buildings
and the smaller temples

1012
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,889
that surround the area around the temple,

1013
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:09,100
including nature.

1014
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:10,810
In the case of Hwangjisa,

1015
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:14,731
what would you include
as its cultural heritage?

1016
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:17,608
Hwangjisa and Hwangjisa's smaller temples,

1017
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:18,651
Sanrokam,

1018
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:19,694
Banggakam,

1019
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:20,987
Busaam.

1020
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,865
And the part
of Hanbaek Mountain National Park

1021
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:26,242
that Local Highway Number 3008
passes through.

1022
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:29,412
That is all.

1023
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:33,583
Plaintiff's counselor,
you may begin cross-examination.

1024
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:45,636
Attorney Jung?

1025
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,973
What's wrong? Are you okay?

1026
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:53,853
Just a moment.

1027
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:00,610
-Attorney Jung!
-Goodness!

1028
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,329
Are you all right?

1029
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:12,872
Are you all right?

1030
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:14,290
-Are you okay?
-Wake up.

1031
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:16,083
-Call 911. Hurry!
-Attorney Jung!

1032
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:39,440
What do we have to do
to find the owner of Haengbok Noodles?

1033
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:41,150
He said not to do anything unnecessary.

1034
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:44,320
If not now, he might never
be able to eat Haengbok Noodles again.

1035
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:48,533
It's not wrong for Hwangjisa to collect
cultural heritage admission fees.

1036
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:52,787
It is absolutely necessary for the nature
surrounding Hwangjisa as well.

1037
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:56,040
Am I someone who can make Jun-ho happy?

1038
01:03:56,123 --> 01:03:57,792
Do you really like me?

1039
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:02,046
I don't think you and I should date.

1040
01:04:02,129 --> 01:04:03,673
I'm sorry.

1041
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:08,761
