1
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,609
-What's your name?
-Gye Hyang-sim.

2
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,569
It's "Gye," not "Gae."

3
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:10,737
GUREUM ORPHANAGE

4
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,905
Your daughter's name?

5
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,491
Gye Ha-yun.

6
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,911
Isn't her name so stylish?

7
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,082
I chose Ha-yun because they said
it's a popular name in Korea.

8
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,458
Her surname is odd,

9
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:27,378
so at least her name doesn't stand out
and she can blend in.

10
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,758
Isn't she heavy? Should we lay
her down on the couch over there?

11
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:32,926
No.

12
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,427
It's fine.

13
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,762
I'm going to hold her.

14
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,308
She's so sound asleep even though
it's the middle of the afternoon.

15
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,893
I gave her medicine.

16
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,188
Medicine? To your daughter?

17
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,607
If Ha-yun is awake,

18
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,109
she'll try not to be separated from me.

19
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,361
I see.

20
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,989
What's your address?

21
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,411
I'm not abandoning Ha-yun.

22
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,872
You can't put her up for adoption.

23
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,416
I'll be back for her.

24
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,626
All right.

25
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:11,673
-But first, we need an address--
-Are you taking my words lightly?

26
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,759
I'm not abandoning Ha-yun.

27
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,178
I'm leaving her here temporarily

28
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,596
because I might have
to go to the correctional labor camp.

29
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,099
Correctional labor camp?

30
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,517
I mean prison.

31
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,394
Prison.

32
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,816
Are you, by any chance,
a North Korean defector?

33
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:34,946
Don't discriminate Ha-yun because
she's a North Korean defector's daughter

34
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:37,448
or be mean to her
because she's the daughter of a criminal.

35
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,994
I will be back for her no matter what.

36
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,080
All right.

37
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,632
Mom!

38
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,051
-Mom!
-You can't go alone.

39
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,761
-Mom!
-You can't go.

40
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,013
Mom!

41
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,098
-Ha-yun.
-Mom!

42
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:03,516
-Mom!
-Mommy…

43
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,227
will be back soon.

44
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,940
Mom, don't leave!

45
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,359
Mom!

46
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:16,362
Mom!

47
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,616
Mom!

48
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:23,202
Mom!

49
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:27,123
Mom!

50
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:30,209
Mom!

51
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,795
Mom!

52
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,632
Mom!

53
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,592
Mom!

54
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:44,349
CASE 6
IF I WERE A WHALE…

55
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,607
Right.

56
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,154
-Yes?
-Attorney Jung, you called me?

57
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:02,867
Yes. Attorney Choi
has a public interest case.

58
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,786
A North Korean defector charged
with injury resulting from robbery.

59
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,829
"A North Korean defector charged
with injury resulting from robbery."

60
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:11,251
The way I see it, there's not a lot
you can do for the case.

61
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:16,130
But how should I put this? I think
Attorney Choi is overly passionate.

62
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,676
It seems she's overly empathizing
with the defendant.

63
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,345
So I was thinking
you could take on the case with her

64
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,930
and stop her, like "whoa, whoa."

65
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,599
Like "whoa, whoa"?

66
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:31,604
Yes, so cool down Attorney Choi so that
she doesn't treat this case emotionally.

67
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,523
Like this.

68
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,108
Whoa, whoa.

69
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,360
-Whoa, whoa.
-Yes, like that.

70
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,362
-Whoa, whoa.
-Whoa, whoa.

71
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,072
Make her relax. Whoa…

72
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,658
All right, get going.

73
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,786
-Whoa…
-Cool her down.

74
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,246
Whoa, whoa.

75
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,206
Whoa, whoa.

76
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,959
Whoa, whoa.

77
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,837
Come in.

78
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:08,766
Well…

79
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,103
Did you not come to work
or did you not go home?

80
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,315
"Go home"? What does that mean?

81
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,608
Is it like having a life after work?

82
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,695
The thing that only exists
in fantasies and not in real life?

83
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,155
Well…

84
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,157
Well…

85
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,118
What about you?
Don't you have a lot of work?

86
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,369
Work?

87
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,746
I do have a lot.

88
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,124
My wrists hurt because I typed
for more than ten hours yesterday.

89
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,376
I already have Asperger's syndrome.

90
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,755
But at this rate, I'll probably get
carpal tunnel syndrome too.

91
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,966
I started growing white nose hair
from not getting sleep.

92
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,349
I'm on the public interest case
you were assigned.

93
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,977
The North Korean defector charged
with injury resulting from robbery.

94
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,021
What? Hyang-sim's case?

95
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,065
Hyang-sim?

96
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,984
The defendant's name is Gye Hyang-sim.

97
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,361
I've met her once, and she's really cool.

98
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,738
She's like a tough older sister.

99
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:07,950
Attorney Jung thinks
you're overly passionate about the case.

100
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,870
That you're overly empathizing
with the defendant.

101
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,872
-Really?
-Yes.

102
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,208
He told me to "whoa, whoa" you.

103
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,168
Whoa, whoa.

104
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,837
Whoa, whoa.

105
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:21,923
Whoa, whoa.

106
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,467
Young-woo. Have you ever been
to a detention center?

107
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,887
No. I haven't been to one yet.

108
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,265
Hurry and request visitation.
Let's go meet Hyang-sim.

109
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,041
My goodness.

110
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,960
Attorney Choi.

111
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,586
How have you been?

112
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,506
This is Attorney Woo.

113
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,466
She'll be working on the case with me.

114
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,928
Hello, I am Woo Young-woo
from Hanbada Law Firm.

115
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,180
Whether it's read straight or flipped,
it's still Woo Young-woo.

116
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,432
Kayak, deed, rotator,
noon, racecar, Woo Young-woo.

117
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,433
Right.

118
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:15,935
Woo Hyang-woo?

119
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,687
What?

120
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,522
-No.
-Why don't we

121
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,524
sit down first?

122
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,192
Okay.

123
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,827
How are you doing in here?
I bet it's tough.

124
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,454
Staying in here?

125
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,789
They feed me and put a roof over my head.

126
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,624
This is like a hotel.

127
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,753
I just miss my daughter, Ha-yun.

128
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,882
That just breaks my heart. That's all.

129
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,218
Ms. Gye, I heard
you're a North Korean defector,

130
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,012
but why don't you use the dialect?

131
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,058
Comrade Woo Hyang-woo.

132
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,729
Why would you say that to me?
It's been a while since I defected.

133
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:05,693
Gosh! Detention centers
in South Joseon look like hotels!

134
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,737
Do I have to speak like this
to be a North Korean defector?

135
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,448
Right, I'm sorry.

136
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,742
Should we talk about the case?

137
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:16,037
Let's start from the beginning
since this is Attorney Woo's first time.

138
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,958
Did you and the victim, Lee Sun-yeong,
know each other before the incident?

139
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:24,212
No. Lee Sun-yeong
is not a North Korean defector

140
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,297
nor was there a reason
for us to cross paths.

141
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,883
The day I went to get the money
was my first time meeting her.

142
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,843
I only got to know her
because Mom told me about her.

143
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,012
Mom?

144
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,932
Are you referring to the North Korean
defector broker, Choi Yeong-hui?

145
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:39,018
She's not my real mother
but my foster mother.

146
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,395
We all just call her Mom.

147
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,150
If only Mom had paid back
the money she borrowed from me.

148
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,236
I'll summarize.

149
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,113
Five years ago,

150
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,700
you asked "Mom," the North Korean
defector broker, Choi Yeong-hui,

151
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,411
for the ten million won
she borrowed from you.

152
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:02,124
Then, rather than
paying you back directly,

153
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,586
Choi Yeong-hui told you that
Lee Sun-yeong had money to give her

154
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,630
and you could get it from her instead.

155
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,131
Yes.

156
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:13,970
The ten million won debt she owed Mom
was transferred over to me and Jeong-hui.

157
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,012
Jeong-hui?

158
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,640
Ms. Kim Jeong-hui, your accomplice?

159
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,475
Comrade Woo Hyang-woo.

160
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:23,020
Does your head hurt because
there are too many people involved?

161
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,605
No.

162
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,441
You were friends
with Ms. Kim Jeong-hui, correct?

163
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,361
Well, we aren't really friends.

164
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,864
We came to know each other through Mom.

165
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,616
So I just call her my friend.

166
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,453
She's also a North Korean defector
and is the same age as me.

167
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:43,374
You were going to split the money with her
once Lee Sun-yeong gave it to you?

168
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:46,544
Yes! The problem was, would Lee Sun-yeong

169
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:50,298
just hand us the money
she didn't even give to Mom?

170
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,758
If we wanted to stop her
from lying about not having the money,

171
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,678
we couldn't look like
people she could take advantage of.

172
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,739
Goodness, she doesn't even lock her door.

173
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,032
Is she not afraid?

174
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,075
She's very brave.

175
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,995
Jeong-hui, be on your toes.

176
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,039
She won't give us the money easily.

177
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:27,168
You can tell how fierce she is
since she didn't even pay Mom back, right?

178
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:30,046
Speak for yourself. You're way too soft.

179
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,174
There's no one else as fierce as me
on the Korean Peninsula.

180
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,258
Let's go.

181
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:38,929
Grab one.

182
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,436
Lee Sun-yeong!

183
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,189
Come out right now!

184
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,315
Come out!

185
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,358
Where are you?

186
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,612
You.

187
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,365
Hand over Mom's money!

188
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,868
-What money?
-"What money?"

189
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,918
You pocketed Mom's ten million won
and you're not paying it back.

190
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:09,919
You.

191
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,172
Where did you hide the money?

192
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,383
Is it in that room?

193
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,509
No.

194
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,263
Please, let it go this one time.
I'm in a difficult situation.

195
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,140
Hey!

196
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,060
Hey, you thieving bitch!

197
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,812
You think we're doing this
because our situation is any better?

198
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,522
Right, step aside!

199
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,732
No, you can't!

200
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,067
Let go!

201
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,904
No. You can't.

202
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,447
What are you doing?

203
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,952
Hey, let go!

204
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:44,954
Let go of me!

205
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,998
-Darn it.
-Hey!

206
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:53,587
Lee Sun-yeong, just hand over the money!

207
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:57,800
Gosh, it's so loud.
I've had enough of this.

208
00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,844
Hello? Is this the police?

209
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,888
-I don't have the money!
-This is 52 Dongbaek-gil.

210
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,683
The people upstairs are being loud again!

211
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,185
I can't sleep. Please hurry.

212
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:09,979
Gosh.

213
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,605
Let go!

214
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:15,568
The police came because the landlord
who lived below the victim reported it.

215
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:19,280
Then you and Ms. Kim Jeong-hui
were arrested on-site, right?

216
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,117
To be honest,
we didn't beat her up that much.

217
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:27,329
But the police saw shattered glass,

218
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,915
a stick rolling around, and a stone brick,

219
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,418
so it must've seemed pretty severe.

220
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:36,338
At the time, you applied
for a jury trial with Ms. Kim Jeong-hui.

221
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,882
Ms. Kim Jeong-hui appeared in court

222
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,633
and received a four-year sentence
for injury resulting from robbery,

223
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,760
but you fled before the trial.

224
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,012
Why did you do that?

225
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:44,805
Four years…

226
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,811
Then Jeong-hui must be out already.

227
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,771
Yes, probably.

228
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,940
Why did you run away?

229
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,527
Jeong-hui doesn't have any kids.

230
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,905
But I have a daughter.

231
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,496
Ha-yun was only
three years old at the time.

232
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:12,333
If I got sent to the correctional labor
camp, she would've been abandoned.

233
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,669
I'm a North Korean defector,

234
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,130
so we have no one.

235
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,967
Mom's not my real mom.

236
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,095
And my friend isn't my real friend.

237
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:31,894
Ha-yun's dad died in a car accident
soon after she was born.

238
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:36,315
Without me, there wouldn't have been
anyone to take care of my daughter.

239
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,236
What about now?

240
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,987
Where's Ha-yun now?

241
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,364
I left her at the orphanage.

242
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,866
Then I went to the police station.

243
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,537
Couldn't you have left her
at an orphanage five years ago?

244
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,040
If I left her then,
Ha-yun would've forgotten about me

245
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,375
because she was too young.

246
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,505
She's eight now,
so when I go back to get her,

247
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,757
she'll remember her mom.

248
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,302
Did you run away so that you could
raise her until she reached an age

249
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,595
where she could remember her mother?

250
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,305
Yes.

251
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,393
And now, Ha-yun has to attend school,

252
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,563
so she can't keep living
as the daughter of a fugitive.

253
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:18,857
It's only right that I hurry
and go to prison and return.

254
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,694
Like a mother whale.

255
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,445
What?

256
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,783
The maternal instincts of a whale
are known for their devotion.

257
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:28,993
They have to be.

258
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:32,830
Because there aren't that many
safe places in the ocean to raise babies.

259
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,085
How did you get by after you ran away?

260
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,838
In those five years, you wouldn't
have received national subsidies

261
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,214
and it would've been
difficult to get a job.

262
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,757
I cleaned at a motel,

263
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,553
got a spare room,
and lived there with Ha-yun.

264
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,555
I feel bad

265
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,557
when I think about that.

266
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,269
Other kids go to kindergarten

267
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,730
and daycare centers.

268
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,317
But Ha-yun was stuck
in a motel room all day

269
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,278
because I was her mom.

270
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,457
I'm sure she was happy
because she was with her mom.

271
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,250
You think so?

272
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,420
Would she really think that?

273
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,965
Yes, she would have.

274
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,306
I was wondering…

275
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,808
If I get a four-year sentence
like Jeong-hui,

276
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,188
could you come visit at least once?

277
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,398
I know you must be busy,

278
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,068
but just once with Ha-yun.

279
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:51,659
Don't be so weak-minded!
There will be no four-year sentence.

280
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:59,375
Ms. Gye Hyang-sim must get probation!

281
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,796
We will do everything in our power
to get the defendant probation.

282
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,883
That was passionate.

283
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:12,179
Does the defendant
have some kind of irresistible charm?

284
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:15,474
Because it seems that everyone
she encounters becomes so heated.

285
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,768
What happened to the "whoa, whoa" mission?

286
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,563
For an attorney,

287
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,942
defending this charge
is as difficult as defending murder.

288
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,652
Any guess as to why?

289
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,196
-Because the statutory penalty is high?
-Correct.

290
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,365
What is the statutory penalty
for injury resulting from robbery?

291
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,534
A life sentence or at least
seven years of imprisonment.

292
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,494
To repeat, at least seven years.

293
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:39,039
What's the maximum amount that can be
reduced at the discretion of the judge?

294
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,416
Mitigation of punishments
in extenuating circumstances

295
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,709
cannot exceed
the range of statutory mitigation,

296
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,461
and with a fixed sentence, it is limited
to half of the term of imprisonment,

297
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,088
so at least 3 years and 6 months.

298
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,758
However, to get probation, the sentence
has to be less than three years.

299
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,970
So if you don't find reasons for not only
mitigation in extenuating circumstances

300
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,889
but also statutory mitigation
to get it reduced even more,

301
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,808
you won't be able to get probation.

302
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,978
That's why they say injury resulting from
robbery always ends up with prison time.

303
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,272
And on top of that,
the defendant ran away.

304
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:06,066
If anything, that could
lead to additional punishment.

305
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,279
All right.

306
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,656
This case is quite odd.

307
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,826
We haven't even started,
but the answers are already there.

308
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,995
It's as if the defendant
already had her trial.

309
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,164
Because there was an accomplice?

310
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,248
Yes.

311
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:24,960
Ms. Gye Hyang-sim and Ms. Kim Jeong-hui's
issues are almost identical.

312
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,713
By being tried first,
Ms. Kim Jeong-hui already

313
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,256
claimed everything that could be claimed

314
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,216
and everything that could be dismissed
has already been dismissed.

315
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,801
And the answer…

316
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,137
was a four-year sentence.

317
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,807
Ms. Gye Hyang-sim testified that she only
held onto the victim's clothes

318
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,267
and hit her a couple of times.

319
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:44,313
What if we claim that this can't be
legally seen as bodily harm?

320
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,988
Here. The victim was hurt badly.
What are you talking about?

321
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,032
But sir,

322
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:58,118
seeing this now,
her injuries are too severe.

323
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,455
The defendant has a small frame.

324
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,916
Of course, her accomplice
might be a bit bigger,

325
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:07,002
but even so, two women
hit her with their bare hands.

326
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,922
And they were arrested by the police
not long after they arrived there.

327
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:14,343
They wouldn't have had much time
to cause injuries that severe.

328
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,847
All right. I guess it's necessary
to look into what really happened.

329
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:23,352
Yes. And we plan on meeting with the
attorney who defended Ms. Kim Jeong-hui.

330
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,772
There could be something from
the earlier trial that they had missed.

331
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,233
Okay, it's not a bad idea,

332
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:33,320
but time is the most important resource
to an attorney.

333
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,241
Balance it well so you don't spend
too much time on this one case.

334
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,201
-I will.
-Yes, I understand.

335
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,288
Get her to cool down.

336
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:44,748
I will.

337
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,588
Hey, Min-woo.

338
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,550
I'm going to tell you a story.

339
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,927
There's this person.

340
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,971
There's a person.

341
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:03,016
And I think I'm making

342
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:07,229
that person think

343
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,399
that I don't like the person.

344
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,192
When you actually do like the person?

345
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:14,361
Yes.

346
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,364
What's the matter?
Just tell the person how you feel.

347
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,658
But…

348
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,911
it's not that simple.

349
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:23,954
Why?

350
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,665
Is it an office romance?

351
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,043
Hey.

352
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,172
What is there to worry about when
you're the most popular guy at Hanbada?

353
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,968
Hey, Jun-ho.
Just give them each a number first.

354
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,637
Number one, two, and three.

355
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:44,099
-And date all of them in order.
-You're talking nonsense.

356
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,392
Forget it.

357
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,394
I'm not talking to you.
Hand me the bottle.

358
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,523
-Is the person an attorney?
-Hey.

359
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,026
Does that matter?

360
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,654
It's just someone

361
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:02,284
who I see often.

362
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,578
Goodness! She's in litigation?

363
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,956
Jeez, let me see.

364
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,542
It can't be Woo Young-woo.

365
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,045
Gosh! I told you to forget it.

366
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,380
You.

367
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,715
You know what?

368
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,259
You're an idiot.

369
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,553
You're an idiot
who's only focused on who it is.

370
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,138
Forget it. Just go to sleep.

371
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,766
I'm just trying to help you.

372
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:28,518
But I can only help if I know who it is.

373
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,272
Hey, tell me.

374
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:34,775
Jun-ho.

375
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,069
I actually know everything though.

376
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,989
I can see what's going on.

377
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,034
Choi…

378
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,876
You heard what the judge said, right?
You have to come here again in two weeks.

379
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,835
-Yes.
-Okay.

380
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,880
Give me some change, will you?
I don't have money to get home.

381
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,590
Here we go again.

382
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,260
Why do you need money to get home
when you don't even have a home?

383
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,469
Go on.

384
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,558
Attorney Kwon Ju-ho?

385
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,436
I'm Choi Su-yeon. I contacted you.

386
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,021
This is Attorney Woo Young-woo.

387
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,022
Hanbada?

388
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,109
Yes, I contacted you because of a case
you were on five years ago.

389
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,653
The one for Ms. Gye Hyang-sim
and Ms. Kim Jeong-hui.

390
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,823
I have another trial.
Should we talk on my way there?

391
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:23,824
Sure.

392
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,661
Did Ms. Gye Hyang-sim resurface?

393
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,497
At the time,
she fled without going on trial.

394
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,665
Yes, that's right.

395
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:35,002
But I'm not sure if I'd be of any help.

396
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:38,005
It's a case from five years ago,
so I don't really remember much.

397
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:42,426
Besides, public defenders
take on so many cases

398
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:45,637
that it's like we work on cases
just to get them out of the way.

399
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,598
Doesn't that make you wish
you had done something?

400
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,184
Perhaps something you wanted to look into

401
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,894
or things that you had
no choice but to pass over.

402
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,646
I'm not sure.

403
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,523
Ms. Gye Hyang-sim's frame
is on the smaller side.

404
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,025
How was Ms. Kim Jeong-hui?

405
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,193
Her size?

406
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,113
From what I recall, they were both small.

407
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,743
These are pictures taken of the victim
at the time of the incident.

408
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:08,994
Do you remember?

409
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,871
Aren't these injuries too severe

410
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:14,458
to have been caused by two small women
in such a short period?

411
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,376
You're right.

412
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,337
But you do know that

413
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,882
the evidence that is most difficult
to flip in a criminal trial is…

414
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,091
Is?

415
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,468
A doctor's diagnosis.

416
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,720
But if you think about it,

417
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,014
most of the diagnoses
used in criminal trials

418
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,975
are clinical speculation
written based on what the patient says.

419
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:36,188
So not many of them have
objective test results to back them up.

420
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:40,275
Which is why it's natural for there
to be questionable and ambiguous parts,

421
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,528
but it's usually difficult to refute.

422
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,740
Right.

423
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:51,453
Now that I think of it,
I think the doctor was a bit biased.

424
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:52,996
The doctor?

425
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,665
The doctor who wrote
the diagnosis for the victim.

426
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,960
A while after the trial,
I was reading the newspaper

427
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,088
and coincidentally
saw a piece that he wrote.

428
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:05,175
It was about North Korean defectors.
How should I put this?

429
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,844
The content seemed to be biased
against North Korean defectors.

430
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,388
Do you remember the title of the piece?

431
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,349
Just a moment, let me look it up.

432
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:17,896
Here it is.

433
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,734
"A Korean woman who was assaulted
by North Korean defectors came to see me."

434
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,194
He's talking about this case.

435
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:27,072
I felt a bit bitter after reading this.

436
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:30,075
In a case where all the defendants
were North Korean defectors,

437
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:34,621
I thought, "Why did it have to be a person
like him who wrote the diagnosis?"

438
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,837
Lee Sun-yeong's house is…

439
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,593
Lee Sun-yeong's house
is on the second floor, right?

440
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,137
Yes, should we go up?

441
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,096
Yes.

442
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:52,931
Damn it.

443
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,559
This damn household.

444
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,728
Where are you going?

445
00:23:58,812 --> 00:23:59,813
Let go.

446
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,483
Let go!

447
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,776
Young-woo, are you okay?

448
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,946
You can't take that money!

449
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:08,947
Damn it, you brat.

450
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,583
Don't be so dramatic.

451
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,676
We have to call the police.

452
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,720
-I can't deal with this anymore.
-Hold on.

453
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,346
I think someone's already making a call.

454
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,057
Is this the police?
This is 52 Dongbaek-gil.

455
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,269
I'm about to go mad
because of how loud they are upstairs!

456
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:40,896
Hurry and send someone over.

457
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,149
It happens far too often.

458
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:45,317
Hurry!

459
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,739
Ms. Lee Sun-yeong.

460
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,574
Ms. Lee Sun-yeong.

461
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,285
We're attorneys representing
Ms. Gye Hyang-sim.

462
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,662
We would like to talk to you.

463
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,332
If I die early,

464
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,292
-Ms. Lee Sun-yeong.
-it's because of the man upstairs.

465
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,753
Breaking, smashing
and throwing things every day.

466
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,964
I might die soon
because my heart keeps trembling.

467
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:12,052
I wanted to kick them out
in whatever way I could,

468
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,763
but I pity the wife who gets beaten up.

469
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:19,643
And before I knew it,
it's been five tiresome years!

470
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,646
So did you call the police
every time they were like that?

471
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:23,772
I did.

472
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:27,609
Do you think that wife-beating punk
listens to me when I try to stop him?

473
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,779
But he calms down
when the police get here.

474
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,614
Even if it's only for a little while.

475
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:36,451
Then you must've called
the police on them five years ago too.

476
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:37,494
Of course!

477
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:41,164
So when I call and just
give them my address now,

478
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,916
the precinct sends the police to me

479
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:45,877
as if they're delivering jjajangmyeon.

480
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,466
Where's Lee Sun-yeong? Did you meet her?

481
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:53,677
No, there's no answer.

482
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,887
Gosh, do you think
she'd want to show her face

483
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,181
when she gets beaten up
by her husband like that?

484
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,058
I'm sick of this.

485
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:04,729
I think the landlord called the police
whenever there was a ruckus.

486
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:08,650
Then wouldn't there be records
of her reports before the incident too?

487
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,695
You're right. We should
secure the report records.

488
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,374
-Are you…
-Young-woo.

489
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:37,137
Please text me after you send it.

490
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,096
All right.

491
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,140
My goodness.

492
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,058
What do you think about Jun-ho?

493
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,937
-What?
-How do you feel about Jun-ho as a man?

494
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,399
You must have
a lot of free time these days.

495
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:53,611
I really think the person Jun-ho likes
is you, Attorney Choi.

496
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:55,363
What?

497
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,531
Works at Hanbada,

498
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:59,617
an attorney on the litigation team,
and someone who he sees often.

499
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:00,785
That's Choi Su-yeon.

500
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,204
Why?

501
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,624
You don't like Jun-ho
because he's not an attorney?

502
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:15,300
Did Jun-ho say something about me?

503
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,593
To you?

504
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:17,927
I mean,

505
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,725
we live together so we talk
about a lot of things together.

506
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,268
Are you curious?

507
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,395
No.

508
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:38,698
Therefore, we would like to summon
the victim, Lee Sun-yeong, as a witness.

509
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:40,575
Your Honor,

510
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,536
the victim already completed
cross-examination

511
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,996
at the trial five years ago.

512
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:50,585
Summoning the victim once again
as a witness is unnecessary and unfair.

513
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:53,922
The defendant ran away
and then came back as she pleased.

514
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,549
What right does she have
to make the victim come and go?

515
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,801
This is secondary--

516
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,845
It is the people's basic right
to get a fair trial.

517
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,848
Is the defendant who fled
and came back not a citizen of Korea?

518
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,517
-The victim--
-Just a moment.

519
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:10,355
What is your family origin?

520
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:15,276
-Excuse me?
-Your family origin. Your surname.

521
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,737
Right. It is the Woo family of Danyang.

522
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,657
Danyang is in Chungcheongbuk-do, right?

523
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:25,662
But why are you in such a rush that
you're cutting off other people's words?

524
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,789
That's very unlike someone
from Chungcheong-do.

525
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:32,210
-Excuse me?
-Cutting people off doesn't look good.

526
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:33,294
Don't do it.

527
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,797
In this courtroom
where I am the presiding judge,

528
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,216
cutting people off is prohibited.

529
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,802
Right. Okay.

530
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,096
Your Honor, with all due respect,

531
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:46,141
isn't your family origin
the Ryu family of Pungsan?

532
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,810
How did you know?

533
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,563
The Ryu family of Pungsan
is one with a long and rich history,

534
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:54,899
located in Andong Hahoe
Folk Village, right?

535
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,903
You just give off that kind of impression.

536
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,613
Is that so?

537
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,407
My family origin
is the Kim family of Andong,

538
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:06,035
and since Pungsan is a part of the city
of Andong, broadly speaking,

539
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,539
we are from the same hometown.

540
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,417
Yes, that's true.

541
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,668
Yes.

542
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:14,878
Nice to meet you.

543
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,004
Yes, nice to meet you.

544
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:20,800
Your Honor, about summoning the victim,
Lee Sun-yeong, as a witness--

545
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,886
What is your family origin, Attorney?

546
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,512
Your Honor.

547
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,390
You just cut another person off
while she was speaking.

548
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,349
I beg your pardon?

549
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,519
In this courtroom
where you are the presiding judge,

550
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,146
cutting people off is prohibited.

551
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,481
It is against the rules.

552
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,996
From now until the trial is over,

553
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,999
attorneys must raise their hands
if they have something to say.

554
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,127
You cannot speak without my permission.

555
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,799
What is it?

556
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,802
Your Honor, my family origin

557
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:06,179
is the Choi family of Wonju.

558
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:11,476
Judge Choi Bo-yeon, whose office
is on the same floor as yours,

559
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,228
also originates
from the Choi family of Wonju.

560
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,230
He…

561
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,941
is my father.

562
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,151
What?

563
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,154
You're Chief Judge Choi's daughter?

564
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,782
-Yes.
-Gosh.

565
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:29,828
Chief Judge Choi
is a dear junior colleague of mine.

566
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,081
We even have dinner together
from time to time.

567
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,834
I heard in passing
that his son is a doctor.

568
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,710
I see his daughter is an attorney.

569
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:43,174
It seems like he raised his children well.

570
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,425
I envy him.

571
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,385
Thank you.

572
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:47,804
I will send your regards to him.

573
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,848
Yes, all right.

574
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,768
My goodness.

575
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,520
What were we discussing?

576
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:58,022
We were discussing the summoning
of the victim as a witness.

577
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,608
Right. Let's do that.

578
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,818
Excuse me?

579
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,698
We're going through with the trial
so we might as well do it properly.

580
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,658
Is there something wrong?

581
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:09,909
Well…

582
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,288
No, sir.

583
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:26,092
So I was right. It is her.

584
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,761
Don't they look good together?

585
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,599
They're such a good-looking match.

586
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,520
Don't you think
Jun-ho likes Attorney Choi?

587
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,023
Right, I guess
you don't drink much coffee.

588
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,441
Actually, rather than coffee…

589
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,443
You don't know much about that, right?

590
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,949
I wonder where my other half is?

591
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,880
The next witness is the victim,
Lee Sun-yeong.

592
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,090
Witness, come out to the front.

593
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,863
ATTORNEYS, DEFENDANT

594
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,490
JURY

595
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,241
PROSECUTOR

596
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,207
"I pledge this."

597
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:45,421
"I solemnly swear to tell the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth,

598
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,299
and agree to receive punishment

599
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,135
in accordance with perjury
should there be any falsehood."

600
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,889
Counselor, you may begin
questioning the witness.

601
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,433
Hold on.

602
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,143
Attorney Choi, you go ahead.

603
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,270
What?

604
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:05,274
The jury is sympathetic to the victim,
so I don't think we should be too stiff.

605
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,485
Attorney Choi,
you go out there and be gentle.

606
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:08,820
All right.

607
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:31,050
Hello, Ms. Sun-yeong.

608
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:32,802
Hi.

609
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:36,389
I know it must be hard for you to have
to recall what happened five years ago,

610
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,808
but thank you
for being here today as a witness.

611
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,146
You have a lot of bruises and wounds.

612
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,189
How did you get hurt?

613
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,566
Objection.

614
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,359
This is irrelevant to the case.

615
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,111
How long are you going to
exchange niceties?

616
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:53,489
Your Honor, please allow me
to question her a bit more.

617
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,782
It's related to the case.

618
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,828
Since she says it's relevant,
we'll keep listening for now.

619
00:33:58,911 --> 00:33:59,787
Overruled.

620
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,587
Could you tell us how you got injured?

621
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,880
Well…

622
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,798
Yes, well…

623
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:11,966
Did your…

624
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,469
husband hit you?

625
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:15,678
Objection!

626
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,180
This is irrelevant to the case!

627
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:20,141
There are police records
that say the police were called

628
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,310
two days before the incident
on November 6th, 2017,

629
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,103
as Lee Sun-yeong was
assaulted by her husband.

630
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:28,524
Differentiating whether her injuries
were caused by the defendant's assault

631
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,861
or caused by her husband is important.

632
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,946
Please let us check
the factual relationship.

633
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,574
I see what you're saying, Counselor.

634
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:41,412
So stick to questions about what
happened at the time of the incident.

635
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:45,166
No more questions about current injuries.

636
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,167
Yes, sir.

637
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,170
I'll ask you again.

638
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:53,382
Witness, do you recall the police
being called to your house

639
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:56,719
on November 6th, 2017?

640
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,639
If you're talking about 2017…

641
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,558
that's already five years ago.

642
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,521
I do not recall.

643
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:10,441
That day, your husband hit you,

644
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:13,027
so the landlord,
who lives below you, called the police.

645
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:17,448
Here are the police records.
Do you not recall?

646
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,577
I do not recall.

647
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,955
Pure lies!

648
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,708
Have you gotten dumb from being
beaten up by your husband?

649
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,544
What are you doing? Stop talking!

650
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,964
Defendant, what did you say?

651
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:36,175
She wasn't beaten by us that much.

652
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:40,012
Even if we wanted to, we didn't have
the time because the police arrived.

653
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:45,017
But look at that wretched thing
with her ulterior motive.

654
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:48,938
She's trying to frame the beatings

655
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,482
she usually gets
from her husband all on me!

656
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,986
It's all a lie!

657
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,529
Your Honor.

658
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:59,699
The defendant is insulting the victim,
making a mockery of the court,

659
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,701
and is showing absolutely
no remorse for her wrongdoings!

660
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,287
Yes.

661
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,955
I see that.

662
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,832
You're absolutely right.

663
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,084
Your Honor--

664
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,255
You have to raise your hand first.

665
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,423
What?

666
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,009
In this trial, attorneys
have to raise their hand first

667
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,510
if they have something to say.

668
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,388
We can't speak before the judge
gives us permission to speak.

669
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:24,015
Why?

670
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:28,853
I think it's because his family origin
is the Ryu family of Pungsan.

671
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,819
What is it?

672
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,070
Right.

673
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,780
Your Honor, we apologize.

674
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,867
The defendant is not used to trials,
so she lost her control

675
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,493
and said things she didn't mean.

676
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:48,581
Could we have a recess
so the defendant can settle down?

677
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:51,292
Prosecution, do you have anything
to ask the witness?

678
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,376
Well…

679
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,503
No.

680
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:55,713
I don't.

681
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:59,425
Witness, you may go home.

682
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,387
I will not allow the victim
and the defendant

683
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,640
to meet in this courtroom again.

684
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,517
We'll have a ten-minute recess.

685
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,561
All rise.

686
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:12,980
Defendant.

687
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,942
Get a hold of yourself!

688
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,250
You can't get in our way.

689
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,542
Get in your way?

690
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,211
You were beating around the bush,

691
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,671
so I pointed it out.

692
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,839
You pointed it out
and look at what happened.

693
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,259
There is an order
and formality in a trial.

694
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,551
This isn't some marketplace fight.

695
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,847
Please help us
go through with our strategy.

696
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,224
Some marketplace fight?

697
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:52,979
If an attorney does it, it's strategy,
but if I do it, it's a marketplace fight?

698
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,897
What do you think I am?

699
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:58,150
-Attorney Jung didn't mean it like that.
-Didn't mean it like what?

700
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:01,028
Are you siding with him
because you're an attorney too?

701
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:05,783
I did it because I was too frustrated
to just sit still and watch!

702
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,702
Whoa, whoa.

703
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,288
Whoa, whoa.

704
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:13,499
This trial isn't for you
to release your frustration.

705
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:15,459
It's to get a reduction on your sentence.

706
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,420
Think of your daughter
who is waiting for you at the orphanage.

707
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,922
If you want to see Ha-yun
as quickly as possible,

708
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,674
you have to listen to us.

709
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,218
Whoa, whoa.

710
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,469
Whoa, whoa.

711
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,595
Whoa, whoa.

712
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,848
Whoa, whoa. Good job.

713
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,099
Stop.

714
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,435
The doctor is next, right?

715
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:33,394
Yes.

716
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,938
We're lucky if he accepts
without reservation

717
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,982
that the injuries
could've come from the husband.

718
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,609
But if he says otherwise,
we'll have to go in strong too.

719
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,864
Emphasize that the witness
is biased against North Korean defectors

720
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:46,324
to discredit him.

721
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:48,868
This time…

722
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,748
Attorney Woo, you go.

723
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:54,915
Because…

724
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:56,876
I'm stiff?

725
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,878
Yes. Show us what you got.

726
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,006
Okay.

727
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,007
WITNESS

728
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,803
This is the diagnosis of the injuries

729
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:11,682
you wrote five years ago
after seeing the victim yourself.

730
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,018
Could you read the underlined part?

731
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,770
Yes.

732
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,022
"Fourteen days of treatment needed

733
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:21,609
for sprains and strain of the cervical
spine from the date of diagnosis."

734
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:25,654
"Lacerations and bruises all over the body
due to indiscriminate assault."

735
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:30,201
"Damage to the hair roots and scalp
caused by excessive pulling of the hair."

736
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:34,789
What do you think
the cause of these symptoms is?

737
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,082
Right.

738
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:42,380
The assault by the defendant
sitting over there and her accomplice.

739
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:44,382
That is all.

740
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,301
Counselor, you may
begin cross-examination.

741
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:56,644
On November 6th, 2017,
two days before the incident,

742
00:39:56,727 --> 00:40:01,148
the police were called because
Ms. Lee was assaulted by her husband.

743
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:04,318
When you issued your diagnosis,
were you aware of this fact?

744
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,112
No, I wasn't.

745
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:10,491
So now that you do, do you think
the injuries of Ms. Lee Sun-yeong

746
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:14,870
could've been caused by her
husband's assault, not the defendant?

747
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,456
No.

748
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,627
I still think the defendant is to blame.

749
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,254
Why is that?

750
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:26,048
It's not like the name of the person
responsible is written on injuries.

751
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,967
I can tell by looking at the injuries.

752
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,636
Because I'm a doctor.

753
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:34,723
Could you explain how you know
based on medical facts?

754
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:39,854
I've already given a doctor's opinion.

755
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:44,733
What more do I have to do

756
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,529
if you ask me to base it on
even more medical facts?

757
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,791
-Push him into a corner.
-Okay.

758
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:04,336
Early 2018.

759
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:10,134
You wrote this piece for a newspaper.
Could you please read the title out loud?

760
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,385
Objection.

761
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,137
This is irrelevant to the case.

762
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,601
-Speak.
-The first sentence of this piece is,

763
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:23,022
"A Korean woman who was assaulted
by North Korean defectors came to see me."

764
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:27,568
The piece directly mentions the incident,
which means this piece is relevant.

765
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,279
Objection overruled.

766
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:32,323
Counselor, continue.

767
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,534
Witness, please read
the title of the piece.

768
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,245
Your Honor.

769
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,665
Could I not talk about this?

770
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,001
Are you refusing to testify?

771
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,044
For what reason?

772
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:48,214
I've received a lot of hatred
and criticism after I wrote this.

773
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,884
I received hate comments,
phone complaints,

774
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,761
and even threatening letters.

775
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:59,892
Unfortunately, none of those fall
under the reasons for refusal to testify.

776
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,645
Read the title of the piece.

777
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:09,985
"North Korean defectors
are becoming a criminal group."

778
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,324
The witness argues
that "in Korean society,

779
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,785
North Korean defectors
are already a huge issue,"

780
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:21,539
and that "the government giving
North Korean defectors funds to settle

781
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:26,126
is like providing criminals
with an incentive for criminal acts."

782
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,253
Is this correct?

783
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:28,337
I mean…

784
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:31,882
Well,

785
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:37,763
I'm not biased or anything like that.
The statistics speak for themselves.

786
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:41,809
Do you have any idea what the violent
crime rate of North Korean defectors is?

787
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,227
As much as ten percent.

788
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:47,356
More than twice the average
crime rate of South Koreans.

789
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:52,069
The rate of second offenders
is also more than five times as much.

790
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:55,447
Do you still think that North Korean
defectors aren't a criminal group?

791
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:58,576
So then, is your opinion on being
able to tell who caused the injury

792
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,537
just by looking at the victim's injury

793
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:04,665
unrelated to your usual thoughts
about North Korean defectors?

794
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,001
What?

795
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,168
You're saying

796
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,839
the defendant is more at fault
than the victim's husband, correct?

797
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,173
Because the husband is South Korean,

798
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,925
but the defendant
is a North Korean defector.

799
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,594
Objection. Leading.

800
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:19,305
Sustained.

801
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,646
But honestly,

802
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:31,317
is it right to make an abusive husband
out of a normal South Korean man

803
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,696
just to do something good
for North Korean defectors?

804
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,239
What?

805
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:41,452
This trial is done
with the tax paid by the citizens.

806
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:45,748
So the trial should protect them,
not that North Korean defector!

807
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:50,002
Take it easy. The jury is on our side now.

808
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:59,303
While I respect your opinion,

809
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,723
North Korean defectors
are citizens of South Korea as well.

810
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,267
That's why we're having this trial.

811
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,270
Yes, well…

812
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,022
That's right.

813
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:28,707
You're eating?

814
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:33,003
You messed things up, yet you're eating?

815
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:38,384
How can you eat, you idiot?

816
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:41,720
-What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?
-You're the one who's crazy.

817
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:45,849
Do you have any idea how hard
I worked to get the GRD as our client?

818
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,142
The GRD?

819
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,394
Yes, you punk!

820
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:51,939
The Group of Righteous Doctors,
the GRD! You blew it!

821
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,820
You put Kwon Byeong-gil
on the witness stand

822
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,279
without knowing that
he's an executive of the GRD?

823
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:02,574
Do you know what I had to deal with
from the Chairman just now?

824
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,284
You don't!

825
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:07,287
Kwon Byeong-gil said
he didn't want to talk about the piece.

826
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:12,418
But the attorneys at Hanbada
insisted that he talk about it!

827
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:14,628
Gosh.

828
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:17,464
Gosh!

829
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:20,676
Is this because of a public interest case
you're doing with the rookies?

830
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:22,636
Myeong-seok.

831
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:25,973
How could someone with your level
of experience make such a mistake?

832
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:28,600
How could you cost us a client

833
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:31,937
who's worth billions
over some mere public interest case?

834
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,819
Okay, I understand. You can stop now.

835
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,071
The one peer I have

836
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:44,450
that should be helping me
is bringing harm to me instead!

837
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:46,118
Gosh, this is so annoying!

838
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:48,454
I'm the only one worried about the firm!

839
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:06,847
I'm sorry for not running
a background check on the witness.

840
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:11,185
I'm sorry for making you
lose a client that's worth billions.

841
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,271
It's nothing for rookies to apologize for.

842
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:15,272
It's my mistake.

843
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:22,112
It's my fault and I'm really
embarrassed right now.

844
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,572
But let's not think of it as

845
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:28,827
"some mere public interest case"
or "some mere North Korean defector."

846
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:32,498
Let's work hard even if it's not a case

847
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,501
that's worth billions of won.

848
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,211
Yes.

849
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:38,795
Yes.

850
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:39,838
All right.

851
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,299
Finish your food.

852
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,927
I'm going to go because I'm embarrassed.

853
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:02,569
ESTABLISHMENT OF LAW AND ORDER

854
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,552
-Mom!
-Ha-yun.

855
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,554
-Mom!
-Ha-yun.

856
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:29,763
Mom!

857
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,058
Mom!

858
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,227
Mommy's sorry.

859
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,645
Mom.

860
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:41,108
Mommy's sorry, Ha-yun.

861
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,165
Ha-yun.

862
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:58,917
You're doing well!

863
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:03,797
You did great.

864
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,262
Let's eat the gimbap.

865
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:12,681
WHITE 480, BLUE 680

866
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:14,683
EXCELLENCE AWARD, EFFORT AWARD
CONCESSION AWARD

867
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:16,935
FAMILY SPORTS DAY WITH DREAMS AND HOPE

868
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:22,065
Here, Young-woo. Have some fruit.

869
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:26,028
No.

870
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,446
My son is too handsome.

871
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,158
Young-woo? Here, hold it.

872
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,587
-Dad.
-Yes?

873
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:48,216
Why don't I have a mom?

874
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,820
The statutory penalty for injury resulting
from robbery is too high.

875
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:10,489
Murder is five years at the least.

876
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:12,616
It doesn't make sense
for this charge to be seven years.

877
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,787
Why don't we file for an adjudication
on the constitutionality of the law?

878
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,790
If the Constitutional Court
finds this to be unconstitutional,

879
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:21,458
Hyang-sim can be acquitted.

880
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,543
That already happened a few times before.

881
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,254
In 2001, 2006, and 2016.

882
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,131
And? They all didn't work?

883
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,051
No, they were seen
as being constitutional.

884
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,308
A North Korean defector
is technically a kind of refugee, right?

885
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:42,771
Aren't there any laws that are generous
to refugees, immigrants, or foreigners?

886
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:43,814
No.

887
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:45,982
Think carefully. Is there really nothing?

888
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:54,825
There's none.
And there shouldn't be anything like that.

889
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:58,328
It's like giving a criminal license
to refugees, immigrants, or foreigners.

890
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,166
Then what else could there be?

891
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,752
Young-woo, you're a genius.

892
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,087
Think of something!

893
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:19,975
It is a bit far-fetched,
but there is one thing I can think of.

894
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:21,810
What is it?

895
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:23,603
It's North Korean law.

896
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:25,731
North Korean law?

897
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:28,734
Yes, there is robbery
in North Korea as well.

898
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:32,988
Article 288 of North Korean criminal law.
Robbery of personal property.

899
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:35,532
"Someone who has robbed personal property

900
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:38,410
by means of assault
or threat to a person's life or health

901
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:41,288
will be sentenced to a maximum of
four years in a correctional labor camp."

902
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:43,832
But according to Criminal Law

903
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:46,376
published by the Kim Il Sung
University Publishers,

904
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,129
North Korea's crime of robbery,
in comparison to South Korea,

905
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:52,007
requires a high level of intensity
in the assault and threats.

906
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:56,261
The assault should be intense enough
to kill or seriously injure

907
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:59,639
and threats should be one of assault
that will result in immediate death

908
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,183
or serious injuries

909
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:04,644
unless the victim does not comply
with the criminal's requests.

910
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:08,231
If the assault and threats
do not meet these standards,

911
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:10,066
the crime of robbery cannot be established

912
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:13,403
and it would merely fall under
the crime of stealing personal property.

913
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:16,156
A crime of stealing personal property?

914
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,325
"Article 284 of North Korean
criminal law."

915
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,993
"A crime of stealing personal property."

916
00:51:20,076 --> 00:51:21,745
"Someone who has stolen
personal property will be sentenced

917
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:24,206
to a maximum of one year
of labor discipline."

918
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:27,125
Your Honor, please focus on the sentence.

919
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,919
Robbery of personal property

920
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:31,004
is a maximum of four years
of correctional labor camp.

921
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:33,715
In other words, a maximum
of four years of imprisonment.

922
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,009
But the sentence
for stealing personal property

923
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:38,970
is a maximum of one year
of labor discipline.

924
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,765
In South Korea, this would merely
be a sentence of a maximum

925
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:43,809
of one year of community service.

926
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:47,521
That's enough lecture on North Korean law.

927
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:51,107
So what are you trying to claim?

928
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,777
The defendant is more
used to North Korean law

929
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,362
than she is to South Korean law.

930
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:59,157
The defendant only tried to get back
the money she was supposed to get.

931
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:03,119
There was no intention to rob the money
by oppressing the victim's free will.

932
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,956
Moreover, she did not think
that she would be

933
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:08,041
sentenced to a life sentence

934
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:10,710
or a minimum of seven years
of imprisonment because of her action.

935
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,587
Because in North Korea,

936
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:16,800
the defendant's actions aren't enough
to establish the crime of robbery.

937
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:21,263
So the attorneys are claiming

938
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,974
that since the defendant thought
"this isn't robbery in North Korea,

939
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:26,226
so I'm not committing robbery."

940
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:28,270
Is that what you're saying?

941
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:32,190
Your Honor, this is the most unprecedented
logic that's ever been heard.

942
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:35,610
It's true that it's unprecedented.

943
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:38,405
But perhaps we should look into it.

944
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:40,657
Defendant.

945
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:45,996
Did you think your action wasn't robbery

946
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:50,125
because you were more
used to North Korean law?

947
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:54,754
Well…

948
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:55,755
Yes.

949
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:57,340
Is that so?

950
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:01,887
What were you going to do
if the victim didn't hand you the money?

951
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:06,766
Didn't you think of getting it
even if you had to force her?

952
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:09,895
Your Honor…

953
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,271
Your Honor.

954
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:15,025
Could you please
once again notify the defendant

955
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:16,735
of her right to refuse to testify?

956
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:18,236
Of course.

957
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,405
Defendant, you don't have to answer.

958
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:25,410
But I would like to ask
so we can have a fair trial.

959
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:29,122
Defendant, could you respond?

960
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,265
I went there

961
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:49,267
to get it at all costs.

962
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:52,103
That was my money.

963
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:55,774
Yes.

964
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:57,651
Well…

965
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:02,572
What do you think of
what the attorneys claimed just now?

966
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:06,451
Did you really think that you should
threaten the victim only enough

967
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:11,831
so that robbery wouldn't be established
according to North Korean law?

968
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:14,209
I'm not sure.

969
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:16,962
I honestly don't know

970
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,799
all that about North Korean law.

971
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,219
I see.

972
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:38,608
That is all.

973
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:46,866
All right, that concludes the defense.

974
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:50,036
Juries, please start your review.

975
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,622
I will give a verdict after that.

976
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:54,374
All rise.

977
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:09,097
I'm headed back to the office.
Are you coming with me?

978
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,808
I'll stay for the verdict.

979
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:12,726
Me too.

980
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:13,768
Okay, then.

981
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,937
Stay with the defendant until the end.

982
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:19,357
No matter the result,
you two did your best.

983
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:35,623
Attorney comrades.

984
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:38,710
Why the long face?

985
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:43,006
She doesn't mean it literally.

986
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,550
I'm sorry.

987
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:47,886
Gosh, what are you sorry for?

988
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:50,263
Then

989
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:52,223
has it already been decided

990
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:54,267
that I'll be sent to prison?

991
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:57,562
No. Get some rest
and we'll see you at the verdict.

992
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:04,360
Come this way.

993
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:41,439
There's a claim that we haven't tried yet.

994
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,983
Adjudication on the
constitutionality of the law.

995
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,068
What?

996
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,403
You said other people tried it

997
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:48,863
and they were seen
as being constitutional.

998
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,076
Wait.

999
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:54,244
Young-woo!

1000
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:55,703
Hey!

1001
00:56:57,997 --> 00:56:59,499
Where are you going?

1002
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:05,213
The jurors are already reviewing.
What can you do at this point?

1003
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:07,298
The verdict hasn't been given yet.

1004
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:08,925
Then we can still request
the resumption of the hearing.

1005
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,135
We're going to go meet the judge.

1006
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,345
You can't enter the judge's chambers
without a visitor's permit.

1007
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:14,013
We can ask for visitor's permits.

1008
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,266
They don't just give it to you.

1009
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:18,143
You need the judge's permission.

1010
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:20,603
Do you think he'll give you permission?

1011
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:21,521
Hey!

1012
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:31,531
Hello, we're attorneys. We would
like to visit one of the judges' chambers.

1013
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:32,866
-Which one?
-Ryu--

1014
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:35,201
Chief Judge Choi Bo-yeon's
chambers on the eighth floor.

1015
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,078
What's the purpose of your visit?

1016
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:38,830
Is he expecting you?

1017
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,124
It's a personal errand.

1018
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,547
Judge Choi Bo-yeon is my father.

1019
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:50,300
This is my colleague
and we're here for an errand.

1020
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:51,426
Just a moment.

1021
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:54,888
This is the access desk.

1022
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:57,807
A woman who says she's
Judge Choi's daughter is hoping to visit

1023
00:57:57,891 --> 00:57:59,851
and I was wondering
if this was prearranged.

1024
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:01,686
Your name?

1025
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:03,021
Choi Su-yeon.

1026
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:04,439
Attorney Choi Su-yeon.

1027
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,443
Yes. All right.

1028
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:12,530
Write down your name and
purpose of visit here, and you can go in.

1029
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:25,251
SUPREME COURT OF KOREA

1030
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,214
Do you know what all that's for?

1031
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:30,924
To stop people like us.

1032
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:33,676
To stop people from trying to plead their
case to a judge outside the courtroom.

1033
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,970
We're not trying to plead our case
to the judge outside the courtroom.

1034
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:38,223
We're just trying to request
the resumption of the hearing.

1035
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:40,391
Would the prosecutor see it that way?

1036
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:42,727
I can't believe I let Wild Card
Woo Young-woo talk me into this.

1037
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:45,855
Excuse me.

1038
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,733
We're here to see Judge Ryu Myeong-ha!

1039
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:50,193
Who are you?

1040
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:57,116
What is this?

1041
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,202
How did you get in here?

1042
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:02,455
Your Honor. We would like to request
the resumption of the hearing.

1043
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:06,501
Don't you know the juries
are reviewing right now?

1044
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:09,254
We do. But we had no choice
but to come see you,

1045
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:11,172
even though we knew it was rude.

1046
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:13,758
It's too late for us to submit a request
form for a resumption of the hearing.

1047
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:14,926
No.

1048
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:18,888
If you're not satisfied
with something, you can appeal.

1049
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,900
What is it?

1050
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:34,237
The defendant ultimately
never got the money from the victim.

1051
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,907
It's unconstitutional for this to be on
trial for injury resulting from robbery.

1052
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:41,160
Please allow for the resumption
of the hearing.

1053
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:45,540
Attempted injury resulting from robbery
does not mean robbery was attempted.

1054
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:46,708
There must be an attempt to cause injury

1055
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:48,960
in order for this charge
to be established.

1056
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:51,087
Isn't there room
for a different interpretation?

1057
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:54,215
An attempted injury resulting from robbery
charge is more favorable to the defendant

1058
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:55,758
than an injury resulting
from robbery charge.

1059
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:57,468
And criminal law prohibits
any reduced interpretation of a law

1060
00:59:57,552 --> 01:00:00,597
that is favorable
to the defendant without reason.

1061
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,600
Are you going to trial
because you don't want to yield?

1062
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:08,313
Are you saying little strokes
don't fell great oaks?

1063
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:11,858
First, you claimed the victim's injuries
are not the defendant's fault.

1064
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:16,487
Then you bring up North Korean law to say
there wasn't any intention in the robbery.

1065
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,281
Now, it's unconstitutional
for the defendant to be tried

1066
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:21,451
for injury resulting from robbery
because she didn't get the money?

1067
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:23,995
Are you kidding me?

1068
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:28,207
Darn it.

1069
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,001
CHIEF JUDGE RYU MYEONG-HA

1070
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:37,800
I understand you're passionate
as young attorneys.

1071
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:38,885
However,

1072
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:42,847
there is a time and place
to be passionate.

1073
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:45,350
It's not because we're young attorneys.

1074
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:49,479
It's because Ms. Gye Hyang-sim
is a great mother.

1075
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:51,522
Like a mother whale.

1076
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:53,900
What?

1077
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:57,070
Ms. Gye Hyang-sim lacks common sense
and does whatever she pleases.

1078
01:00:57,695 --> 01:01:01,991
Even now, it doesn't seem like
she fully understands what she did wrong.

1079
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:06,287
But Ms. Gye Hyang-sim
chose to be a fugitive for five years

1080
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:08,498
to not abandon her child.

1081
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:12,126
Maternal instinct is not
a reason for mitigation,

1082
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:16,172
but I beg you to think of
the circumstance of a great mother

1083
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:20,093
who thought she had to raise
her daughter before going to prison

1084
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:23,262
so that she would be old enough
to remember her mother

1085
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:26,474
once she was released.

1086
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:38,611
This is an argument made out of court.

1087
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:42,699
I'm not going to hear any more of this
or reflect it on the verdict.

1088
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:44,659
I won't allow for the resumption
of the hearing either.

1089
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:49,706
If you both don't leave right now,
I will call a bailiff.

1090
01:01:57,422 --> 01:02:02,135
The most famous way of hunting whales
is to kill the baby first.

1091
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:05,096
They throw a harpoon at the weak baby,

1092
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:08,015
and as the baby
is swimming around in pain,

1093
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:11,227
the mother never leaves its side.

1094
01:02:12,603 --> 01:02:15,356
She can't abandon her baby
that is in pain.

1095
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:17,316
That's when

1096
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:19,986
the second harpoon is thrown

1097
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:22,655
at the mother that is the ultimate target.

1098
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:25,742
Humans.

1099
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:28,244
Whales are intelligent.

1100
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:32,623
She knows that she will also be killed
if she doesn't abandon her baby.

1101
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:35,960
But she never does.

1102
01:02:38,796 --> 01:02:41,174
If I were a whale,

1103
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:45,887
would my mom not have abandoned me?

1104
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:09,911
All rise.

1105
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,000
Be seated.

1106
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:24,217
Jury, did you finish up the review?

1107
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,177
Will you hand me the written verdict?

1108
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:44,862
I will announce the jury's review.

1109
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:48,366
On the charges.

1110
01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:51,786
By unanimous decision of the
indictment of all seven jurors, guilty.

1111
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,038
Opinion on sentencing.

1112
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:57,375
By unanimous decision
of the indictment of all seven jurors,

1113
01:03:57,458 --> 01:03:58,751
four years of imprisonment.

1114
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:02,421
Thank you, members of the jury.

1115
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:08,761
This court sincerely
respects the jury's verdict.

1116
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:11,305
Now, for the verdict.

1117
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:13,307
Stand up.

1118
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:17,812
Formal adjudication.

1119
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:21,774
The defendant is sentenced to one year
and nine months of imprisonment.

1120
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:27,822
However, the execution of the sentence
against the defendant

1121
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:31,367
is suspended for three years
following the date of the verdict.

1122
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:36,205
The court orders
that the defendant be on probation

1123
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:38,541
and 80 hours of community service.

1124
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:43,087
What is he saying?

1125
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:45,214
Probation!

1126
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:46,340
What?

1127
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,010
Probation…

1128
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:52,555
The nature of this crime
offending as the defendant colluded

1129
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:55,474
with an accomplice
and assaulted and threatened the victim

1130
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:58,686
with the intention
to take property by force.

1131
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:02,148
Considering the fear the victim
must've felt during the crime

1132
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:06,485
and how the defendant fled
after the crime without being tried,

1133
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:09,488
it is necessary
to punish the defendant severely.

1134
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:13,618
However, considering that the defendant

1135
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:17,413
is not used to South Korean laws and
regulations as a North Korean defector,

1136
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:20,207
is a first-time offender
without a criminal record,

1137
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,084
and most importantly…

1138
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:29,133
although it has been five years,

1139
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:32,178
she has confessed
without forgetting her crimes,

1140
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,847
with the intent of receiving punishment.

1141
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,850
Thus, the court is taking into
account these special sentencing factors.

1142
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:45,900
Right.

1143
01:05:46,692 --> 01:05:47,818
Confession.

1144
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:49,987
Yes, she confessed.

1145
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:51,530
That's right.

1146
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:55,826
Sentencing elements that are advantageous
or disadvantageous to the defendant…

1147
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:59,497
We were focused on something else
that we forgot Hyang-sim had confessed.

1148
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:03,084
Confession is the most basic reason
for mitigation. I can't believe we forgot.

1149
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:04,961
We're idiots.

1150
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:07,129
Perhaps the judge is the smart one.

1151
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:10,549
The cleverness of a veteran.

1152
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:13,386
"The cleverness of a veteran."

1153
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:17,306
Through a trial by jury,

1154
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,809
following the law regarding
juries in criminal trials,

1155
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:21,936
the ruling is as the formal adjudication.

1156
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:25,439
Thank you.

1157
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,150
Thank you.

1158
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:31,362
Thank you.

1159
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:37,076
Thank you.

1160
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:10,651
Mom, put that down.

1161
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:12,319
Look at this. Isn't it so pretty?

1162
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:14,864
Gosh, it's too short for me.
You try it on.

1163
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:16,824
-Mom, try it on.
-It looks good on you.

1164
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:17,742
Just this once.

1165
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:20,536
No, this is too expensive.

1166
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:22,204
Come on, I'll get it for you.

1167
01:07:24,665 --> 01:07:27,168
The headquarters has been marketing
toward the younger generation,

1168
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:29,462
so we have more customers
who bring their daughters with them.

1169
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:30,421
I see.

1170
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:31,839
Do you have a daughter?

1171
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:34,967
No, just a son.

1172
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,302
I see.

1173
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:39,764
Then you must be envious whenever
you see a mother and daughter shopping.

1174
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:42,850
It's not too late for you
to have a daughter.

1175
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:52,902
Just stand by me and look.

1176
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:55,321
It's very expensive
to buy that brand at full price.

1177
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:57,907
If I miss this sale,
I'll never be able to buy it, okay?

1178
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:00,409
What?

1179
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:03,245
-You should buy one too.
-I'm fine.

1180
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:06,123
Buy a bag. Stop using
the same one every day.

1181
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:07,625
I don't like department stores.

1182
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:09,502
You're going to like them now.

1183
01:08:11,712 --> 01:08:13,672
This is exciting.

1184
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:46,747
What are you doing?

1185
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:47,832
Let's go.

1186
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:49,667
Again?

1187
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:02,221
-I still have more things to see.
-Let's go home.

1188
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:03,430
Why?

1189
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:19,822
It's splitting the town in half
and isolating each side.

1190
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:23,826
It's not a neighborhood
that can just disappear like that.

1191
01:09:23,909 --> 01:09:26,537
Are these all materials on Haengbok-ro?

1192
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:28,205
That's Attorney Tae Su-mi, right?

1193
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:30,124
-Why is the king here herself?
-"King"?

1194
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:34,295
-I think Jun-ho likes you.
-It's not easy for someone to like me.

1195
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:37,256
-Does your heart pound like crazy?
-There was a time when it did.

1196
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:38,716
You totally like him!

1197
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:42,178
I want to check whether or not I like you.

1198
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:48,350
