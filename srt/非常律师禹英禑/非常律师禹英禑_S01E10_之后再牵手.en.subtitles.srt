1
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,449
Hey!

2
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,242
Stop right there!

3
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,413
Hey!

4
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,793
Let go!

5
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,836
You're going to hurt yourself. Hold still!

6
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,298
What's your problem?
I didn't do anything wrong!

7
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,425
Then why did you run away?

8
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,220
You ran because you know what you did.

9
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,643
Damn it! Do you have a warrant?

10
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,144
Tell me. Do you have a warrant?

11
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,355
You want to see a warrant?

12
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,440
I guess you watched a few cop shows.

13
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,734
Stop it already.
You can talk at the station.

14
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,362
It's an illegal arrest
if you don't have an arrest warrant.

15
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,825
Illegal arrest? You don't know
what you're talking about.

16
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,409
This is an emergency arrest.

17
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:01,746
This is a necessary capture
of a fugitive suspect.

18
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,500
We don't need a warrant
for these situations. Got it?

19
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,377
Even if it is an emergency arrest,

20
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,130
Article 200-5 of the Criminal
Procedure Act still applies.

21
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,215
"When arresting a suspect,
the prosecutor or judicial police officer

22
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,342
shall notify the suspect of the facts
of the suspected crime,

23
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,803
the reason for arrest,
their right to an attorney,

24
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,429
and give an opportunity
to justify oneself."

25
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,974
This is also called the Miranda Rights.
Are you not aware of this?

26
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,935
So I've just been illegally arrested?

27
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,897
The police illegally arrested a citizen!

28
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,482
You're filming all this right?

29
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,651
Post it on all your social media accounts.

30
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,696
Hey, why are you interrupting
official police duties?

31
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,906
Are you an attorney or something?

32
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,867
-Yes.
-What?

33
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,494
I'm Woo Young-woo,
an attorney at Hanbada Law Firm.

34
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,538
Whether it's read straight or flipped,
it's still Woo Young-woo.

35
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,623
Kayak, deed, rotator,
noon, racecar, Woo Young-woo.

36
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,132
-Detective Park, uncuff him.
-What?

37
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,300
Uncuff him!

38
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,136
Okay.

39
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,680
Now, Mr. Yang Jeong-il.

40
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,308
At this point,
you are under emergency arrest.

41
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:07,145
You have the right to remain silent
and to appoint an attorney.

42
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,647
You have the right to request the court
to review the legality of the arrest too.

43
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,191
-Would that be all?
-No.

44
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,236
You didn't inform him
of the charges for his arrest.

45
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,575
Quasi-rape of a person with disabilities.

46
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,119
-What?
-Are you serious?

47
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,246
-Goodness.
-What a piece of trash.

48
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,623
This piece-of-trash bastard

49
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,375
sexually assaulted a woman
with an intellectual disability!

50
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,378
Now, are we good here?

51
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:48,269
CASE 10
HOLDING HANDS CAN WAIT

52
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,279
What?

53
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,407
You really came.

54
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,743
Thank you so much.

55
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:07,622
You have no idea
how much I begged my parents

56
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:10,041
to get me the Kayak Deed attorney.

57
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,961
You're a total celebrity!
You were in the newspaper too.

58
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:16,464
The first autistic attorney
of the Republic of Korea, Kayak Deed!

59
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,174
My name is Woo Young-woo.

60
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,218
Of course, I know.

61
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:25,431
But for some reason,
I want to call you Attorney Kayak Deed.

62
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,101
Can I?

63
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,981
No. Call me Attorney Woo Young-woo.

64
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,649
Okay, Young-woo.

65
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:35,984
Mr. Yang Jeong-il.

66
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,987
You're charged with quasi-rape
of a person with disabilities.

67
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,739
Do you have any idea
how severe the punishment for that is?

68
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:45,743
The statutory penalty of typical rape
is three or more years of imprisonment,

69
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,537
but the rape of a person with disabilities

70
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,832
is a life sentence or a minimum
of seven years of imprisonment.

71
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,251
This isn't the time to talk about
stuff like "kayak" and "deed."

72
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,295
Do you not realize
how bad the situation is?

73
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,548
I really didn't do anything bad like that.

74
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:02,969
Yes, I had an HN with FFY, but rape?

75
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:07,598
Doesn't that involve hitting and swearing
and forcing yourself on that person?

76
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,475
"FFY"?

77
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,393
"HN"?

78
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,311
Right.

79
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,730
It's my pet name for Hye-yeong.

80
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,606
"FFY."

81
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,608
"Fool For Yang Jeong-il"

82
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,528
And "HN" means, wellâ€¦

83
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,071
You know.

84
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,532
"Hot Night."

85
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:28,036
Even if it is a pet name,
why would you choose the word "fool"

86
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,537
for someone
who is intellectually disabled?

87
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,039
She calls me a fool too.

88
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,415
"FFH."

89
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,126
"Fool For Hye-yeong"

90
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,544
What?

91
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:40,214
If you want the two to match,
shouldn't it be "FFS"?

92
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:43,968
The victim's name is Shin Hye-yeong.
Or change what you call her to "FFJ"--

93
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,470
Attorney Woo.

94
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,263
Is that really important right now?

95
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,557
No.

96
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,143
Hye-yeong and I

97
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,312
love each other.

98
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,897
Assailant and victim?

99
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,107
It's really nothing like that.

100
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,777
We understand that you didn't use
violence or threaten her

101
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,988
in order to engage
in sexual intercourse with her.

102
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,075
That's what Ms. Shin also said
during the police investigation.

103
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:10,870
But a sex offense can be established
even if there was no force involved.

104
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,081
The typical charge being quasi-rape.

105
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,040
And this case,

106
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,084
the Act on Special Cases Concerning
the Punishment of Sexual Crimes--

107
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,251
Right! PSC!

108
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,754
I know what that is!
The prosecutor always mentioned it.

109
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,380
Paragraph 4 of Article 6 states,

110
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,092
"A person who has sexual intercourse
with another person by taking advantage

111
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,843
of a person's inability to resist
or difficulty in resisting

112
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,679
due to physical or mental disability
can be punished."

113
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:33,059
So the prosecution believes
that you took advantage

114
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,561
of Ms. Shin's intellectual disability.

115
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,022
I didn't take advantage of anything!

116
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,899
I'm really not that kind of person!

117
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:43,194
You got Ms. Shin Hye-yeong to get
a credit card issued under her name

118
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:46,989
and had her pay the date expenses
that cost millions of won all by herself.

119
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,826
-Is that not taking advantage?
-Listen.

120
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,912
Gosh.

121
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,915
Hye-yeong is well-off.

122
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:59,085
So she paid for the dates
with her younger boyfriend.

123
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,336
Is that a crime?

124
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,258
Why did you join Eoulrim
when you don't even have a disability?

125
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,176
The group introduces itself as

126
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,719
"A gathering of people
with intellectual disabilities,

127
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,139
developmental disabilities, and autism."

128
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:14,225
That was for a good cause.

129
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:18,104
Groups like that usually need volunteers.

130
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,858
I was a member of Eoulrim
and I met Hye-yeong.

131
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,615
And it was love at first sight.

132
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:38,541
Why doesn't anybody believe me?

133
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,460
Is it because Hye-yeong is disabled?

134
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,338
A person without disabilities truly loving
a person with an intellectual disability.

135
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,882
Is it that hard to believe?

136
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,260
Who said that? We--

137
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:52,805
People with disabilities
are kind and innocent.

138
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,516
They're people
who fully deserve to be loved.

139
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,437
Attorney Kayak Deed would know.

140
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,564
Right?

141
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,872
Where did you pick up
such a troublesome case like this?

142
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,083
I picked it up on subway line two.

143
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,420
I can already picture
what must have happened.

144
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:29,258
You showed off by talking about
illegal arrests and warrants, didn't you?

145
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:32,595
You did.

146
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,347
This is why they say

147
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,849
nothing good comes from
letting people know you're an attorney.

148
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,479
Okay. From now on, I will try not to
let other people know I'm an attorney.

149
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:47,026
Sexual assault
usually happens in private, right?

150
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:50,196
So more often than not, the only evidence
is the victim's statement.

151
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,324
In that situation, what should be done
to defend the defendant?

152
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,078
Discredit the victim's statement.

153
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,288
But the victim is a person
with an intellectual disability.

154
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,040
Then, of course,

155
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:04,544
the victim's statement is more likely
to be neither specific nor consistent.

156
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,380
But despite knowing these circumstances,

157
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:10,716
you still have to discredit
the credibility of the victim's statement.

158
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,971
This is quite an unpleasant thing
to do as an attorney.

159
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:18,891
What if we get off this case now?

160
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:22,853
They can save on commission fees
if they go to a smaller law firm than us.

161
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,773
That sounds like a better option
for Mr. Yang's parents too.

162
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:29,902
I don't think that's a bad idea.
What about you, Attorney Woo?

163
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,322
Iâ€¦

164
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,995
I want to defend Mr. Yang Jeong-il.

165
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,788
Why?

166
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:43,416
What he's saying could be true.

167
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,378
You believe all that nonsense?

168
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,880
I want toâ€¦

169
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,675
believe it.

170
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:57,138
I want it to be true that he and Ms. Shin

171
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,474
are really in love.

172
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,402
If you want to believe
the defendant that bad,

173
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,446
then you should take it.

174
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,573
Proceed with the case.

175
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,408
Okay.

176
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,662
Attorney Choi, you too.

177
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,289
Excuse me?

178
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:28,669
You know it's easy to get emotional
when you want to believe the defendant.

179
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:34,300
Join Attorney Woo and "whoa, whoa" her

180
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,719
so she doesn't make that mistake.

181
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:38,721
"Whoa, whoa"?

182
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,432
Whoa. Please.

183
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,899
That's awesome.

184
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,692
Give me the details of the situation.

185
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:55,946
Including the air, sunlight, clouds, speed
of the wind, temperature, and humidity.

186
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,700
Soâ€¦

187
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,666
I like you.

188
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,005
I like you so much

189
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,675
that it feels likeâ€¦

190
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,137
I'm sick inside.

191
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,192
He's sick because he likes you!

192
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,903
Call the doctor! Call the ambulance!

193
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,989
Hello? Is this 911?

194
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,992
What? You're not just 911
but the 911 of love?

195
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:43,828
All right.

196
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,873
The problem is after that.

197
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,668
After liking each other.

198
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,254
What do I do now?

199
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:58,300
How did you respond to him
after he said he likes you?

200
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,052
Wellâ€¦

201
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:09,770
Kayak, deed, rotator,
noon, racecar, Yeoksam Station.

202
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,481
Yeoksam Station.

203
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,109
Attorney Woo!

204
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:27,329
So you ran away
after he expressed his feelings to you?

205
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,125
This punk dined and dashed.

206
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,334
Dined and dashed on love.

207
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:37,923
At the time, my mind turned blank.

208
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,426
So I just wanted to get away
from the situation.

209
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:43,888
I was rude, right?

210
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,806
Well, I wouldn't say you were rude--

211
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,183
More like weird.

212
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:52,146
Forget about it. Just do something
before it gets even worse.

213
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,023
What do I do?

214
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,566
You date Jun-ho.

215
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,778
Hey, how can you date someone right away
just because they said they like you?

216
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:03,449
You have to get to know each other first
by going on a few dates.

217
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,993
How do you do that?

218
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,411
Going on dates?

219
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,205
There's not much to it.

220
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,249
Get food, have tea,

221
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,585
watch movies, and sing karaoke.

222
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:17,421
Do things you think
would be fun to do together.

223
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,381
There's a lot to do if you look into it.

224
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,051
Look at you.

225
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:26,263
Hairy Boss, you know a lot of things
when you don't even have a girlfriend.

226
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,516
Do you go on imaginary dates?

227
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,604
I'm going to live aggressively
from now on.

228
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,481
If you know someone nice,
introduce me to him.

229
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:36,815
Because I'm going to win him over.

230
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,984
You're going to aggressively
win someone over?

231
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,945
I can think of someone.

232
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,698
He knows a lot about being nice.

233
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,617
He pulls out seats, opens car doors,

234
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,494
makes the person walk on the inside
of the street when walking together,

235
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,787
and carries their things.

236
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,288
Really?

237
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,459
Can I introduce you to a girlfriend?

238
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,587
-What?
-Hey, what about me?

239
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,713
Introduce me to someone too.

240
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:03,133
She's like an angel
in the spring sunshine who recently said

241
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,469
she's going to
aggressively win a good guy over.

242
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:10,808
Aggressive, win over, good guy,
spring sunshine, angel?

243
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,310
Gosh, she sounds amazing.

244
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,104
Hey, what about me?

245
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,564
What about me?

246
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,732
Youâ€¦

247
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,694
Hey.

248
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,487
So when will this be happening?

249
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,656
I have to go on a diet.

250
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,199
Me, first.

251
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,534
Wellâ€¦

252
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,620
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

253
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,830
That is all.

254
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,089
Counselor.

255
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,091
Give your opening statement.

256
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,136
Excuse me.

257
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,514
Can Attorney Kayak Deed defend me?

258
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,808
What?

259
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,143
Everyone here

260
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:55,644
is glaring at us.

261
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,774
I don't think they will be able to
once they know you're my attorney.

262
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,446
-What?
-Yes. The defendant has a point.

263
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,573
Attorney Woo,
you give the opening statement.

264
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,242
So that it doesn't look like a trial
between the disabled and non-disabled.

265
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,703
Are you not giving your statement?

266
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,788
I'm sorry. We'll get started right away.

267
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,833
Remember what you said
during your first trial?

268
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,377
To excuse you because you have autism.
Begin with that.

269
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:29,553
I have autism spectrum disorder.

270
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,312
Right.

271
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:43,192
So please excuse me if my speech seems
inarticulate and my actions awkward.

272
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:45,861
JURY

273
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:51,575
The defendant denies
all charges in this case.

274
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,619
The defendant, Mr. Yang,
and the victim, Ms. Shin,

275
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,120
are in a loving relationship

276
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,247
and engaged in consensual intercourse.

277
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,916
-What?
-Lies!

278
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:02,211
-Consensual?
-You call that love?

279
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,046
-What are you saying?
-What nonsense is that?

280
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,547
Goodness.

281
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,383
Silence in the court!

282
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,176
Do you not know courtroom etiquette?

283
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,931
Mr. Yang Jeong-il and Ms. Shin Hye-yeong

284
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:18,519
used an app called Alkongdalkong,
which was developed for couples.

285
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:23,148
On March 13th, the two
chatted on Alkongdalkong

286
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,068
and had the following conversation.

287
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:37,037
"FFH" is the defendant's pet name,
which means "Fool For Shin Hye-yeong,"

288
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:42,126
and "FFY" is the victim's pet name,
which means "Fool For Yang Jeong-il."

289
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:46,213
It's unfortunate that they did not match
the two by either last name or first name.

290
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,007
Anyway,

291
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,217
please look closely at their conversation.

292
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,431
FFH: FFY, DID YOU SLEEP WELL?
DO YOU WANT TO GO TO THE CK AND CFDT?

293
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,643
"Go to the CK and CFDT?"

294
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,478
"CK" means "Coin Karaoke."

295
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:05,107
"CFDT" means "Chicken For Dinner Tonight?"
Both are abbreviations.

296
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:09,236
"HN" is an abbreviation of "Hot Night,"
referring to sexual intercourse.

297
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,243
What about "Shine, shine"?

298
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,619
"Shine, shine"?

299
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,164
-What?
-Right.

300
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,667
Are you referring to the "Shiii shiii"
that comes after

301
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,294
"I don't know, I don't know"?

302
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,378
Right.

303
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,048
That's "Shiii, shiii"?

304
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,384
Yes, I think it's a modification
of the word "shy."

305
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:37,806
Similar modifications would be "When
will you be dun?" and "I miss ya."

306
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,266
Those I understand.

307
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,143
You don't have to explain.

308
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,150
Based on Ms. Shin's written statement,
the prosecution claims

309
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,153
on March 12th,
the day before these chat messages,

310
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,406
Mr. Yang Jeong-il sexually assaulted
Ms. Shin Hye-yeong.

311
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,576
But does this chat
that starts with "Did you sleep well?"

312
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,871
and ends with "I miss ya"
seem like a conversation

313
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:04,124
between a sexual assault victim
and the assailant?

314
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,752
Isn't it fair to see this

315
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:09,421
as a loving chat between a couple
who are deeply in love?

316
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,049
You have to read between the lines!

317
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:17,054
Calling each other by pet names
and saying "I miss you" doesn't mean love.

318
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:21,433
That gigolo-like bastard seduced Hye-yeong

319
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,519
then took her to karaoke and ate chicken!

320
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,854
He even took her to motels!

321
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:29,149
He was just enjoying himself!

322
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,026
What's going on today?

323
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,154
If you keep speaking up
without permission,

324
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,280
you'll be removed from the courtroom.

325
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:39,409
Your Honor, she is the victim's mother.

326
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,621
It was wrong of her to speak
without your permission, butâ€¦

327
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,958
That's how that bastard
played my daughter.

328
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,460
It's all up there, but what?

329
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,837
A loving chat?

330
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,423
How can you call yourself an attorney
when you can't even tell the difference?

331
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,675
Ma'am!

332
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,635
I said be quiet!

333
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,971
Sit down.

334
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,278
Attorney Woo?

335
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,364
Yes. You told me last time

336
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,075
that you have some information about her.

337
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,829
Right. It's nothing.

338
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,206
Come on. What is it?

339
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:29,960
Your face is saying otherwise.

340
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,256
Wellâ€¦

341
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,885
Someone wrote a post
on Hanbada's bulletin board

342
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,722
saying that the CEO went to university
with Attorney Woo's father,

343
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:46,101
so she gave her a job at Hanbada.

344
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,106
That's it?

345
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,232
What? Yes.

346
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,570
There's nothing about Tae Su-mi?

347
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,239
Tae Su-mi?

348
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,993
Apparently, Attorney Woo

349
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,580
is Tae Su-mi's daughter.

350
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:07,581
What?

351
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,291
What?

352
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,589
According to who?

353
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,776
Do you stillâ€¦

354
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,869
like me?

355
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,629
Yes, I do.

356
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,049
And I was hurt
when you just left like that last time.

357
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,511
Right.

358
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,054
About thatâ€¦

359
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:08,934
I'm sorry.

360
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,151
If you still like me,

361
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:25,284
what if we get to know each other better
before becoming an official couple?

362
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,869
Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

363
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,047
I researched things to do on dates
and made a list.

364
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,633
THINGS TO DO ON DATES

365
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:42,968
Goodness.

366
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,595
There's a lot.

367
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,724
-Yes.
-Wellâ€¦

368
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,768
Is taking you home not on here?

369
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,937
What?

370
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:54,980
It isn't.

371
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,398
Really?

372
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,983
Should I add it?

373
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:01,069
I'll take you home today.

374
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:01,987
Right.

375
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,156
Addâ€¦

376
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,242
-Okay.
-Let's go.

377
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:13,373
Then I'm assumingâ€¦

378
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:17,461
holding hands while taking you home
isn't on the list, right?

379
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,882
No. Even if it was on there,
holding hands is not easy for me.

380
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:24,426
My father often
wanted to hold my hand too,

381
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,262
but I could only bear it
for a maximum of 57 seconds.

382
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,597
Really?

383
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,016
What happens if you hold hands
for over 57 seconds?

384
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:35,020
I want to let go to the point
where it becomes unbearable if I don't.

385
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,898
Right, I see.

386
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,196
Do you want to hold hands

387
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,240
even if it is only for 57 seconds?

388
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,118
Are you sure?

389
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,378
I can't do it.

390
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:42,921
Right.

391
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:44,631
Okay.

392
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:46,925
I'm sorry.

393
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,677
No, it's all right.

394
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,848
I'll just take you home today then.

395
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,266
Holding hands can wait.

396
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,269
"Holding hands can wait."

397
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,670
What is the exact degree
of the victim's intellectual disability?

398
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:24,880
Wellâ€¦

399
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:28,300
Ms. Shin Hye-yeong has a mild
intellectual disability with an IQ of 65.

400
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:32,012
Through training, she is able to have
a social life and a job.

401
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:37,893
She has the developmental age
of a 13-year-old, so a 6th grader.

402
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,353
This is the victim's statement

403
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,063
that was written
during the police investigation process.

404
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,690
Have you seen this?

405
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:49,988
As a psychiatrist,
how do you feel about this statement?

406
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,824
Overall, I feel that it has credibility.

407
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:57,120
The descriptions of the circumstances
at the time of the assault are in detail

408
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:01,166
and her thoughts and emotions
are also expressed consistently.

409
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:03,877
The victim's thoughts and emotions?

410
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,338
Like what?

411
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:10,508
"When the sex began,
I started to feel bad."

412
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,510
"I was scared."

413
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,096
"I didn't like it because I thought
I would get in trouble with Mom."

414
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:18,183
She's expressing herself clearly.

415
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:22,979
Then why wasn't the victim
able to resist the defendant's actions?

416
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:28,610
The reason is written in the statement
without me having to speculate.

417
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:32,364
"I said no and he got upset.
He was about to cry."

418
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,324
"He said it wasn't true love."

419
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:38,578
People with intellectual disabilities
are especially vulnerable to violence

420
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:41,748
that takes advantage of relationships
or disguised as affection.

421
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:46,002
The victim seems to have been afraid
that she might lose this relationship

422
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,797
if she denied the unwanted sex.

423
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,301
And it's highly likely that she didn't
know how to refuse in the first place.

424
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,180
Yes, that is all.

425
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:02,060
Counselor, begin cross-examination.

426
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:11,861
Witness.

427
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:15,031
Have you seen the chats between
the defendant and Ms. Shin?

428
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,825
No, I haven't.

429
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,286
According to the prosecution's claim,

430
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:23,498
the defendant
raped Ms. Shin on March 12th.

431
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:24,582
That day,

432
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:28,003
Ms. Shin said the following
to the defendant on chat.

433
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,547
Could you read the underlined sentences?

434
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,928
"I love you. I miss ya."

435
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,973
"I've been waiting for you to text me
for a while now."

436
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:42,142
"Let's always be together."

437
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,185
Such affectionate expressions

438
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,646
are not only seen
on the chat on March 12th.

439
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,273
The chat between the two

440
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,984
is full of Ms. Shin's expressions
of love for the defendant

441
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:55,739
until the day he was arrested
and was no longer able to chat.

442
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:58,366
What do you think about this?

443
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,743
I think it's awfullyâ€¦

444
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,621
heartbreaking.

445
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,374
Excuse me?

446
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:11,379
We all want to love and be loved.

447
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:15,050
It's the same for people
with intellectual disabilities too.

448
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,595
Rather, the desire is even greater.

449
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,597
Because in most cases,

450
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:24,601
it's harder for them to get the attention
or affection they want from others.

451
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:30,857
Can't you tell from Ms. Shin Hye-yeong's
earnest expressions of love here?

452
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,864
The problem is that, with people
who have intellectual disabilities,

453
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,075
there are many situations
where they misunderstand

454
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:43,661
an impure motive toward them
as pure affection.

455
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,874
Their ability to distinguish
between normal and improper relationships

456
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,000
is sometimes lacking as well.

457
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:53,254
In that sense, it's hard to say
that Ms. Shin Hye-yeong

458
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:57,008
has sound decision-making capabilities
when it comes to sex.

459
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:03,014
You just said that Ms. Shin Hye-yeong's
statement is consistent and detailed.

460
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:04,766
But now you're saying

461
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:08,728
she can't tell the difference between
normal and improper relationships.

462
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,898
She is able to write credible statements

463
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,692
but doesn't have decision-making
capabilities about sex.

464
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,653
Isn't that too vague of a diagnosis?

465
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:19,197
What exactly is Ms. Shin's condition?

466
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,573
I'mâ€¦

467
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:24,911
talking about the ability
to protect oneself.

468
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,580
Anyone can experience what they thought
was a loving relationship

469
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:32,419
actually turn out to be fraud,
deception, and violence.

470
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:37,173
But most people can protect themselves
even if they go through such a thing.

471
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:40,844
And they try not to repeat
the same mistake.

472
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:46,266
But it's different if you have
a disability like Ms. Shin Hye-yeong.

473
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:50,603
Even if she has the ability to make
credible statements about the situation,

474
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:53,064
the power to protect herself

475
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,483
from the defendant's
malicious intent is lacking.

476
00:28:57,026 --> 00:29:01,781
I don't think my diagnosis
is contradictory.

477
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,814
Do you have something to say?

478
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:36,399
Yes.

479
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,067
Butâ€¦

480
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:39,944
Hye-yeong!

481
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:41,946
Shin Hye-yeong!

482
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,908
Wellâ€¦

483
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:47,994
I'm by myself when I go to the BA.

484
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,749
What are you doing by yourself?

485
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,501
Gosh.

486
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,003
"BA"?

487
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:58,922
Young-woo.

488
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:06,888
I just heard from the prosecutor
that Yang Jeong-il has done this before.

489
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,097
What?

490
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:11,309
He was investigated by the police
for dating another person

491
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,019
with an intellectual disability
at a different organization.

492
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,146
Really?

493
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,149
But there wasn't anything
on his criminal record.

494
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,360
It wasn't
a sexual assault charge back then.

495
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:23,571
The problem was that he spent
a lot of money using her credit card.

496
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:27,659
Yang Jeong-il paid her back
and settled with the victim,

497
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:30,703
which is why the police
closed the investigation.

498
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,665
When was this?

499
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,251
Not that long ago. It was last year.

500
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,627
Wellâ€¦

501
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,672
I have to go meet Mr. Yang Jeong-il.

502
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,678
Is this true?

503
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,057
Well, Young-wooâ€¦

504
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,183
Defendant.

505
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,686
Stop calling Attorney Woo by her name.

506
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,187
It's uncomfortable to hear.

507
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,481
Attorney Wooâ€¦

508
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,985
You said you were truly in love
with Ms. Shin Hye-yeong.

509
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:05,864
You said it was love at first sight
and that you didn't expect that to happen.

510
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,825
Yes, those words are all true.

511
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,869
You're not just going around
volunteering at organizations

512
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:14,706
for people with intellectual disabilities,
looking for someone easy to fool?

513
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:17,000
Is what happened last year
even your first time?

514
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,210
How many victims
were there before Ms. Shin?

515
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,879
What do you mean by that?

516
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,047
How could you say something like that?

517
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,841
I'm really not a bad person!

518
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:28,636
There's no reason for me
to continue defending you

519
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,431
if you and Ms. Shin
don't truly love each other.

520
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:33,433
I am withdrawing.

521
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,560
What? Attorney Woo.

522
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:36,686
Attorney Choi.

523
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,646
I agree with Attorney Woo.

524
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,859
Hye-yeong and I

525
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,903
really do love each other!

526
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:50,074
But true love
doesn't have to be your first love.

527
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,038
I'm begging you.

528
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:56,748
Please?

529
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,709
Please believe me.

530
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,476
Are you really going to withdraw
from Mr. Yang Jeong-il's case?

531
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,355
Yes, I'm going to
talk to Attorney Jung tomorrow

532
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,065
and submit my withdrawal.

533
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,192
I see.

534
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,031
Have you heard of the saying
that lovers who walk

535
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,158
the Deoksugung Stonewall Walkway together
will break up?

536
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,786
No. Is that a saying?

537
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:37,664
Yes. In the past, the Seoul Family Court
and the Supreme Court

538
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,333
were at the north end
of the Deoksugung Stonewall Walkway.

539
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:45,254
This saying originated from having to
walk down this walkway to get a divorce.

540
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,090
Wait.

541
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:51,302
Then shouldn't we stop walking now?

542
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,303
What?

543
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,181
You believe in these things?

544
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,767
It has no scientific evidence.

545
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:01,729
Besides, the Seoul Family Court
moved to Seocho-dong in 1995

546
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,649
and then again to Yangjae-dong in 2012
along with the Seoul Administrative Courtâ€¦

547
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:05,692
Jun-ho!

548
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:14,158
I can't believe I'm running into you
like this again. What a coincidence.

549
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,494
Tell me about it.
Long time no see, Jun-ho.

550
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,871
Gosh, I was curious
about how you were doing.

551
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:21,165
Right. How have you all been?

552
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,501
What?

553
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,336
Isn't sheâ€¦

554
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,338
Nanuri?

555
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,177
I told you it's not like that.

556
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,429
It's not?

557
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,346
Thenâ€¦

558
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,060
I'm on a date right now.

559
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,395
What?

560
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,231
We are on a date.

561
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,859
Walking down Deoksugung Stonewall Walkway.

562
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:51,154
I work with her.
She's Attorney Woo Young-woo.

563
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,530
Say hi, guys.

564
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,743
Hello, I'm Woo Young-woo.

565
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,786
Whether it's read straight or flipped,
it's still Woo Young-woo.

566
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,789
Kayak, deed, rotator,
noon, racecar, Woo Young-woo.

567
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,332
I see.

568
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,292
Right.

569
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,793
Hello.

570
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,506
ASK DOCTORS ABOUT MEDICINE
AND BARISTAS ABOUT COFFEE

571
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:27,023
"FFY" is "Fool For Yang Jeong-il."

572
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:29,442
"FFH" is "Fool For Shin Hye-yeong."

573
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,568
"HN" is "Hot Night."

574
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:33,404
"PSC" is "Punishment of Sexual Crimes."

575
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,324
"CK" is "Coin Karaoke."
"CFDT" is "Chicken For Dinner Tonight?"

576
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,953
Attorney Woo?

577
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,663
Then "BA" is?

578
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:46,334
-Barista Academy!
-Excuse me?

579
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,336
According to the chat,

580
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,172
Ms. Shin started going to
a barista academy a few months ago.

581
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:54,592
She let me know that she's alone
when she goes to the academy.

582
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:55,635
Soâ€¦

583
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,179
The academy is on Jongno 3-ga,

584
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,598
and she has class every Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday, and ends at 9 p.m.

585
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:08,356
We have to go now.
That's the only way to meet Ms. Shin.

586
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,108
What? Attorney Woo!

587
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:13,194
Hey, let's meet up for drinks soon.
I'll be in touch.

588
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,487
Attorney Woo!

589
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,739
Wait!

590
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:22,745
Let's go together!

591
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,082
Ms. Shin Hye-yeong!

592
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:28,543
COOL BARISTA ACADEMY

593
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,796
Ms. Shin, what was it
that you wanted to say to me?

594
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,427
I love him.

595
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,054
-What?
-What?

596
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,057
Please don't let him go to jail.

597
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,726
Right.

598
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,311
You mean Mr. Yang Jeong-il.

599
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,229
Yes.

600
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,272
Right.

601
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:54,110
Do you not want him to go to jail?

602
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,403
No.

603
00:35:55,486 --> 00:36:00,408
But you gave a statement
saying that he sexually assaulted you.

604
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:03,578
-He didn't sexually assault me!
-He didn't sexually assault you?

605
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,998
My mom made me say that.

606
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:10,668
My mom hates men.

607
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,920
She thinks
they're all gigolo-like bastards.

608
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:18,176
Well, Mr. Yang Jeong-ilâ€¦

609
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,180
does seem like a gigolo-like bastard.

610
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:23,931
Yes.

611
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,433
What?

612
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:30,271
You knew that he's a gigolo-like bastard?

613
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,856
Yes.

614
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:33,941
Yet you stillâ€¦

615
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:36,152
love him?

616
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,278
Yes.

617
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,447
Is that not allowed?

618
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:41,991
Wellâ€¦

619
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,409
No.

620
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:45,578
There's nothing wrong with that.

621
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:49,373
Please don't let FFH go to jail.

622
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,792
Please.

623
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:59,091
Then can you testify
what you just said at the next trial?

624
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,676
Gigolo-like bastard?

625
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,803
-What?
-What?

626
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:08,434
You just said
you don't want Mr. Yang to go to jail.

627
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,518
Yes.

628
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,521
We want you to say that in court

629
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:13,981
directly to the judges.

630
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,066
Right.

631
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:23,407
But what if my mom says I can't?

632
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:27,703
You can still testify
even if your mother tells you not to.

633
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,539
You're a 27-year-old adult.

634
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,000
So you can make your own decisions.

635
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,630
As you know,

636
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,716
Mr. Yang is a gigolo-like bastard.

637
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,301
He's a bad guy.

638
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:43,803
Yes.

639
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,389
But even people with disabilities

640
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:49,475
have the freedom
to fall in love with a bad guy.

641
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:56,399
Whether you experienced love
or sexual assault,

642
00:37:56,983 --> 00:38:00,278
it's up to you to make the judgment.

643
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:05,116
Don't let your mother and the court

644
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,952
decide for you.

645
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:16,919
I mean, why is everyone so interested
in my salary, deposits, and savings?

646
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,421
There was a guy who asked for my date
and time of birth on the first date

647
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:20,464
so he could check
our astrological compatibility.

648
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:24,218
And another guy asked about my dad's job
and talked about him the entire time.

649
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,219
Gosh.

650
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,638
I just want to be in a relationship
with a good guy.

651
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,056
Is that too much to ask for?

652
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,560
I think the guys you're being set up with
all have marriage on their minds.

653
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,354
Why don't you try clubbing
instead of going on blind dates?

654
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,690
I don't want to go clubbing.

655
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:40,443
Clubs are only
for one-night stands and stuff.

656
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:43,446
Hey, what's wrong with one-night stands?

657
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:47,950
You only live once.
Go out and enjoy yourself.

658
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,453
Forget it, I'm here. I have to go.

659
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,146
Hello.

660
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:18,689
Take a seat right there.

661
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:24,445
Wellâ€¦

662
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,614
Nice to meet you.

663
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,867
I'm Kim Min-sickly prickly.

664
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,537
Sickly prickly.

665
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,580
Right.

666
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,333
Hello.

667
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,751
I'm Choi Su-yeon.

668
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,336
I see.

669
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:43,172
You said you live nearby, right?

670
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:46,342
I made a reservation here
because it was close.

671
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,053
I live in Bundang. I work nearby.

672
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:51,639
I see. Okay.

673
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:52,807
Wellâ€¦

674
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:57,103
There must be some
really great bread where you live.

675
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,814
-What?
-"Bun, dang."

676
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,690
Bunâ€¦

677
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:03,901
Right.

678
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,319
Bun, dang?

679
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,239
Bundang.

680
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,032
Wellâ€¦

681
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,367
Should we look at the menu?

682
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,535
Yes, sure.

683
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:21,544
Gosh, they have a salad
with oranges in it.

684
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:24,088
Orange you glad you came out tonight?

685
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:26,882
I'll go with

686
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:29,593
the gorgonzola cheese pizza,
hoping it'll be "grate."

687
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,180
How do you feel about
having banana cake for dessert?

688
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:34,723
If you eat bananas,

689
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:36,600
will you find me "a-peeling"?

690
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,021
Right.

691
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,356
Gosh.

692
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,401
I heard you cook
and here you are making food jokes.

693
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,027
Was I?

694
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:50,281
It must come with the job.
I didn't even realize.

695
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:52,616
Eat your noodles, not your strudel.

696
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,161
Don't doodle on your noodles.

697
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,293
Take it.

698
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,296
No, it's all right. I can call back later.

699
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:08,632
No, please take it right now.

700
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:10,551
Shall I?

701
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:15,764
Hello?

702
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:19,393
Hairy Boss, I want suyuk.
How do you make it?

703
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,896
What are you talking about?
Hang up! I'm busy!

704
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,022
No, I'm not busy.

705
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:27,276
Hold on. It's bay leaves and what else?

706
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,319
Gochujang?

707
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,404
Why would you put gochujang in suyuk?

708
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:33,032
I'm sorry. It's my employee.

709
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,412
What? The house is on fire?

710
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,164
I'll be there. I'll take care of it!

711
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,627
I'm sorry, there's a fire at my house.
I think I should go.

712
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,129
I know you made time to see me.
I'm really sorry.

713
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,257
Why would you go when there's a fire?

714
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,386
Oh, I got it. It's ssamjang!

715
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,180
Is it not?

716
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,599
Hairy Boss, are you listening to me?

717
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,478
Yes.

718
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,688
I think I've just been ditched.

719
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,023
What? Already?

720
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,984
What on earth did you do
to get ditched right away?

721
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:09,944
Did you fart?

722
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:12,112
I don't know.

723
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:15,366
Why was I ditched? It's not like
we were having dinner in a ditch.

724
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,328
What theâ€¦

725
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:21,664
Hello?

726
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:24,041
-Hey, get ready. Let's go clubbing.
-What?

727
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:26,335
You said we only live once.

728
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:27,920
Let's go out and enjoy ourselves!

729
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,255
Let's get wild tonight!

730
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:44,562
So what kind of guy do you want?

731
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:48,941
Tell us. What do you mean by "good guy"?

732
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:52,194
I mean, it's not like
I'm asking for a lot.

733
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,779
He should be tall enough.

734
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:54,738
Okay.

735
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,907
He should have broad shoulders.

736
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,033
Shoulders are important.

737
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:00,411
He should have a nice smile, andâ€¦

738
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:02,621
Him?

739
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,502
Hey, he's been eyeing you for a while now.

740
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,503
Me?

741
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,088
Me?

742
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:15,092
-What?
-Hey, he's coming. Let's go.

743
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:16,176
Hey!

744
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:21,682
The music's good today, right?

745
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,018
Right.

746
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,020
The music.

747
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:27,521
Yes.

748
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,998
Thank you for not abandoning me

749
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,626
and staying on as my attorney.

750
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,294
What?

751
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,087
It's not for your sake.

752
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,089
It's for Ms. Shin's sake.

753
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,634
You should thank her, not us.

754
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,681
You smell like alcohol.

755
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:05,601
And you're wearing
the same outfit as yesterday.

756
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,061
Be quiet.

757
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,313
-How was the blind date?
-It didn't work out.

758
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:11,982
All rise.

759
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,448
You may be seated.

760
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,913
Defendant.

761
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:30,042
I see you requested the victim,
Ms. Shin Hye-yeong, as your witness.

762
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:35,214
Yes, Ms. Shin expressed her wish
to testify in court through our attorney.

763
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:38,592
Your Honor. Please consider that
given this is a case of sexual assault,

764
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:43,514
it would be difficult for the victim
to remain calm in front of the defendant.

765
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,849
I request for the defendant
to be removed from the courtroom

766
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,601
so the victim can properly testify.

767
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,145
I agree.

768
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:54,692
Defendant, you'll be removed from
the courtroom during witness questioning.

769
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:21,343
Ms. Shin Hye-yeong.

770
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:24,221
Come forward.

771
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:45,617
"I solemnly swear
that I will tell the truth,

772
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:49,872
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

773
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:52,458
and agree to receive punishment

774
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:55,127
in accordance with perjury
should there be any falsehood."

775
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:02,134
Counselor, you may begin
questioning the witness.

776
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:14,646
Do you want Mr. Yang to be punished
for sexually assaulting you?

777
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,231
-Yes.
-What?

778
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:21,111
You want Mr. Yang to go to jail?

779
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,780
No, I don't.

780
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:26,700
Why not?

781
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,661
Because I love him.

782
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:37,002
Witness, are you saying
that you love Mr. Yang Jeong-il?

783
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:38,545
Yes.

784
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,756
FFY and FFH

785
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,342
are in love with each other.

786
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:48,764
So was the sexual intercourse that you
and the defendant had on March 12th

787
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:52,559
consensual intercourse
that happened because you love each other?

788
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:53,977
Yes.

789
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,480
So you're saying it wasn't sexual assault?

790
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:57,648
Yes.

791
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,316
Then during the police investigation,

792
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:02,986
why did you testify that Mr. Yang Jeong-il
sexually assaulted you?

793
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:08,534
Wellâ€¦

794
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:14,915
I don't know.

795
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:22,881
Did your mother
perhaps tell you to say that?

796
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:27,427
Objection. Leading.

797
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,476
Overruled.

798
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:37,563
Counselor, go on with the questioning.

799
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:44,194
Did your mother tell you to testify
that you were sexually assaulted?

800
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,199
I justâ€¦

801
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:54,580
Please don't let FFH go to jail.

802
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,382
That is all.

803
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,847
Prosecution, you may begin
cross-examination.

804
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,519
Ms. Shin Hye-yeong.

805
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,813
You said you love
Mr. Yang Jeong-il, right?

806
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:20,939
Yes.

807
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,482
What is love?

808
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:23,900
Can you define it?

809
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:25,819
Wellâ€¦

810
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:26,945
Define it?

811
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,406
Wellâ€¦

812
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,617
Loveâ€¦

813
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,868
Objection!

814
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:34,369
What kind of question is that?

815
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:38,248
It's hard for anyone to answer
such an abstract and vague question.

816
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,417
Okay, then I'll be more specific.

817
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,295
Ms. Shin, do you know
what sexual intercourse is?

818
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,546
Yes.

819
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,715
Do you know what sexual assault is?

820
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:48,091
Yes.

821
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:51,303
Then what is the difference
between the two?

822
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,681
How are sexual intercourse
and sexual assault different?

823
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,060
Wellâ€¦

824
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:00,479
Wellâ€¦

825
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,025
An adultâ€¦

826
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:06,943
An adultâ€¦

827
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,363
Wellâ€¦

828
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,923
Ms. Shin, let me ask a different question.

829
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:30,550
Can you open your eyes?

830
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:37,265
On March 12th,

831
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:40,352
after leaving the motel
you were at with Mr. Yang Jeong-il,

832
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:43,480
you went straight home, correct?

833
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:44,690
Yes.

834
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:48,777
After that, you went straight
into your room

835
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,988
and scratched the back of your left hand
with your right hand so hard

836
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,782
that you hurt yourself.

837
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:54,866
Is this correct?

838
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,243
Yes.

839
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:03,417
This is a picture of Ms. Shin's hand
taken that day.

840
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:16,388
Why did you do this?

841
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:18,765
Wellâ€¦

842
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:20,892
That's becauseâ€¦

843
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,396
That's because--

844
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:28,442
Weren't you extremely stressed from
the defendant's one-sided sexual advances?

845
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:29,818
Objection!

846
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:31,653
The fact that
you didn't stop harming yourself

847
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:35,282
until your mother found you
and took you to the hospital

848
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:38,660
shows how taxing the mental aftereffects
of the defendant's sexual assault was.

849
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:40,036
Objection!

850
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,707
Scratching the back of her hand
is merely a habit that she has.

851
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,001
It's speculative of the prosecution to say

852
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,961
that it's because of the intercourse
she had with the defendant.

853
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:50,297
Is the prosecution
asking the witness questions

854
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,507
or forcing her own speculations?

855
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:04,102
Mom, I don't want to do this.

856
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,645
Momâ€¦

857
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:08,648
Hye-yeong.

858
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:10,734
Are you okay?

859
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,195
Come here.

860
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:18,116
It's okay.

861
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:31,213
Hey!

862
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:37,969
You have autism?

863
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:39,429
What?

864
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:42,933
So do you think you know
how every person with disabilities feels?

865
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:47,395
To spew some bullshit about
having the freedom to love a bad guy?

866
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:52,651
Ma'am, calm down and if you have
something to say, you can talk to me--

867
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:53,777
You know what?

868
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,863
I have to protect my daughter
from this messed-up world.

869
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:59,866
I have to protect my child
from the evil bastards

870
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,703
who try to take advantage of her
in every way possible

871
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,997
the second they think
she's innocent and soft!

872
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:08,250
You don't even know how I feel, but what?

873
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,919
A disabled person's right to love?

874
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:15,131
Who are you to talk
about autism and disability?

875
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:17,759
Is my child's disability
the same as yours?

876
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:20,679
Please take your ridiculous attempt
at empathizing elsewhere.

877
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:23,223
It's disgusting. Do you understand?

878
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,976
"It's disgusting. Do you understand?"

879
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:42,826
Hey, Jun-ho.
I want to meet the girl you're seeing.

880
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:45,620
Why won't you call her over?
I'm the only one who hasn't seen her.

881
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:48,790
All right, I'll invite her next time.

882
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,960
Are you really sure about this?

883
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:56,882
Even if she's an attorney,
you should think this one through.

884
00:52:57,465 --> 00:53:00,886
-What do you mean?
-I mean, forget about us.

885
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:03,763
But can you really tell your parents
that you're dating someone like her?

886
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:08,435
What do you mean by "someone like her"?

887
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:11,187
Why are you saying it like that?

888
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:12,898
I meanâ€¦

889
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:14,941
Honestly, it'sâ€¦

890
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,777
You know.

891
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:19,988
It's what?

892
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:23,491
-It's what? Tell me.
-Well, it's just something.

893
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,327
Come on, what's just something?

894
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,453
You know,

895
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:29,831
Jun-ho has always been nice.

896
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:32,334
It's because he's nice.

897
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,629
Hey, I'm going to get going.

898
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:39,257
I don't get what any of you are saying.

899
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,508
-No.
-Come on, sit.

900
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:43,094
-Let go.
-Okay.

901
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:47,223
I've been in that kind of
relationship before.

902
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:49,643
I've done it

903
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,938
and that's not love.

904
00:53:56,441 --> 00:54:00,278
-What?
-Dating a pitiful girl you want to help.

905
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:03,281
That's not love.

906
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:05,075
That'sâ€¦

907
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:08,828
sympathy.

908
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,497
Hey, stop it.

909
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,918
Right. Hey, are you drunk?
He's drunk. Let's make a--

910
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:17,170
"A pitiful girl you want to help"?

911
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,799
Who's so pitiful?

912
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:22,968
Come on, who's so pitiful?

913
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,390
Hey!

914
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:30,225
-Stop it.
-Let go!

915
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:32,227
You bastard.

916
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:35,647
-I'm just looking out for you.
-Hey, come here. What did you say?

917
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,732
-What do you know, you bastard?
-That bastard!

918
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,901
-Hey, come here.
-Hey, let go.

919
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,903
-Let go of me. Hey, come here.
-Let go.

920
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:44,280
-Hey, let go.
-Say that again!

921
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:50,412
The alcohol tastes sweet today.

922
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:52,330
It really does.

923
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:55,041
-Attorney Kim.
-Yes?

924
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:58,837
Didn't you go to university
with Attorney Tae Su-mi from Taesan?

925
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,296
Tae Su-mi?

926
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,465
Yes, I went to the same school as her.

927
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,383
Right?

928
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:07,387
I heard a preposterous rumor about her.

929
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,140
-Preposterous rumor?
-Yes.

930
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,600
I heard that Attorney Tae

931
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,103
has another child.

932
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,188
Oh, that.

933
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:20,108
Goodness.

934
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:21,526
That she has another child?

935
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:22,819
My goodness.

936
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,112
You know about this?

937
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:26,072
That's just gossip.

938
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,574
Gosh.

939
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:30,243
During university, Tae Su-mi took a break

940
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:33,663
from school out of nowhere,
saying she was going to study abroad.

941
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:37,584
-I see.
-Her family is well-off

942
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:41,546
so it wasn't a big deal
when or where she went.

943
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:44,799
But something didn't add up.

944
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:47,093
It's not like she graduated

945
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,763
or passed the bar.

946
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:53,016
But she just suddenly
went to study abroad.

947
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:54,642
Right.

948
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:58,938
People started speculating
all sorts of things

949
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,732
and that's how that rumor came about.

950
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:04,486
People and their imaginations.

951
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:07,405
Have a child? My goodness.

952
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:08,990
Attorney Kim, do you perhapsâ€¦

953
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:14,913
remember what year it was
when she took a break from school?

954
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:16,331
Let's see.

955
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:17,874
Wellâ€¦

956
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:21,419
I was 24 and it was before
I went to the army, soâ€¦

957
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:25,340
it might be 1996.

958
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:27,717
Then that's aboutâ€¦

959
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,178
twenty-six years ago, right?

960
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:33,598
Gosh, 1996 was 26 years ago?

961
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:34,724
Yes.

962
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,393
Jeez, time really flies.

963
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:42,357
If I ended up with Yeong-suk back then
and had a kid,

964
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:47,570
they would be around 27 years old, right?

965
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:48,613
Right.

966
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:52,534
Most of the female rookies who joined
the firm this year are around that age.

967
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:53,701
Really?

968
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:55,870
Goodness.

969
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:35,326
First, I will announce the jury's review.

970
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:37,954
On the charges.

971
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,123
Three of the seven jurors

972
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,542
found the defendant guilty,

973
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,461
four found the defendant not guilty.
Therefore, not guilty.

974
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:47,338
-This is absurd!
-That's unbelievable!

975
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:48,715
-Not guilty?
-No way!

976
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:49,966
This doesn't make sense.

977
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:53,052
-Not guilty?
-This is absurd!

978
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:56,681
Quiet down.

979
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,017
This court

980
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:02,228
sincerely respects

981
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:04,355
the jury's opinions.

982
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:06,733
Now, for the verdict.

983
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:08,526
Stand up.

984
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:09,527
Okay.

985
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:13,406
Formal adjudication.

986
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:15,700
The defendantâ€¦

987
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,870
is sentenced to two years imprisonment.

988
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:25,793
The defendant is ordered to complete

989
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:30,673
a 40-hour sex offender treatment program.

990
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,552
-The defendant's information
-Young-woo.

991
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:39,307
will be notified and disclosed through
the information network for five years.

992
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,308
Am Iâ€¦

993
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:41,768
The defendant

994
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:44,938
-Am I going to jail?
-is restricted from employment

995
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,607
-Yes.
-for five years at institutions

996
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,068
and welfare facilities
related to people with disabilities.

997
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:51,819
Grounds of judgment are as follows.

998
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:56,616
The crime, in this case, is due to
the defendant engaging in indecent acts

999
00:58:57,325 --> 00:59:00,036
-with the victim, who is unable
-Hye-yeong.

1000
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:02,121
to defend herself against sexual assault
due to her intellectual disability.

1001
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:04,958
-Thus, the nature of the crime is bad,
-Hye-yeong.

1002
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,502
and is highly likely to be criticized.

1003
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:10,171
-He also seems to have
-Hye-yeong, why are you crying?

1004
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:13,466
intentionally joined organizations
for people with autism and intellectual

1005
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:18,221
-and developmental disabilities.
-Why are you crying? He's being punished.

1006
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,765
Furthermore, after the crime,

1007
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:24,185
-the victim's intellectual disability
-Hye-yeong.

1008
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:26,980
and anxiety seems to have become severe,

1009
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,857
and due to the crime,

1010
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:34,112
the victim appears to have suffered
considerable physical and mental trauma.

1011
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:49,002
It's House 607 at the end over there.

1012
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:52,088
That's where Attorney Kwon and I live.

1013
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,840
I see.

1014
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:00,179
Soâ€¦

1015
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:02,015
Min-woo said

1016
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:04,559
he'll be coming home late today.

1017
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:09,522
Do you want to come in for a second?

1018
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:14,569
No, I'm tired so I would like to go home.

1019
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:15,653
Right.

1020
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:18,656
Then let's head out together.
I'll walk you home.

1021
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:20,533
What?

1022
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,035
That means

1023
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:26,623
there was no point in me walking you home.

1024
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:28,916
The route is inefficient too.

1025
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,252
Dates are like that.

1026
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:33,630
No meaning, no efficiency.

1027
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:35,506
Foolish.

1028
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:43,139
If you have a disability,

1029
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:46,142
I think merely liking someone

1030
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:48,978
is not enough.

1031
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:51,898
Because even if I say it's love,

1032
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,400
if other people say it's not,

1033
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:57,153
then it's not.

1034
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:00,114
Are you talking about the case today?

1035
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,826
I'm not sure

1036
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:06,412
if I'm talking about the case

1037
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:08,414
or myself.

1038
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,212
Even if other people say it's not,

1039
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:16,839
if you say it's love,

1040
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:19,926
it's love.

1041
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:26,057
Loving meâ€¦

1042
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:29,060
is hard.

1043
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:31,646
Yes.

1044
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,482
It appears so.

1045
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:40,988
But are you still going to?

1046
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:48,329
Yes.

1047
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:05,698
Do your teeth

1048
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:10,703
usually knock against each other
when kissing?

1049
01:03:12,997 --> 01:03:13,998
No?

1050
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:18,753
Then what am I supposed toâ€¦

1051
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:22,298
Wellâ€¦

1052
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:25,218
I thinkâ€¦

1053
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:30,723
it would be better
if you open up your mouth a bit more.

1054
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:33,434
And it would be betterâ€¦

1055
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:37,271
if you closed your eyes a bit more.

1056
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:39,398
Right.

1057
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:49,635
I'm sorry. We're closed forâ€¦

1058
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:02,815
Can I come in?

1059
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:29,634
How could you come here?
What if Young-woo sees you?

1060
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:46,692
Taesan has an overseas office in Boston.

1061
01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:48,694
Go with Young-woo.

1062
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:53,658
Young-woo is working at Hanbada.

1063
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:58,162
Who are you to tell her where to go
when she's not even working at Taesan?

1064
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:00,039
Gwang-ho.

1065
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:02,750
Did you plan this with Han Seon-young?

1066
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:06,087
Did you two plan

1067
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,756
to get Young-woo employed at Hanbada

1068
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:12,134
so you can take me down?

1069
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:16,222
The world doesn't revolve around you.

1070
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:19,517
What plan?

1071
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:22,770
Hanbada gave her the job
because Young-woo is outstanding.

1072
01:06:25,856 --> 01:06:26,899
Yes.

1073
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:30,444
Young-woo is outstanding.

1074
01:06:32,738 --> 01:06:34,532
Which is why I'm making the offer.

1075
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:38,160
This is a great opportunity for her
to grow as an international attorney.

1076
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:39,662
Convince her.

1077
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:43,457
I'll provide everything
so she can focus solely on her work

1078
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:45,418
when she's in the States.

1079
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:50,339
Are you not trying to send her
as far away from you as possible

1080
01:06:50,923 --> 01:06:52,758
because she could get in the way
of you becoming the Minister of Justice?

1081
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:55,261
Does Young-woo

1082
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:59,515
have a doctor or a counselor?

1083
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:03,019
-What?
-She has autism.

1084
01:07:03,894 --> 01:07:06,814
Do you have a professional
who takes exclusive care of her?

1085
01:07:06,897 --> 01:07:09,442
I gave Young-woo
every treatment she needed.

1086
01:07:10,317 --> 01:07:13,362
And she's doing well without all that.

1087
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:16,323
Is that so?

1088
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:21,996
Are you sure it's not that
you can't do enough for her?

1089
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:28,919
It's not too late
to do what's best for her.

1090
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,715
Awareness and treatment for autism

1091
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:34,884
are much more advanced
in the States than in Korea.

1092
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,844
Do you have any idea

1093
01:07:36,927 --> 01:07:39,263
how many communities there are
for people with autism just in Boston?

1094
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:40,723
There will be a lot of

1095
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:43,142
doctors and counselors
who specialize in autism too.

1096
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:47,563
But here, Young-woo's all alone.

1097
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:51,942
Are you going to take responsibility
for her life and help her forever?

1098
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:53,527
Young-woo is my daughter.

1099
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:57,907
Who are you to interfere
and tell me what to do now?

1100
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:03,037
You've been living selfishly
without showing up once all this time.

1101
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:05,539
And now, what?

1102
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,920
You've got some nerve.

1103
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:16,050
You're one to talk.

1104
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:18,969
Did you forget about our promise?

1105
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:22,139
You said you'd disappear forever

1106
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:25,017
if I gave birth to Young-woo.

1107
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:28,437
Why did you break that promise
and show up again?

1108
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:30,898
Are you trying to get revenge on me

1109
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:33,067
by using Young-woo?

1110
01:08:33,984 --> 01:08:35,152
Or is it money?

1111
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,905
Are you trying to get money from me?

1112
01:08:37,988 --> 01:08:38,948
Hey!

1113
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:41,992
Get out.

1114
01:08:42,868 --> 01:08:44,036
Get out!

1115
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:35,504
Recently, two other people and I

1116
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:37,965
pooled our money
and bought lottery tickets.

1117
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:42,511
And we promised
to split it evenly if any of us won.

1118
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:44,513
I really need the 1.4 billion won.

1119
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:47,975
If you get a divorce, does the prize money
have to be divided as well?

1120
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:54,899
This is the first time
I've constantly thought of someone,

1121
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:56,609
so it's quite strange.

1122
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:05,618
