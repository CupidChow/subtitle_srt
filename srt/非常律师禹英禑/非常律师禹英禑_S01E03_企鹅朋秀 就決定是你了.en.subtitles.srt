1
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,195
-Why are all the lights off?
-Jeong-hun?

2
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:12,989
Sang-hun?

3
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,744
Jeong-hun!

4
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,712
Jeong-hun!

5
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,757
-Jeong-hun!
-What is going on?

6
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,841
Jeong-hun!

7
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,051
Jeong-hun, what's wrong?

8
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,140
Jeong-hun.

9
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,475
Jeong-hun!

10
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,602
-Sang-hun!
-Jeong-hun! Kim Jeong-hun!

11
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:43,728
Snap out of it!

12
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,024
Sang-hun.

13
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:49,067
Sang-hun?

14
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,984
Sang-hun!

15
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,695
Honey.

16
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,572
Something's wrong with Sang-hun.

17
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,741
-Sang-hun.
-Sang-hun!

18
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,369
Sang-hun!

19
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,537
Sang-hun!

20
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,748
Sang-hun.

21
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:04,707
Sang-hun!

22
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,417
Wake up, Sang-hun!

23
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,503
Die! Stop!

24
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,755
Die! Stop!

25
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,591
Die! Stop!

26
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,260
Die! Stop!

27
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:19,097
Die!

28
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,140
Stop!

29
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:28,648
CASE 3
THIS IS PENGSOO

30
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:35,113
ATTORNEY WOO YOUNG-WOO

31
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,578
Hello.

32
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,875
Look at you. You got your own nameplate.

33
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,294
"Attorney Woo Young-woo."

34
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,754
-You happy?
-Yes.

35
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,591
-Do you want me to take a picture?
-Yes.

36
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,055
Okay.

37
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,521
What are you doing? Why do you look mad?

38
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,522
Smile a little.

39
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:21,200
Let's just go back to looking mad.

40
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,118
Okay.

41
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,330
ATTORNEY JUNG MYEONG-SEOK

42
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:30,835
Hello.

43
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,296
Attorney Woo, please come
to my office right away.

44
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,131
Okay.

45
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,843
-Shall we take pictures some other time?
-Yes, some other time.

46
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,265
Yes, come in.

47
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:55,777
Attorney Woo. I put the case files
over there, so take a look.

48
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,870
Have you heard
of Sangjeong Pharmaceutical?

49
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,247
It's quite a famous
pharmaceutical company.

50
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,206
Yes.

51
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,249
EVIDENCE RECORD

52
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,002
The Chairman is a long-time
client of Hanbada.

53
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,963
But he's going through
a rough patch at the moment.

54
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,423
He has two sons,

55
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,343
but it seems as though the younger son
beat the older son to death.

56
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,554
And the Chairman
and his wife witnessed it themselves.

57
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,182
The cause of death is thoracic trauma.

58
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,725
He had 22 rib fractures

59
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,728
that caused internal bleeding
in his chest, leading to his death.

60
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,773
They say there's some sort
of faint mark on his neck,

61
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,734
but it doesn't seem
like it would've been life-threatening.

62
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,696
All this resulted
from the younger son's assault?

63
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,991
Yes. At least, that's what
the prosecutor seems to believe.

64
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:46,035
The fractures to the front of his ribs

65
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,329
may be attributed to CPR,

66
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,164
but for the remaining 11 fractures,

67
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,709
it's hard to explain with anything
other than assault.

68
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,544
The blood-alcohol level of the victim

69
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,297
at the time of his death
was at intoxication levels.

70
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,216
I don't think
he would've ended up like this

71
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,095
if he had been sober.
It's a pity what happened.

72
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,723
Is Kim Jeong-hun, the one who's been
charged with bodily injury

73
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:07,932
resulting in death, the younger son?

74
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,058
Yes.

75
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:13,813
I'll be handling this case,
but I'd like for you to join me.

76
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,024
The defendant has autism.

77
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:25,700
There should be a psychiatric evaluation
for Kim Jeong-hun on the next page.

78
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,452
SEOIN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

79
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,544
AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER
ALSO REFERRED TO AS ASD

80
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,087
THIS DISORDER IS A COMPLEX
DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER

81
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:43,217
Are you assigning me this case
because I'm autistic?

82
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:48,556
Wouldn't you know
the defendant better than I do?

83
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,768
And I'm sure the Chairman
would feel more reassured

84
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,478
if a lawyer with autism was on the case.

85
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:57,732
The official diagnosis for autism
is Autism Spectrum Disorder.

86
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,859
As you can tell from the word spectrum,

87
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,861
there's a wide variety of autistic people.

88
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:03,821
Like…

89
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:06,699
whales.

90
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,452
Even if they're all whales,
blue whales and right whales

91
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:13,039
have a totally different ecosystem
and social structure from humpback whales.

92
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,165
What's more is that--

93
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:17,168
Okay, enough about whales.
What is it that you're trying to say?

94
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:18,711
Right.

95
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,131
According to this evaluation,

96
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,008
Kim Jeong-hun is on
the severe end of the spectrum,

97
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,345
with a mental age of somewhere
between age six and ten.

98
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:30,056
I have never met someone like him.

99
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,599
Neither have I.

100
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:36,521
You're still better than me,
who didn't even know

101
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,980
the official term for autism.

102
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,777
Let's meet with them first.
Don't be so scared.

103
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:55,873
Hello.

104
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,627
I'm Jung Myeong-seok,
the attorney handling your case.

105
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,254
And this is…

106
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,713
I'm Attorney Woo Young-woo.

107
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,595
Whether it's read straight or flipped,
it's still Woo Young-woo.

108
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,973
Kayak, deed, rotator,
noon, racecar, Woo Young-woo.

109
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,560
Right.

110
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:19,397
Attorney Woo Young-woo
has autism spectrum disorder.

111
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,815
Like your younger son.

112
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,834
According to your younger son's statement,

113
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:44,088
the words "Die. Die. Stop." were repeated.

114
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,091
No matter how many times we ask

115
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:51,554
about what happened that night,
he only keeps saying,

116
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,680
"Die. Die. Stop."

117
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,808
How was the relationship
between your two sons?

118
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,185
It was good.

119
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:01,063
Jeong-hun was especially fond of Sang-hun.

120
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,859
Before Sang-hun got busy with med school,

121
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,070
he always hung out
and took care of Jeong-hun.

122
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,572
Sang-hun

123
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,201
was our son, but the kid was perfect.

124
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,871
He went to SNU med school
with a perfect score on the CSAT,

125
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,500
but he was also humble and warm

126
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,169
and was so good to his brother.

127
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,756
Does Mr. Jeong-hun normally
often say the words "die"?

128
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,633
No.

129
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,929
Jeong-hun saying something
like that is quite unusual.

130
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,057
He gets misunderstood by people
because of how big he is,

131
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,434
but he's a nice kid.

132
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,644
Sometimes,

133
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,189
he doesn't listen to me
and can be a little stubborn.

134
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:47,151
But he never threatens or attacks anyone.

135
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:51,948
So you have no idea in particular
as to why your younger son

136
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,991
beat up your older son?

137
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:54,909
No.

138
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,710
Looks like I don't know much
about what goes on in my sons' minds.

139
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,008
Would it be okay
if we meet with your younger son?

140
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,971
Meeting with him isn't an issue.

141
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:19,100
But I'm not sure if he'll talk.

142
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:22,812
He goes silent when he meets strangers.

143
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,147
They should still meet him at least once.

144
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,067
Jeong-hun is the defendant.

145
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,861
And we never know.

146
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:34,198
He might open up to Attorney Woo.

147
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,833
If only this elevator would hurry up,

148
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,668
we'd have ten more minutes
for our lunch break.

149
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,004
You're right.

150
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,548
-Do you know today's lunch menu?
-It's stir-fried pork.

151
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,632
Really?

152
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,801
It's here.

153
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,642
Have a nice lunch.

154
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,315
Excuse me, can you wait just a second?

155
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:10,109
-What is it?
-I'm sorry.

156
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,360
Hey.

157
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,324
I'm so hungry.

158
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,285
I'm starving.

159
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,629
Gosh, I'm hungry.

160
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,758
Closing the doors now.

161
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,904
If I knew you brought lunch from home,
I'd have come down first.

162
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,906
Next time, come down a bit later.

163
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,202
By "a bit later," how much later
do you exactly mean?

164
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,496
About ten minutes?

165
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:04,580
Okay.

166
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,669
While we work on the 17th floor
and eat lunch on the first basement level,

167
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:13,881
whales feed in the coastal waters of Ulsan
and sleep on the west coast of Japan.

168
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,425
For them, the coastal waters
of Ulsan are their kitchen

169
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,260
and the west coast
of Japan is their bedroom.

170
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:23,641
Migratory whales that move to the polar
regions every summer feed intermittently.

171
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:27,645
They only eat during the 3 to 4 months
that they stay in the polar regions.

172
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:30,648
-Jeez, Young-woo's doing that again.
-What?

173
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:31,899
Should I go stop her?

174
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,112
Since people only eat within eight hours
each day when intermittent fasting.

175
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,864
Just leave her be.
He doesn't seem to mind.

176
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:39,782
What?

177
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,618
The look on Jun-ho's face.
It doesn't seem like he minds.

178
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,001
Okay.

179
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,318
You promised. Be good, okay?

180
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,202
-Hello.
-You're here.

181
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,122
Kim Jeong-hun, come in.

182
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:38,632
Right.

183
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,426
Pengsoo!

184
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,553
Jeong-hun, I see you like Pengsoo.

185
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,266
Please take a seat.

186
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:48,976
Jeong-hun, sit down.

187
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,478
Sit down.

188
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,199
Take your headphones and sunglasses off.

189
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,367
I won't take my headphones
and sunglasses off.

190
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:06,994
Listen to me.

191
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,412
You promised, right?

192
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,456
Listen to me. I didn't promise, right?

193
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:15,377
It's fine. The headphones
and sunglasses look cool.

194
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,296
If it's okay with you two,

195
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,507
I think we should proceed like this.

196
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,552
Hi, Jeong-hun.

197
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:27,306
My name is Jung Myeong-seok,
and this here is…

198
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,432
Woo Young-woo.

199
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:34,104
Right, Young-woo and I
have a lot to ask you, Jeong-hun.

200
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,731
So, today--

201
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,696
Do you know what he's saying?

202
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,365
No, I do not.

203
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,826
Jeong-hun.

204
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,246
What's that?

205
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,960
Kim Jeong-hun, stop it!

206
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,550
Attorney Woo,
can you try asking him a question?

207
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:09,390
Mr. Kim Jeong-hun, do you recall the day
Mr. Kim Sang-hun died?

208
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,649
Why did you beat up Kim Sang-hun?

209
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,735
Easy.

210
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,502
Why?

211
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,922
-Why?
-Kim Jeong-hun. Stop it!

212
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,758
-Why?
-Kim Jeong-hun.

213
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,927
-Why?
-Jeong-hun.

214
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,679
-Jeong-hun.
-Jeong-hun.

215
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,600
Mr. Jeong-hun, stop.

216
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,853
-Why?
-Kim Jeong-hun.

217
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,522
-Why?
-Kim Jeong-hun.

218
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,065
-Why?
-Jeong-hun.

219
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,912
My goodness, Madame Attorney is home.

220
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,539
I have an inquiry for you, Dad.

221
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,374
Yes, please do inquire.

222
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,794
I have to communicate with a 21-year-old
autistic man, but it's difficult.

223
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:21,754
What should I do?

224
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,048
What is this about?

225
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:27,092
I can't tell you the details
because of attorney-client privilege.

226
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,888
I'm inquiring because I thought you'd know
since you live with an autistic person.

227
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:36,477
Then would you be so kind
as to trim spinach with me while I answer?

228
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,395
No, I don't want to.

229
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,362
Living with an autistic person
is indeed quite…

230
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,113
"Quite"?

231
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,783
Lonely.

232
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,997
For me,

233
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,668
it's you and me against the world.

234
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,671
But you, my daughter,
don't have any interest in me.

235
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,466
You still don't, but it was worse
when you were younger.

236
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:15,516
Why are you bringing up blind dates
and getting married when I have Young-woo?

237
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,397
What are you talking about, Mom?
You can't raise her.

238
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,857
You said you barely make it to the
bathroom because your back hurts.

239
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,364
Stop!

240
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:31,782
Mom!

241
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,575
You know what?

242
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,912
I bite the bullet every single day.

243
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:41,166
Why are you making it worse,
of all people?

244
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,459
Darn it!

245
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,715
Darn it!

246
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,552
Young-woo, what are you up to?

247
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:03,230
Young-woo. Daddy's in so much pain.

248
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,899
Blow on it for me.

249
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:16,535
Look, Daddy's crying.

250
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,747
Daddy's crying.

251
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,736
Is it that fun, Young-woo?

252
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,406
What are you trying to be
when you grow up?

253
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,996
Someone who puts LEGO pieces on the floor?

254
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,590
How should I put it?

255
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,052
It's like the feeling
of a father and daughter

256
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:18,514
living in this world,
hand in hand, is missing.

257
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:22,267
It felt like as long as you were fed,

258
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,687
you would've been okay with anyone
even if it wasn't your dad.

259
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,694
Do you still feel that way?

260
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,490
It's much better now!
I can have conversations with you.

261
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:41,161
You liked putting
LEGO pieces on the floor,

262
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,372
but you also really liked the law.

263
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,833
It was a relief.

264
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,377
Because that was something

265
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,504
we could do together.

266
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,964
Young-woo!

267
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,299
Young-woo!

268
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,219
Young-woo!

269
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,721
Young-woo!

270
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:01,807
Young-woo!

271
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,857
Here, have this.

272
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,194
If you keep crying,
I'll call the police officer.

273
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,488
And the police will scold you.

274
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,115
Young-woo.

275
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,366
OBUK CORNER STORE

276
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,870
Jeez, this little girl
has such a loud voice.

277
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,454
My eardrums were about to burst.

278
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,832
Young-woo, get up.

279
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,502
Ms. Woo Young-woo.

280
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,755
This action falls
under public disturbance.

281
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,508
If you don't stop crying,
I'll call the police for minor offense

282
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,303
and obstruction of business
of Obuk Corner Store.

283
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,601
Young-woo, get up.

284
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,228
Goodness.

285
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:51,064
Let's go home and read about
the Punishment of Minor Offenses Act.

286
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,029
The way you like law,

287
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,364
that person must like something, right?

288
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,949
You should dig into that.

289
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,577
"Dig into what he likes."

290
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,456
Isn't that too obvious
to call it your method?

291
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,415
Hey.

292
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:12,461
If you want good grades, study.
If you want to lose weight, exercise.

293
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,505
If you want to communicate,
make an effort.

294
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:20,010
Methods are always obvious.
What's hard is accomplishing them.

295
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:22,804
Right.

296
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:26,767
Now that I think about it,
living with you,

297
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,145
I really…

298
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,446
But…

299
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,949
it takes a really long time.

300
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,787
Conversations don't just happen right away

301
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,166
simply by making an effort.

302
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,090
Do we really have to do this?

303
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:01,009
I agree. Is this really effective?

304
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:03,720
Yes.

305
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,314
Hello.

306
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,233
Come in.

307
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,239
-Peng-ha!
-Peng-ha!

308
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,577
Peng-ha!

309
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,915
Please, take a seat.

310
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,251
Here.

311
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,211
Sit down.

312
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:12,205
Let's soar through the sea
And go to the Billboard

313
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,249
It feels different

314
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,084
I feel good

315
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,921
With my little wings
Swim over the sky

316
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,090
I'm the very best

317
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,967
I'll be number one

318
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,102
South Pole Peng, Amazing Soo

319
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,229
-It can't get any better than this
-Than this!

320
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,690
I'm a penguin, an Emperor penguin,
The captain of all penguins

321
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,442
Marching toward the Billboard

322
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:44,112
Let's soar through the sea,
And go to the Billboard

323
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,073
It feels different

324
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,949
I feel good

325
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,951
With my little wings

326
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,661
Swim over the sky

327
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,955
I'm the very best

328
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,832
I'll be number one

329
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,251
Fantastic Pengsoo multiples
The more you divide

330
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,045
Thank you for sharing your love

331
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:00,962
Penguin's day

332
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,090
Happy birthday

333
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,967
There's no last place
We can all take up the challenge

334
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,928
Smiling dazzling eyes
Put your hands up, yes!

335
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,888
March, march, Captain Penguin

336
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,307
Confident legend of the South Pole

337
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,740
That's enough.

338
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:36,248
Yodel-oh-ee-dee, Yodel-oh-ee-dee

339
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:39,292
Yodel-oh-ee-dee, Yodel-oh-ee-dee

340
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:42,754
-Yodel-oh-ee-dee, Yodel-oh-ee-dee
-Yodel-oh-ee-dee, Yodel-oh-ee-dee

341
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:46,258
-Yodel-oh-ee-dee, Yodel-oh-ee-dee
-Yodel-oh-ee-dee, Yodel-oh-ee-dee

342
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,430
Again! Sing again!

343
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,890
-Should we?
-Again!

344
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,433
No.

345
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:59,813
We can sing again
only if Mr. Kim Jeong-hun answers.

346
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:03,525
Again! Sing again!

347
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,903
Answer me first.
Why did you beat up your brother?

348
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:17,455
Why?

349
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,540
-Attorney Woo.
-Why?

350
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,667
-Mr. Kim Jeong-hun, answer me.
-Why?

351
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,627
-Why did you beat up your brother?
-Why?

352
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:33,054
Die! Stop!

353
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,140
Stop! Die!

354
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,266
-Stop!
-Jeong-hun.

355
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,852
-Mr. Jeong-hun.
-Die! Stop!

356
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,354
Die!

357
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:57,704
Mr. Kim Jeong-hun.

358
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,624
Did your brother try to die?

359
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,293
What?

360
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,214
That "die" could be
an action, not what was said.

361
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,883
Not what his brother said but what he did.

362
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:11,718
His brother's actions?

363
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:15,138
When he died, Mr. Kim Sang-hun's blood
alcohol level was 0.321 percent.

364
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,556
He was unconscious.

365
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,185
And in his autopsy report,
there's a record of a mark on his neck.

366
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:23,104
It is written that it is unclear whether
or not he was strangled with a rope

367
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,105
because the mark is too faint.

368
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:28,443
Has your older son ever
attempted suicide when he was alive?

369
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:29,444
No.

370
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,988
Why would Sang-hun do such a thing?

371
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:33,949
Mr. Kim Jeong-hun.

372
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,951
Did your brother try to commit suicide?

373
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:38,828
Yes.

374
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,666
No.

375
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,668
Sang-hun isn't like that.

376
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:48,338
But you also just heard him say yes.

377
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,635
Jeong-hun.

378
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,054
Did your brother try to die?

379
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,306
Yes.

380
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,768
Jeong-hun, did your brother try to live?

381
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,395
Yes.

382
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,399
Your brother never tried to die?

383
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,526
Yes.

384
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:22,372
Communicating with Jeong-hun at his level

385
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:25,667
is still not an easy task, even for me.

386
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,546
I appreciate your effort,

387
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,258
but this will be the last time
you meet with Jeong-hun.

388
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,345
-Let's go.
-Yes.

389
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,196
You're trying to find evidence that
Kim Sang-hun attempted suicide, right?

390
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,700
Yes. But I'm not sure if there would be
any useful evidence left

391
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,494
since the police would've
looked through everything already.

392
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:04,831
But in this situation,
the case itself is very simple and clear.

393
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:09,210
So the police wouldn't have felt
the need to work hard to obtain evidence.

394
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,588
I hope there's something left
among his things.

395
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:13,590
Jun-ho!

396
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,008
What?

397
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,634
Hi.

398
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:19,220
What are you doing here?
You live in this apartment?

399
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,597
No, I'm here for work.

400
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,307
What work?

401
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:37,322
-Do you still do volunteer work?
-Volunteer work?

402
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,282
Aren't you volunteering
for Nanuri right now?

403
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:45,789
What are you talking about?
No, this isn't like that.

404
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,959
-You should get going. I'm late.
-All right. It was nice seeing you.

405
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,546
Hang in there.

406
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,768
Is Nanuri a volunteer organization

407
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:08,937
for disabled people?

408
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,690
I'm sorry, Attorney Woo.

409
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,193
She's a friend from college,
and that was rude of her.

410
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,111
Well.

411
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,322
It's okay. I have autism,

412
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,242
so I guess it could be seen that way.

413
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,119
I apologize.

414
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:48,893
I kept this door closed
because seeing the room was upsetting.

415
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,271
His things should all still be there.

416
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,690
But I'm not sure
if you'll find anything helpful.

417
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:54,858
Okay.

418
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,111
Could we take a look by ourselves?

419
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:00,029
We'll let you know if we find anything.

420
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:16,838
If I were to try
hanging myself in this room…

421
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:21,551
This is about where Kim Sang-hun
was found lying.

422
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,012
Then this should be it.

423
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,014
You said Mr. Kim Jeong-hun is tall, right?

424
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:29,100
Yes, he seemed almost two meters.

425
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,568
So his eye level
would be around this high?

426
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,528
Yes.

427
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,738
Then…

428
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:51,289
He opened the door
and saw his brother hanging by the neck.

429
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:53,458
He must've tried to
stop him at first, right?

430
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:00,089
He's tall, so he could've
reached up and untied the knot.

431
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,886
Then Sang-hun would've fallen
to the floor with a thud.

432
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:08,848
Wait.

433
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,923
What's that?

434
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:43,800
Do you see that?

435
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:57,939
What?

436
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,399
I think I found it.

437
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,694
There are traces on it
as if it has been roughly torn off.

438
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,572
Could it be the rope
that Mr. Sang-hun used to hang himself?

439
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,532
And could Mr. Jeong-hun have torn it off?

440
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:03,922
We'll have to check and compare it
with the mark on Mr. Sang-hun's neck.

441
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,294
I think this is Mr. Sang-hun's diary.

442
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,466
It's from last year.

443
00:32:56,933 --> 00:33:01,020
I sent the rope to National Forensic
Service to have it compared

444
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,522
to the mark on your son's neck.

445
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:04,565
I'll let you know
as soon as the results come in.

446
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,025
And also,

447
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:09,278
we went through your older son's diary.

448
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,990
And we've prepared some of the pages

449
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,909
because we thought you should see them.

450
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,206
According to the diary,

451
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:24,043
it seems like this incident happened
a few times last year, as well.

452
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,838
And your younger son witnessed it too.

453
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,339
What do you mean…

454
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,883
"this incident"?

455
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,430
I'm talking about suicide attempts.

456
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,309
You're making me repeat
the same thing over and over.

457
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,062
Sang-hun is not like that.

458
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,741
The only thing
I've been good at was studying.

459
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,411
I'm not even sure what that is now.

460
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:01,539
Is memorizing until I throw up studying?

461
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:06,961
I'm someone who is the worst
at what he does best.

462
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:10,631
Simply put, a loser.

463
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:15,511
The exams will probably continue.
And I will probably continue to fail.

464
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,890
I can't tell the difference
between life and death.

465
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:20,892
I can die.

466
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,061
If I die…

467
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,897
There isn't anything
people can't write in their diaries.

468
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,107
That's allowed
when you're having a hard time.

469
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,651
The important part is right here.

470
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,117
I do it as if it's become a habit.

471
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,290
I don't care if my brother sees me.

472
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,130
Die! Stop!

473
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:55,384
He can't seem to get a good night's sleep
ever since he saw me hang myself.

474
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,511
Die! Stop!

475
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,887
Does he have nightmares?

476
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,305
He watches me every night.

477
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,598
Die!

478
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,434
The idiot who doesn't even know
what dying is shakes in fear,

479
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,978
worried that I might die.

480
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,439
That…

481
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,150
is comforting to me.

482
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,529
Are you punishing us?

483
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,157
Did you call us here to let us know that

484
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,953
our child, who died a miserable death,
had suffered in life too?

485
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,247
Even on the day of the incident,

486
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:28,042
your younger son might've been
trying to stop the older one.

487
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,586
He might have beaten him up
because he got angry

488
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,880
after seeing his brother
attempting suicide continuously.

489
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,715
So what difference does that make?

490
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,511
The kid who was famous all over
the country for being good at studying

491
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:41,556
frequently attempted suicide
because of some mere academic stress.

492
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,558
If this gets out,

493
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,685
what becomes of our Sang-hun?

494
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,688
What would it be
besides disgracing a dead person?

495
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:51,065
Isn't getting a sentence reduction
for Mr. Jeong-hun, who is alive,

496
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,026
more important than the honor
of Mr. Sang-hun, who is dead?

497
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:57,113
He can't be seen as a person
who beat his own brother to death

498
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,364
without any particular reason.

499
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:01,367
There was a specific reason
that made his temper explode.

500
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,369
And now that the reason has been removed,

501
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:07,874
we'll have to show in the trial
that he won't commit violence anymore.

502
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,458
You be quiet!

503
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,170
What makes you so special

504
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:15,673
that you're calling my precious sons
by their names and judging them?

505
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,550
You're autistic yourself!

506
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,093
Honey, what's wrong with you?

507
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,803
Forget it.

508
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,930
Let's just call it quits.

509
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:27,185
I will give this case to an attorney
who won't insult my son.

510
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,812
The relationship between Sangjeong
and Hanbada is over.

511
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:30,813
Sir.

512
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:32,481
Ma'am.

513
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,613
Sir.

514
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,293
-Hey.
-Yes.

515
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,086
I'm making ramyeon right now.
You want me to add one for you?

516
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,129
No, I'm good.

517
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,135
I'm not giving you a bite.

518
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,113
ATTORNEY WOO YOUNG-WOO

519
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:24,659
Attorney Woo, the mistake
my friend made last time…

520
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:33,084
What my friend did wrong
last time keeps bothering me.

521
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,878
I want to give you a proper apology.

522
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,847
You want to apologize to her. So what?

523
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,774
A male in his twenties,
who assaulted his brother to death,

524
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:58,776
has been charged
with bodily injury resulting in death.

525
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,654
The 21-year-old Mr. A,
who has autism spectrum disorder,

526
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,448
assaulted his intoxicated brother,
Mr. B, while their parents were out,

527
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,576
leaving him with a serious injury
of 22 rib fractures.

528
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,788
Mr. B was taken to the hospital
by his parents who had returned home

529
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:12,373
but in the end, passed away.

530
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,751
It was found out that Mr. B had achieved
a perfect score on the 2018 CSAT

531
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:18,587
and was a brilliant student
attending SNU medical school,

532
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:21,090
which only added
to the sorrow of the public.

533
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:27,888
ISN'T THE MED SCHOOL STUDENT DYING WHILE
THE AUTISTIC GUY LIVING A NATIONAL LOSS?

534
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,893
299 LIKES

535
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,733
I'M SURE HE'LL BE FOUND NOT GUILTY,
BY PLEADING INSANITY

536
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,785
HE KNOWS EVERYTHING EVEN IF HE HAS AUTISM.
SEND HIM TO PRISON.

537
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,080
I HAVE AN AUTISTIC NEIGHBOR
AND IT'S ACTUALLY SCARY

538
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:55,708
THIS IS WHY THEY SHOULD BE ISOLATED

539
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,376
LET'S NOT GO EASY ON HIM
JUST BECAUSE HE'S AUTISTIC

540
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:23,402
Hey.

541
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,487
Peng-ha!

542
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,696
Peng-ha!

543
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,365
Peng-ha!

544
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,663
I hear you got fired
even after you sang a song.

545
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:38,125
People often tell you
that you're rude, right?

546
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,336
People often tell you
that you pretend to be nice, right?

547
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,471
Attorney Jung.

548
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:57,103
I heard about what happened with
the Chairman of Sangjeong Pharmaceuticals.

549
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,396
You must be upset.

550
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:02,691
Well, I'm fine, but Attorney Woo worked
really hard on this, so it's too bad.

551
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:03,901
I see.

552
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:06,070
Attorney Woo, hang in there.

553
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,796
Where do you think you're going?

554
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,049
The fare…

555
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:29,927
What's the matter?

556
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,807
What's the matter?

557
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,274
What seems to be the problem?

558
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:46,235
He just got into my taxi out of nowhere.

559
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,572
And kept saying "Hanbada."

560
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:52,658
So I brought him here, but he won't pay!

561
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:55,619
When I asked him
if he had money, he said "Yes."

562
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,705
I'll pay for his fare.

563
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,294
-Okay.
-Thank you.

564
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,005
Again. Sing.

565
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,465
Again.

566
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,924
Sing again.

567
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,009
Okay.

568
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:12,470
Call his mother and tell her
to come pick up her son.

569
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,805
And stay with him until she gets here.

570
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,599
Yes, all right.

571
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:19,059
Again. Sing again.

572
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,125
-Jeong-hun!
-Mom!

573
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,293
Goodness.

574
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:49,048
I was so worried!

575
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:53,886
Gosh.

576
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:55,971
Thank you, Attorney Woo.

577
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,642
I'm sorry Jeong-hun inconvenienced you.

578
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:03,604
It's fine.

579
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,317
Excuse me.

580
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:14,031
I've been doing some thinking.

581
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,868
Does it really have to be
revealed in court

582
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,871
that Sang-hun tried to make such a choice?

583
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:26,001
Jeong-hun can get
his sentence reduced anyway.

584
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,671
He has autism, so maybe
by pleading insanity.

585
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,882
I was hoping

586
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:35,052
you all would take this case back.

587
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:38,514
I don't think there will be anyone else

588
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:41,392
who would treat Jeong-hun
with such sincerity.

589
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,353
If you don't…

590
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,856
bring up that thing about Sang-hun,

591
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,401
I'll convince my husband.

592
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,360
Right.

593
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:52,903
Okay.

594
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:55,990
I will talk to
Attorney Jung Myeong-seok about it.

595
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,409
Attorney Woo.

596
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,581
I apologize for what my husband said.

597
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:05,916
I know

598
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,043
I shouldn't say this,

599
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:13,257
but we felt conflicted seeing you.

600
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:17,052
You and Jeong-hun both are autistic.

601
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,762
But you two are so different

602
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,348
that we couldn't help but compare.

603
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:26,061
We've heard that sometimes
people with autism are brilliant.

604
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,439
But seeing it in real life like this

605
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,733
made us feel strange.

606
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,277
You know, with autism,

607
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,281
most cases are like Jeong-hun.

608
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,619
And it just takes
too long for us to be hopeful

609
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,041
that he'll get better.

610
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:02,139
Hans Asperger, the first person
to do research on autism,

611
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:05,267
thought there was a positive side to it.

612
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,227
He said,

613
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:10,064
"Not everything that steps
out of line, and thus 'abnormal',

614
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,940
must necessarily be 'inferior'."

615
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:15,110
That with their new ways
of thinking and experiences,

616
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,613
people with autism
can later accomplish great things.

617
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:22,701
Hans Asperger was a Nazi collaborator.

618
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:26,705
His job was to separate children
who were worthy of living and who weren't.

619
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:30,459
To the Nazis, people who were
not worthy of living were those who were

620
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:35,547
physically disabled, terminally ill, or
mentally ill, including autistic people.

621
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,049
Jeong-hun, say goodbye.

622
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:41,011
Say, "I apologize for the trouble
I've caused. Thank you."

623
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,015
Peng-ba.

624
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:49,645
Peng-ba.

625
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,863
Even just 80 years ago,

626
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:02,533
autism was an illness
that was not worthy of living.

627
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:07,037
Even just 80 years ago,
Mr. Kim Jeong-hun and I

628
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:10,165
were people who weren't worthy of living.

629
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,502
Even now, hundreds of people

630
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,796
click the "like" button
on a comment that says,

631
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,257
"It is a national loss
if a medical student dies

632
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:20,300
and an autistic person lives."

633
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,136
Peng-ba!

634
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,138
Peng-ba!

635
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:32,938
That is the weight

636
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,982
of this disability that we bear.

637
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,410
WITNESS

638
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:50,038
I believe Mr. Kim Jeong-hun
had a meltdown.

639
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:53,959
Could you explain
what a meltdown is, please?

640
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,712
It is a phenomenon that occurs
to people with autism from time to time.

641
00:45:56,795 --> 00:46:00,257
It is when they explode due to
not being able to withstand any longer

642
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,800
the stress they have been suppressing.

643
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:04,261
It's not something
that is done intentionally.

644
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:09,975
It just happens when they are overwhelmed
by the feeling of extreme helplessness.

645
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,603
There are a variety of types.

646
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:16,648
There are those that cut off
all communication and withdraw,

647
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:19,193
but also those where it can
manifest in very aggressive ways.

648
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:24,031
Like screaming, crying,
and even self-harm,

649
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,991
as well as displaying violent behavior.

650
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:28,952
So at the time of the incident,
the defendant's behavior

651
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:32,915
was a meltdown that he had
no choice or control over?

652
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:35,459
Thus, a symptom of autism
spectrum disorder?

653
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,753
Yes, I believe so.

654
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:40,756
That is all.

655
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:53,810
Witness, you are a psychiatrist
who is well-informed about autism?

656
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:55,729
Well, yes.

657
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:56,813
Right.

658
00:46:56,897 --> 00:47:00,901
How many autistic patients
are in this courtroom?

659
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:02,569
What?

660
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:07,741
I'm asking because it seems to me that
there is one more besides the defendant.

661
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:16,416
What about the attorney
who questioned you just now?

662
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,256
Objection!

663
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:25,592
The prosecutor is insulting
the attorney with statements

664
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,636
that are both irrelevant
to the case and discriminatory.

665
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,721
Overruled.

666
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:30,889
Excuse me?

667
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,141
You're overruling my objection?

668
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:37,938
While the prosecutor's question
may be badgering the attorney,

669
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:41,567
I don't see it as being irrelevant
to the case nor as discriminatory.

670
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,735
Counselor, take a seat.

671
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,529
Prosecution, please continue.

672
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,158
So…

673
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:55,998
Is the attorney who questioned you
just now an autistic patient?

674
00:47:57,082 --> 00:48:00,586
Just because one has autism does not mean
they all have to get treatment.

675
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:04,172
And I believe the phrase
"autistic patient" is inappropriate.

676
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,882
Even when she's doing that

677
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,759
in court?

678
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:17,269
Prosecutor, what do you think
you're doing?

679
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:18,895
What do you mean?

680
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:23,275
I'm asking whether or not the defendant's
attorney, Woo Young-woo, has autism.

681
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:26,987
I'm aware that Attorney Woo
has autism spectrum disorder.

682
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,324
However, I only know because I heard.
I did not diagnose her.

683
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,659
I'm not some sort of appraiser.

684
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:36,246
I can't say someone is this or that
the moment I see them.

685
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,664
Now, answer clearly.

686
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,125
Does Attorney Woo Young-woo
have autism or not?

687
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:41,877
She does.

688
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:44,004
-She does but--
-Do you think

689
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:47,591
that the defendant
is a mentally unfit person?

690
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:50,510
-Yes.
-Because he has autism?

691
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:52,679
Yes.

692
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:57,768
Then do you also think
the attorney is mentally unfit?

693
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,186
Objection!

694
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,729
We are on trial about the defendant,

695
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:02,814
but why do you
keep mentioning the attorney?

696
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,024
The attorney's medical history

697
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,652
is irrelevant to the defendant,
the incident, and the trial.

698
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:07,778
It is not irrelevant.

699
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:10,238
It is not irrelevant because the defense
is arguing for a reduced sentence

700
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:12,991
due to the defendant's autism.

701
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:15,702
If the autistic defendant
is mentally unfit,

702
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,663
can't the same be said for the attorney?

703
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:20,290
Does the prosecution
not know what mentally unfit is?

704
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:23,418
Having mental or physical disorders
does not mean they are all mentally unfit.

705
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:26,046
It is only when the disability affects
one's ability to discern things

706
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:30,050
and make decisions that they are
considered to be mentally unfit.

707
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:33,261
So the sentence of the autistic defendant

708
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,430
should be reduced
compared to other criminals,

709
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,224
but the arguments of the autistic attorney

710
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,559
should be recognized as equal
to other legal professionals?

711
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,311
Doesn't something feel off to you?

712
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:46,066
I'm pointing out the irony
of the attorney's argument.

713
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:33,196
Attorney Woo!

714
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:02,809
Your hand is still grabbing onto my butt.

715
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:05,145
Right.

716
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,313
Yes.

717
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:17,532
So that's why I fell on my back.

718
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,514
Your shoes…

719
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,892
Attorney Woo, your shoes.

720
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:47,896
Yes?

721
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:59,491
I was just hanging myself
and Jun-ho saved me.

722
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,409
Sorry, what?

723
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:05,914
Jun-ho first used his left hand
to hold up my butt.

724
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:09,543
And then used his right hand
to untie the knot around my neck.

725
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,920
Do you know what happened then?

726
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:18,468
My body was tipped backward
and I fell on my back.

727
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,387
What are you talking about?

728
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,806
According to the autopsy report,
Mr. Kim Sang-hun…

729
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:25,016
I mean,

730
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:28,812
the victim's ribs
had a total of 22 fractures.

731
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:32,440
Total of 5 on the front
of his right ribs, numbers 3 to 7,

732
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:35,485
and 6 on the front
of his left ribs, numbers 2 to 7.

733
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:36,403
And…

734
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:37,863
And…

735
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:38,822
Wait…

736
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:41,283
May I point to your ribs?

737
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:42,742
What?

738
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:43,910
Sure.

739
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:48,999
And 11 on the back
of his right ribs, numbers 2 to 12.

740
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:52,085
And he doesn't have fractures
anywhere else. Isn't it strange?

741
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,965
The fractures
on the front of both his ribs

742
00:52:57,048 --> 00:53:00,427
are highly likely from CPR.

743
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,305
The problem is the back of his right ribs.

744
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:07,100
The fracture is aligned straight
from number 2 to number 12.

745
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:11,938
Unless the defendant struck
the victim's back in a straight line,

746
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,566
it is hard to get this type of fracture.

747
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:18,111
However, if the defendant
tried to save the victim

748
00:53:18,194 --> 00:53:21,573
with the same method
as Jun-ho, it is possible.

749
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:25,785
So, because the defendant
was holding onto the victim's butt,

750
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,538
he fell on the floor, back first.

751
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:32,626
So? What difference does that make?

752
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:33,919
That will make your younger son

753
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,838
not guilty of bodily injury
resulting in death.

754
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:40,842
Of course, he will be
found guilty of assault.

755
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:44,679
But he'll be able to get off from
the charge of killing your older son.

756
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,389
And the sentence will be much lighter too.

757
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:49,559
But…

758
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,938
for us to plead not guilty based on this,

759
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,857
we can't hide the fact

760
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:58,526
that your older son attempted suicide.

761
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,528
You need to decide, sir.

762
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:08,161
I've actually…

763
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,665
been thinking a lot about this problem.

764
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:15,085
When you reach my age,

765
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:19,005
children feel like
your report card for life.

766
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,759
As a father, I didn't want to admit

767
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,137
that Sang-hun was that unhappy.

768
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,432
But what is there that I wouldn't do

769
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:32,060
for Jeong-hun?

770
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:35,438
Proceed with what you just said.

771
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,315
Okay.

772
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:42,195
There's one thing I also want to say.

773
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:47,325
This was something I was going to
discuss with Attorney Jung alone.

774
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,744
But since we're all here,
I'll just say it.

775
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,705
All right. You two take a seat.

776
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:52,664
Okay.

777
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,628
From now on,

778
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:02,674
I want the trial to proceed
without Attorney Woo.

779
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:09,014
I know how hard you try, Attorney Woo.

780
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:12,475
However, you heard
what the prosecutor said during the trial.

781
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:16,813
Please think of
what is best for Jeong-hun.

782
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:21,276
But sir, you heard
what Attorney Woo told you just now.

783
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,695
We can take this in a different
direction than the last trial.

784
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:26,698
We'll not only emphasize
your younger son's mentally unfit state

785
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:30,785
but also plead not guilty based on
scientific evidence of the autopsy report.

786
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:33,329
I think…

787
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,793
the Chairman is right.

788
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:45,383
When I walk with Jun-ho,

789
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:49,471
people think he's doing
volunteer work for a disabled person.

790
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:55,435
When the taxi driver was holding on
to the defendant, I had money too.

791
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:59,481
But the driver didn't see me as someone
capable of resolving the situation.

792
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:04,986
I can tell how my autism
and the defendant's autism are similar

793
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,404
and how they're different.

794
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:09,741
But the prosecutor can't.

795
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:10,825
Which means…

796
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,621
neither can the judges.

797
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:15,622
I'm…

798
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:19,167
not an attorney
who is helpful to the defendant.

799
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:26,716
I'm…

800
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:29,761
not an attorney

801
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,597
who is helpful

802
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:35,266
to the defendant.

803
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:49,072
Please, convince the Chairman.

804
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:50,406
Of what?

805
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,451
Taking Attorney Woo Young-woo to court?

806
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:57,122
Yes. It's not like she's bad at her job
or that she made a mistake.

807
00:56:57,205 --> 00:57:00,291
It's discrimination to not let her go
to trial because of the reason

808
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,293
that she won't be able
to effectively make her defense

809
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:05,380
due to her autism.

810
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:07,298
Weren't you the one who said,

811
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:12,846
"Did you not see
the second page of her resume?"

812
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,889
"You saw that but still accepted her?"

813
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:18,560
"How am I supposed to train someone who
can't even introduce herself properly?"

814
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:20,103
Didn't you say that?

815
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:23,148
What happened since then?

816
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:24,649
Back then,

817
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,152
she wasn't on my team.

818
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:28,945
Now, she is.

819
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,075
Well.

820
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:39,372
I do agree that
what the Chairman of Sangjeong asked is

821
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:42,459
unfair and discriminatory.

822
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,378
But I'm the CEO.

823
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:48,089
I have to do what the client wants.

824
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,674
So,

825
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,719
Attorney Jung, don't go to court either.

826
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:55,972
-What?
-You said she's on your team, right?

827
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:58,308
"If you don't go, I won't go."

828
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,226
You have to show them.

829
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:06,399
I can't be a fighter who fights until
the end for a rookie attorney's rights.

830
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,736
So you should show them.

831
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,946
That you two are one team.

832
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,367
Yes, all right.

833
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:17,494
Okay.

834
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:21,789
I will reassign the case to Attorney Jang.
Hand him the case files directly.

835
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:26,211
Why Jang Seung-jun, of all people?

836
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:30,340
You should at least
get that kind of penalty.

837
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:33,676
The Chairman might think
of this as very unpleasant.

838
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,887
Thinking you're protesting
because you're upset about what he said.

839
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:39,307
Okay, I understand.

840
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,369
Hey.

841
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:01,329
Myeong-seok?

842
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,541
What's up?

843
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:07,126
The CEO called you, right?

844
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,170
Yes, the CEO called me.

845
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:11,506
But what's up?

846
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:13,675
You should know if she called you.

847
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:16,636
Yes, I do know since she called me.

848
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:18,972
What are you getting at?

849
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:23,726
I just want to hear Myeong-seok
ask me for a favor himself.

850
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,147
Do me a favor.

851
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:31,484
What? I can't hear you.

852
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,529
Probably because I'm hanging upside down.

853
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:35,947
I can't hear you.

854
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:45,456
Do me a favor.

855
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,500
What did you say?

856
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,294
I can't hear you.

857
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:02,682
Gosh.

858
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:07,729
What?

859
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:11,316
Do me a favor, Seung-jun.

860
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:14,193
Can't you live without me, Myeong-seok?

861
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:17,905
How long do I have to keep
cleaning up after you, Myeong-seok?

862
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:27,582
Leave the case files over there.

863
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:29,459
I'll handle it for you.

864
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:33,421
I told you to put it over there.

865
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:35,673
Seriously.

866
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,010
What?

867
01:00:39,093 --> 01:00:40,178
Myeong-seok.

868
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,598
Myeong-seok!

869
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:46,601
Darn it.

870
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:50,938
Myeong-seok!

871
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:52,482
ATTORNEYS

872
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:54,567
Counselor, you may begin
questioning the witness.

873
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:55,485
Right.

874
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,198
DEFENDANT

875
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,576
What is your occupation, Witness?

876
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,536
I'm a medical examiner.

877
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:08,748
I do autopsy-related work
at the National Forensic Service.

878
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,917
What is the victim's cause of death?

879
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,170
He had internal bleeding
in his chest due to broken ribs.

880
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:17,006
Why would he have broken ribs?

881
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:21,094
The anterior fractures
seem to have been caused by CPR.

882
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:22,970
When the paramedics arrived,

883
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:26,015
the victim was already not breathing
and his heart had stopped,

884
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:28,935
so it is understood that the fractures
happened after his death.

885
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:31,938
The problem is
on the posterior side of the ribs.

886
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:36,359
There is a series of fractures
in the form of a slanted diagonal line.

887
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:38,569
Considering this location and the form,

888
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:41,823
it seems to be from a single,
continuous impact,

889
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:44,784
rather than separate, independent impacts.

890
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:47,954
You're saying it seems to be
from a single, continuous impact,

891
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:51,833
rather than separate, independent impacts?

892
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:56,671
That sounds quite complicated.
Can you simplify what you've just said?

893
01:01:56,754 --> 01:02:02,176
It means that it's hard to say
that the ribs were broken one by one

894
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:04,637
because the fractures
are aligned in a straight line.

895
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:08,850
Instead, it would've been caused
by a single big impact.

896
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:12,353
A single big impact?
Could you give us an example?

897
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:15,398
At the time of the incident, the victim
seems to have fallen to the floor

898
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:17,442
after hanging
from the ceiling by his neck.

899
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:21,404
The rope that was found in his room
matches the scratches on his neck.

900
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:25,950
And on top of that, his blood
alcohol level was as high as 0.3 percent.

901
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:30,580
So there wouldn't have been
any reflexive behavior when he fell.

902
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:35,376
Then it's highly likely that
the fractures are from the fall.

903
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:40,089
Is there no possibility for the ribs

904
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:42,967
to have been broken
due to the defendant's assault?

905
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:46,053
Possibility? Yes, of course, there is.

906
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:51,851
However, it is a bit awkward.

907
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:55,938
I heard that the defendant
was extremely agitated

908
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:58,524
when he was attacking the victim.

909
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,151
In that state,

910
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:02,820
it would be difficult
to aim at the victim's ribs

911
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:05,823
in the shape of a neat line.

912
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:06,824
Thank you.

913
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:09,160
That is all.

914
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:18,044
Just a moment.

915
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:21,297
Let me ask a question first.

916
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:23,549
Defendant?

917
01:03:29,555 --> 01:03:30,765
Mr. Kim Jeong-hun?

918
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:33,434
Yes!

919
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:35,978
You just heard
the medical examiner's testimony, right?

920
01:03:37,271 --> 01:03:40,817
Did you drop your brother to the ground?

921
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:43,361
Yes.

922
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:51,702
Were you trying to save his life?

923
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:57,542
Yes.

924
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:01,796
And it's not that
the rope broke on its own?

925
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:04,507
Yes.

926
01:04:05,883 --> 01:04:07,468
Say it clearly.

927
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:11,556
Were you or were you not the one
to drop your brother?

928
01:04:12,723 --> 01:04:13,641
Yes!

929
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:21,107
Mr. Kim Jeong-hun?

930
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:27,280
Were you trying
to save your brother or not?

931
01:04:38,082 --> 01:04:39,166
Yes!

932
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:50,511
I asked these questions to check
if the defendant is capable

933
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:54,140
of understanding and answering questions

934
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:55,850
and testifying about what happened
at the time of the incident.

935
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:59,437
I think it is certain that the defendant

936
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:02,565
is mentally unfit as of right now.

937
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:34,513
The results will be good.

938
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:36,265
Is that so?

939
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:39,060
I was shocked that the prosecutor demanded
seven years of imprisonment

940
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:41,604
and claimed medical treatment and custody.

941
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:45,441
No matter what he demanded,
we proved our argument well.

942
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:48,361
And most of all, the judges
seemed to be understanding.

943
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:49,320
I think it's likely

944
01:05:49,403 --> 01:05:51,364
that he'll be found not guilty
of bodily injury resulting in death.

945
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:53,616
And he'll get probation
for the assault too.

946
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:56,661
If not, we can always appeal,
so don't worry too much.

947
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,204
Okay.

948
01:05:58,287 --> 01:05:59,497
Gosh.

949
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:00,957
It was no trouble at all.

950
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:05,836
It was an honor to be able to
finish your case myself.

951
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:12,176
You both worked so hard
to prepare for the trial.

952
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:13,844
I'm sorry.

953
01:06:17,181 --> 01:06:21,394
Especially Attorney Woo,
you must be so disappointed.

954
01:06:24,689 --> 01:06:26,148
It's fine.

955
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:31,654
-Thank you for your efforts.
-No problem, sir.

956
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:34,115
She's the--

957
01:06:34,198 --> 01:06:35,449
Thank you, Seung-jun.

958
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:39,829
We'll get going now.

959
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:41,372
Attorney Woo, let's go.

960
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:46,377
Yes, you're welcome.

961
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:16,240
Excuse me.

962
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:18,075
Yes.

963
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:21,495
Could you wrap this up for me?
It's a gift.

964
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:23,247
-Sure.

Apparently, he got tricked by my uncles
and signed some weird memorandum.

Yes, a memorandum that says he'll share
the land compensation with my uncles.

01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:12,499
Your dad is getting land compensation?

01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:14,293
-Ten billion won.
-That's great.

-Are you just going to watch the father

of your only friend become broke
after being fooled by his older brothers?

side as you, Attorney Woo.
