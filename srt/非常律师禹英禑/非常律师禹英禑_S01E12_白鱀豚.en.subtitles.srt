00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,788
SENIOR MANAGER, KIM HYEON-JEONG
MIR LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY

2
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:32,801
Ms. Kim.

3
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,471
He's ready to see you now.

4
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,848
Okay.

5
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:50,610
You're aware that the company is currently
in the process of an M&A, right?

6
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:51,778
Yes, sir.

7
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,739
I understand Mir Life

8
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:58,535
will be acquired by SB Life,
a German insurance company.

9
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,412
Since the owner
of the company is changing,

10
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,248
we can't avoid restructuring.

11
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,834
This is the policy
that was decided on by the higher-ups.

12
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,419
"Employees who are married
within the company

13
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,004
are eligible for voluntary resignation."

14
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,881
Why?

15
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,925
Because they have relative stability.

16
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,427
Relative stability?

17
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,014
Employees who are married
with a double income

18
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,725
must have a more stable life
than single-income employees.

19
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:26,146
But even if I add up my salary
with my husband's,

20
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,439
it wouldn't match up
to the executives' salaries.

21
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,525
This is the company policy.

22
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,194
"If one of the employees
of a married couple

23
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,571
does not voluntarily resign,

24
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:38,116
the husband will be subjected to
unpaid leave."

25
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,912
So you're saying that if I don't quit,

26
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,456
you're going to fire my husband?

27
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:51,504
Think hard about
which option would be more beneficial.

28
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:55,216
As a wife, should you really be getting
in the way of your husband's career?

29
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:56,968
Excuse me?

30
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,178
It would be uncomfortable
for the parents too.

31
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,638
What kind of parents would be happy to see

32
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,182
their son hanging around at home
while their daughter-in-law goes to work?

33
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,564
This is when you should
support your husband.

34
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,408
Ms. Kim.

35
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,243
Ms. Kim.

36
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,370
What did the Head of HR say?

37
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,288
Right.

38
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,832
Your husband
also works here right, Ms. Lee?

39
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,168
Yes. Why do you ask?

40
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,461
Ms. Lee.

41
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,504
He'll see you now.

42
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,424
Okay.

43
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,388
HUSBAND: WE NEED TO TALK

44
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,891
What did he say to you?

45
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,352
He told me to convince you.

46
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,979
To get me to quit?

47
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,524
That's what the company wants right now.

48
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,318
To get rid of the female employees.

49
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:08,790
Are you okay?

50
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,460
I worked so hard for this company.

51
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,003
You know that, right?

52
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,713
Of course.

53
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,840
Of course, I know.

54
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,550
I think I took maybe two weeks off

55
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,053
after I gave birth to Jeong-min.

56
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:27,016
I voluntarily gave up the remaining days
of my maternity leave

57
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,103
and came straight back to work.

58
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,688
I know.

59
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,232
Everyone at work knows you did.

60
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,859
They expected me to drop all my roles
as mother and wife

61
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,238
and be a dedicated employee
of the company.

62
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,742
Now he's saying I should just stay home
and take care of you as a wife.

63
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,414
He said I'll be getting in the way
of your career…

64
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,586
if I keep working here.

65
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:22,739
CASE 12
YANGTZE RIVER DOLPHIN

66
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:30,705
Come in.

67
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,462
Gosh.

68
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,716
It seems as if…

69
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,804
-Did you spend the night here?
-No, I went home at dawn and rested.

70
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,097
I see.

71
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,891
You're having a burger for breakfast?

72
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:54,145
Yes. I have a client meeting soon,
so there's no time to eat a proper meal.

73
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,022
What can I do for you?

74
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:59,484
I'm on my way to visit
Attorney Park Hak-su at the hospital.

75
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,153
I thought maybe you could join me.

76
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,405
But I guess you can't come.

77
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,490
Wait…

78
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,242
What happened to Attorney Park?

79
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,535
Is he ill?

80
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,703
Gosh.

81
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,539
You haven't heard yet?

82
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:18,544
Last night, Jang Jae-jin paid a visit
to Attorney Park and caused a scene.

83
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,921
Jang Jae-jin…

84
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,925
Jang Jae-jin, the son of
Hyeonbo Construction's chairman?

85
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,134
Yes, that's right.

86
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,595
He got out of prison a few days ago.

87
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:32,016
The reason he only got
an eight-year sentence

88
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,853
after brutally murdering his own father
is all thanks to you and Attorney Park.

89
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:39,440
I wonder what his problem is.

90
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:43,069
He went to Attorney Park's home
and swung a knife at him for revenge.

91
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,489
Thank goodness
his family showed up in time.

92
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:50,493
Luckily, he wasn't injured too badly.
Just a bit rattled up.

93
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,412
Was Jang Jae-jin caught?

94
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,499
Not yet. The police are looking for him.

95
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,170
Jang Jae-jin probably
remembers my face too.

96
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,673
So I told the security team

97
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:07,135
to pay more attention
to the people entering the building.

98
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,971
We're going to increase the number
of security personnel,

99
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,014
so don't worry too much. Okay?

100
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,641
Yes, ma'am.

101
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,519
-Get back to work then.
-I'll see you later.

102
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,721
He went to Attorney Park's home
and swung a knife at him for revenge.

103
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,016
Was Jang Jae-jin caught?

104
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,560
Not yet. The police are looking for him.

105
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:13,826
Hello.

106
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,473
You're Attorney Jung Myeong-seok, right?

107
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,266
Yes.

108
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,019
I'm Moon Jong-cheol,
the Head of HR at Mir Life.

109
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,896
We've met once before. Do you remember?

110
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,856
Yes.

111
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,191
I'm sorry.

112
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,944
Let's go to the conference room.

113
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,111
Sure.

114
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,656
"If one of the employees
of a married couple

115
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,533
does not voluntarily resign,

116
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,744
the husband will be subjected to
unpaid leave."

117
00:08:56,827 --> 00:09:00,248
I'm not sure why this policy
is discriminatory toward women.

118
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:04,919
Since they're penalizing the husband,
isn't it discriminatory toward men?

119
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,462
Exactly.

120
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,089
That's what I'm saying.

121
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,508
The opposing attorney keeps claiming

122
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,885
that it's discrimination
against female employees

123
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,137
and it's so frustrating.

124
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,138
Well…

125
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:21,644
That may be true in a literal sense,
but our society has patriarchal values.

126
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,647
If only one person
of the married couple can work,

127
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,858
can we really ignore the prejudice
that it should obviously be the husband?

128
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:29,819
I see.

129
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,530
In fact, out of the 112 married couples
in the company,

130
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:35,199
ninety-eight of the wives
have already resigned.

131
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:39,078
Exactly. You said you would penalize
the husbands, but ultimately,

132
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,956
it was mostly the wives
who voluntarily resigned.

133
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,750
And on top of that,
they can't even make a complaint.

134
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,461
Because their husbands are being held
like hostages by the company.

135
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,798
Isn't this probably why only
2 out of the 98 female employees

136
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,426
who resigned filed the lawsuit?

137
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:57,847
Was this policy created
with all this considered?

138
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,931
What?

139
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,726
Well, I mean…

140
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,939
It's quite difficult to proceed with
major restructuring without any issues,

141
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:10,651
so Mir Life just found
the most efficient method.

142
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,654
Yes, that's right. That's what I'm saying.

143
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,574
All right. The two employees
who filed the suit

144
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,577
are Kim Hyeon-jeong
and Lee Ji-young, right?

145
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,829
What kind of employees were they?

146
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:25,791
They weren't particularly problematic.

147
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,377
You could say that Senior Manager Kim

148
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,213
was very dedicated to her work.

149
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,550
Since she received
the Best Employee Award twice.

150
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:38,596
Assistant Manager Lee
was good at her job too.

151
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:42,141
I see that she frequently took days off
before her resignation.

152
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:45,186
I think those were
for her doctor's appointments,

153
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,146
but I'll look into it more.

154
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:50,316
The more information you have
on the plaintiffs, the better.

155
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,693
Please give us everything you have.

156
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,363
We're not trying to
pick apart their flaws,

157
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:59,283
but it is crucial that we know
of their situations or weaknesses.

158
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,743
Yes, all right.

159
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,995
But…

160
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,705
about the opposing attorney.

161
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,124
Attorney Ryu Jae-sook?

162
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,459
Do you know her well?

163
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:11,128
No, I don't know her personally.

164
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,339
I know that she usually takes on cases

165
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,717
involving women, human rights, and labor.

166
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:20,429
Is she famous in this field?

167
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,057
She did a lot of cases
that stirred up the public.

168
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,935
For example, the case of "Seono Heavy
Industry's subcontracting misconduct,"

169
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,229
"Gwangil Group's early retirement
of its female employees,"

170
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,981
and the "workers' suit against Gyeongok
Construction for causing pneumoconiosis."

171
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:34,151
But because she takes
on big David and Goliath-like cases,

172
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,153
her winning rate is not that high.

173
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,781
She lost all the cases
that were just mentioned.

174
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,075
It's as if she's an attorney
that specializes in losing cases.

175
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:45,996
Do you have any particular concerns
about Attorney Ryu?

176
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,456
Well,

177
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,334
she came by the company once, and she was…

178
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,795
How should I put this?

179
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,048
Loud?

180
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,803
Do not

181
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:05,057
inform the company of your marital status!

182
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,230
Mir Life is exploiting the law
to force wives to voluntarily resign

183
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:16,110
to achieve
gender discriminatory restructuring!

184
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,154
Come to your senses!

185
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,448
-Come to your senses!
-Come to your senses!

186
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,577
Forced resignation under the guise
of voluntary resignation!

187
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,204
Condemn the act of oppression!

188
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,331
-Condemn!
-She is loud.

189
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,459
-Mir Life, come to your senses!
-It's the pretrial hearing today.

190
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,253
-Come to your senses!
-Is she warming up by protesting?

191
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,838
I've never seen
an attorney like her before.

192
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,173
Condemn!

193
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,092
-Condemn!
-Condemn!

194
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:44,054
And it seems like she is wearing
matching colors with the plaintiffs.

195
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,015
And put on matching headbands too.

196
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,934
-Come to your senses!
-Come to your senses!

197
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,145
It's almost time. Should we head in?

198
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:54,064
Judge Ryu Myeong-ha
is known to be strict about everything.

199
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,024
Ryu Myeong-ha?

200
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,692
Condemn this act of oppression!

201
00:12:56,775 --> 00:13:00,613
The judge of this case
is Judge Ryu Myeong-ha?

202
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,406
Yes, you didn't know?

203
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,033
We have a problem.

204
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:08,496
That loud attorney,
isn't her name Ryu Jae-sook?

205
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,498
No way…

206
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,292
She can't be from
the Ryu family of Pungsan, right?

207
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:18,297
Mir Life, admit to this unjust dismissal!

208
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,841
-Admit!
-Admit!

209
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,930
CONCILIATOR

210
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,557
Hello.

211
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,937
PLAINTIFF

212
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,021
DEFENDANT

213
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,397
Your Honor.

214
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,151
The plaintiffs and their attorney
just held a protest

215
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,362
in front of the court regarding this case.

216
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,532
I'm concerned
that the protest will affect you

217
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:49,328
and undermine the fairness of this trial.

218
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,330
The plaintiffs and I
were merely protesting

219
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:55,125
against the sexually discriminatory
restructuring of Mir Life.

220
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:59,505
We had no intention
of affecting the trial.

221
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:02,007
Then why protest in front of the court?

222
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,634
You should've done it at Mir Life.

223
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,636
We are going to protest at Mir Life too.

224
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:10,641
We only did it here today because
we had to be at this pretrial hearing.

225
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:14,478
Do we have to discuss
where we protest with you?

226
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,272
That's not necessary…

227
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,317
Counselor,

228
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,653
what is your family origin?

229
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,157
My family origin
is the Ryu family of Pungsan.

230
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,576
My goodness.

231
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,705
My family origin
is also the Ryu family of Pungsan.

232
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,501
Then what generation name
does your father use?

233
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,587
My father uses…

234
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:50,472
Your Honor, why are you asking about
my father's generation name and not mine?

235
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:55,519
Well, that's because daughters usually
don't use a generation name.

236
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,520
Right.

237
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,981
Because daughters
become outsiders once they marry

238
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,400
and can't continue
the Ryu family of Pungsan's line?

239
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,652
-No, I mean--
-Your Honor,

240
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:07,740
I think the essence of this case
is sex discrimination.

241
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:10,242
And sex discrimination
is an act that is strictly forbidden

242
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,952
by the laws of this country,

243
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,579
such as the Framework Act
on Gender Equality

244
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,080
and the Equal Employment Opportunity Act.

245
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,874
I'm deeply concerned if Your Honor,

246
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:21,211
who is biased in that I wouldn't have used
a generation name because I'm a woman,

247
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:27,092
will be able to see
the essence of this case fairly.

248
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,473
What?

249
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,600
The "Jae" in my name, Ryu Jae-sook,
is a generation name that denotes

250
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:37,811
the 26th generation
of the Ryu family of Pungsan.

251
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,606
Your name has "Ha" in it, Your Honor,

252
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,943
so I'm assuming that
you are of the 27th generation.

253
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,863
Yes, I am.

254
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:53,035
So that would mean in a way,
I'm like your aunt.

255
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:57,957
Of course, it's not necessary
for you to call me "aunt."

256
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:00,834
Okay.

257
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:06,298
Your Honor, may I bring up the protest
that the plaintiffs and their attorney--

258
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,550
That won't be an issue.

259
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,135
Sorry?

260
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:14,348
I do not see the protest
affecting my judgment in any way.

261
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:15,975
So,

262
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,227
it won't be an issue.

263
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,562
Thank you, Judge Ryu Myeong-ha.

264
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,661
I don't like the word "context."

265
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,454
It's as difficult as the word "tone."

266
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,958
When I was studying law, I didn't have
to figure out the context and tone

267
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,043
that were hidden behind words.

268
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,796
But I think that's not enough
for some cases.

269
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,841
I can't get into the specifics,

270
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:52,386
but I learned that even a seemingly
neutral policy can be discriminatory

271
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:56,432
if you considered the context
that this is a patriarchal society--

272
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,891
Hey, Young-woo.

273
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,393
Yes?

274
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,271
Are you…

275
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,481
seeing someone?

276
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,446
Why are you asking me that
out of the blue?

277
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:14,283
Does this also have a hidden context
that I don't know about?

278
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,909
No, there's nothing like that.

279
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,579
I'm just wondering
if you're in a relationship.

280
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,459
Well…

281
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,502
No.

282
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,505
No?

283
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:32,426
I mean…

284
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,721
But…

285
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,307
you kissed?

286
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,227
Goodness.

287
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,480
I didn't think you had it in you.

288
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,024
It's like you're in a Hollywood movie,
doing things the American way.

289
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,152
How did you know I kissed someone?

290
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,737
What do you mean how?

291
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,239
You were kissing
right in front of the house!

292
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,408
Gosh, you little…

293
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,785
But what?

294
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,328
You're not in a relationship?

295
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,332
We haven't discussed it yet.

296
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:07,628
We're getting to know each other first
by going on dates.

297
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,671
Then he's a total punk.

298
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:14,134
He's going around kissing you
without even asking you out properly?

299
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,512
Who is he? Bring him home.

300
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,098
I need to see for myself
what kind of guy he is, okay?

301
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,140
Goodness.

302
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,621
I didn't do anything wrong.

303
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,625
Hey, wait.

304
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,129
The gas gun.

305
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,441
"If one of the employees
of a married couple

306
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,151
does not voluntarily resign,

307
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:57,404
the husband will be subjected to
unpaid leave."

308
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:02,242
What was Mir Life's intention
in making this policy?

309
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,829
Didn't you ultimately
lead the female employees to resign

310
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:09,291
by threatening the wives that
their husbands would lose their jobs?

311
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:14,254
No, Mir Life is a company
that respects women.

312
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,506
Even in the middle of restructuring,

313
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,509
we came up with a policy that is more
advantageous to female employees.

314
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:23,222
"As a wife, should you really be getting
in the way of your husband's career?"

315
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,265
"What kind of parents
would be happy to see

316
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,309
their son hanging around at home
while their daughter-in-law goes to work?"

317
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,519
"This is when you should
support your husband."

318
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,439
"When a husband loses his job,
he becomes jobless."

319
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:35,150
"But when a wife loses her job,
she's still a housewife."

320
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:39,571
"Are you going to make your husband's life
embarrassing and pathetic?"

321
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:44,576
These are the words that
you said to the plaintiffs. Do you recall?

322
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:46,703
Yes.

323
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,497
Didn't you just say

324
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,792
Mir Life is a company that respects women,

325
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,627
and that you came up
with a restructuring policy

326
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,755
that is more advantageous
to female employees?

327
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,258
But through these meetings,

328
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:03,428
you actively persuaded
the female employees

329
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,389
to voluntarily resign.

330
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:06,765
Do you admit to doing this?

331
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:10,269
I was just saying how I felt.

332
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:14,982
They are my personal opinions
that are irrelevant to the company policy.

333
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,858
Don't be ridiculous.

334
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:21,780
Your Honor. This type of questioning
is very inappropriate

335
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,491
as it insults the witness.

336
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:27,869
Please restrict the plaintiff's counselor
so she doesn't cross the line.

337
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,789
Mr. Moon is the Head of HR at Mir Life,

338
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:33,917
so he had meetings with the plaintiffs
as a representative of the company.

339
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:38,213
Am I supposed to just accept that
he expressed his personal opinions

340
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:42,759
and exchanged casual conversations
at serious meetings like that?

341
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,303
I don't think so,

342
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,306
Judge Ryu Myeong-ha.

343
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,229
ATTORNEY RYU JAE-SOOK

344
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,112
Mr. Moon Jong-cheol

345
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:07,367
was representing Mir Life at the time
of his meetings with the plaintiffs.

346
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,953
Do you admit to doing this?

347
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,913
Yes, but…

348
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,415
Put that on the record.

349
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,012
When you heard of
the company's restructuring policy,

350
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:29,014
what did you think of it?

351
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:34,019
Did you think that they were ultimately
leading female employees to resign

352
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:39,149
by threatening them, saying that
their husbands would lose their jobs?

353
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,275
No.

354
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:44,029
If I thought that, I would have quit.

355
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,907
In our case, my husband
was the one who voluntarily resigned.

356
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,243
I didn't feel that the company policy
was sexually discriminatory.

357
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,995
Unless it's reverse discrimination.

358
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,832
You had a meeting with Mr. Moon, correct?

359
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,210
Yes.

360
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:00,629
Did he say something along the lines of,

361
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:05,425
"As a wife, should you really be getting
in the way of your husband's career"?

362
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,470
I don't really remember.

363
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,348
Because that's not all that important.

364
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:15,102
What I remember is that
if we applied for voluntary resignation,

365
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:18,230
we would be provided with a severance
equivalent to 13 months of pay

366
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:21,149
and the opportunity to work
as contract employees.

367
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,610
An opportunity to work
as a contract employee?

368
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,822
Why are you saying that
as if it's some kind of benefit?

369
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,448
Don't you know they're using
the restructuring as an excuse

370
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,284
to turn female employees
into non-full-time employees?

371
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:35,080
All these things about sex discrimination
and becoming non-full-time employees.

372
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:37,624
I don't get why people,
who are usually so independent and smart,

373
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:40,001
are saying they were forced to
make such a decision

374
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,212
because of what Mr. Moon said.

375
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,798
Things are already uneasy at the company
with the restructuring and the M&A,

376
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,133
and now there's a lawsuit too.

377
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,635
The remaining employees are exhausted!

378
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,559
That is all.

379
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,396
Plaintiff's counselor,
you may begin cross-examination.

380
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,240
Your husband is quite ill, right?

381
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,536
I heard he recently had an operation
for colon cancer.

382
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,288
Yes.

383
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:19,457
But that wasn't the reason
my husband quit his job.

384
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,668
Even if he wasn't ill,

385
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:25,172
we would have made the same decision.

386
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,465
Before your husband's surgery,

387
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:31,011
you received a month of paid leave, right?

388
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,222
That's quite an exceptional benefit
for a company

389
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:38,268
that is currently
under such difficult circumstances.

390
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:42,439
Does your being here today
have anything to do

391
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,443
with you receiving such a benefit?

392
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:05,879
Ms. Choi Yeon-hui.

393
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,886
Did your husband's surgery go well?

394
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,846
We were occupied with the lawsuit

395
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,307
that we couldn't even
visit you at the hospital.

396
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:19,643
It's fine.

397
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,938
His surgery went well.
There's no metastasis either.

398
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:24,856
He's okay.

399
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,567
Really? That's good.

400
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,402
That's such a relief.

401
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:37,494
Hey, there's no need for you
to feel bad about this.

402
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,746
Just focus on taking care of your husband.

403
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:43,124
Everyone has different opinions.

404
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:47,337
If I were in your position,
I would have done the same thing.

405
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,547
Ms. Kim…

406
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:53,426
Ms. Choi, did you try
the bungeoppang out front?

407
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,012
I'm not sure if it's because it's sold
in front of the courthouse, but it's good.

408
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,098
Let's go get some bungeoppang together.

409
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,643
It's okay. I'll get some another time.

410
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:02,894
Come on.

411
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,396
Have at least one.

412
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,731
If all three of us
were still at work together,

413
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,900
it would have been snack time
right about now.

414
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,114
I'm sorry.

415
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,867
I'm really sorry.

416
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,954
Why are you crying?

417
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:22,622
Gosh…

418
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,628
It's okay.

419
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,130
Yes, it's okay.

420
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,215
It's okay.

421
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:40,181
What's the point of all this?

422
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,152
Excuse me!

423
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:58,658
Here.

424
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:01,453
-What is this?
-Bungeoppang.

425
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:04,706
We bought them for you
while we were getting ours. Have some.

426
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,292
Thank you.

427
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,085
Sure. Bye.

428
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:18,345
Buying the opposing attorneys bungeoppang?

429
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,055
They're quite relaxed.

430
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,349
Do they think they're winning?

431
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,975
Well, they are winning.

432
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,643
Let's go.

433
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,027
Jun-ho.

434
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,988
I think we're going to have to
look into the plaintiffs.

435
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,782
-Look into them?
-Yes.

436
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:41,618
Is there anything that could show

437
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:44,037
that the plaintiffs
voluntarily quit the company?

438
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,582
I'm sure they didn't quit
because they wanted to.

439
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,918
But maybe any kind of proof

440
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,379
that they thought voluntary resignation
was the best choice at the time.

441
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:53,922
I'll look into it.

442
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,221
What?

443
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,640
Taxi.

444
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,394
I want to see the ad on that taxi.

445
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,895
What? Taxi?

446
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,983
There's a symbol on the ad of that taxi

447
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:18,154
that looks exactly like
Ms. Lee Ji-yeong's key chain.

448
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,864
I want to check what it is.

449
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,117
And why should we check that?

450
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,244
Right. If it's another one
of your random obsessions--

451
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:25,578
Is everyone buckled up?

452
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,049
What's wrong with him?

453
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:50,437
Young-woo.

454
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,151
Attorney Woo. Take a good look.

455
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:03,116
THE START OF A NEW LIFE AT HUIMANG

456
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,162
"Specialization in infertility treatment."

457
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,622
"Huimang Women's Hospital"?

458
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,854
You said you work with Attorney Woo?

459
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:38,151
Do you think you can make
Attorney Woo quit Hanbada?

460
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,819
Excuse me?

461
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,989
It doesn't matter
if she quits or gets fired.

462
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,918
LEGAL CONSULTATION STATEMENT

463
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,799
What are you up to?

464
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,717
Work.

465
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,927
I'm working.

466
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:09,724
I see.

467
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,520
You don't mind me sitting here, right?

468
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,776
I have to get myself one of these.

469
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:23,947
Well…

470
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,200
So…

471
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,494
How is it

472
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,997
working at a major law firm?

473
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:35,959
What?

474
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:37,669
For me,

475
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:39,879
it can sometimes be

476
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,048
miserable.

477
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:47,929
You know, at major law firms,
we have to do unjust things

478
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:52,433
and bully the weak as well.

479
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,437
Because those who can afford attorneys
with high commission fees like us

480
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,358
are the rich and powerful.

481
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,823
Do you know…

482
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:11,578
who came up with Mir Life's strategy
for the restructuring?

483
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,580
What?

484
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,290
We did.

485
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,585
What?

486
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,004
It was Hanbada.

487
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:28,469
I looked at the consultation statement
Hanbada sent to Mir Life last year

488
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,929
and it was all written there.

489
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:33,182
"Officially, you have to say that
the husband will be penalized

490
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,767
to avoid sex discrimination."

491
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,228
"Even if it's not much,
giving a small severance pay

492
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,689
will be advantageous
to claim voluntary resignation."

493
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,608
"Make it seem like
the switch to being a contract employee

494
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:44,152
is a benefit that is only offered to
those who resign."

495
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,279
All this…

496
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:49,824
was a trick that Hanbada taught Mir Life.

497
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:54,078
Then did Mir Life come up with that policy

498
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:58,875
with the intention to fire
the female employees in the first place?

499
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,418
Yes.

500
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,714
They used the M&A as an excuse
to fire almost 100 female employees

501
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:07,091
and transitioned them
into non-full-time positions

502
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,719
while receiving consultation
from a major law firm

503
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:12,221
so they wouldn't
face any issues in the future.

504
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,807
It's very clever sex discrimination.

505
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,518
If only the Three Musketeers

506
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,855
could prove this,
they'd have a chance of winning.

507
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,816
I guess that won't be happening.

508
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,527
Seeing Attorney Ryu on TV…

509
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,446
Have you seen her on TV?

510
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:33,326
Her office looked like some corner store.

511
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:35,703
Do you think she can get
any proper investigation done?

512
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,996
Probably not.

513
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,416
Even if she wants to hire an employee
like Jun-ho, would she be able to?

514
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,669
No, because she can't afford it.

515
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,504
Don't you agree?

516
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,302
I'm going to stop grumbling
and get back to work.

517
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,263
Right.

518
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,475
This is the consultation statement,

519
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,936
and it has everything I just mentioned.

520
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,022
Would you like to give it a read?

521
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,692
Take your time.

522
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,652
LEGAL CONSULTATION STATEMENT

523
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:10,989
"Recipient, Mir Life Corporation.
Sender, Hanbada Law Firm."

524
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,448
"Title, Review of…"

525
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,910
No, I didn't mean that

526
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,162
you should read it out loud right now.

527
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,668
Read it quietly on your own.

528
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:32,343
"Title, Review of Restructuring
Policy for Married Employee Couples."

529
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,557
What's this?

530
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:42,812
The legal consultation statement
that Hanbada sent to Mir Life last year.

531
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:46,941
Were you aware
of the content of the statement?

532
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,446
Of course, I knew.

533
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,990
How did you even find this?

534
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,491
Then did Hanbada really help

535
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:59,078
Mir Life fire only the female employees?

536
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,955
Did you teach them

537
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,958
how to cleverly discriminate
in a way that wouldn't be illegal?

538
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,628
No, that's not how it should be phrased.

539
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,213
We merely gave our opinion

540
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:14,093
so our client could achieve their goals
without any legal problems.

541
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,220
If we win this trial,

542
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:19,974
we'll be playing a part in legalizing
the firing of female employees first.

543
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:24,270
And in a shameful way at that,
by taking issue with the fact that

544
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:25,563
Ms. Lee was treated for infertility.

545
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:29,233
It's a shame a dolphin
jumped so high when I saw

546
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,110
the Huimang Women's Hospital logo.

547
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,237
What? Dolphin, jump, what?

548
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,865
If we can't give up representing Mir Life,

549
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:39,911
what if we at least keep silent about
Ms. Lee's infertility treatment?

550
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:44,082
If we can't contribute to making
the world a better place as attorneys--

551
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,541
Attorney Woo.

552
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:50,088
Who told you that attorneys contribute to
making the world a better place?

553
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,716
-Excuse me?
-What an attorney does is defend.

554
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,344
It's our job as attorneys
to protect the client's rights

555
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,972
and do our best
to prevent the client's losses.

556
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:03,976
Our legal expertise is supposed
to be used for that,

557
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,437
not to make the world a better place.

558
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:10,691
And what would make the world
a better place to begin with?

559
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,486
Isn't it the judge's job to judge that?

560
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,488
"The mission of any
attorney-at-law shall be

561
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,824
to defend fundamental human rights
and realize social justice."

562
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:20,034
It's Paragraph 1, Article 1
of the Attorney-at-Law Act.

563
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,661
Exactly!

564
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:25,123
Aren't we defending Mir Life right now?

565
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:30,336
It's the judge's job to decide
which side is socially just, not ours!

566
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:32,922
Are you…

567
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,175
getting angry?

568
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,302
No, I'm not!

569
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,142
Even when your brows are lowered,
your cheekbones are raised,

570
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:47,145
and your nostrils are flaring?

571
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:52,108
These are the typical signs
of when someone is angry.

572
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,363
Anyway.

573
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:00,908
Do thorough research
on infertility treatments,

574
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,828
and question
Ms. Lee Ji-yeong properly. Okay?

575
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:06,414
If you don't, I will.

576
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,424
DOLPHINS BELONG IN THE WIDE OCEAN,
NOT AN AQUARIUM

577
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,675
It's a dolphin!

578
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:19,927
-Hello.
-Hello.

579
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:20,887
Hi.

580
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,346
This dolphin is so cute.

581
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,347
Come on, kids.

582
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,348
-Okay.
-Okay.

583
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,771
STOP DISPLAYING DOLPHINS AND RELEASE THEM

584
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:38,237
There's also a protest
in front of Mir Life right now,

585
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:43,284
but I'm turning a blind eye to that
and instead doing another protest.

586
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,537
I'm not sure if this is a good idea.

587
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:50,124
You're not doing this protest
to free the dolphins as an attorney.

588
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,834
We're…

589
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,087
on a date right now.

590
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:58,090
Then what am I supposed to do
as an attorney?

591
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,718
Should I listen to what Attorney Jung said

592
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:03,638
and leave the judgment
of what's right or wrong to a judge

593
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,224
and only focus on defending the client?

594
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,391
Well…

595
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,686
Working at Hanbada,

596
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,315
I've seen a lot of attorneys
who were stressed about that same thing.

597
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,902
Rookies, junior attorneys,
senior attorneys, all of them.

598
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:20,321
-Really?
-Yes.

599
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:24,283
There are attorneys like Attorney Jung
who have reached their answers,

600
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:27,870
but there are also attorneys
who continue to contemplate.

601
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:31,165
And some attorneys end up
leaving the firm because of that.

602
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,001
Is it because Hanbada is a major law firm?

603
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,711
But the funny thing is

604
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:39,382
there's no other place that's more active
in public service than a big law firm.

605
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,384
I bet you there are no law firms in Korea

606
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:44,262
that take as many public interest cases
as Hanbada and Taesan.

607
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,472
This is hard.

608
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:49,892
It's even more difficult
after hearing what you said.

609
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,603
It's not an issue with an easy answer.

610
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,356
Just take some time,
and think about it slowly.

611
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:59,402
I'll always cheer for you
no matter what you decide to do.

612
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,954
"I solemnly swear that
I will tell the truth, the whole truth,

613
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,455
and nothing but the truth,

614
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,708
and agree to receive punishment
in accordance with perjury

615
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,251
should there be any falsehood."

616
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,254
Defendant's counselor, begin questioning.

617
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,488
When did you find out that

618
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:49,118
Mir Life was going to be acquired
by SB Life, a German insurance company?

619
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,412
Around last year.

620
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,206
You used a lot of paid time off last year.

621
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,084
And for a few months,
you left work early three days a week.

622
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,127
Why is that?

623
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,629
I had doctor's appointments.

624
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,716
But it was only last year.

625
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,760
In the eight years
I've worked for this company,

626
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,845
I had never taken time off
as often as I did last year.

627
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:11,057
What is the name
of the hospital you went to?

628
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,019
Huimang Women's Hospital.

629
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,520
Huimang Women's Hospital

630
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,106
is a maternity clinic specializing
in infertility treatments, correct?

631
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,401
Yes.

632
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:28,157
For IVF, which is one of the ways
to treat infertility,

633
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,494
one must visit a hospital three times
a week for a month.

634
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:34,288
If one has a job,
they would have to leave early.

635
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:38,417
On the days when eggs are collected
or embryos are implanted,

636
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,336
one would most likely have to
take the day off.

637
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:43,881
Did you also get off work early

638
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:47,510
and take frequent days off for IVF?

639
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,347
Yes.

640
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,149
Then to you, the suggestion
of voluntary resignation

641
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,902
would've been a great opportunity to
focus on receiving infertility treatments.

642
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:08,280
Since you had plans for pregnancy.

643
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,124
How is that relevant?

644
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,627
I failed to get pregnant,

645
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:25,047
but even if I had succeeded, I would've
continued to work at the company.

646
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:40,062
Under the Labor Standards Act,
female workers receive

647
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:43,190
90 days of paid vacation
before and after they give birth.

648
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,860
At the last hearing,
the plaintiff's counselor mentioned

649
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:49,363
the one month of paid leave that
the witness, Ms. Choi, had received,

650
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:53,117
and said that it was
an exceptional benefit for a company

651
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,910
under such difficult circumstances.

652
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:59,331
Then, doesn't this also apply
to the 90 days of maternity leave?

653
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:02,751
Objection. The plaintiff received IVF
way before it was suggested

654
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:05,296
that she voluntarily resign.

655
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:09,091
The plaintiff's infertility treatments and
the voluntary resignation are irrelevant.

656
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:20,728
Well…

657
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:22,688
Overruled.

658
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,399
Defendant's counselor,
continue questioning.

659
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,863
Plaintiff, please give an honest answer.

660
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,824
Didn't you decide that it'd be better
to take this opportunity

661
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,951
to get severance pay and resign
so that you could prepare for pregnancy

662
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:39,663
rather than to hold out
at a company in a crisis?

663
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:05,064
Excuse me.

664
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,403
My name is Woo Young-woo.

665
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,781
Whether it's read straight or flipped,
it's still Woo Young-woo.

666
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,158
Kayak, deed, rotator,
noon, racecar, Woo Young-woo.

667
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,871
I'm Ryu Jae-sook.

668
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,581
If it's flipped, it's Sook-jae Ryu.

669
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,043
Okay.

670
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:29,004
I saw you in the newspaper.

671
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,132
"The first autistic attorney
of the Republic of Korea."

672
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,262
I wondered what kind of attorney
this person would turn out to be,

673
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,722
but I see you
eventually ended up at Hanbada.

674
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:41,308
I thought you'd work somewhere cooler.

675
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,394
Somewhere cooler?

676
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:47,856
Yes. For example, somewhere like
the Law Office of Ryu Jae-sook.

677
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,568
Right.

678
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:53,153
Isn't it cooler to stand on the side
of brave women laborers,

679
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:56,323
instead of defending a client
like Mir Life?

680
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,119
An attorney is someone who defends.

681
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:03,539
It's an attorney's job
to protect the client's rights

682
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,833
and do the best to prevent
the client's losses.

683
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:10,129
It's not an attorney's job
to make a value judgment

684
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,131
about which client would make them cooler.

685
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:14,925
But attorneys are human.

686
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,929
They're different
from judges and prosecutors.

687
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,725
-Sorry?
-We all work in the legal field,

688
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:25,394
but while judges and prosecutors work
to protect the law,

689
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:27,313
attorneys work to protect the people.

690
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:31,775
Each case might just be work
for a judge or a prosecutor,

691
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,570
but it's different for an attorney.

692
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,781
We sit next to the client…

693
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:42,703
as someone they chose for protection

694
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,080
and as fellow humans.

695
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,707
"You weren't wrong."

696
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:49,126
"I support you."

697
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:52,296
Saying these things
and showing them support

698
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:54,506
are also part of our job.

699
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,636
To do that, we have to judge
for ourselves what is right

700
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,138
in terms of who we defend.

701
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,350
You can't lie to yourself.

702
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:15,402
What?

703
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,614
Attorney Woo is with Attorney Ryu.

704
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:25,162
What could they be talking about?

705
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:26,789
I wonder too.

706
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:52,606
-What are you doing?
-What? Why do you ask?

707
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,902
You were trying to go
into Young-woo's office. What is it?

708
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:59,863
I could have something
to ask Attorney Woo.

709
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:04,201
What are you? The Kayak Deed Protector?
Why does it concern you?

710
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:06,537
Young-woo left with Jun-ho earlier.

711
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,247
She's obviously not here.
Her lights are off.

712
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:10,290
Where would she be going
with Jun-ho at this hour?

713
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:14,253
I thought you live with Jun-ho.
You don't know?

714
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,548
-The two of them…
-What about them?

715
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:20,884
They're seeing each other.

716
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:23,429
They're seeing each other?

717
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:28,100
-Why?
-What do you mean?

718
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,144
They just are!

719
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,020
You're so annoying.

720
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,480
Get out of my way.

721
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,137
LEGAL CONSULTATION STATEMENT

722
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,107
LAW OFFICE OF RYU JAE-SOOK

723
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,192
ATTORNEY WOO YOUNG-WOO

724
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,342
What's wrong?
Are you looking for something?

725
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,302
I'm looking for my father.

726
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:46,762
What?

727
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:51,225
My father said he saw us
kissing last time.

728
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,434
What?

729
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,563
He told me to bring you to meet him.

730
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,774
But I'm not going to.

731
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:01,109
Because we're not dating yet.

732
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,152
What…

733
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:07,032
We're not…

734
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:09,076
dating yet?

735
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,619
Well…

736
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:14,081
We never said we were dating, right?

737
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:17,292
Well…

738
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,545
Or did we?

739
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:21,129
Then…

740
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:24,591
are we dating?

741
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,718
If we're not dating,

742
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:31,223
why would I protest
to free the dolphins on my day off?

743
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:32,224
What?

744
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:36,061
Do you not agree
that dolphins should be freed?

745
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,730
Of course, I do.

746
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:44,152
But it's not the most ideal activity to do
on someone's day off.

747
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:46,697
It's not like it's fun.

748
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,492
It's not…

749
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:52,286
fun?

750
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,370
I mean…

751
00:47:57,749 --> 00:47:59,084
Honestly,

752
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:02,754
the list that you made.

753
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,215
"Things to do on dates"?

754
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,216
Yes.

755
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,843
I'm not…

756
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,678
used to those things.

757
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,473
People typically don't do
those things on dates.

758
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:16,351
Things like picking up garbage
while jogging by the Han River.

759
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:24,985
Jun-ho!

760
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:26,486
Hey…

761
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,583
That day, you really

762
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,793
only picked up garbage.

763
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:45,422
You picked up garbage again and again
as the day got brighter

764
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:48,133
until that huge basket was full.

765
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,722
Would there be anyone else

766
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:55,849
who goes on these kinds of dates?

767
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:59,019
We did go on typical dates.

768
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:01,688
For example,
we went to famous restaurants.

769
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:05,067
They were all gimbap places.
We ate nothing but gimbap that day.

770
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:08,195
The list has things you want to do too.

771
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:11,281
We went to the arcade
because you wanted to.

772
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,575
It was very loud, but I held it in.

773
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:16,745
Okay, but we only played
"Find the Difference" for three hours.

774
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:48,944
Attorney Woo.

775
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:51,279
You're great at this.

776
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:59,579
And you were too good at it,
so it wasn't fun for me.

777
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,082
Then…

778
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:06,545
Then why do you keep
going on dates with me?

779
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:08,422
It's not even fun for you.

780
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,215
Because I like you!

781
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:14,219
I did the protest to free the dolphins,
picked up trash while jogging,

782
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:16,471
and went to all those famous gimbap places
because I like you.

783
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:17,973
And yet we're still not…

784
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:20,058
officially together?

785
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,602
That really…

786
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,942
just hurts me, you know that?

787
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,032
Right.

788
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:46,918
Plaintiff's counselor,
you submitted new evidence, right?

789
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,130
Yes, Your Honor.

790
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,340
It's proof that
Mir Life had thoroughly planned

791
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:53,925
the sexually discriminatory
restructuring policy

792
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:58,346
with the intent to fire
the female employees from the beginning.

793
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:02,476
An anonymous informant
sent it to our office.

794
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,380
I present to you
the original work notebook

795
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:35,884
of Mr. Moon Jong-cheol,
the Head of HR at Mir Life.

796
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:40,180
I submitted the scanned copies
of the pages in question today.

797
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,766
Wait, is that really your notebook?

798
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:45,852
The company gave them out
to all the employees last year.

799
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:48,980
Mine should be in my office.

800
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:55,821
If you take a look at the notebook,
you can see that Mr. Moon

801
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:59,157
has a habit of taking notes
during his phone calls.

802
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,494
Those notes were taken
during a phone call in April last year

803
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,790
with Mir Life's Executive Director,
Choi Seung-cheol.

804
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:10,877
Executive Director Choi
clearly gave Mr. Moon the order

805
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,129
to get the wives to voluntarily resign

806
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,882
by notifying them that
their husbands will be penalized.

807
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,096
-Is that true?
-That's undeniable.

808
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:23,139
-Goodness.
-That's undeniable proof.

809
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:29,104
Mr. Moon, is this true?

810
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:31,231
Is that your notebook?

811
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,984
I did write that.

812
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:35,694
But I don't know how that…

813
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:37,946
ended up in their hands.

814
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,281
Your Honor.

815
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:43,326
Mr. Moon has not agreed to his personal
notebook being used as evidence.

816
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,829
Therefore, this evidence
has been collected illegally.

817
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:48,582
This pertains to the
Criminal Procedure Act, Article 300…

818
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,667
Three…

819
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,044
Three…

820
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:57,966
The Criminal Procedure Act, Article 300…

821
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:00,760
What is it?

822
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:06,308
You know, the thing about the illegal
collection of evidence.

823
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:07,225
Right.

824
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:10,896
"Article 308-2 of the Criminal
Procedure Act. Any evidence obtained

825
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:12,981
in violation of the due process
shall not be admissible"?

826
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:15,483
Yes, according to the article
you heard just now,

827
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:18,486
Mr. Moon's notebook
is not admissible as evidence.

828
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,405
Please exclude it from the evidence.

829
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,074
Well…

830
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:26,995
But that's a Criminal Procedure Act.
This trial is a civil procedure.

831
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:32,042
But that's a Criminal Procedure Act.
This trial is a civil procedure.

832
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,044
Isn't it the discretion of the court

833
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:35,337
to accept evidence
according to the Civil Procedure Act,

834
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,881
which adopts the Principle
of Free Evaluation of Evidence?

835
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:42,552
I look forward to your wise judgment,
Judge Ryu Myeong-ha.

836
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,391
ATTORNEY RYU JAE-SOOK

837
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:01,571
This notebook was sent
by an anonymous informant?

838
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:02,739
Yes, Your Honor.

839
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:07,494
Then, even if the evidence
was collected illegally,

840
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:09,621
the degree of violation of the procedure

841
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:13,333
is not large enough to refuse
the acceptance of the evidence.

842
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,418
I acknowledge
the admissibility of your evidence.

843
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:25,345
It's all right.

844
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,886
HEAD OF HR
MOON JONG-CHEOL

845
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:30,452
You said all the employees are family.
Aren't female employees also family?

846
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:32,620
Admit wrongful termination!

847
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:34,748
-Admit!
-Admit!

848
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:38,251
A rally was held in front of Mir Life's HQ
to denounce Mir Life's dismissal

849
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:41,337
of female employees first
among married employee couples.

850
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:45,050
The rally was attended by female employees
who were fired from Mir Life,

851
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:48,386
as well as dozens of members
of women's organizations and labor unions.

852
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:51,181
Meanwhile, two of
the fired female employees filed a lawsuit

853
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:53,725
to confirm the invalidity
of their termination.

854
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,602
Participants of the rally

855
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:58,271
said they plan to file
a written statement to the court.

856
00:55:58,354 --> 00:56:01,441
The public are wondering
whether the rally will affect the ruling.

857
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,112
Now, for the verdict.

858
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:24,547
Formal adjudication.

859
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:28,051
All claims of the plaintiffs
are dismissed.

860
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:31,513
And the litigation costs
are to be paid by the plaintiffs.

861
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,981
This court acknowledges
that the defendant urged

862
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:45,777
the married employee couples
to voluntarily resign multiple times

863
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:49,197
and notified them
of their husbands' termination

864
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,991
or them being subjected
to unpaid leave if they did not.

865
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:55,495
However, designating one of the employees

866
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:58,915
of a married employee couple
for this while restructuring

867
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:01,292
is acceptable
from the socioeconomic perspective,

868
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,130
and because they did not specify
that it just applied to the wives,

869
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:08,007
it cannot be seen
as an act against gender equality

870
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:11,261
or the discrimination
against women as set forth

871
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:15,306
by the Constitution
or the Labor Standards Act.

872
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:18,226
Furthermore,

873
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:22,772
the plaintiffs submitted
their resignation letters

874
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:27,110
considering the conditions
of voluntary resignation

875
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:29,070
as suggested by the defendant

876
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:32,073
and the various circumstances
and interests regarding the options

877
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:33,908
of resignation and continuing to work.

878
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:35,827
Thus, this cannot be considered invalid.

879
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,209
My goodness.

880
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:02,103
Sir.

881
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:05,106
You don't look so good.
Is everything okay?

882
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:06,983
The ruling was in our favor.

883
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:09,903
What's the point of that?

884
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,739
It doesn't do me any good,
but the company.

885
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,741
What?

886
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:16,743
To be honest,

887
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:19,329
I think I'm going to be fired soon.

888
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,289
Weren't you aware?

889
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:22,540
No, I wasn't.

890
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:24,709
I see.

891
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:28,505
I thought perhaps Hanbada
gave them another consultation.

892
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:33,343
"How to fire the Head of HR without
any trouble." Something like that.

893
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:35,470
This is the first time
I'm hearing of this.

894
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:40,225
Officially, they're firing me because
I didn't succeed with the restructuring.

895
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:44,479
The trial, the rally,
and the news reports.

896
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:46,022
Things did get out of hand.

897
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:47,899
But the more I think about it,

898
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:50,902
the more it feels like
this was their plan from the start.

899
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:57,200
They want to give my job
to the person that SB Life wants.

900
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:03,331
You went through a lot this whole time.
It must be difficult for you.

901
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:05,291
No.

902
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:09,128
I fired almost 100 employees.

903
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:12,590
It wouldn't be right to hope
that things would work out for me.

904
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,134
It's all karma.

905
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:35,488
Regardless of the ruling,
we view this lawsuit positively.

906
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:38,700
That's right. We view it as being WLGF!

907
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:41,119
We Lost, but it was a Good Fight!

908
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:44,539
We feel good
that we at least went to trial!

909
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:46,916
-We feel good!
-We feel good!

910
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:53,548
We still have the second and final appeal.

911
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:59,345
So we will fight even more bravely
for job security and equality!

912
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,639
-We will!
-We will!

913
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:04,767
-Fight!
-Fight!

914
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:08,104
-Fight!
-Fight!

915
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:12,025
-Fight!
-Fight!

916
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:19,240
I'm amazed by the fact that
they're having an after-trial party,

917
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:23,036
and it's also weird that we're going
just because we were invited.

918
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:25,330
We were the opposing side, after all.

919
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:28,041
I want to go. I'm curious.

920
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,961
Are you interested in those things?

921
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:35,840
Dealing with cases about human rights,
women, and labor like Attorney Ryu?

922
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:37,258
Well…

923
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,093
I'm not sure.

924
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:41,054
Attorney Ryu

925
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,765
is like the Yangtze River dolphin.

926
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:47,477
Gosh, the Yangtze River dolphin.
I haven't heard about that one in a while.

927
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,146
Can I tell you
about the Yangtze River dolphin?

928
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:51,648
Can I say no?

929
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:55,735
Please.

930
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:58,696
Dolphins mostly live in the sea,

931
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,865
but some populations adapt to rivers,

932
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:02,867
and the Yangtze River dolphin
is a model example of that.

933
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:05,370
Just like their name,
they lived in the Yangtze River in China,

934
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:07,664
but they were declared extinct in 2007.

935
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:12,043
So how does Attorney Ryu
resemble the Yangtze River dolphin?

936
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:15,630
Attorney Ryu

937
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:19,384
is the type of attorney
you can't find at Hanbada.

938
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,553
I just hope she doesn't go extinct.

939
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:42,657
SEXUALLY DISCRIMINATORY RESTRUCTURING

940
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,075
THERE SHOULDN'T BE RESTRUCTURING!

941
01:01:58,047 --> 01:01:59,507
You're doing it again.

942
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,092
Just leave it be.

943
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:03,803
It's not easy to just leave it alone.

944
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:04,846
Gosh.

945
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:10,852
I'M ROOTING FOR YOU, ATTORNEY RYU

946
01:02:10,935 --> 01:02:12,895
MEANINGFUL LOSS!

947
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:17,442
I wonder what it's like to receive
this kind of support.

948
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:19,235
Even when she lost.

949
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:20,278
Right.

950
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:22,447
Me too.

951
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:26,159
DON'T BE DISCOURAGED!
LET'S OVERCOME! LET'S FIGHT TOGETHER!

952
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:27,702
Goodness! You're here.

953
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,622
We were on the roof.
Let's head up together.

954
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:32,874
Okay.

955
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:34,417
Right.

956
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,419
Why don't you head upstairs first?

957
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:38,671
I have something to give to Attorney Woo.

958
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,047
Okay.

959
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:51,934
I wanted to return this.

960
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:57,273
LEGAL CONSULTATION STATEMENT

961
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:03,696
Why do you have this?

962
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,990
You didn't send it to me?

963
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:07,992
No, I didn't.

964
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:13,456
Your business card was in it.

965
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:17,585
As if you had sent it to me in secret.

966
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:24,258
It seems as though it's complicated
within Hanbada as well.

967
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:28,805
You should watch out for yourself.

968
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:34,811
So you had this the whole time
but didn't use it as evidence?

969
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:37,980
If I did, you would've been in trouble.

970
01:03:40,441 --> 01:03:43,069
And it's not like I didn't have
other ways to get evidence.

971
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:51,994
Come.

972
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:58,918
Hello.

973
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:00,127
Sit over here.

974
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:04,298
We were making bibimbap.

975
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:06,759
The vegetables Attorney Ryu grows
up here on the roof are so fresh.

976
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:09,554
I'm a farmer on the side.

977
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:10,721
Roof farming.

978
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:13,850
But it seems like I'm better at farming
than I am at my main job.

979
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:20,648
Do you only have bibimbap? No gimbap?

980
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:23,025
I can't see the ingredients
in bibimbap all at once,

981
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:25,820
so I could be alarmed
by any unexpected textures or flavors.

982
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:27,363
What?

983
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:28,531
Gimbap?

984
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:29,782
Alarmed?

985
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:34,829
Then don't mix the ingredients
and eat them all separately.

986
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:36,664
Well…

987
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:38,624
Just eat what you're given.

988
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:40,668
Okay.

989
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:43,045
The bibimbap is so pretty.

990
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:45,590
We should have come earlier
and helped you prepare.

991
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:49,302
We were just relaxing
and taking our time as we made it.

992
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:50,678
Reciting poems.

993
01:04:51,178 --> 01:04:52,179
Reciting poems?

994
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:54,849
It turns out that we all love poetry.

995
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:57,768
I recited one by the poet Kim Su-young,

996
01:04:57,852 --> 01:04:59,812
and Hyeon-jeong recited one
by the poet Ko Jung-hee.

997
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,689
And now it's Attorney Ryu's turn.

998
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:04,191
Is this the time to be reciting poems?

999
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:06,402
Don't you have an appeal to prepare?

1000
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:08,279
-Right.
-That's right.

1001
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:11,866
You're right.

1002
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:14,076
Hanbada's attorneys sure are different.

1003
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,870
I think I'm going to lose again.

1004
01:05:17,371 --> 01:05:19,290
Come on, we can have fun today.

1005
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:21,042
It's the after-party.

1006
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:25,713
I'm so curious as to what poem
Attorney Ryu likes.

1007
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:29,133
Yes, we want to know. Recite it for us.

1008
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:30,343
Ryu Jae-sook!

1009
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:33,846
-Ryu Jae-sook!
-Ryu Jae-sook!

1010
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:35,973
There she goes!

1011
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:45,983
"Though there are many sayings,

1012
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,069
life is

1013
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:51,197
to gladly become a piece of coal

1014
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,908
for someone other than myself."

1015
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:59,747
"From the day the floors grow cold
to the day spring comes,

1016
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:04,085
the most beautiful thing
in the streets of the Korean peninsula

1017
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:08,255
is a truck that fervidly
climbs up the hill

1018
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:10,508
with coal."

1019
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:15,721
"As if it knows what it has to do,

1020
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:20,601
coal burns endlessly

1021
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:24,689
once its body catches fire,

1022
01:06:25,439 --> 01:06:31,278
but I was oblivious even though
I had warm rice and soup every day."

1023
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:35,157
"Because I feared becoming
a lonely lump of ashes

1024
01:06:35,866 --> 01:06:39,412
after loving others with my whole being,

1025
01:06:40,454 --> 01:06:44,333
I haven't become coal

1026
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:46,919
for anyone."

1027
01:06:49,213 --> 01:06:51,132
"When I think about it,

1028
01:06:51,632 --> 01:06:55,386
life is to shatter myself into pieces."

1029
01:06:57,304 --> 01:07:02,393
"I had never thought of

1030
01:07:03,477 --> 01:07:07,773
clearing the streets for others to tread

1031
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:13,362
when the world is slippery
from early morning snow."

1032
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:21,120
That was great!

1033
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:27,960
-Eat.
-Okay.

1034
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:30,129
-Thank you for the food.
-Enjoy.

1035
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:33,567
Damn it.

1036
01:08:39,406 --> 01:08:40,449
Damn it.

1037
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:52,837
Yes, boss.

1038
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:55,256
I got off on the wrong floor.

1039
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:58,592
I got both a Phillips head
and a flat head screwdriver.

1040
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:00,845
Yes, I'm on my way up.

1041
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:13,023
Damn it.

1042
01:09:14,066 --> 01:09:14,942
Damn it.

1043
01:09:26,453 --> 01:09:29,498
Attorney Jung, they caught Jang Jae-jin.

1044
01:09:30,082 --> 01:09:33,252
The police caught him
all the way in Changwon,

1045
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:35,254
so you have nothing
to worry about anymore.

1046
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:56,275
What the…

1047
01:09:59,236 --> 01:10:00,654
Am I sick?

1048
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:48,994
Is there really a law
that states that even those

1049
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:51,622
who did not visit a cultural heritage
must pay the admission fee?

1050
01:10:51,705 --> 01:10:53,040
May I go on a business trip?

1051
01:10:53,123 --> 01:10:54,750
-Where to?
-Jeju Island.

1052
01:10:54,833 --> 01:10:56,752
I'll do my best to earn my keep

1053
01:10:56,835 --> 01:10:58,504
since I'm taking
several rookie attorneys with me.

1054
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:01,507
We're calling it a business trip, but
isn't this an excuse to go on a vacation?

1055
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:02,508
They're not open.

1056
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:04,009
It looks like it's been closed
for quite some time.

1057
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:06,929
Don't be blinded by what you can see.

1058
01:11:07,012 --> 01:11:08,931
Keep in mind the essence
of what lies beyond that.

1059
01:11:09,014 --> 01:11:11,976
You should bring home a girl
who can make you happy.

1060
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:13,769
Not someone you have to take care of.

1061
01:11:14,478 --> 01:11:18,983
