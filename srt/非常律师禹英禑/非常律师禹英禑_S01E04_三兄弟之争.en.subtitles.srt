1
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,135
My goodness.

2
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,179
What brought you all here to Ganghwa?

3
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,096
Hello.

4
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,599
We need to talk.

5
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,019
Come in.

6
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:50,318
I'll work on the roof later
since his brothers are here.

7
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,529
Yes Jin-hyeok, I'll contact you later.

8
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,659
It's been a while
since they all got together.

9
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,702
GIFT CONTRACT

10
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:01,746
What's this?

11
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,790
The compensation for land expropriation.

12
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,583
It has to be divided properly, right?

13
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,462
You didn't think
the compensation is all yours

14
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,840
just because the rice paddy
is in your name, right?

15
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:15,802
Of course, not. Would I have
contacted you if I thought that?

16
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,763
It was father's rice paddy, so of course,

17
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,516
I have to split
the compensation fairly with you.

18
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,601
Right. Then let's do it this way.

19
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,021
The eldest gets 50 percent,
the second-born gets 30 percent,

20
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,606
and the youngest gets 20 percent.

21
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,403
What do you think, Dong-i?

22
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,364
It's only right that
the eldest son gets more shares.

23
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,366
Dong-il also holds
the memorial service for our parents.

24
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,785
I'm not being greedy here.

25
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,163
In civil law, there's inheritance law.

26
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,456
According to that law,

27
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,251
the eldest gets more than the second-born,

28
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,128
and the second-born
gets more than the youngest.

29
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,630
That's the law?

30
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,049
Why? You don't believe me?

31
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,676
No.

32
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,888
I had it looked over
by an attorney who specializes in this.

33
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:15,987
GIFT CONTRACT

34
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,868
Can I have some time
to think it over and discuss it again?

35
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,286
Think it over?

36
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,538
Think over what?

37
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,416
Are you going to get a countryside
attorney and get a consultation?

38
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:32,128
Or are you going to ask
that head of the village from earlier?

39
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:36,591
You probably know nothing because
you've been farming all your life.

40
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:39,052
But Dong-il had a big business in Seoul.

41
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,262
I had a long career myself.

42
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,097
We brought it up to you

43
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,725
after we looked into it
and considered things thoroughly.

44
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,732
Hurry up and stamp
your seal on the contract.

45
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:56,110
This is what our late
parents would've also wanted.

46
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,489
The seal.

47
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,658
Bring it over.

48
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,385
-Where should I…
-Right here.

49
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,942
GIVER: DONG DONG-SAM

50
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,778
RECIPIENT: DONG DONG-IL, DONG DONG-I

51
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:45,785
CASE 4
THE STRIFE OF THE THREE BROTHERS

52
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,926
Attorney Woo didn't come in again today?

53
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,177
It seems like it.

54
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,437
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

55
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,564
RESIGNING PARTY: WOO YOUNG-WOO

56
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,399
Here you go.

57
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,151
Just a moment.

58
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,782
-Yes, enjoy.
-Have a good one.

59
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:06,949
Thank you.

60
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,257
Young-woo, your friend's on her way over.

61
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:37,271
You didn't have breakfast, right?
I'll make you gimbap.

62
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,607
I'll have the pork-cutlet gimbap.

63
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,610
-Yes, just eat the plain one.
-Okay.

64
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,738
It's morning. Why are you here
and not asleep?

65
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,573
Because my dad is so annoying.

66
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,785
Apparently, he got tricked by my uncles
and signed some weird memorandum.

67
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,286
My family is completely ruined!

68
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,412
Memorandum?

69
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:58,376
Yes, a memorandum that says he'll share
the land compensation with my uncles.

70
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,920
Your dad is getting land compensation?

71
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,797
You're talking about the rice paddy
in Ganghwa-do, right?

72
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,092
Yes, it belonged to my grandfather
and is about 5,000 pyeong.

73
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:09,137
When my grandfather passed,
he left the land in my father's name.

74
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,015
But it became a development area recently,
so the government is giving compensation.

75
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:13,975
How much?

76
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:14,934
Ten billion won.

77
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:16,936
Really?

78
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,605
That's great.

79
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,815
"That's great."

80
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,443
Gosh, we used to live
in Ganghwa-do for over three years.

81
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:27,905
I should've bought some land back then.
My goodness, what a shame.

82
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,198
"What a shame."

83
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,535
But my stupid dad

84
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,079
said he promised to share
the money with his brothers.

85
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,664
So we'll just be left with debt.

86
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,416
Uncle Dong-il gets 50 percent,

87
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,877
Uncle Dong-i gets 30 percent,
and my dad 20 percent.

88
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,088
Your uncles all have
single-syllable names? Il and I?

89
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,090
No, it's Dong-il, Dong-i, Dong-sam.

90
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,801
So with their surnames, it's Dong Dong-il,
Dong Dong-i, Dong Dong-sam.

91
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,052
My dad is Dong Dong-sam.

92
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,391
Apparently, my grandfather named them.

93
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,352
Don't you think
he put in so little effort?

94
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:02,315
He named his children like that,
but do you know what his name is?

95
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,443
-What is it?
-Won-bin.

96
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,989
Dong Won-bin.

97
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,875
Only his name is handsome.

98
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,085
Only his name.

99
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,922
But why would your dad
be left with just debt?

100
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:30,176
Even if your father's share is 20 percent,
the total compensation is 10 billion.

101
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,761
So he'll be getting two billion.

102
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:36,891
But this foolish Mr. Dong Dong-sam
agreed to pay all the tax by himself.

103
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,351
When he didn't even know
how much it would be.

104
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:41,103
He found out two days ago
and is now laid out in shock.

105
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,563
How much is the tax?

106
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,648
Right.

107
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,068
I have it written down here.

108
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,947
It would be a total of 2.26 billion won

109
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,823
with the transfer tax
and local income tax.

110
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:56,202
Gosh, I couldn't believe it.

111
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,079
The compensation is ten billion won,

112
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,206
and my uncles each get 5 and 3 billion.

113
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,125
But my dad is left
with a debt of 260 million.

114
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:07,421
I'm seriously considering
reporting this to How is That Possible.

115
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:12,260
Why did your father stamp his seal
on such a disadvantageous memorandum?

116
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:16,305
My dad thinks my uncles are amazing.

117
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:20,101
He always brags about how
his brothers went to universities in Seoul

118
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,812
while he spent his whole life farming.

119
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,855
And they have a big age gap,

120
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,817
so Uncle Dong-il
is older than my dad by 12 years.

121
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,488
So my dad can't disobey
my uncles in any way.

122
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:37,868
My uncles underestimate us.
They think we're brainless nincompoops.

123
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,787
They don't think we know any attorneys.

124
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,498
So I said, "I know an attorney."

125
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,417
Who?

126
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,088
-You.
-Right.

127
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,883
I'm not an attorney anymore.

128
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,135
What? Why?

129
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,846
Right. I want to know the reason too.

130
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,098
Why on earth are you quitting?

131
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,560
Instead, I'll refer you
to an attorney I know.

132
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,894
Do you have the memorandum?

133
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,397
No, my dad has it.

134
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,316
Okay.

135
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,943
Then let's go!

136
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,864
Let's close the shop
and go get the memorandum together!

137
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,532
-What?
-Hey. Get up.

138
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,117
-Get ready.
-Yes, okay!

139
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,745
-We're going to Ganghwa-do together!
-Come on.

140
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,331
What?

141
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,839
It's been a while
since I've been to Ganghwa-do.

142
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,135
We moved to Seoul when Young-woo got
into university, so it's been seven years.

143
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,346
Geu-ra-mi, that's around the time
you moved to Seoul, right?

144
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,681
Yes, after I graduated from high school.

145
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,184
What do you think?
Should we stop by the town?

146
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,227
Do you guys want to
visit your high school?

147
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,521
Why?

148
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,482
Just because. It's old memories.

149
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:52,193
You're not curious
if your alma mater is doing well?

150
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,153
-No, I'm not.
-No, I'm not curious.

151
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,866
-I see.
-The reeds are pretty.

152
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:02,787
Yes.

153
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:07,833
My father moved us to Ganghwa-do
because I used to be bullied in school.

154
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:12,046
He was hoping things would be better
at a small school in the countryside.

155
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,509
They say the kids are gentle and nice
because they're country kids.

156
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,513
It'll be all right.
It'll be different from Seoul.

157
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,348
Okay.

158
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,600
Go straight to the teachers' office.

159
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:27,436
Your homeroom teacher
is waiting for you there, okay?

160
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,439
-Okay.
-Go on.

161
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,571
Things weren't any different
in the countryside.

162
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,991
At school, they called me a loser.

163
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,786
There was a popular prank
that was pulled on me.

164
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,372
The "I'm sorry" game.

165
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,917
I'm sorry.

166
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,883
I'm sorry.

167
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,009
Why did you do that?

168
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,307
Enjoy.

169
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,684
Thank you.

170
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,195
I'm sorry.

171
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,912
I had to find somewhere that was safe.

172
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,039
So during recess,
I escaped to the teachers' office.

173
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,082
Gosh, you scared me.

174
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,168
Why do you keep coming here?

175
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,297
Are you not uncomfortable like that?

176
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,673
No, I'm fine.

177
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,812
And during lunch,
I escaped to the security office.

178
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,944
I'm fine.

179
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,907
But no matter how much I escaped,

180
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,994
I couldn't stop
what happened during class.

181
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,122
And the power…

182
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:15,211
of the administrative subdivisions
and the provincial officers

183
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,546
was strengthened.

184
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,799
This shows how
provincial officer-centered ruling

185
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,762
was strengthened during the later period

186
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,724
of the Joseon Dynasty era.

187
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:31,268
Memorize this because it
usually comes up on tests.

188
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,314
Any questions?

189
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,775
Yes, I have a question.

190
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,276
What is it?

191
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,071
Where did you get your eyes done,

192
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,573
student teacher?

193
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,452
It looks like you did
your inner corners too.

194
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,703
Was it done at the same hospital?

195
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:54,041
The surgery seems to have been successful,
so many students are curious.

196
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,752
-How much did you pay for it?
-They're pretty.

197
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:59,129
-It turned out good.
-They're pretty.

198
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,424
-Where did she get them done?
-Come on, tell us.

199
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,138
That was gold.

200
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,106
I'm sorry.

201
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,150
I thought she wouldn't mind
if the top student asked that.

202
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,996
YOUNG-WOO, ASK THE STUDENT TEACHER
WHERE SHE GOT HER EYES DONE

203
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,378
I'm sorry.

204
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:42,506
I thought it wouldn't hurt
because you're a bonehead.

205
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,383
What did you say? You psychotic brat!

206
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,261
What did you say? You're going to
be a drum in your next life

207
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,889
and get your head beaten
by sticks all the time.

208
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,682
-What?
-What's going on?

209
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:52,892
Are you two dating?

210
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,685
-Goodness.
-Seriously.

211
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,145
You two look good together.

212
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,188
You two should date.

213
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,401
Yes, we're dating!

214
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:05,154
If any of you have
a problem with the psycho

215
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,949
and the loser dating, step forward!

216
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,618
Hey, you punks!

217
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,287
Dong Geu-ra-mi was called "psycho"

218
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,915
at school.

219
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:20,836
-Come here.
-It hurts.

220
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,379
It hurts!

221
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,589
Gosh.

222
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,591
Is karaoke your school?

223
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:29,470
If I catch you one more time at the
karaoke during school hours, you're done.

224
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,429
Got it?

225
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,388
Got it.

226
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,349
Gosh, you're insolent.

227
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,976
Answer respectfully,
in full sentences. Understand?

228
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,269
I understood.

229
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,480
What? Say it properly!

230
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,690
I said I understood!

231
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,945
Darn it! You brat!

232
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,572
So that means ecosystems

233
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:52,910
are composed of biological
factors and non-biological factors.

234
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,453
The biological factors…

235
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,331
RESTRICTED AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

236
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,798
Decomposer…

237
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,511
What is this?

238
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,430
When she was banned from going to karaoke,

239
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,682
Geu-ra-mi chose
the school's broadcasting room

240
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,476
as the place to sing.

241
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:21,146
Looking looking looking
I’m looking looking at you, I miss you

242
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,775
Every day, you make me crazy
Even my soul goes crazy

243
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:28,028
Hooked hooked hooked
I’m hooked hooked on you

244
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:31,323
My body is hooked on you
My body is hooked on you

245
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,826
Feel your senses react to my scent

246
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,744
Subtly wrapped around

247
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,746
You’re a sexy shadow

248
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,749
My heart was beating fine

249
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,626
-Now it’s all broken
-Hey, quiet down!

250
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,044
You make me crazy

251
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,756
I'm going to kill you!

252
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,800
Quiet down.

253
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,552
Quiet down and stay put.

254
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,846
Living foolishly
Foolishly foolishly foolishly

255
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:57,558
Foolishly foolishly foolishly
Makes me crazy

256
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,735
HWAMOON HIGH SCHOOL

257
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,010
You're 48 minutes late.

258
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:37,598
So what? I come to school
at any time I want.

259
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,856
Why are you following me?

260
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,658
Why are you following me?

261
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:00,454
When I'm with you, I'm safe.

262
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,501
What about me?

263
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,170
What do I gain from hanging out with you?

264
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,386
I'll be your friend.
You don't have friends.

265
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,059
What?

266
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,646
What?

267
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,027
Wait.

268
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:35,197
Hang on. What should I do with you?

269
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,157
What should I do?

270
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:43,330
Gosh, I can't believe
a loser said that to me.

271
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,374
Gosh.

272
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,585
I guess I lived long enough
to see such a crazy thing.

273
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,469
What are you doing? You said we're late!

274
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,500
Hey, Sync. How are you, buddy?

275
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,795
I missed you so much.

276
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,463
Gosh, it's been a while.

277
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,390
GIFT CONTRACT

278
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,271
What do you think?

279
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,772
As Geu-ra-mi said,

280
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,401
this memorandum is very
disadvantageous to Mr. Dong Dong-sam.

281
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,907
The clause that states Mr. Dong Dong-sam
will take responsibility

282
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,827
for all the tax when receiving
the compensation is the fatal part.

283
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,122
There isn't any loophole
in the memorandum?

284
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,958
No. This is enough
to be legally effective.

285
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,379
Why did you agree to such a memorandum?

286
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,006
I wouldn't say

287
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,467
I voluntarily agreed.

288
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,428
My husband typically can't say no
to his older brothers.

289
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:24,139
I think he's more scared
of them than his parents.

290
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,683
He just thinks their word is the law.

291
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:31,146
Did your brothers
intimidate you by any chance?

292
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,608
No, of course not.
My brothers aren't like that.

293
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,526
They all went to universities in Seoul.

294
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:40,405
They speak softly
in a refined manner unlike me.

295
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:46,620
They're so refined that they lied to
their youngest brother to take his money?

296
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:47,829
Quiet.

297
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,999
Lie? What lie?

298
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,167
Well…

299
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,253
According to Dong-il,

300
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,672
that's just the way the law is.

301
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,841
He said that
according to the inheritance law,

302
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,262
the eldest gets more than the second-born,

303
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:07,015
and the second-born
gets more than the youngest.

304
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,394
Did Mr. Dong Won-bin
pass away before 1991?

305
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,854
Mr. Dong Won-bin? Right, my father.

306
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:17,109
He passed away exactly 20 years ago,
so that would be 2001.

307
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,569
Then it's not true.

308
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:23,448
The inheritance law that's been revised
and is presently applied states that

309
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,826
all children should receive
equal amounts of inheritance,

310
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:28,078
regardless of birth order,
gender, and marital status.

311
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,497
Jeez, look at you go.

312
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,124
My friend is so smart!

313
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,460
-Yes.
-Well, Dong-il kept talking about

314
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,213
the inheritance law and this and that.

315
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:42,342
I wouldn't have stamped
my seal like that if he hadn't.

316
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,179
It's good.

317
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,600
Mr. Dong Dong-il
lying about the inheritance law

318
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,644
legally falls under deception.

319
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,689
-Disruption?
-It's deception.

320
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,524
-Deception?
-Yes.

321
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:00,736
It refers to the action of going against
the principle of good faith

322
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,738
and saying something is true
when it's not or covering up the truth.

323
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,244
So to put it simply, it was a fraud.

324
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,538
-Right.
-I see.

325
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,540
According to Article 110 of the civil law,

326
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:17,002
you can take back your expression of will
that was made due to fraud or compulsion.

327
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:20,464
What Mr. Dong Dong-il said
about the inheritance law is fraud.

328
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:21,715
If we consider how Mr. Dong Dong-sam

329
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:24,009
typically feels uncomfortable
around his brothers,

330
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,178
we might be able
to claim compulsion as well.

331
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:29,473
Then, canceling the memorandum
would be possible.

332
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,142
So…

333
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:36,772
you're saying I have to sue my brothers?

334
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,649
Suing is only used for criminal cases.

335
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,152
In this case,
it would be filing a complaint.

336
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,323
What's wrong? Is something troubling you?

337
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:47,991
So then,

338
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:53,497
I'd have to go to court
and go through a trial and everything.

339
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,084
Look here, Mr. Dong Dong-sam.

340
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:01,630
My father still hasn't come to his senses
after everything he's been through.

341
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,423
Go into debt then!

342
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,050
Give all your money to the uncles,

343
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:08,470
and live the rest of your life
paying it back with Mom!

344
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:12,140
-How could you say that to your dad?
-Gosh, she's not wrong.

345
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,018
You're worried about
your brothers and not us?

346
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,731
I'll do it. If I have to, I will.

347
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,068
So what? How should I go about it?

348
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,445
Young-woo, are you going
to be our attorney?

349
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,030
Of course, she will.

350
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,615
This isn't some random case.

351
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,659
It's for Geu-ra-mi's family.

352
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,160
Right?

353
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:35,205
Yes. Are you just going to watch
the father of your only friend

354
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:38,083
become broke after
being fooled by his brothers?

355
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,050
No.

356
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,594
I'm not an attorney anymore.

357
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,888
Instead, I will refer you
to another attorney.

358
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:55,350
What?

359
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,060
Well…

360
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,611
Hey, it's super big.

361
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,030
Yes, it's bad. Be careful when you go in.

362
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:09,990
Sure.

363
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:13,869
Be careful of what?

364
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,329
There's nothing to be careful of.

365
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,084
Goodness me!

366
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,009
This way.

367
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,972
I found it. Jung Myeong-seok.

368
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,141
Knock, then go in.

369
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,226
I didn't knock.

370
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:40,520
Okay.

371
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:42,731
But he's not here.

372
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,483
There's no one here.

373
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:49,279
Then go to the litigation team
and look for Lee Jun-ho.

374
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,281
What team?

375
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,871
How will I know who Lee Jun-ho is?
There are so many people here.

376
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:58,872
Well…

377
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,123
Lee Jun-ho

378
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,083
is popular.

379
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,836
How am I supposed to find him with that?
You have to describe his features.

380
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,797
Well, he's tall.

381
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:08,882
He's tall.

382
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,843
And good-looking.

383
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,680
We have to get his cellphone records.

384
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,015
Yes, I found him. Bye.

385
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,938
Any texts or calls
within the past three months…

386
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,022
Mr. Lee Jun-ho?

387
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,778
Yes, I'm Lee Jun-ho.

388
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,741
Really?

389
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,493
-Yes.
-Right.

390
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,454
-Take care of it for me, Jun-ho.
-Okay, bye.

391
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,836
What brings you here?

392
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,757
Young-woo told me to find you.

393
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,468
-Excuse me?
-Woo Young-woo.

394
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,097
-Are you an acquaintance of Attorney Woo?
-Yes, I'm her friend.

395
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,057
How is she doing?

396
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,480
She's doing well.

397
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:09,609
She actually told me
to go to Jung Myeong-seok.

398
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:10,986
But he wasn't in his office.

399
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,155
Here he comes. Attorney Jung.

400
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,116
-Jung Myeong-seok?
-Where's Jun-ho?

401
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,701
There he is.

402
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:54,321
Here is the crabmeat gimbap

403
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,240
you ordered.

404
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,366
Okay.

405
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,414
Technically speaking,

406
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,168
-it's not crabmeat gimbap.
-What?

407
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:10,253
Crabmeat gimbap is made with crab sticks,

408
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:13,715
and the main ingredient
of crab sticks is pollack, not crab.

409
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:17,177
I will suggest that it should be
renamed as crab stick gimbap.

410
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,763
Gosh, I'm sorry.

411
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:22,682
I have a suggestion.

412
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,896
Stop saying unnecessary things,

413
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,358
and answer the phone Ms. Part-Timer.

414
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,442
Okay.

415
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:36,738
Hello?

416
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,532
Hey, I'm here with Jun Myeong-seok…

417
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:42,869
I'm with Attorney Jung Myeong-seok
and he said no.

418
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,454
What?

419
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:45,497
He won't defend me.

420
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,959
I didn't say I won't defend you.
I said the chances of you winning is low.

421
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,336
Same difference.

422
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:54,339
Why won't he defend you?

423
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,926
I don't know. This is annoying.
He said we'll probably lose.

424
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,678
Did you tell him that expression of will
due to fraud or compulsion

425
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:01,805
can be canceled?

426
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,390
What about Mr. Dong Dong-il's deception?

427
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,058
Fraud or compulsion…

428
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:08,186
-What?
-Article 110 of the civil law.

429
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,021
Civil law.

430
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,064
No civil law.

431
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:11,981
No civil law?

432
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,942
He says he knows
the civil law, but we can't.

433
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,069
-Why not?
-Why not?

434
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,280
-Attorney Woo is
-"Attorney Woo is

435
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,075
-a rookie
-a rookie

436
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:24,994
-who is not aware of practicalities.
-who is not aware of practicalities."

437
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,747
-What?
-What?

438
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,043
Speak to him yourself.

439
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,169
WOO YOUNG-WOO YOUNG-WOO

440
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:37,215
-Hello, Attorney Woo.
-Hi.

441
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:40,760
I've been working at Hanbada for 14 years.

442
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:44,305
Do you know what perplexes me the most?

443
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,598
Well…

444
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:48,852
The revolving doors?

445
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,478
What?

446
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,188
The paper…

447
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:02,574
The paperwork that
the client already signed and sealed.

448
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,493
A rookie whose law school
degree is still fresh

449
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,705
wouldn't know how scary
these disposition documents are.

450
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,832
Mr. Dong Dong-sam did seal it,

451
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,209
but can't we still claim for cancelation
due to his brothers' deception

452
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,463
and compulsion based on
Article 110 of the civil law?

453
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,715
-Do you have proof?
-What?

454
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,842
How are you going to prove
that there was deception and compulsion?

455
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:22,969
Well…

456
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,430
Anyway, I'm not taking on this case.

457
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:28,141
If you have anything
else to say, do so in person.

458
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:29,851
I'm busy. Bye.

459
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,190
You really hung up.

460
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,153
What? No…

461
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:41,696
What?

462
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,324
Is something wrong?

463
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,451
Do you think you should go to the office?

464
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,620
Yes.

465
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,080
I think I should go to the office.

466
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,124
-Here.
-What?

467
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,918
When did you…

468
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,419
Get going.

469
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,129
-Here you go.
-What?

470
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,632
Here. Go.

471
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:02,842
-See you later.
-Okay.

472
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,931
Hey, your apron.

473
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,228
I'm sorry.

474
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,314
Enjoy your…

475
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,408
-Who is she?
-A friend of Attorney Woo.

476
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,660
Enjoy your food.

477
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:41,756
Hey.

478
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,058
Young-woo, did you eat yet?

479
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,017
No.

480
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,478
Woo Young-woo Gimbap?

481
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:59,440
When did you open up your own business?
It hasn't been that long since you quit.

482
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,610
Mr. Dong Dong-sam will be in extreme debt
if he can't cancel the memorandum.

483
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,238
I can't watch the father
of my only friend go broke

484
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,824
after being fooled by his older brothers.

485
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:13,413
If you won't take this case,
I'll ask Attorney Choi or Attorney Kwon.

486
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,208
Neither Attorney Choi
nor Attorney Kwon can make it work.

487
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,919
If it's a case that must be taken
to court even if failure is evident,

488
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:23,464
why would you irresponsibly
hand it over to your colleagues?

489
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,717
Because…

490
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,054
I'm not an attorney anymore.

491
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:33,182
Why are you not an attorney anymore?

492
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:37,687
We've all been
on the same team for months now.

493
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,564
Does it make sense to you
to just leave a letter of resignation

494
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,025
without any explanation
as to why you're quitting?

495
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:48,448
I couldn't process your resignation yet
because I wasn't given a proper reason.

496
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:52,535
So, Attorney Woo,
you're still an attorney at Hanbada

497
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,538
who's been taking a lot of
absences without notice.

498
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,586
-I'm going to leave first.
-Sure.

499
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:06,007
Since it's an urgent situation,
Attorney Woo, you take on this case.

500
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:10,345
I'll be going to court with you
as a senior attorney, but just to watch.

501
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:13,139
I won't be helping
or poking my nose into the case.

502
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,433
We'll talk about
your resignation again later.

503
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,000
Attorney Woo!

504
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:58,518
I've missed eating with you.

505
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:02,772
Okay.

506
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:07,235
Did you stop by your office?

507
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:10,405
I left something on your desk for you.

508
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,533
Oh, that.

509
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:14,617
Yes, that.

510
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,577
Did you open it?

511
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:20,790
I threw it away because
I didn't know it was from you.

512
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,959
Right.

513
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,627
Already?

514
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:26,963
That was fast.

515
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,341
Hey, Young-woo.

516
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,012
-Let's go.
-Okay.

517
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,180
Goodbye.

518
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,532
Plaintiff's counselor,
you may begin questioning the defendant.

519
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,296
The defendant told the plaintiff,

520
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,339
"let's divide the compensation

521
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:13,009
so that the eldest gets
more than the second-born,

522
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,178
and the second-born gets more
than the youngest." Correct?

523
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:17,889
Yes.

524
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,141
When the plaintiff hesitated,
the defendant said,

525
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,435
"According to the inheritance law,
the eldest gets more than the second-born,

526
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,854
and the second-born
gets more than the youngest."

527
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:28,983
"I've had it looked over by an attorney
who specializes in this." Correct?

528
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,947
No. I do not recall.

529
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:43,164
Defendant, tell the truth.

530
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,124
If you give false testimony,
you'll receive punishment.

531
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:46,793
Objection!

532
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,379
The plaintiff's counselor
is threatening the defendant

533
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,714
based on incorrect knowledge of the law.

534
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,510
Incorrect knowledge of the law?

535
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,595
The defendant is the party
this civil suit was filed against,

536
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:58,971
therefore he cannot serve as a witness.

537
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,891
Thus, he is not able to be punished for
perjury even if he gives false testimony.

538
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:04,977
This is a Supreme Court ruling.
Did you not study?

539
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:09,273
Is the defendant's attorney admitting
that the defendant gave false testimony?

540
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:12,735
No. I'm just telling you
to stop threatening the defendant

541
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,821
with incorrect knowledge about the law.

542
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,240
The court can impose
a fine for false testimony

543
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:19,367
even if it is the party
the civil suit was filed against.

544
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,994
It's stated in Article 370
Paragraph 1 of the civil law.

545
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,371
Did you not study?

546
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,916
Now, settle down.

547
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,878
Defendant, whether you can
be punished or not,

548
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,673
you're in court, so tell the truth only.
Do you understand?

549
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,424
Yes.

550
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,093
Let me ask you again.

551
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,720
"According to the
inheritance law, it is right

552
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,557
that the eldest and second-born
take more than the youngest."

553
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,642
"I had it looked over by an attorney."

554
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:47,228
Did you say this to the plaintiff?

555
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,406
No, I didn't.

556
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,242
Uncle, stop lying!

557
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,077
Sit down.

558
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,623
Mr. Dong Dong-i, you were there
at the time of the incident, right?

559
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,542
Is your big brother telling the truth?

560
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,592
-Uncle!
-Be quiet.

561
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,511
Once more and you'll be
excused from the courtroom.

562
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:24,432
Mr. Dong Dong-i, answer me.

563
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,726
All that about…

564
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,896
the inheritance law…

565
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:36,485
was never said.

566
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:41,115
Everything Dong-il said is true.

567
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:46,412
Plaintiff, I see that the contents
of this memorandum

568
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,539
are disadvantageous for you.

569
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:51,292
But, you need proof to claim

570
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,503
that this was an expression of will
due to fraud and compulsion.

571
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,756
Bring me the evidence.

572
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,484
Are you happy to bring us to court?

573
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,527
Are you blinded by your greed for money?

574
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,446
If our late parents saw this,

575
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,490
they'd be so shocked
that they'd come back to life!

576
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:31,832
What are they saying?

577
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,085
It would be great
if they came back to life!

578
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,044
Hey…

579
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:39,548
Is there really nothing
that can be used as evidence?

580
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:43,469
Any threatening texts
or phone call recordings.

581
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,138
Even a witness who saw what happened.

582
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:48,516
No, there isn't anything like that.

583
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:52,395
They just barged in out of the blue
and pulled out the memorandum.

584
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:53,896
Wait, perhaps…

585
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,607
the head of the village heard something.

586
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:57,775
Jin-hyeok?

587
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,070
Jin-hyeok left because my brothers came.

588
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,906
Knowing him,
would he have just left right away?

589
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,325
He would've been very curious.

590
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,702
You're right.

591
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:11,038
Jin-hyeok is not
the kind of person to just leave.

592
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,750
He's the kind of person to eavesdrop.

593
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:21,924
Jin-hyeok!

594
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,761
Jin-hyeok!

595
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,513
-Is that you, Sam?
-Yes.

596
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:28,472
Okay.

597
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,099
Hey, Sam.

598
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,983
Do you remember that time
when you came over to fix our roof?

599
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:39,900
Yes.

600
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:43,738
And you couldn't finish the work
because my brothers suddenly showed up.

601
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,156
Yes.

602
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,866
Did you

603
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,160
go home right away that day?

604
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,077
What?

605
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:53,331
You didn't listen in on
what my brothers and I

606
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,166
were saying?

607
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,086
Please tell us you eavesdropped. Please.

608
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,838
What do you take me for?

609
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:03,549
I don't go around eavesdropping.

610
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,262
Darn it.

611
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,431
Darn it.

612
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,143
I just happened to retie
my shoelaces at that moment.

613
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:16,520
So the sounds from inside
were somewhat audible.

614
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,231
Hey, Sam. Your roof is not
the issue with your house.

615
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,984
-You should look into soundproofing.
-Right.

616
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:27,031
So is there anything you overheard?
Something about the inheritance law?

617
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,992
Gosh, when I heard that,
I almost collapsed.

618
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,495
Do you not watch TV?
Why are you so easily fooled?

619
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,997
Thank you.

620
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,250
Hey. Really.

621
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,418
Seriously.

622
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,171
Thank you so much
for retying your shoelaces.

623
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,508
-You don't have to be thankful.
-Goodness.

624
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,385
Yes, have some.

625
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:51,889
Gosh, it's a long way
back to Seoul. Be safe.

626
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,474
-Okay, goodbye.
-Goodbye.

627
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,517
Bye, Young-woo.

628
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,394
-We'll get going then.
-Okay.

629
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,478
Bye.

630
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:58,854
Wait!

631
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,941
I'm going to spend the night
with Mom and Dad today.

632
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,442
-You will?
-Yes?

633
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:04,652
Okay.

634
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:05,736
Yes.

635
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,904
Hey.

636
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,697
Come here.

637
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,912
Nakjo Village is 30 minutes from here.

638
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,331
-It's famous for sunsets.
-What?

639
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,708
Nakjo village is a famous
date spot in Ganghwa-do.

640
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,794
I'm giving you guys privacy.

641
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,129
What?

642
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,340
I'm rooting for you. You got this.

643
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,154
This is my first time in Ganghwa-do.

644
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:54,869
Okay.

645
00:40:57,746 --> 00:41:00,749
Do you have any plans
for the rest of the day?

646
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,543
No, I don't.

647
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:04,795
Then…

648
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,384
would you like to go see the sunset?

649
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,358
A whale that is frequently found
in the Yellow Sea

650
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:29,737
is the Indo-Pacific finless porpoise.
It lives in shallow waters.

651
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:33,365
The Indo-Pacific finless porpoise
has a stubby snout

652
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,784
and narrow bumps on its back.

653
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:40,080
It's cute because its face
looks like it's smiling.

654
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,418
Have you ever seen a whale in person?

655
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,712
-No, I haven't.
-Really?

656
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:48,672
You've never been to an aquarium?

657
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,220
Aquariums are like jails for whales.

658
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,555
It's like slavery for them
as they are trapped in a small tank

659
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,767
eating only frozen fish and putting on
shows all year without any days off.

660
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,727
Dolphins, which have an average
life expectancy of 40 years,

661
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,230
can only survive
for four years in an aquarium.

662
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,732
Do you get how huge
the mental stress would be?

663
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,901
Right.

664
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,403
I wasn't aware.

665
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:20,079
Apparently, in the town of Daejeong,
Seogwipo city, Jeju Island,

666
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:22,248
you can frequently see

667
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:26,877
Sampal, Chunsam, and Boksun
swimming with baby dolphins.

668
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:29,797
Sampal, Chunsam, and Boksun?

669
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,758
They're Indo-Pacific bottlenose
dolphins that have been released

670
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:35,344
back into the sea of Jeju
due to a Supreme Court ruling,

671
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:37,846
after being trapped in an aquarium
and performing dolphin shows.

672
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,139
One day,

673
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,475
I will go see them.

674
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,704
Attorney Woo.

675
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,624
If you don't mind,

676
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:11,005
may I ask why you're quitting
being an attorney?

677
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,507
Right.

678
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:17,344
I was worried because you submitted your
letter of resignation after the last case.

679
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,847
I also kept thinking
about the mistake my friend made

680
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,350
when we were out
investigating the scene of the incident.

681
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,479
I felt bad.

682
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:31,609
Even when I'm working
as Attorney Woo Young-woo,

683
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,653
it feels as if I'm autistic Woo Young-woo

684
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,656
in people's eyes.

685
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:42,745
Autistic Woo Young-woo
is the weakest link.

686
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,539
If you have me on your side, you lose.

687
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:48,626
It's better if I'm not part of it at all.

688
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:59,053
I want to be on the same
side as you, Attorney Woo.

689
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:07,895
I want an attorney like you

690
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,648
to be on my side.

691
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,485
I have something I want to ask you.

692
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:58,237
Yes, go on.

693
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:02,658
Okay. Will Attorney Woo
be given a penalty?

694
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,451
Penalty?

695
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:08,622
She's been on leave without notice,
and she isn't coming into the office.

696
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,834
It's uncomfortable for me

697
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:14,795
to watch her only take on cases she wants

698
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,339
without managing
basic time and attendance.

699
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,552
Yes, that's understandable.

700
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:24,263
But this is just a temporary situation

701
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:27,182
because I didn't process
her letter of resignation yet.

702
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,518
I'll be processing it whichever way soon.

703
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:32,855
Why didn't you process
her letter of resignation yet?

704
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:38,235
Of course,

705
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:44,241
I understand giving Attorney Woo
special treatment because she's disabled.

706
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:46,326
-However--
-It's not special treatment.

707
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:50,164
I think Attorney Woo is doing pretty well.

708
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,709
The way she tenaciously
hangs onto a case is great,

709
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,169
and her way of thinking is creative.

710
00:45:56,587 --> 00:46:01,175
I'm sure you can learn something from her.

711
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:04,344
Colleagues are supposed to
learn from each other.

712
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,596
To grow.

713
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:08,849
Right.

714
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,020
WITNESS

715
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,939
Plaintiff's counselor,
you may begin questioning the witness.

716
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:25,532
When the defendants came over
to the plaintiff's house

717
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,618
and you couldn't work on the roof anymore,

718
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:30,329
did you return to your home right away?

719
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:33,874
-No.
-Then what did you do, and where?

720
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:38,420
I sat on Dong-sam's terrace stone
and retied my shoelaces.

721
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:41,298
While you were retying your shoelaces,

722
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:44,426
could you hear what the plaintiff
and defendants were discussing?

723
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,472
No.

724
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:50,516
Excuse me?

725
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:53,060
I couldn't hear them.

726
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,649
You couldn't hear them?

727
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:00,526
How would I be able to hear them?

728
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:04,071
I was outside, and Dong-sam
and his brothers were all inside.

729
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:19,211
Witness, when the plaintiff
asked you this same question before,

730
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:21,004
you definitely said you heard them.

731
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,881
Why are you changing your words?

732
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:26,635
Well, that's because it kind of felt like

733
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:30,847
Dong-sam wanted me
to say that I overheard.

734
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,516
But truthfully, I couldn't hear a thing.

735
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,144
No.

736
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,572
That is all.

737
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,347
Gosh.

738
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:13,724
Hey!

739
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,017
Stop drinking.

740
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,769
What kind of a part-timer
takes a customer's beer?

741
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,773
She doesn't drink anyway.

742
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:24,735
I'm the one boosting your sales.
Am I right or am I wrong?

743
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:26,653
Do you want another glass of beer?

744
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,155
I'm okay.

745
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,323
Gosh, I'm so angry.

746
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,408
Everyone's lying.

747
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:35,829
Only people who lie are alive
in this beautiful ecosystem.

748
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:36,955
I'm sorry.

749
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,417
I didn't expect people to lie in court.

750
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,128
I should've found indisputable
evidence before anything.

751
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:44,212
Evidence?

752
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:47,257
How on earth could you have
found evidence that doesn't exist?

753
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,635
It's my parents' fault
for not recording anything.

754
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,345
That darn evidence!

755
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,013
It's not like I can make one!

756
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,599
Darn it!

757
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,228
Right.

758
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:03,190
Make

759
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,192
evidence?

760
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:45,190
-Grandfather, your granddaughter's here!
-That sounds like Geu-ra-mi.

761
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,567
-Honey.
-What's going on?

762
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,236
Grandfather!

763
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:52,155
-Auntie.
-Gosh, I can smell the alcohol.

764
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:55,200
What have you guys been doing?

765
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:59,705
Grandfather Won-bin,
your granddaughter is here!

766
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:02,374
My dear grandfather
who's handsome only in name.

767
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:05,043
Here you are. How have you been?

768
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,379
How dare you behave this way
on the day of your grandfather's memorial?

769
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:11,425
I'm sorry.

770
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:13,969
A second time!

771
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:16,471
I'm sorry.

772
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:21,268
That's some uneducated behavior.
Like father, like daughter.

773
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,479
You're the best, Uncle.

774
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:26,398
The highly educated Mr. Dong Dong-il.

775
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:29,484
I respect you so much.

776
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,112
You are my life's mentor!

777
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:36,283
He said that's how the inheritance law is

778
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:39,077
and how the law itself is.

779
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:44,332
He said an attorney that specializes
in this advised you but during the trial,

780
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:47,544
he said, "Gosh, I don't recall."

781
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:56,511
A round of applause!

782
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:58,388
A round of applause!

783
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:01,016
-What is she saying?
-You live only once.

784
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:03,810
Let's live shamelessly like Dong Dong-il!

785
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:07,647
That's how you make five billion!

786
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,900
-Yes!
-Are you out of your mind?

787
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:11,318
What on earth are you doing?

788
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:14,321
Yes, okay.

789
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:16,698
Big brother is right.

790
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:18,700
Big brother is right.

791
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,952
I'm his dog.

792
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,956
I say "big," you say "brother."

793
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,374
Big! Brother!

794
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:27,292
Big! Brother!

795
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:29,544
Why aren't you doing it?

796
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:31,671
Dong Dong-sam!

797
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,633
Get your daughter out of here!

798
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:35,634
Why?

799
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:37,928
Did Geu-ra-mi say anything wrong?

800
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,763
-Dong-sam!
-Uncles!

801
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,934
You did scam my dad.

802
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,729
You called him a farmer
who doesn't know anything but rice.

803
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:52,067
You underestimated him and treated him
like some brainless nincompoop.

804
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:54,820
The compensation is 10 billion,
and you each take 5 billion and 3 billion.

805
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:57,864
But my dad is left
with 260 million in debt.

806
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:02,285
What kind of nonsense law is this?

807
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:03,829
This gift…

808
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:05,622
You brat!

809
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:09,125
-This brat.
-My goodness.

810
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,418
Are you okay?

811
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:14,548
Who do you think you are?
How dare you hit my daughter!

812
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:17,843
What did you just say?
Did you just say "how dare you"?

813
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,177
Yes, I did, you bastard!

814
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,555
You call yourselves my brothers?

815
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:24,891
You punk, what on earth are you doing
during our father's memorial?

816
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,560
-Hit me!
-Don't touch my dad!

817
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:29,396
-Hit me, you bastard!
-Don't touch my dad!

818
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,794
Yes, is this the police?

819
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:58,008
My brothers-in-law are beating up
my husband and daughter.

820
00:52:58,091 --> 00:53:00,051
Yes! Right now. My goodness!

821
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,470
You bastard!

822
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:07,642
Please rise.

823
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:16,902
You may be seated.

824
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:27,162
Plaintiff, are you injured?

825
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,373
Yes.

826
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,418
Your daughter as well?

827
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:37,172
Judge.

828
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:39,090
I wish to submit evidence

829
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:41,968
and a written statement
regarding the injuries of the two.

830
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:01,029
The defendants recently assaulted
the plaintiff and his daughter,

831
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:05,367
and they need two weeks and a week
to make a full recovery, respectively.

832
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:08,495
I submit the diagnosis of the plaintiff
and Ms. Dong Geu-ra-mi,

833
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:12,082
and the record of the call that was made
to the police at that time as evidence.

834
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:15,043
This trial is about
the gift contract that was made

835
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:16,878
between the plaintiff and the defendants.

836
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:19,923
The diagnosis and the police call
are irrelevant to this case.

837
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:21,549
It is not irrelevant.

838
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,176
The civil law stipulates

839
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:27,514
that there is one situation in which
a gift can be legally canceled.

840
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:31,434
Article 556, Paragraph 1,
Item 1 of the civil law.

841
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:35,105
When the recipient commits a crime against
the giver or the giver's immediate family,

842
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:37,399
the giver can cancel the gift contract.

843
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:40,068
The defendants, who are the recipients,
assaulted the plaintiff, who is the giver,

844
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:43,279
and Ms.Dong Geu-ra-mi,
his immediate family.

845
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:45,448
It was done together by two people,
so this falls under Article Two,

846
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:49,995
Paragraph Two which is
the Act on Punishment of Violence, etc.

847
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:52,872
Therefore, the plaintiff

848
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:56,251
wishes to cancel the gift contract
he has with the defendants.

849
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:03,800
Are you saying you wish
to change the purpose of the claim?

850
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:06,594
We wish to keep
the original purpose of the claim

851
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:08,555
which is cancelation of expression
of will due to fraud and compulsion,

852
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:11,558
but also add
cancelation of the gift contract

853
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,351
based on Article 556, Paragraph One,

854
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:16,354
Item One of the civil law
as a primary purpose of the claim.

855
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:17,856
Wait!

856
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:21,484
Was the assault perhaps induced
aiming for cancelation of the gift?

857
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:28,783
Do you have evidence
to support your claim?

858
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:42,047
I approve of the change
of the purpose of the claim.

859
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:46,384
We will make the decision
based on the newly added materials.

860
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:52,474
What is this? What's going on?

861
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:55,935
We're screwed.

862
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:19,709
Good work.

863
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,052
This is your first time
going to the main conference room, right?

864
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:32,430
Yes, but today's meeting is not being held
in the main conference room.

865
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:35,350
-I'm not sure why you want us to go there.
-Right.

866
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:38,186
There's something
I really want to show you.

867
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,290
The view is nice.

868
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:02,377
What I want to show you is behind you.

869
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:58,618
Dong-sam.

870
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,007
I'm sorry.

871
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:14,759
I'm sorry.

872
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,178
We're really sorry.

873
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,682
To be honest,

874
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:24,310
we try to look like it,
but we're not that well-off.

875
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,436
I'm…

876
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:29,023
still paying back the debt
I have from my old business.

877
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:31,734
Dong-i lives paycheck to paycheck.

878
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:37,782
When I heard the compensation
would be in billions…

879
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:40,285
It's hard to understand people's feelings.

880
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:44,289
The feeling of gratitude
was gone in an instant

881
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,708
and I just felt like it was a waste.

882
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:52,714
Splitting it with my brothers
and paying the tax felt like a waste.

883
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:54,716
So…

884
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,178
That's why I came up
with this horrible plan.

885
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:04,475
Geu-ra-mi, you must've
been in so much pain.

886
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:07,228
We're sorry.

887
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:10,148
Okay, sure.

888
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,693
Take a seat.

889
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:30,752
My attorney says

890
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:34,631
if we go by the law,
the ten billion is all mine.

891
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:38,635
We wouldn't have to worry about
going through any more hardships.

892
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:40,428
And especially,

893
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:44,265
I finally can let
Geu-ra-mi live in luxury.

894
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:45,808
Then let me.

895
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:48,227
Let me live in luxury.

896
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:55,318
But I'm not like you two.

897
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:01,240
I won't be greedy for what was not mine
in the first place.

898
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:06,412
That's what our late mother
and father would want.

899
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,542
After paying the tax,

900
01:01:12,877 --> 01:01:15,004
we'll split it equally

901
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,465
between the three of us.

902
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:19,592
What do you say?

903
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:24,722
Thank you, Dong-sam.

904
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:27,809
We'll be forever grateful.

905
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:34,023
I did mock calculations.

906
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:35,650
Taxes are imposed

907
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:37,860
once when the initial ten billion
is assigned to Mr. Dong Dong-sam.

908
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:42,490
And once again when the shares are paid
to Mr. Dong Dong-il and Mr. Dong Dong-i.

909
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:46,369
Deducting all the taxes,
you'll have 6 billion and 4 million won.

910
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:47,912
Taking into account
the possibility of a margin of error,

911
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:50,373
ultimately Mr. Dong Dong-ill,
Mr. Dong Dong-i, and Mr. Dong Dong-sam

912
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:53,292
will each receive
approximately two billion won.

913
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:56,546
Yes, thank you.

914
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:58,005
Thank you.

915
01:01:58,756 --> 01:01:59,966
This is the agreement.

916
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:04,345
Read it over, sign,
and seal with discretion.

917
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:21,362
PLAINTIFF: DONG DONG-SAM

918
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:22,405
Look at this.

919
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:28,911
This clause is what saved
my family from being screwed.

920
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:30,288
I'll remember this forever.

921
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:31,456
I see.

922
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,959
My Young-woo.

923
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:37,879
My baby is all grown up.

924
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:41,257
Thank you. I'm sorry. I love you.

925
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:42,925
Okay.

926
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:43,885
Okay.

927
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:55,396
Yes, come in.

928
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:11,913
Attorney Jung.

929
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:14,081
Was my resignation processed?

930
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:16,751
Not yet, but I was just about to.

931
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:20,421
Then starting today,
can I come back to work?

932
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:25,218
Yes, suit yourself.

933
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,553
Okay.

934
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:31,307
But you can't take days off now.

935
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:33,643
You used it all up with your absences.

936
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:34,769
Well.

937
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,939
I couldn't take days off
in the first place.

938
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:56,707
She always has the final say.

939
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:32,535
ATTORNEY WOO YOUNG-WOO

940
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:43,004
ATTORNEY WOO YOUNG-WOO

941
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:48,009
A FEW MONTHS AGO

942
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:51,429
Gwang-ho.

943
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:53,764
It's been a while.

944
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:57,685
Han Seon-young?

945
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,528
Your daughter…

946
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:11,157
applied to Hanbada, right?

947
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:14,452
Yes.

948
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:19,373
But how do you know all this?

949
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,334
I guess Hanbada is different.

950
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:24,211
The CEO even takes a look
at applications of new employees.

951
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:28,424
That's true.

952
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:31,802
I was preoccupied

953
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:34,096
and they rejected
your daughter within that time.

954
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:35,848
They didn't recognize such a talent.

955
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:41,562
Send her to Hanbada now.

956
01:05:47,151 --> 01:05:50,237
Why do you want her?
She's already been rejected once.

957
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:53,574
Isn't your recruitment process over?

958
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:55,534
I told you.

959
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:58,287
My HR team made a mistake

960
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,665
when I was preoccupied.

961
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:04,293
I mean, if Hanbada
doesn't take in the attorney

962
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:07,672
who graduated summa cum laude
from Seoul National University law school,

963
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:11,008
and got a near-perfect score on the bar,
who else would take her.

964
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:15,471
Seon-young.

965
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:20,309
My daughter is smart,

966
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,898
but she has autism.

967
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:29,902
That's why she hasn't been hired
by anyone for over six months

968
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:31,737
since she graduated from law school.

969
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:35,074
I know.

970
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:42,248
All the other law firms
are making a mistake right now.

971
01:06:54,218 --> 01:06:56,637
I'm going to head home, okay?
No need to walk me out.

972
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:57,555
All right.

973
01:06:57,638 --> 01:06:58,806
-Seon-young.
-Yes.

974
01:06:58,889 --> 01:06:59,932
Thank you.

975
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:02,476
Gosh, you're thanking me? I'm honored.

976
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:05,146
-I'm leaving now. Get back inside.
-Okay. Bye.

977
01:07:05,229 --> 01:07:07,398
-Get home safe.
-Okay, I'll call you.

978
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:23,706
THE FIRST AUTISTIC ATTORNEY OF
THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA, WOO YOUNG-WOO

979
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:31,297
She resembles her mom.

980
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:50,483
I hope the Geumgang people
learn a lesson this time.

981
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:51,567
What effort?

982
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:53,027
-An effort to come up with a dirty trick
-Look.

983
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:54,570
-to ruin the other companies?
-Can you tell who's lying?

984
01:07:54,653 --> 01:07:57,281
Then look between their eyebrows.
The area of truth.

985
01:07:57,364 --> 01:08:00,659
It'll look like you're lying
if you stroke your thighs.

986
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:02,745
Most importantly,
don't rub the tip of your nose.

987
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:03,996
You'll look like Pinocchio.

988
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,333
Come to think of it,
you never handle cases quietly.

989
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:09,001
It's not like you're
Wild Card Woo Young-woo.

990
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,628
You Tactician Kwon Min-woo!

991
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:11,712
"Tactician"?

992
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:12,880
In the spirit of Cham Cham Cham.

993
01:08:12,963 --> 01:08:14,757
Lee Jun-ho likes Woo Young-woo.

994
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:15,883
Is this true?

995
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:21,097
