1
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,915
There comes a day for every parent

2
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:25,835
when they ask themselves
if their kids could be special.

3
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:31,716
For my father,
that day was November 17, 2000.

4
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,219
Young-woo.

5
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,305
Young-woo?

6
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,934
Young-woo.

7
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,978
Look at me.

8
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,900
Young-woo.

9
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,152
Woo Young-woo, look at me.

10
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:55,615
You said Young-woo can't talk
even though she's five years old?

11
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,200
Yes.

12
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,786
Not even simple words like mom or dad?

13
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,996
No, not at all.

14
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,920
We'll have to look further into it,

15
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,965
but it seems
as though Young-woo is autistic.

16
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,633
What?

17
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,011
Autistic?

18
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,152
Is that good, Young-woo?

19
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,870
Hey!

20
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,956
You stay right there, okay?

21
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,043
You…

22
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,336
You bastard.

23
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,422
I took pity on you for being a widower,

24
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,716
so I let you live here
without raising the rent.

25
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,593
And you're trying to get with my wife?

26
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,636
Move out this instant, you bastard!

27
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,972
What are you talking about?

28
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,892
You always came to my place
whenever I was away, right?

29
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,685
What did you do?

30
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:09,647
What did you do with my wife? You punk!

31
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,276
Your wife was just babysitting
Young-woo because I had to go to work.

32
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,445
You dare come to my house
whenever I was away

33
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,363
with an excuse of leaving your kid?

34
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,158
You bastard! You're going to die

35
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,869
after spitting
your damn nonsense like that!

36
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,163
How can you swear
like that in front of a child?

37
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,748
-What?
-You have no right!

38
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,541
What did you say? You bastard!

39
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,500
You punk!

40
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,377
-What are you doing? Let go.
-Damn you!

41
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,212
-What's wrong with you?
-You bastard!

42
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,505
What are you doing?

43
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,882
Let go of me!

44
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,634
Move out, you punk!

45
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,843
How can we…

46
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,887
-Come on, what are you doing?
-You punk!

47
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,889
Let go. Gosh, what's wrong with you?

48
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,516
Seriously!

49
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,935
What are you doing?

50
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,022
You bastard!

51
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,857
What's wrong with you?

52
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,859
-You bastard!
-What's wrong with you?

53
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,320
"Inflicting bodily injury."

54
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,823
"A person who inflicts
bodily injury upon another

55

56
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:08,039
up to ten years of probation,
or a fine of up to ten million won."

57
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:16,839
Young-woo.

58
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,842
Did you just talk?

59
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:21,886
Did you?

60
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:25,974
YEONGRAN VILLA

61
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,100
Did you hear?

62
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,852
You heard Young-woo talk, right?

63
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,105
Young-woo talks!

64
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,107
You heard, right?

65
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,319
Young-woo can talk!

66
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,530
Young-woo can talk!

67
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,291
Young-woo.

68
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,583
Young-woo?

69
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,043
Young-woo.

70
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,380
Where did you learn all that?

71
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,424
The law about inflicting bodily injury.

72
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,718
Did you see it somewhere?

73
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:03,845
Criminal law.

74
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,513
Criminal law?

75
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:07,974
Criminal…

76
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,227
CASEBOOK OF CRIMINAL LAW

77
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,196
Hey…

78
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,116
Did you read this book?

79
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,036
"Article 311, Insult."

80
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,621
"A person who publicly insults
another shall be punished

81
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,249
with up to one-year imprisonment

82
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,919
or imprisonment without prison labor
or by a fine of up to two million won."

83
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,380
"Direction and components
of investigation."

84
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,007
"One, publicity."

85
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:45,678
"One, refer to Article 307, Defamation."

86
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,806
"Two, it holds the characteristics
of not stating facts

87
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,894
and hurting one's honor and feelings."

88
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,188
"Two, action, insulting a person."

89
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,564
-"One,
-Gwang-ho.

90
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,650
insult is not the statement
of a specific fact,

91
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,570
-but harming a person's honor
-Hi.

92
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,447
and feelings in a contemptuous manner."

93
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,283
I'm sorry.

94
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:10,661
My husband behaved so ridiculously.

95
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,999
Here, put some ointment on.

96
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,751
Thank you.

97
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:20,838
Are you crying?

98
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,760
Young-woo…

99
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,722
memorizes criminal law.

100
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,557
What?

101
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,352
She memorized this thick book.

102
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,105
Really?

103
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,066
She's a genius!

104
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,736
She must've been different
from other kids because she's a genius.

105
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,030
My goodness.

106
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,242
Young-woo can grow up
to be an attorney, right?

107
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,828
Thank you.

108
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,496
Thank you.

109
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,416
There comes a day for every parent

110
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,087
when they ask themselves
if their kids could be special.

111
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:06,884
For my father,
that day was November 17, 2000.

112
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:11,389
The day he found out that his daughter
was an autistic genius.

One Woo Young-woo gimbap, please.

131
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:51,215
My daughter looks great!

132
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,759
One Woo Young-woo gimbap!

133
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,970
Here you go.

134
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,892
I always have the Woo Young-woo gimbap
for breakfast.

135
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,020
Gimbap is reliable.

136
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,688
I can see all the ingredients,

137
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,524
so I will not be alarmed
by unexpected texture or flavor.

138
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,777
Tell me the route to your office.

139
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,071
I walk to Hapjeong Station,
take line number two,

140
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,281
and get off at Yeoksam Station.

141
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,992
I come out through exit number 4
and walk 312m straight.

142
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,910
A total of 38 minutes.

143
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:20,870
Okay.

144
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,998
Don't repeat other people's words
and don't say anything weird.

145
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,791
But don't be too blunt, okay?

146
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,919
Refrain from echolalia. Saying weird
and honest things are prohibited.

147
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,213
Especially, no talking about whales.

148
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,889
Well…

149
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,226
What if the situation
absolutely requires whale talk?

150
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,145
Do you work at an aquarium?

151
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,440
In what kind of situation
would whale talk be necessary?

152
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:55,446
But, despite all that,
what if that kind of situation happens?

153
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:57,740
Then you do it.

154
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,659
Okay.

155
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,089
Wait.

156
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,889
-See you later.
-All right.

160
00:12:59,028 --> 00:12:59,987
it's Yeoksam Station.

161
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,641
You can step in now.

162
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,184
Right here.

163
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,776
You can step out now.

164
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,447
The door is so confusing, right?

165
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:27,908
Thank you.

166
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,244
Where are you headed?

167
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,956
Right.

168
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,083
Attorney Jung Myeong-seok's office.

169
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,211
I'm headed that way too.
Let's go together.

170
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,093
This way.

171
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,555
-Hi, Jun-ho.
-Nice to see you.

172
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,556
-Hey.
-Hey.

173
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,100
Good morning.

174
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,686
-Good morning.
-Hello.

175
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:56,687
-Hello.
-Hello.

176
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,355
Jun-ho, where's the paperwork
for Attorney Jang?

177
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,815
It should be at my desk.

178
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,400
Okay.

179
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,318
You got this.

180
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,204
Excuse me.

181
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,457
It's this way.

182
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,336
Right here.

183
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,421
This is Attorney
Jung Myeong-seok's office.

184
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,757
-Do you want me to knock for you?
-No.

185
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,300
I will do it.

186
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,218
Sure, I'll get going then.

187
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,274
ATTORNEY JUNG MYEONG-SEOK

188
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,526
Yes, come in.

189
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,679
Who are you?

190
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:15,641
I'm Woo Young-woo, the new attorney
who will be working at Hanbada Law Firm.

191
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:20,521
Was the new attorney
supposed to come today?

192
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:21,939
Well…

193
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,983
Hold on, the resume I got…

194
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,536
APPLICATION (LAW SCHOOL)

195
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,621
TAKE CARE OF HER, PLEASE.
FROM HAN

196
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,417
Well…

197
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,838
My resume should have two pages.
Do you not have the second page?

198
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,138
No, what does it say?

199
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,306
Special note, autism spectrum disorder.

200
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,143
Right.

201
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,437
I see.

202
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,149
Yes, well, do you have
anything else to say?

203
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:17,161
My name is Woo Young-woo,
whether it is read straight or flipped.

204
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,830
Kayak, deed, rotator,
noon, racecar, Woo Young-woo.

205
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:21,957
Yeoksam Station.

206
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,545
That's very funny.

207
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,172
Yes.

208
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,385
So…

209
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:37,556
I'm going to leave for a bit,
so get yourselves acquainted.

210
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:38,724
Yes, sir.

211
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,769
All right, it was nice to meet you.

212
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,607
You can't say those things at work.

213
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,317
Kayak? Deed?

214
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,320
"You can't say those things at work."
Kayak, deed, forbidden.

215
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,362
But…

216
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,656
it's not easy to not do it.

217
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,616
Do you

218
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,451
know each other?

219
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,869
We went to law school together.

220
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,747
So how do you know our CEO?

221
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,541
There was a note
that said to take care of you.

222
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,920
You memorized the CEO's handwriting?

223
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:08,962
No.

224
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,134
It says "from Han" here.

225
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:18,263
Who else here at Hanbada
can refer to themselves as Han

226
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,766
besides the CEO?

227
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,073
Come in.

228
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,168
APPLICATION (LAW SCHOOL)

229
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,921
The new attorney you sent came in.

230
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,924
She did?

231
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,344
Did you get a chance
to see the second page of her resume?

232
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,888
Apparently, it says she's autistic.

233
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,307
I did see the second page.

234
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:06,061
So you saw that and still accepted her?

235
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,899
Were you too fixated on the second page
to check out the first one?

236
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,152
She graduated with top honors

237
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,696
from SNU law school
and scored over 1,500 on the bar.

238
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,992
If Hanbada doesn't bring
such a talent in, who will?

239
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,579
People can score well
just by having great memorization skills.

240
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:27,624
I need an attorney who can meet
with clients and go to trials.

241
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,253
Someone with good social skills
and can speak eloquently.

242
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,756
How can I train someone who can't
even introduce herself properly?

243
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,468
Did you introduce yourself well
on your first day here?

244
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,929
Didn't I?

245
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,225
What I'm trying to say

246
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,728
is that she's different from me.

247
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,648
In what way?

248
00:19:56,778 --> 00:20:00,699
Okay, if you insist,
I'll assign a case to the rookie.

249
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,743
I'll test her to see if she's qualified

250
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,913
or if it's my prejudice
against people with disabilities.

251
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,999
If Attorney Woo Young-woo
is determined as being not up to standard

252
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,834
to meet with clients and go to trials,

253
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,961
can we let her go then?

254
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,051
Sure.

255
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,220
Okay.

256
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,732
It's a public interest case.
Take out the materials.

257
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,108
"Take out the materials."

258
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,367
The defendant…

259
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,623
All settled?

260
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,459
The defendant
is an old lady in her seventies.

261
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,295
The defendant takes care of
her husband who has mild dementia

262
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,838
and they got into a fight
on the day of the incident.

263
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,257
The husband was mouthing off,

264
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,551
so the defendant got mad
and hit him on the forehead

265
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,136
with an iron that was in front of her.

266
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,680
"With an iron that was in front of her."

267
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,354
EVIDENCE THAT WAS FOUND
AT SCENE OF THE CRIME IRON 1

268
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,564
This iron resembles

269
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,733
a sperm whale.

270
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,235
A sperm whale?

271
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,152
Yes.

272
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,154
A sperm whale is also called a cachalot

273
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:24,241
because it has a big, square head
with a spermaceti organ inside.

274
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:28,412
The spermaceti organ contains a wax-like
liquid, which is used to make sounds.

275
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,705
All right. Moving on--

276
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,332
Have you read
Herman Melville's novel, Moby-Dick?

277
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,751
The whale in that novel is a sperm whale.

278
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,962
In the novel, it is described to be white,

279
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:40,132
but actually, its body color
is dark gray or purplish-brown--

280
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,927
What are you talking about right now?

281
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:44,886
I'm…

282
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,264
talking about the sperm whale.

283
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,558
-Are you not going to focus on the case?
-Right.

284
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,226
I'm sorry.

285
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,228
Whale talk is prohibited.

286
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:11,955
Gosh, my head.

287
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,042
It feels like it's about to split open.

288
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,295
Does it hurt that bad?
Do you want some painkillers?

289
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:19,588
I want food.

290
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:20,839
Give me food!

291
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:23,508
You ate earlier. Don't you remember?

292
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,760
Gosh, my head.

293
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,011
Goodness.

294
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,513
-Delivery.
-My goodness. Yes.

295
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,683
It must be the dried persimmon.

296
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,643
-Goodness.
-How have you been?

297
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,270
You're the young man from before.

298
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:38,315
That was so quick.
That was like lightning delivery.

299
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,067
-I have to work hard.
-Yes.

300
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,819
Hard-working and handsome.

301
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,572
Top husband material.
Do you have a girlfriend?

302
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:46,656
No, I don't.

303
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,699
That's too bad.

304
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,494
You would've been a perfect match
for my granddaughter if I had one.

305
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:51,536
That's too bad.

306
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,996
What's going on?

307
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,248
-All right, bye.
-Oh, bye.

308
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,208
Darn it!

309
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,251
Darn it.

310
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,004
Why are you all excited?

311
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,091
Chatting and giggling with another man
in broad daylight.

312
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,093
There you go again.

313
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:09,221
What do you mean another man?
He's young enough to be our grandson.

314
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:13,058
You're flirting with another man
even when your husband is right here.

315
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,977
You would probably bring him
into the bedroom if I wasn't here.

316
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,188
Gosh, stop it.

317
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,981
-Here, try this.
-Darn it!

318
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,530
Always grinning from ear to ear
whenever you see a man.

319
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:30,242
Do you think a person
has to work at a bar to be a bargirl?

320
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,119
How could you say that to your wife?

321
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:35,997
I told you if you speak like that again,
we're going to die together, didn't I?

322
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,250
Why would you flirt with men

323
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,752
as if you're a whore?

324
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:41,878
What?

325
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,171
Whore?

326
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,133
Whore?

327
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:49,845
Are you out of your mind?

328
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:50,804
What are you doing?

329
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,475
Let's just die today.

330
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,768
You die, then I die.

331
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,770
Let's just end this.

332
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,733
You die, I die, we'll finally end this.

333
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:05,735
You old man.

334
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,321
In the last 50 years, not once did…

335
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,075
Honey.

336
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:13,743
Honey.

337
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,662
Honey!

338
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,122
What's wrong? Honey!

339
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,166
Honey!

340
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,625
Honey!

341
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,051
Hello?

342
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,929
Yes, my husband fainted.

343
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,307
Please hurry.

344
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,895
Yes, 314 Yeonhui-dong,
Seodaemun-gu. Yeongran Villa.

345
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,440
Eventually, the husband suffered a brain
hemorrhage, requiring 12 weeks to heal.

346
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,400
The defendant was charged
with attempted murder.

347
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,235
"The defendant was charged
with attempted murder."

348
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,153
Why?

349
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,198
Why do you keep repeating what I say?

350
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,575
Right. I'm sorry.

351
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,620
-Use of echolalia is prohibited.
-Echolalia? What's that?

352
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:59,956
The act of repeating after others.
It's a common symptom of autism.

353
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,416
Yes, stop with the echolalia.

354
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,793
"Yes, stop with the echolalia."

355
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:10,175
Anyway, this old lady
is in a pitiful situation.

356
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,719
She must also be aching all over
since she's in her seventies.

357
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:15,013
But she has to take care
of her 80-year-old husband with dementia.

358
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:18,683
But the good news is that
the prosecution seems to think so too.

359
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,852
They haven't applied
for an arrest warrant.

360
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,604
Even when it's suspicion
of attempted murder?

361
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:26,483
But it's good. There's a low possibility
for imprisonment for the defendant

362
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,401
who stands the trial undetained.

363
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:35,533
So what is it that Attorney Woo Young-woo
should do for the defendant?

364
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,122
What should you do?

365
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,253
Get her probation.

366
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:50,632
Even if the charge is attempted murder,
it's possible enough in this case.

367
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:51,800
Yes, sir.

368
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,636
Let's get ready to meet the defendant.
She's coming to the conference room.

369
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,397
Hello, Attorney Jung.

370
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,439
Yes, hello.

371
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:09,985
I'm just here to make introductions.

372
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,946
She will be in charge
of your defense from now on.

373
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:16,408
Hello, I'm Woo Young-woo.
I will do my best.

374
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:22,831
Right.

375
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,208
This young lady is an attorney?

376
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,462
You won't be looking at my case?

377
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:32,882
I'll be looking at it too.
But Attorney Woo is in charge.

378
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,267
She graduated from SNU.

379
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,688
-Really?
-She graduated with top honors.

380
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,864
All right, then. Have a nice conversation.

381
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,407
I'm going to excuse myself.

382
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:09,461
I was surprised when I saw the address.
You still live in that house.

383
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:13,423
-Excuse me?
-My father and I lived there 22 years ago.

384
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,966
House 201 at Yeongran Villa.

385
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:20,305
House 201, 22 years ago…

386
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,391
Gwang-ho.

387
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,061
He graduated from SNU law school, right?

388
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,981
Are you Young-woo?

389
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,442
My goodness. You're Young-woo.

390
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,611
My goodness.

391
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:37,030
What in the world is going on?

392
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:39,824
The little kid really grew up
and became an attorney.

393
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:43,495
My goodness. They said you're a genius,
and you actually became an attorney.

394
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,663
Gosh, let me look at you.

395
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:46,873
You grew up well.

396
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:51,002
Gosh, you grew up so well.
How's your father doing?

397
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:55,632
When was your husband
diagnosed with dementia?

398
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,051
Right.

399
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:01,554
It's been about five years.

400
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:04,349
Even after he quit working
at the district office,

401
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,893
he kept working, doing this and that.

402
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,771
He isn't the type
to sit around doing nothing.

403
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:13,525
Then when he was diagnosed
with dementia, he quit everything.

404
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,361
That was about five years ago.

405
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,030
Your husband was a public officer
at the district office?

406
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:22,867
Yes, he was a section chief
before he retired.

407
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,578
Then what is your source
of income right now?

408
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:30,917
My husband's pension
and the rent we collect.

409
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,127
We live off those two.

410
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,254
Whose name is the villa under?

411
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,839
My husband, of course.

412
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:40,218
The building is just named after me.

413
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,180
Why?

414
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:47,851
Will that cause some kind of issue?

415
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:49,519
Will it?

416
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,443
Yes, Attorney Woo, come in.

417
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,919
I composed
an Attorney's Statement of Opinion.

418
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:25,972
What is this?

419
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,766
An Attorney's Statement of Opinion.

420
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,017
Yes, I'm aware.

421
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:32,103
Not guilty?

422
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:35,482
I plan on pleading not guilty
of her attempted murder charge.

423
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,026
Attorney Woo.

424
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,612
Can you not see the obvious?

425
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,616
This is a case
where the prosecution has decided

426
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,993
to give the defendant
probation from the beginning.

427
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,496
Showing them
that the defendant is remorseful

428
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,916
and that the victim doesn't want
the defendant to be punished is enough.

429
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:56,920
They will sentence probation
even when the attorney does nothing

430
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:59,172
and just sits still next to the defendant.

431
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:02,884
Why would I have assigned it to you if we
had to argue over guilt and innocence?

432
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,844
To a rookie on her first day?

433
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,056
I think this is a case

434
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,850
where we need to argue
over guilt and innocence.

435
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,770
Why do you think that?

436
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,564
This case is interesting.

437
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,483
It's like the whale quiz I enjoy.

438
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,110
If a female sperm whale
that weighs 22 tons

439
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,196
ate a giant squid
that weighs 500 kilograms,

440
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,698
then laid an egg
that weighs 1.3 tons 6 hours later,

441
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:29,077
how much does the sperm whale weigh?

442
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,453
I don't know.

443
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:34,499
The answer is, "Whales cannot lay eggs."

444
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:37,335
Whales are mammals so they give birth
instead of laying eggs.

445
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,754
If you only focus on the weight,
you can't solve the problem.

446
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,423
-You have to look at the main point.
-Okay, so what?

447
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,300
This case is a criminal case,

448
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,886
so people will generally focus
only on criminal law.

449
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,596
But if you do that,
you can't see the answer.

450
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,265
The key is in civil law.

451
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,184
-Civil law?
-"Article 1004 of the Civil Act."

452
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:56,938
"A person who has intentionally killed
or attempted to kill a lineal ascendant,

453
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,566
the inheritor, their spouse, or any person
who has priority or in the same order

454
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,860
of inheritance cannot become
the inheritor." In other words,

455
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:06,155
they cannot inherit from a person
they have murdered or tried to murder.

456
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:09,409
The defendant lives off the pension
of her husband, a retired public officer.

457
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:12,245
Even the building in which they collect
rent is in her husband's name.

458
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:14,789
If the attempted murder is recognized,

459
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:18,418
the defendant will be in a huge financial
crisis after her husband passes.

460
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:22,297
She won't be able to receive the pension
nor will she be able to inherit the house.

461
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,632
It is true that the defendant
hurt her husband,

462
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,010
so she won't be found
not guilty of all charges.

463
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:30,179
Therefore, I will try to get her probation
for the crime of inflicting bodily injury,

464
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,306
not attempted murder.

465
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,647
Well…

466
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,190
Nice work.

467
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,485
Good job.

468
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,572
You found the hidden issue.

469
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,825
I should've looked
into something like this first.

470
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,411
I thought too little of it.

471
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,663
It's okay now that you realized that.

472
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,172
Hey.

473
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,174
You have to visit the hospital, right?

474
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,676
I'll send an employee with you.

475
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,220
Meeting with defendants and victims
outside the office is difficult.

476
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,348
Even for ordinary attorneys.

477
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,557
Yes, sir.

478
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,021
I apologize.

479
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:25,401
-Pardon?
-It was rude of me to say

480
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:26,945
ordinary attorneys.

481
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,155
That's fine.

482
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,991
Because I'm not an ordinary attorney.

483
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,457
EMPLOYEE LEE JUN-HO

484
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,127
It's around the time
you usually feel sleepy.

485
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,129
The chocolate
will help you feel energized.

486
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,881
Thank you.

487
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,425
I noticed you seem to like it dark.

488
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,886
So I got you the dark kind.
82 percent cacao.

489
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,431
Gosh, 82 percent.
Thank you, I appreciate it.

490
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,684
Jun-ho, are you busy?

491
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,148
Gosh, is that everything you've received?

492
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,775
I'm so envious.

493
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:08,444
I don't even have anyone
who offers to share gum with me.

494
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,904
I'm not busy. What's up?

495
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,323
I need you to visit the hospital for work.

496
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,993
The attorney you'll be
accompanying is a rookie.

497
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,160
Really?

498
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,454
But they say she's a handful.

499
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,349
Do you want me to get the door for you?

500
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:39,892
No.

501
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,520
I'm not leaving yet.
I'm waiting for someone.

502
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:43,896
Oh, okay.

503
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,409
I'm also waiting for someone.

504
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,207
An advantage of revolving doors is that

505
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,002
it allows people access to the building
while completely blocking off

506
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:08,629
the flow of air
between the outside and the inside.

507
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,007
It's beneficial for both cooling
and thermal insulation.

508
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:13,760
Right.

509
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,261
I see.

510
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,431
But it's slower in handling traffic
than the average door,

511
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,683
and children and the elderly
might get caught.

512
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,019
Also, it's difficult
to use for wheelchair users.

513
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,772
There's one advantage
but three disadvantages.

514
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:29,358
Maybe we can get rid of it
if we can persuade the landlord.

515
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,281
Well…

516
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,829
What if you think of it
as dancing the waltz?

517
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,458
-What?
-It's easy to go through it

518
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,210
if you get into a rhythm.

519
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,841
One, two, three.

520
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,010
One, two, three.

521
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,471
One, two, three.

522
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,306
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

523
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,350
One, two, three.

524
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:05,061
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

525
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:07,188
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

526
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,190
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

527
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,234
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

528
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,653
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

529
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,571
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

530
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,281
Yes, just like that.

531
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,699
That's right.

532
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,785
Let's do it together when we head out.

533
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,913
Excuse me, I have to make a phone call.

534
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:32,755
Hello?

535
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,298
Hello?

536
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,763
You're an attorney?

537
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,432
Hi, I'm Lee Jun-ho
from the litigation team.

538
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:46,686
I'm the one accompanying you
to the hospital.

539
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:48,771
I see.

540
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,648
I'm Woo Young-woo.

541
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,402
Right.

542
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,406
Attorney Woo Young-woo.

543
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,699
Attorney Woo Young-woo.

544
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,368
Your name is quite interesting.

545
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,120
It's still Woo Young-woo backward.

546
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,418
You're not supposed to
say things like that at work.

547
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,044
Is that so?

548
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,797
Then should we take it outside?

549
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,472
One, two, three.

550
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,516
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

551
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,935
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

552
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,729
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

553
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,480
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

554
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,149
One, two, three.

555
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:34,859
One, two, three. You ready?

556
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,652
-One, two, three.
-Two, three.

557
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,029
-One, two, three.
-Three.

558
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,780
-One, two. Now.
-Three.

559
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:40,823
One, two.

560
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,819
One, two, three.

561
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:20,780
Good job.

562
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,741
One, two, three. One.

563
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,088
This white thing right here is blood.

564
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:41,008
You see how blood is pooled
under the dura mater of the brain?

565
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,678
So this is called a subdural hematoma.

566
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:48,140
A subdural hematoma
is usually caused by external injuries.

567
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:52,061
It's the most severe
out of all traumatic brain illnesses.

568
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:55,648
There's a mortality rate of over
60 percent and even if it's treated,

569
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,650
there are usually a lot of aftereffects.

570
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,485
But there's no fracture.

571
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,112
Maybe he has a strong skull.

572
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,698
We see cases like this from time to time.

573
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:07,702
Is there any chance that it might
not have been caused by the assault?

574
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,370
That's unlikely.

575
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:12,206
He was hit on the head with an iron.

576
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:16,627
And the patient didn't normally have
high blood pressure or anything.

577
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,050
There they are.

578
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,239
Ms. Choi Yeong-ran.

579
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,283
-Hello.
-You're here.

580
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,286
My husband's asleep,
so let's talk outside.

581
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,413
What?

582
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:53,998
Who's here?

583
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,291
He's up.

584
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,625
Come here.

585
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:59,545
Honey, do you recognize this young lady?

586
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,130
Who is she?

587
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:05,634
You know, the little kid
from House 201 a long time ago.

588
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,386
Gosh, she was cute.

589
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:11,515
Her dad graduated from SNU law school
and was really smart.

590
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,936
SNU Law School House 201.
That bastard, right?

591
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:18,731
With the excuse of leaving his kid,

592
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:21,567
he always sneaked into our house
whenever I wasn't home.

593
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:25,654
Look here, that bastard sneaked into
our house whenever I wasn't home.

594
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:29,075
-What kind of nonsense are you saying?
-Why is that jerk's daughter here?

595
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:32,453
You want to see me die of anger that bad?

596
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,413
-Sir, calm down.
-What?

597
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,707
You better not show up
in front of me again.

598
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:37,917
You bastard!

599
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,214
You're going to die after spitting
your damn nonsense like that!

600
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,508
Damn it. I'm a sick person!

601
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:48,302
Go outside. Wait outside for a moment.

602
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,596
-What's wrong with you?
-Attorney Woo, let's go.

603
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,723
Gosh.

604
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,439
I'm sorry.

605
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:03,401
My husband is suspicious of everything.

606
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:07,738
He's usually fine, but he goes nuts
like that once in a while.

607
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:11,700
Goodness, this is embarrassing.

608
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,244
Right.

609
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,122
Let's get back to our discussion.

610
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,499
You told the police

611
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:22,253
that you wanted to kill your husband.

612
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,212
Yes.

613
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:26,215
I should have killed him
when I had the chance.

614
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,592
Then I wouldn't have
had to live with that mess.

615
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,094
So…

616
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,847
was the statement true?

617
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,182
That's how I feel right now.

618
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,978
How you feel right now is not important.
How you felt when it happened is.

619
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,898
Gosh, I don't know.

620
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:47,236
Why does it matter what I thought?

621
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,864
If you wanted to kill him,
it would be attempted murder.

622
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,866
If you wanted to hurt him,
it would be inflicting bodily injury.

623
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,909
If you wanted to hit him, it would be
an injury resulting from violence.

624
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:56,579
If it was just a mistake,
it would be bodily injury by negligence.

625
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:59,915
The law takes intention very seriously.

626
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,836
How you felt changes your charge.

627
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,885
When I see my husband acting like that,

628
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:16,182
I think I might've wanted to
kill him, to be honest.

629
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,809
Maybe it's because you're having
a rough time right now.

630
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,734
It's hard to fathom how someone feels.

631
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,988
I don't think I would close the curtains

632
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:34,617
so the light doesn't disturb their sleep
if I wanted to kill that person.

633
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,828
And I wouldn't mind
if they woke up from the sound.

634
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,247
Isn't that…

635
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,709
what you do for people you love,

636
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:47,338
not for people you want to murder?

637
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,726
The direction of the trial…

638
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:03,687
Yes, come in.

639
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,986
Come in and sit down.

640
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,115
So Jun-ho went to the hospital with you?

641
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,367
How's the victim?

642
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,745
Not good. I think I have to get
the letter of non-punishment next time

643
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:21,413
because he caused a scene today.

644
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,916
Gosh, his temper is no joke.

645
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:26,377
He cursed the second
he laid eyes on Attorney Woo.

646
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,296
I could relate to the old woman.
No wonder she hit him.

647
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,173
Cursed? Why?

648
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:34,260
He thinks my father
and the defendant had an affair.

649
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,178
Your father and the defendant?

650
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:38,889
What did he say to you?

651
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:45,229
"You're going to die after spitting
your damn nonsense like that!"

652
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:54,738
Okay, so I've been thinking…

653
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,199
I've been thinking…

654
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,492
What was I going to say?

655
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:03,163
Right, let's request
a jury trial for this case.

656
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:06,125
If you only look at the evidence,
it's clearly attempted murder.

657
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:08,085
It doesn't make sense
that she didn't want to kill him

658
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:10,004
after hitting him with an iron.

659
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,047
We'll lose if this becomes
a battle of evidence.

660
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,216
We have to show
that she's in a pitiful situation.

661
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,594
Which is when a jury trial comes in handy.

662
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,679
Because we can appeal
to the jury's hearts.

663
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:22,850
Then how about if I help
Attorney Woo with the trial?

664
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:26,103
Knowing how to talk
is crucial in winning over the jury.

665
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:28,564
And I've passed
the news anchor exam in the past.

666
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:32,693
I came in first place in the speech
competition for rookie attorneys.

667
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:36,530
Speaking clearly like a news anchor
could actually have an adverse effect.

668
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:40,075
We need persuasive speaking
to approach the jury in a soft manner.

669
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,624
What do you think, Attorney Woo?

670
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,292
If you can't speak eloquently,

671
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,085
you'll need to get help.

672
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:51,712
Well…

673
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:55,466
Isn't showing the defendant's
pitiful situation the key point?

674
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:58,093
There's nothing more pitiful
than a disability.

675
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,512
And I have autism spectrum disorder.

676
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:10,481
Then try to handle it
by yourself to the end.

677
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,318
You're going to court
as a Hanbada attorney,

678
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:17,237
so make sure you practice speaking
to avoid getting humiliated.

679
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,656
Yes, sir.

680
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,199
So, now we…

681
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:29,625
What is Woo Young-woo supposed to be?
Is she really a disabled person?

682
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,837
What if she's just pranking us
by acting like she's dumb?

683
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,924
Do you know what her
nickname was in law school?

684
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:38,592
Kayak? Deed?

685
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:39,885
We called her FWA.

686
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:43,263
Short for "First place
is Woo Young-woo Anyway."

687
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,475
It hurts whenever I look at her.

688
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:49,186
I helped her out because I felt bad
for her clumsy actions.

689
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:52,106
But in the end, I always fell behind
while she got first place.

690
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,359
Whether at school or here, it's the same.

691
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:59,113
Then don't help her. Why would you
help someone who's stronger?

692
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:02,783
One, two, three.

693
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:06,995
One, two, three.

694
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,000
How can I not help her
when she's doing that?

695
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:13,669
Then go help her.

696
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,763
One, two, three.

697
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:54,001
Come out.

698
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,383
If the revolving door is difficult,
just use the other door.

699
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:04,428
-Well, I--
-Are you stupid?

700
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,680
Are you an idiot?

701
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:09,892
Goodness.

702
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,026
My name is Young-woo,
as in "Flower" and "Luck".

703
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,987
It means a lucky charm
as pretty as flowers.

704
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:25,866
But perhaps Young-woo
as in "Clever" and "Foolish"

705
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,367
would've been a better fit.

706
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:33,290
Woo Young-woo, who remembers
every single book she's read since birth

707
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:35,959
but can't even go through
a revolving door.

708
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:41,340
Clever and foolish Woo Young-woo.

709
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:12,037
Give me 100,000 won, boss
Give me 100,000 won

710
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,998
Give me 100,000 won, boss
Give me 100,000 won

711
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,041
Give me 100,000 won

712
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:18,210
-Give me 100,000 won, boss
-I don't have any.

713
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:20,671
Give me 100,000 won, boss
Give me 100,000 won

714
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:23,131
-I told you not to come.
-Give me 100,000 won, boss

715
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:25,133
-I said I don't have 100,000 won.
-Give me…

716
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,843
Go away, stop.

717
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,011
I said stop.

718
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,267
-Give me 100,000 won
-I said stop.

719
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:38,772
-Stop cleaning!
-No! I'm going to!

720
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:39,856
-Why are you…
-I want to!

721
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,068
-No!
-You…

722
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:52,077
Woo to the Young to the Woo

723
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,537
Dong to the Geu to the Ra-mi

724
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,965
You didn't have dinner, right?
Woo Young-woo seaweed-sushi as usual?

725
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:06,842
Yes, Woo Young-woo seaweed-sushi as usual.

726
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,719
Hey, how was your first day at work?

727
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,095
It was tiring.

728
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:13,849
My goodness, our Young-woo
is finally getting a taste of society.

729
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:14,975
I'm proud of you.

730
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,893
Do you know the trial by jury?

731
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:17,936
Sure.

732
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,689
It's a trial that
the public participates in, right?

733
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:23,191
I have to present my case
before the judge and jury.

734
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:27,321
But since I'm not good at speaking,
could you help me practice?

735
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:30,198
Of course. Do I start now?
How should I help?

736
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,116
Okay, start.

737
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,620
-What?
-Gosh.

738
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:38,498
Do you really think
she will be of actual help?

739
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,459
She's probably never been to court.

740
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:43,170
What do you mean?

741
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:46,465
Who goes to court in person these days?
It's all in the movies.

742
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:48,508
Hey, have you seen Innocent Witness?

743
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,470
"Attorneys are people too!"

744
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:53,513
-I haven't seen it.
-Okay. What about The Attorney?

745
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:58,685
"Nation? What is this nation
you speak of? Self-harm?"

746
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,063
-I haven't seen that either.
-"You think you're a patriot?"

747
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:04,441
"Not at all, you're just
a subordinate of the state."

748
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:07,736
"Speak the truth.
That is real patriotism!"

749
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:09,780
"Shut up, you commie bastard!"

750
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,119
Wow.

751
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,082
Sorry, boss. I was too into it.

752
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:23,752
Hey, trials are no big deal.

753
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:24,753
You got this.

754
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:27,255
An attorney only has to be good at this.

755
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,382
Repeat after me.

756
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:30,634
Objection!

757
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,220
Objection.

758
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,640
No, you have to put your heart
and soul into it more. Again.

759
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:38,350
Objection!

760
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:41,520
Objection!

761
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:44,523
That was better. Good.

762
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:47,317
But you should work
on your basic vocalization.

763
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:48,318
Repeat after me.

764
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,076
Woo Young-woo.

765
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,161
Focus.

766
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,125
Squeeze your butthole.
Are you squeezing? All right.

767
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:07,379
Objection!

768
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:09,047
-Objection!
-Objection!

769
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:11,299
-Objection!
-Objection!

770
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:12,551
Objection!

771
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,220
-Good.
-Okay.

772
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:16,179
Great.

773
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,880
COURT

774
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:58,388
All rise.

775
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:08,982
Please be seated.

776
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,652
ATTORNEYS

777
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:18,116
Is Prosecutor Choi Hyeon-uk present?

778
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:19,826
Yes.

779
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,704
Is Attorney Jung Myeong-seok present?

780
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:24,915
Yes.

781
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:29,294
Is Attorney Woo Young-woo present?

782
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:35,509
PROSECUTOR

783
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,767
Is Attorney Woo young-woo present?

784
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,478
Attorney Woo, you have to answer.

785
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,357
JURY

786
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,067
-What's going on?
-What's happening?

787
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,235
Attorney Woo Young-woo?

788
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:57,614
Yes.

789
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:04,871
Yes.

790
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:08,041
My apologies.
Attorney Woo Young-woo is present.

791
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:09,960
Yes, all right.

792
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:14,673
Okay, now we will start
the trial of case number 2022,

793
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:17,968
criminal settlement trial 1017, in which
the defendant, Choi Yeong-ran,

794
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:19,636
is charged with attempted murder.

795
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,973
Prosecutor, you may give
your opening statement.

796
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:27,435
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

797
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:31,147
Therefore, we hereby charge
the defendant with attempted murder

798
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,817
based on Article 250 Paragraph 1

799
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,819
and Article 254 of the Criminal Act.

800
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:42,492
Counselor.

801
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:44,578
You may give your opening statement.

802
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:55,672
Counselor, what's going on?
Are you not going to give your statement?

803
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:56,590
Right.

804
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,342
What's happening?

805
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:04,055
What are you doing? Get up.

806
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,547
Before I begin the opening statement,

807
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:40,133
I ask for your understanding.

808
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,344
I…

809
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:47,265
have autism spectrum disorder.

810
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:50,060
So for you,

811
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:54,105
my speech and actions
might seem inarticulate and awkward.

812
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,401
But I love the law,

813
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,613
and my respect toward the defendant

814
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:04,574
is no different from any other attorney.

815
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:11,206
As an attorney,

816
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:14,960
I will do my very best…

817
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:22,133
to help the defendant shed light
on the truth of this incident.

818
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:36,690
Keep silent, please.

819
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:45,156
You love the law?

820
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:48,994
Well, that's nice.

821
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:59,004
"I wanted to kill my husband because he
kept being suspicious and spoke rudely."

822
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:02,674
This is the statement you gave
to the police right after the incident.

823
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:03,758
Do you recall?

824
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:07,929
-That…
-Please answer, yes or no.

825
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:13,685
Yes.

826
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:16,146
So why are you saying something else now?

827
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:19,149
Because back then,
the police were right in front of me.

828
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:23,611
I was nervous, so I just said that.

829
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:25,905
But I never intended on killing him.

830
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:29,576
You did not intend on killing him.
Should we take a look at the case records?

831
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:32,078
"If you speak like that again,
we're going to die together."

832
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,789
"Let's just die today.
You die, then I die."

833
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,876
These are what you said to the victim
at the time of the incident.

834
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:39,002
Do you recall?

835
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:43,923
-Yes.
-For someone who did not intend to kill,

836
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,884
don't you think you used
the word "die" too much?

837
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:47,969
Objection!

838
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:52,724
Leading question.

839
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:54,601
Sustained.

840
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,355
Take a seat, Counselor.

841
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:11,868
This is the iron the defendant used
to hit the victim.

842
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:13,828
Defendant.

843
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:16,289
Where did you hit
your husband with this iron?

844
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:19,084
His head.

845
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:20,627
His head?

846
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:22,253
Defendant.

847
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:25,006
Are you sure you didn't have
the intention to kill him?

848
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,717
Didn't you want him to die?

849
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:29,803
Objection.

850
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,805
Overruled.

851
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:33,348
Defendant.

852
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:36,392
Answer the prosecution's question.

853
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:41,189
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

854
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:44,984
I live for my husband,

855
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:49,030
and I felt bitter
that he didn't acknowledge that.

856
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:50,490
I'm sorry.

857
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:53,201
Please, spare me. I'm sorry.

858
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:56,746
Please, spare me. I'm sorry.

859
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:04,295
Prosecutor Choi, I thought
you were interrogating a gang member.

860
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:07,090
Aren't you a bit too harsh
to an elderly woman?

861
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:09,592
I had planned on being soft.

862
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:12,637
Can't you tell by how I didn't even apply
for an arrest warrant?

863
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,514
You're the ones who came on strong.

864
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,724
What do you mean we came on strong?

865
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:20,478
I have to go all in since you wanted
to determine whether she is guilty or not.

866
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:23,481
I can't be treated as the prosecutor who
couldn't even make an indictment stick.

867
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,489
The prosecutor is determined
to come at us.

868
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:33,741
We've got a problem.

869
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,997
How about if we call
Mr. Park Gyu-sik to court?

870
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,916
Let's get him to say that
he doesn't want her to be punished.

871
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,295
Even when we submitted a letter
of non-punishment saying the same thing?

872
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:48,131
Did Mr. Park write
the letter of non-punishment himself?

873
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:51,759
No, he just signed the form I provided.

874
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:53,303
No.

875
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:58,183
Mr. Park pleading himself is going to be
more effective than a mere letter.

876
00:57:58,266 --> 00:57:59,434
Especially to the jury.

877
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:01,811
But will he testify well?

878
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:05,398
He has a horrible temper and he has
ill feelings toward Attorney Woo.

879
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:08,443
I'll be the one to question Mr. Park then.

880
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:10,904
You should write up
the draft for the interrogation.

881
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:13,948
Yes, sir.

882
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,297
ATTORNEYS

883
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:38,598
"I pledge this."

884
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:40,683
"I solemnly swear

885
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,102
to tell the truth,

886
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:48,316
the whole truth,

887
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,777
and nothing but the truth

888
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:52,946
and agree to receive punishment

889
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:56,741
in accordance with perjury
should there be any falsehood."

890
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:03,122
Attorney Woo, you go.

891
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,167
What?

892
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:09,379
"I could relate to the old woman.
No wonder she hit him."

893
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:12,215
This is what Jun-ho said
after seeing Mr. Park curse at you.

894
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,676
Counselor, you may question the witness.

895
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:18,680
Attorney Woo, you go
and get him to start cursing.

896
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:20,557
Go get cursed at.

897
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:22,725
Right.

898
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:24,644
Okay.

899
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,938
Counselor, are you not going to
start the questioning?

900
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:27,981
We are.

901
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:39,033
WITNESS

902
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:54,757
Hello.

903
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:58,720
I'm Choi Yeong-ran's attorney,
Woo Young-woo.

904
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:00,680
Hey!

905
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:02,849
You…

906
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:06,936
Did I or did I not tell you
to stay out of my sight?

907
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:09,939
-Goodness.
-What's wrong with him?

908
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:12,442
All of you are in cahoots.

909
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:17,405
You all want to
see me die of anger, right?

910
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:18,656
Witness.

911
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:22,493
Did you tell me to come here
just to show me this?

912
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:25,163
What's all this nonsense?

913
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:26,998
Stop.

914
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,209
Witness, what are you doing?

915
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,336
Damn it!

916
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:34,589
You're going to die after spitting

917
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:39,469
your damn nonsense like that, you bastard!

918
01:00:40,678 --> 01:00:42,263
Can he just hit her like that?

919
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,182
Goodness.

920
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:46,726
You damn old man!

921
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:48,144
Just stop it!

922
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:51,230
-You're all in cahoots!
-We're going to take a ten-minute recess.

923
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,650
-Are you even human?
-You're all in this together.

924
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:55,526
Are you human, you punk?

925
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:59,906
-Stop it!
-Let go of me, you punk!

926
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,452
As you all saw,

927
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:07,789
Mr. Park is not a husband
who's easy to live with.

928
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:13,836
He's overly suspicious of his wife
and uses severely abusive language.

929
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:17,090
Despite this, the defendant,
Choi Yeong-ran,

930
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:19,300
lived with him her whole life

931
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:21,594
and did not object to
taking care of him in his dementia.

932
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:22,720
The defendant might be a wife

933
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:26,391
who impulsively hit her husband
because she lost her temper.

934
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:31,104
But she is not a wife who failed
in an attempt to murder her husband.

935
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:35,233
To the defendant who acknowledges her
wrongdoings and feels regret…

936
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:49,956
Your Honor, the victim, Mr. Park, died
while being transferred to the hospital--

937
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:50,998
What?

938
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:52,875
What did you just say?

939
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,044
Who died?

940
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:58,798
My husband died?

941
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:01,551
Ma'am.

942
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:05,805
We would like to change the charge
from attempted murder to murder.

943
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:07,765
Please allow for the change of indictment.

944
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:10,935
-What just happened?
-How could this happen?

945
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:12,603
Seriously, how could this happen?

946
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:39,172
If

947
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:42,133
I wasn't the one to question him,

948
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:47,096
and if Mr. Park Gyu-sik
didn't get so mad like that…

949
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:50,433
No.

950
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:55,521
If I didn't take on this case at all,

951
01:02:57,273 --> 01:03:00,234
would Mr. Park Gyu-sik
still be alive right now?

952
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:18,544
My first words…

953
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:24,342
My first words

954
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,637
in front of people

955
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:30,181
were "inflicting bodily injury."

956
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:34,060
And the first person
who said I would become an attorney

957
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:36,604
was you, Ms. Choi Yeong-ran.

958
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:38,731
I was surprised.

959
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:41,484
That my first-ever case

960
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:45,613
was to change your charge
to the crime of inflicting bodily injury.

961
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:50,117
What do you mean?

962
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:53,871
It was my first time doing everything.

963
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:58,042
So I wanted to be good at doing it.

964
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:00,294
Because I wanted to be good,

965
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:02,880
I was greedy.

966
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:07,093
I'm sorry I caused…

967
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,388
Mr. Park Gyu-sik to die.

968
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:17,478
Why is that your fault?

969
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:24,193
It was my husband's fault
for cursing at the little neighbor kid

970
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:28,865
that he saw for the first time
in 20 years instead of greeting her.

971
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:36,038
And it's my fault for swinging
the iron at him without knowing his time…

972
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:42,169
was almost up.

973
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:48,551
He always complained
about his head hurting.

974
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:53,431
I was too hard on him.

975
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:56,183
I…

976
01:04:58,352 --> 01:04:59,353
Goodness.

977
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:02,607
My goodness.

978
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:07,320
My goodness.

979
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:11,616
My goodness.

980
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,411
My goodness.

981
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:18,372
My old man.

982
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:21,250
My old man.

983
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:33,554
TRIAL BY JURY
A PUBLIC INTEREST CASE

984
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:35,848
ASSAULT WITH IRON,
CHARGED ON JULY 20

985
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,225
LIVING OFF HUSBAND'S PENSION
VILLA UNDER HUSBAND'S NAME

986
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:48,527
Yes.

987
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:57,036
I brought Mr. Park Gyu-sik's
autopsy report.

988
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:02,959
The cause of death
is brain hemorrhage as we expected.

989
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:05,586
There was a recurrence of the subdural
hematoma that he got surgery for.

990
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:26,482
That iron…

991
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,402
resembles something.

992
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:33,364
-The thing in Moby-Dick--
-The sperm whale?

993
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:35,533
Yes, the sperm whale.

994
01:06:37,201 --> 01:06:40,121
Gosh, she really beat a person
with that scary-looking thing.

995
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:42,999
I guess he's lucky
not to have died on the spot.

996
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:50,631
What's the matter?

997
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:55,928
There are a lot of things
that you can't do at work.

998
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:58,097
Repeating after others
and saying weird things.

999
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,307
Kayak, deed, rotator, noon, racecar.

1000
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:01,851
And being blunt.

1001
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,687
Is that so?

1002
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:06,731
I didn't know.

1003
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:07,815
Especially,

1004
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:10,484
talking about whales.

1005
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:12,319
Unless absolutely necessary.

1006
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:15,489
But,

1007
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:18,284
if it's just you and me,

1008
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:22,079
wouldn't it be okay?

1009
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:24,206
What?

1010
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:29,754
If it's just you and me,
just the two of us,

1011
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:31,672
we can talk about whales?

1012
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:34,091
Yes, of course.

1013
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:15,091
Do you think it seemed that way
to Mr. Park's doctor?

1014
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:17,802
Do you think he might've missed
the fact that whales don't lay eggs

1015
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:20,346
because the iron looked
as strong as a sperm whale?

1016
01:08:20,971 --> 01:08:21,972
What?

1017
01:08:22,723 --> 01:08:24,308
You can't only look at
criminal law with this case.

1018
01:08:24,391 --> 01:08:26,685
You have to look at civil law to solve it.

1019
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:29,647
We can't focus only on the iron.

1020
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:30,898
PARK GYU-SIK, 81
MILD DEMENTIA PATIENT

1021
01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:34,652
He always complained
about his head hurting.

1022
01:08:39,156 --> 01:08:40,199
The…

1023
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:41,325
The police statement!

1024
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,996
Line 7 of page 24.

1025
01:08:48,415 --> 01:08:51,293
"A package arrived when I was laying down
on the couch because of a headache."

1026
01:08:54,713 --> 01:08:57,675
He had a headache from the beginning.
Even before he was hit with the iron.

1027
01:08:57,758 --> 01:08:58,801
It might be

1028
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:02,054
that the brain hemorrhage
isn't because of the iron.

1029
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:08,769
WITNESS

1030
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:11,480
Counselor, you may question the witness.

1031
01:09:17,027 --> 01:09:18,529
With subdural hematoma,

1032
01:09:18,612 --> 01:09:21,240
there's subdural hemorrhage
caused by external injury

1033
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:24,869
and spontaneous subdural bleeding
caused by illnesses.

1034
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:27,246
-Is this correct?
-Yes.

1035
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:31,041
Why did you conclude that Mr. Park's brain
hemorrhage was due to external injury?

1036
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:33,836
Because he was hit with an iron.

1037
01:09:33,919 --> 01:09:36,338
I heard he even fainted from the hit.

1038
01:09:36,922 --> 01:09:39,133
Were there any fractures
on Mr. Park's skull?

1039
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:40,718
No, there weren't.

1040
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:44,555
Were there any wounds
or bruises on his head from the iron?

1041
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:46,140
No, there weren't.

1042
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:48,517
He said he blocked it like this.

1043
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:51,812
So were there wounds on his arms?

1044
01:09:52,396 --> 01:09:54,899
Yes, but there was nothing too severe.

1045
01:09:55,482 --> 01:09:59,486
Then why did you assume
that the iron was that threatening?

1046
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:02,698
It didn't cause fractures,
severe wounds, or bruises.

1047
01:10:03,574 --> 01:10:04,658
I mean,

1048
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:07,411
I'm not a detective.

1049
01:10:07,494 --> 01:10:10,706
They said he was hit with an iron
and that he fainted because of it,

1050
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:13,167
so I diagnosed him based on that.

1051
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:17,504
Do I have to investigate whether or not
it was really caused by the iron?

1052
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:22,092
If the defendant might end up in prison
due to your diagnosis, shouldn't you?

1053
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:24,511
Objection.

1054
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:26,680
Argumentative.

1055
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:27,973
Sustained.

1056
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:30,434
Counselor, only question the witness.

1057
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:32,353
"Counselor, only question the witness."

1058
01:10:32,436 --> 01:10:33,771
Yes. Pardon?

1059
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:57,086
Mr. Park was 81 years old.
Are you aware of this, Witness?

1060
01:10:58,170 --> 01:10:59,004
Yes.

1061
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:02,216
And Mr. Park had dementia.
Are you aware of this?

1062
01:11:02,299 --> 01:11:03,467
Yes.

1063
01:11:04,051 --> 01:11:08,138
Severe headaches are typical early signs
of cerebral hematoma. Are you aware?

1064
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:09,056
Yes.

1065
01:11:09,139 --> 01:11:10,891
On the day of the incident,
Mr. Park was experiencing

1066
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:12,351
-a severe headache
-Gosh, my head.

1067
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:15,396
-even before he was hit with the iron.
-It feels like it's about to split open.

1068
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:17,147
Are you aware of this?

1069
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,525
What?

1070
01:11:20,734 --> 01:11:24,905
"A package arrived when I was laying down
on the couch because of a headache."

1071
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:27,574
This is the statement Mr. Park
gave during the police investigation.

1072
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:31,495
I wasn't…

1073
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,081
aware of that.

1074
01:11:35,499 --> 01:11:39,086
A spontaneous subdural hematoma
is typically seen in the elderly

1075
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:42,089
and is a common occurrence for patients
with dementia. Is that correct?

1076
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,675
Yes.

1077
01:11:44,758 --> 01:11:47,636
The old age of 81
and medical history of dementia.

1078
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,472
Despite the severe headache he complained
about right before the incident,

1079
01:11:51,348 --> 01:11:52,808
are you still certain

1080
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:56,353
that Mr. Park suffered from a subdural
hematoma caused by external injury?

1081
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:59,565
Is there any possibility that
it was a spontaneous subdural hematoma?

1082
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:10,993
A spontaneous subdural hematoma…

1083
01:12:25,257 --> 01:12:26,467
would've been possible.

1084
01:12:31,555 --> 01:12:34,183
Based on Mr. Park's medical record
and autopsy report,

1085
01:12:34,266 --> 01:12:36,643
we submit a diagnosis
that states his illness

1086
01:12:36,727 --> 01:12:39,188
and cause of death
as a spontaneous subdural hematoma,

1087
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:42,483
written by three medical specialists
as further evidence.

1088
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:45,069
Your Honor,

1089
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:47,780
as the witness testified,
Mr. Park's brain hemorrhage

1090
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:50,240
did not occur from being hit
by the defendant,

1091
01:12:50,324 --> 01:12:53,160
but it's possible that it was caused
by a pre-existing illness.

1092
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:55,954
Therefore, there's no causal relationship

1093
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:59,166
between the defendant's infliction
of injuries and the victim's death.

1094
01:12:59,249 --> 01:13:03,170
Please allow the defendant to be tried
for the crime of inflicting bodily injury.

1095
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:11,637
What do you think?

1096
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:14,306
Are you inclined
to apply for a change of indictment?

1097
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:44,795
Yes.

1098
01:13:45,712 --> 01:13:46,713
Attorney Woo.

1099
01:13:50,509 --> 01:13:51,718
The ruling just came out.

1100
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:53,595
Right.

1101
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:57,099
Not guilty of murder and probation
for the crime of inflicting bodily injury.

1102
01:13:57,182 --> 01:13:58,016
Congratulations.

1103
01:13:58,976 --> 01:13:59,935
I see.

1104
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:01,562
Thank you.

1105
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:08,527
Ms. Choi Yeong-ran wanted to see you
so I brought her here.

1106
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:09,695
Hang on.

1107
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:11,572
Ms. Choi, come in.

1108
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:24,877
Attorney Woo.

1109
01:14:26,044 --> 01:14:27,087
Thank you.

1110
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:30,883
Thank you.

1111
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:50,379
INSTANT GIMBAP

1112
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:59,263
I'm sorry. We're actually closed for…

1113
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:08,146
Gwang-ho.

1114
01:16:09,314 --> 01:16:10,524
It's been a while.

1115
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:36,800
There was an incident at the wedding.

1116
01:16:36,883 --> 01:16:40,971
The chairman's daughter
was wearing a strapless wedding dress,

1117
01:16:41,054 --> 01:16:43,807
but when the bride and groom
were walking down the aisle,

1118
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:45,475
the dress slipped down.

1119
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:46,560
What is that?

1120
01:16:46,643 --> 01:16:47,936
Dear Lord.

1121
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,313
Are you determined
to humiliate your father?

1122
01:16:49,396 --> 01:16:51,773
-Do you love your husband?
-Pardon?

1123
