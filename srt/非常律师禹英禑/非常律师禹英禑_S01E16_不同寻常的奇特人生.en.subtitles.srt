ALL ABOUT CODING
A REINTERPRETATION OF CODING

2
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:58,993
COMPUTER SCIENCE BASICS

00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,164
GRAND PRIZE
THE 2020 CYBERSECURITY COMPETITION

4
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,714
You're up.

5
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,217
I made your favorite dish, gimbap.
Hurry and eat.

6
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,028
And for our next story.

7
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,073
The largest class-action lawsuit
in South Korean judicial history

8
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,324
is about to begin.

9
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,410
Users of the online shopping mall, Raon,

10
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,246
are seeking damages
for a personal data breach.

11
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,291
The number of co-litigators alone
is over 30 million,

12
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,710
and the amount being claimed
is close to three trillion won.

13
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,378
Taesan Law Firm,

14
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,714
to which Minister of Justice candidate
Tae Su-mi is affiliated,

15
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,341
filed a lawsuit with
the Seoul Central District Court

16
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,093
on behalf of Raon users.

17
00:02:57,176 --> 00:03:00,138
Meanwhile, Bae In-cheol,
the founder and CEO of Raon,

18
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,724
is still unconscious
after he ingested poison

19
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,893
during the trial with the KCC

20
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:08,187
over the amount of the penalty surcharge
for the personal data breach.

21
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:11,316
There are growing concerns that Raon,

22
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:15,278
the nation's largest e-commerce company,
will go bankrupt due to the large sum

23
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,572
of three trillion won
that is being claimed as damages.

24
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:23,286
Why are all the news reports
going in this direction?

25
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,955
Did Hanbada do something?

26
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,290
What's our PR team doing?

27
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,001
I'll pass your comments
along to the PR team.

28
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:34,631
It shouldn't seem like the powerful Taesan
is running poor Raon out of business.

29
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,966
That's what Hanbada
is going for right now.

30
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,386
That's why they keep bringing my name up
and stressing how Raon's CEO collapsed.

31
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,846
-Don't you agree?
-Yes.

32
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,642
Taesan usually works with companies,

33
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,561
and standing with the consumers
in this lawsuit

34
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,104
is actually a show of great courage.

35
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,983
We have to promote that
we're representing 30 million citizens

36
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,944
despite the risk
of looking like we're attacking

37
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,362
our existing clients as well.

38
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,155
Mom.

39
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,574
I have something to tell you.

40
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,826
-I'm working right now, so--
-I did it.

41
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:05,703
What?

42
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,622
I did it.

43
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,666
I hacked into Raon.

44
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,354
I'm glad you told me the truth.

45
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,233
But from now on, you can't tell anyone.

46
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,860
I'll take care of everything.

47
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,285
What are you going to do?

48
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,122
Will you go to the police with me?

49
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,334
Why do you keep bringing up the police?

50
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,671
Let's say that we do go.

51
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,424
What do you think will happen after that?

52
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,259
Do you have any idea

53
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,845
how scary and agonizing it is
to be punished by the law?

54
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,394
Mom, I'm already scared and in agony.

55
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,981
If getting punished
will make this situation any better,

56
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:16,941
I'll take it.

57
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,860
I did it.

58
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,697
I'm the reason Raon is ruined
and In-cheol is in that state.

59
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,990
Choi Sang-hyeon!

60
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,036
Do you not think about your mom?

61
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,080
Don't you know how much is
at stake for me right now?

62
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,583
My confirmation hearing
is right around the corner!

63
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,169
What…

64
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,379
does that have to do with this?

65
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,425
Are you afraid you might not
become Minister because of me?

66
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,468
Yes!

67
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:45,928
How could you do something like this

68
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,306
when you know how much effort
I've put into becoming Minister?

69
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,974
And now, of all times?

70
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,686
Did I ever expect a lot from you?

71
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,355
Did I ever tell you to get good grades?

72
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,899
All I ever wanted

73
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:02,320
was my son to grow up to be a good person!

74
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,404
What about you?

75
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,740
Have you only been good all your life?

76
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,617
You don't think I know?

77
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,786
-What?
-Woo Young-woo!

78
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,124
You don't think I know?

79
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:32,475
CASE 16
THOUGH UNUSUAL AND PECULIAR

80
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:56,207
Is there really no way
for you to come in a bit faster?

81
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,291
Right.

82
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:02,755
Then from now on,
I'll count "one, two, three" a bit--

83
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,799
Whatever. Did you self-reflect?

84
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,175
Sorry?

85
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,428
Did the three of you self-reflect
on what you did?

86
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,933
Yes, I did some deep self-reflection.

87
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,062
From now on, I'll be sure
to abide by the rules and procedures,

88
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,939
and not give my opinion as I please.

89
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,566
I knew a Hana University graduate
would know better.

90
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,693
That's right.

91
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:29,073
I'm not upset about rookies
giving their opinions, okay?

92
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,951
I'm really not that uptight.

93
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,786
But last time, you said,

94
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,371
"Don't say anything
you haven't been asked,

95
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,081
and don't do anything you haven't…"

96
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,503
-Hello, ma'am.
-Sit down, everyone.

97
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:43,838
Sit.

98
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,258
Let's not be like that, okay?

99
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,303
Sit.

100
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:55,057
I'll be joining the Raon lawsuit
going forward.

101
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,101
There's not much time left
until the first trial, right?

102
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:58,853
What's our strategy?

103
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:03,191
First, we plan to emphasize
the results of the lawsuit against the KCC

104
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,777
since it was clearly proven that

105
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,697
Raon not having the idle timeout set up
wasn't the direct cause

106
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,324
of the personal data breach.

107
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,283
All right.

108
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,702
Because we won the previous trial,

109
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:17,455
we can start this lawsuit
in our favor too.

110
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,251
As always, I'm glad we have you,
Attorney Jang.

111
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:26,672
To argue that the hack began
before the law was revised

112
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,299
is something you can only find

113
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,343
by looking really closely
at the details, right?

114
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,260
Nice work.

115
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,810
We always learn a lot from Attorney Jang.

116
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,313
Right.

117
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,856
How is Mr. Bae In-cheol doing?

118
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,609
He's still unconscious,

119
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,444
so it seems that
the board of directors at Raon

120
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:52,114
will be appointing Kim Chan-hong
as an independent CEO.

121
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,575
That way Mr. Kim can have the authority

122
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:59,455
to make decisions by himself
even in Mr. Bae's absence.

123
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,415
CEO KIM CHAN-HONG

124
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,543
Then according to the decision
of Raon's board of directors,

125
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,546
we will abolish the co-CEO system

126
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:10,424
and change it to an independent CEO system
with both Bae In-cheol and Kim Chan-hong.

127
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,344
Mr. Kim, would you like to say something?

128
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,608
After founding Raon with In-cheol, I mean…

129
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:32,405
Mr. Bae In-cheol and I

130
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,825
have always decided on matters together,

131
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,953
whether they were big or small.

132
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,749
But with Raon going through a crisis,
and with In-cheol being sick,

133
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,377
I've become an independent CEO

134
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,838
and am taking on
a much bigger responsibility.

135
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:53,050
Yes, it's true this is a lot of pressure.

136
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,637
But I will do my best to fulfill not only
my responsibilities but Mr. Bae's as well.

137
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,140
Members of the board of directors,

138
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:03,269
Raon will overcome this crisis
no matter what.

139
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,411
It keeps coming off.

140
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,087
-Attorney Jung.
-Hey.

141
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,131
You came to visit me?

142
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,841
Aren't you really busy right now?

143
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,093
We're sorry we couldn't visit sooner.

144
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,762
How are you feeling?

145
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,096
I'm fine.

146
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,016
The surgery went well,
and I'm slowly recovering.

147
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:46,937
Attorney Kwon, I'm sorry,
but could you pick up that comb for me?

148
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,566
Thanks.

149
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,779
I couldn't pick it up for hours,
so I haven't been able to comb my hair.

150
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:58,491
Were you alone here this whole time?
You don't have anyone taking care of you?

151
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,535
My mother was supposed to come
instead of the caregiver today,

152
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,205
but I told her to stay home
and get some rest.

153
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,415
My ex-wife is coming today.

154
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,835
Is that why you have that face mask on?

155
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,254
Yes. To look pretty.

156
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:18,719
You are pretty.

157
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,100
I mean…

158
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:25,643
You look dewy.

159
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:26,602
Right.

160
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,105
Really? Do I?

161
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,481
I see.

162
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,945
The two of you should also
start taking care of your health now.

163
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,030
If you count on your youth
and pull all-nighters

164
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,657
while skipping meals all the time,

165
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,827
you'll start getting sick
as soon as you turn 40.

166
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:47,832
I'm sure there are a lot of sick attorneys
in our firm besides me.

167
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,667
Actually, I heard Attorney Kim Ji-yong

168
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,836
has facial nerve paralysis
from all the stress.

169
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,003
What?

170
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,922
Attorney Shin Seung-jae was also sick.

171
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,591
He kept overworking
and came down with Meniere's disease.

172
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,051
Gosh.

173
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,517
Hello.

174
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,521
Then we will…

175
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,773
Yes, we should get going.

176
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:13,732
Yes, okay.

177
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:14,775
What?

178
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,277
Already? But you just got here.

179
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,695
We'll come back another time.

180
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,530
We'll leave you two alone.

181
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,846
You look well.

182
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,473
Really?

183
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,310
Do I look dewy?

184
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,279
Watch this.

185
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,156
What is it?

186
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,741
Soonpoong Clinic.

187
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,743
Soonpoong Clinic?

188
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,203
You used to like it.

189
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,706
I bought all of the episodes in HD.

190
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:14,502
Right. Thanks.
Now I'll have a reason to laugh.

191
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,219
Ji-su.

192
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,306
When I'm discharged…

193
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,975
do you want to go to Jeju Island?

194
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,608
I mean, there's this place
that sells great meat noodles.

195
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:38,984
We should go there together.

196
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:42,112
I'll buy you meat noodles.

197
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,115
When you were young and healthy,

198
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,243
you were crazy about work
and I always came second.

199
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,203
What's gotten into you

200
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,247
now that you're old and sick?

201
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,082
I'm sorry.

202
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,710
But, still…

203
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,505
I made quite a lot of money.

204
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,675
Thanks to only focusing on work
until I got old and sick.

205
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,889
Then can you quit the firm?

206
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,517
What?

207
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,229
Once you're discharged and you return
to Hanbada, nothing will change.

208
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,024
The workload or how intense it is.

209
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,151
You can't do anything about that
on your own.

210
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:25,823
You should move to a firm where
you can have a good work-life balance.

211
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:27,825
Right.

212
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,412
Looks like you never once thought
about leaving the firm

213
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,747
even when you got this sick.

214
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,459
That's so you.

215
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,547
No, well…

216
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,757
I'll think about it from now on.

217
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,468
If I really think it's necessary…

218
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,641
I'll quit my job at Hanbada.

219
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,563
I'll change.

220
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,734
So be with me.

221
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,659
Please?

222
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,332
It's been a while, Attorney Kwon.

223
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,458
Yes.

224
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,668
So what is it that you wanted to say?

225
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,840
If I were Attorney Woo,

226
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,052
I would want to quit Hanbada right now.

227
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,430
Really?

228
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:32,348
Why?

229
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,934
The mentor who was nice to her
isn't at the firm because he's sick,

230
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,895
and the new senior attorney
that she's working with hates her.

231
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,607
She also recently broke up
with the guy she was dating at the firm.

232
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,901
"Dating at the firm"?

233
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,696
Attorney Woo was in a relationship?

234
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,406
Yes.

235
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,743
Gosh, I see.

236
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,828
Anyway…

237
00:15:55,829 --> 00:16:00,501
Now would be the right time
to make Attorney Woo quit Hanbada.

238
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:03,045
I came to tell you that.

239
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,715
So in the end,
you couldn't accomplish this yourself.

240
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,718
-Excuse me?
-Attorney Kwon.

241
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,889
You said you would make Attorney Woo
quit Hanbada.

242
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,642
Whether she quits or gets fired.

243
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,269
I think that was our deal, wasn't it?

244
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,063
You're right.

245
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,065
It's also true that
I wasn't able to accomplish it myself.

246
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:24,692
Are you giving up?

247
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,029
Yes.

248
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,156
I'm going to stop now.

249
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,283
Why?

250
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,410
From now on…

251
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,126
I think…

252
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,588
I'm going to try living like a fool.

253
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,024
Well…

254
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:09,153
I understand where you are coming from…

255
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,907
but I like you.

256
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,662
Because I like you…

257
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,708
Since I like you…

258
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,085
Since I like you…

259
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,808
Excuse me.

260
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,644
Attorney Woo.

261
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,440
Who are you?

262
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,566
And who are you?

263
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:48,692
I asked who you were!

264
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,030
You're Attorney Woo, right?

265
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,240
I have a message for you.

266
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,333
TAESAN LAW FIRM

267
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,086
Taesan Law Firm?

268
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,423
If you have a message for her,
you should send it to the firm.

269
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,717
What are you doing
coming to her house at this hour?

270
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:17,096
-Are you really a Taesan employee?
-Who are you to be butting in?

271
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,972
Are you her guardian or something?

272
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,057
I'm…

273
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:23,727
Well…

274
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:26,730
Deliver the message you came to tell me.

275
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,732
I will listen to it with Jun-ho.

276
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,405
Attorney Woo, would you like to work

277
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,450
at Taesan's US office in Boston?

278
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,538
Of course, Taesan will provide housing
for you and your father

279
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:46,083
as well as any necessary
educational and living expenses.

280
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,754
And your salary will be more than double
what you get at Hanbada right now.

281
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,298
Especially for you, Attorney Woo…

282
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,053
we will introduce you
to a professional counselor

283
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,889
and Taesan will pay
for the counseling fees as well.

284
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,268
A professional counselor?

285
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,396
I'm talking about a counselor
who specializes

286
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,814
in autism spectrum disorder.

287
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,649
Right.

288
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,067
Attorney Woo.

289
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:16,864
Boston is a city
with a variety of active communities

290
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,240
for those with autism.

291
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,576
You won't be lonely living there.

292
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,911
But why are you
making a job offer like this?

293
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:26,582
I've never seen someone recruit a person
by staking out in front of their house.

294
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,045
Is Attorney Tae Su-mi

295
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,423
the one who made the offer?

296
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,925
Yes, that's right.

297
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,512
Not Taesan's HR team, but Attorney Tae?

298
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,890
My business card is in the envelope.

299
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,309
Think about it and contact me anytime.

300
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,488
Jun-ho,

301
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,408
do you have something to say to me too?

302
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:02,868
What?

303
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,871
Right.

304
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,539
Yes, I…

305
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,588
I'll tell you some other time.

306
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,466
You must have a lot to think about.

307
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,509
You should get some rest.

308
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,763
Okay.

309
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,364
I'm home.

310
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,366
Hey, you're here.

311
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,784
Young-woo.

312
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,913
Can you come sit here for a second?

313
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,832
We need to talk.

314
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,509
So…

315
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,511
A few days ago,

316
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,265
Seon-young came by.

317
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:08,809
"Seon-young"?

318
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,602
Your CEO, Han Seon-young.

319
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,062
Right.

320
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,065
What?

321
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,818
Anyway, it looks like…

322
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:24,408
she's planning on revealing everything
to the press

323
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,035
right before Tae Su-mi's
confirmation hearing.

324
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,086
That you're the child…

325
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,089
Tae Su-mi had out of wedlock.

326
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,097
If that happens,

327
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,393
the world's attention
will not only be on Tae Su-mi

328
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,936
but also on you, Young-woo.

329
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:57,899
Then reporters will come to you
every day and bother you.

330
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,654
So Seon-young suggested that

331
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:08,368
we go to some resort in the countryside
and stay hidden until things die down.

332
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:14,249
Paid leave, basically.

333
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,558
Did you get this from Tae Su-mi?

334
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,727
When?

335
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:37,355
I got it from a Taesan employee just now.

336
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:45,447
I guess Tae Su-mi's offer for us
to go to the States is still valid.

337
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:51,203
You already knew about this?

338
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:01,213
I would hate to comply with
Tae Su-mi's wishes.

339
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,466
But right now,

340
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,553
that seems like the better option.

341
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,725
Rather than continuing to work here

342
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:18,396
while being the target of gossip
and being labeled as Tae Su-mi's daughter,

343
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:23,193
leaving for the States seems better.

344
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,119
What do you think, Young-woo?

345
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,459
I'm not sure.

346
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,631
So far, my life has had

347
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:48,468
nothing to do with Attorney Tae Su-mi.

348
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:53,098
I don't understand why

349
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,226
I have to hide all of a sudden

350
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,897
and go to the States.

351
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,816
You're right.

352
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,947
I'm sorry, Young-woo.

353
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:11,950
I'm…

354
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,289
sorry…

355
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,542
for everything.

356
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:30,969
Your Honor,

357
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:36,266
despite the defendant
being a large e-commerce company

358
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,351
that needs to manage the personal data
of more than 40 million users,

359
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,855
they had not established
an appropriate security system.

360
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:45,525
Not only were they imposed with
a 30 million won administrative fine

361
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,737
for not putting a limitation
on the maximum connection time…

362
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,738
Your Honor.

363
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,949
But their response after the leak
was also appalling.

364
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,660
According to Article 34 of the
Personal Information Protection Act,

365
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:56,995
a personal information controller

366
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,914
must notify data subjects
of the personal data breach

367
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,208
as soon as they become aware of it.

368
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:06,671
However, despite being aware
of the hack on January 19, 2022,

369
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:10,383
the defendant reported it to the police
a week later on January 26th.

370
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,553
And they notified users of the hack

371
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,889
through the Raon website

372
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,934
on February 20th,
a month after the incident.

373
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,728
The defendant's complacent response

374
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,315
is what prevented a quick resolution
and handling of the incident.

375
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:26,441
That's right!

376
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:28,526
-What's wrong with you?
-Goodness.

377
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,820
-It should've been notified earlier!
-How could you do that?

378
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,739
Of course, you have to compensate!

379
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,282
How are you going to compensate?

380
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:38,620
You may be seated in the audience seats,

381
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,497
but aren't you all co-plaintiffs?

382
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:45,252
As the litigants, please do not interrupt
the proceedings of the trial.

383
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,430
Come in.

384
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,399
Someone who claims to be
your younger brother wants to see you.

385
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,569
My younger brother?

386
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:12,529
Yes.

387
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:15,031
He said you would know
if I said he was your younger brother.

388
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,200
And that he can't tell me his name.

389
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,790
Should I tell him you're busy?

390
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:28,628
No.

391
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,548
Please send him in.

392
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,341
Okay.

393
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:55,780
Who are you?

394
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,324
Choi Sang-hyeon.

395
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:58,908
Tae Su-mi's son.

396
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:07,042
Why did you come to see me?

397
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,877
I want to come clean about what I did,

398
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,755
but I don't know how.

399
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,259
I hacked into Raon.

400
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,096
Because Chan-hong asked me to.

401
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:22,515
What?

402
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:31,816
I met Chan-hong
at a cybersecurity competition.

403
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,653
He was a judge
the year I won the grand prize.

404
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,115
We became close and met up often
even after the competition.

405
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,117
He showed me around Raon too.

406
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,661
And he introduced me to In-cheol too.

407
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:48,083
Then one day, Chan-hong asked me

408
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:52,420
if I could hack into Raon
and steal the users' personal data.

409
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,383
Are you saying Mr. Kim Chan-hong asked you

410
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,719
to hack into Raon?

411
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,263
The company where he's the CEO?

412
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:03,848
Why?

413
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,017
Because I want In-cheol
to come to his senses.

414
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,187
In-cheol? Why?

415
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,688
He's lost sight of where we started.

416
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:13,900
Raon is a company
created by two developers.

417
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:16,986
The developer's spirit
is the basis of this business.

418
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:21,408
In-cheol has forgotten about all that
and is just a businessman now.

419
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,577
He's only interested in making money
by selling things.

420
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:29,165
He has no interest at all in investing
in software development or security.

421
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,334
We'll use this opportunity

422
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:34,796
to properly remind him
of that developer's spirit.

423
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,589
How?

424
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:52,021
What if you hack into Raon
and steal the personal data of the users?

425
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,150
Then I'll try convincing In-cheol.

426
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:59,279
"I told you. We're being attacked
because we're not investing in security."

427
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,615
Isn't it too risky?

428
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,952
If word gets out about the hack,
the police will investigate.

429
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,079
I looked into it a lot.

430
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,874
A personal data breach is fine.

431
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,876
All we have to do
is pay a fine of 100 million won

432
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,962
and upload an apology statement
on our website.

433
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,465
All the other companies did that too.

434
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,677
Jeez, it's nothing.

435
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:27,682
So…

436
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:29,559
that's why I did it.

437
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,772
I left some clues to make it look like
it was done by North Korea,

438
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:37,317
and then I stole
the personal data of Raon users.

439
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,781
What did you do with the personal data?

440
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,949
I gave it to Chan-hong
because he asked for it.

441
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,075
All encrypted.

442
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:50,497
But he kept asking me to decrypt it.

443
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:52,791
Why?

444
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:53,792
I don't know.

445
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:57,378
He kept talking nonsense
about how he wanted to check

446
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,173
if it was really Raon users' data,
so I just kept it encrypted.

447
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,926
Just in case he sells it off somewhere.

448
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,135
I see.

449
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,724
You carried out the hack
according to your plan.

450
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,936
But why do you want to confess
all of a sudden?

451
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,064
Because In-cheol…

452
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,276
attempted suicide.

453
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,572
I didn't know he would take it that hard.

454
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:29,160
I only did it because Chan-hong said
it would end with just a small fine.

455
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,246
I wasn't trying to
make In-cheol end up like that

456
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:34,249
and ruin Raon.

457
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,337
Shouldn't you go to the police to confess?

458
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,465
Why did you come to me?

459
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,217
I told my mom.

460
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:47,512
But she got mad
and told me not to do anything.

461
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,932
I went to the police too,
but they got on the phone with my mom

462
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,309
and then wouldn't even listen to me.

463
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,395
My mom is powerful.

464
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,398
People do whatever she tells them to do.

465
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,442
That's why I came here.

466
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,360
Because I thought…

467
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,406
my big sister wouldn't do as Mom says.

468
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:10,994
"Big sister"?

469
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:14,330
Our dads are different
but we have the same mom.

470
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,374
So you're my big sister.

471
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,588
How did you know

472
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:25,049
that I was your big sister?

473
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,053
I heard the rumor…

474
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:34,142
that my mom had a child
before she married my dad.

475
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,228
I thought it was just a false rumor.

476
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,105
But for a while, she was acting weird.

477
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:43,276
She would watch something in her room
and get startled when I walked in.

478
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,529
So I hacked into her phone and computer.

479
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:51,034
And I saw that she looked up
a lot of stuff about you.

480
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,287
I also saw her texts with Grandma
talking about you.

481
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,372
That's how I knew.

482
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:08,468
How do you want me to help you?

483
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,603
I took a video of myself

484
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,647
confessing to the hack.

485
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,359
What if you use this
as evidence during the trial?

486
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,861
Then wouldn't the police
start investigating?

487
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,613
My mom wouldn't be able to stop it.

488
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,785
Mr. Kim Chan-hong is my client.

489
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,078
Therefore,

490
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,499
I cannot reveal the fact
that Mr. Kim had you hack

491
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,000
into his own company.

492
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:45,046
Because it's against
my client's interests.

493
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,339
What kind of person…

494
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,218
do you think Mom is?

495
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,097
-Sorry?
-People think…

496
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,601
that those who are born rich
don't get punished.

497
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:03,439
Whether it's drugs,
drunk driving, or assault.

498
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,652
Whatever they do, they get away with it.

499
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,863
But my mom was different.

500
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,909
If I did something wrong, she scolded me.

501
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,915
But now that something big like this
has happened,

502
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,792
she's…

503
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:25,586
just the same.

504
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,425
She's acting like those foul rich people…

505
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,511
you see on the news.

506
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:44,439
When are you returning to Hanbada,
Attorney Jung?

507
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,651
I'm not sure.

508
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,820
I might not return.

509
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:52,989
What?

510
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,866
You might not return?

511
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,910
I'm just thinking about it.

512
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,204
Why do you ask?

513
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,456
Right.

514
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:05,418
It's inconvenient to have to come
to the hospital whenever I have questions.

515
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,587
You could always call.

516
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,257
-Right.
-Seriously.

517
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:15,178
I can never tell if you're worried
about me or just being selfish.

518
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,473
So what is it you want to…

519
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,308
You're going to say,

520
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:25,271
"I can't tell you the details
because of attorney-client privilege."

521
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,856
Right?

522
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:27,940
Yes.

523
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,484
That's true.

524
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,818
Then…

525
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,571
be vague about it.

526
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:38,659
I found out about a criminal act
that my client has committed.

527
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:42,580
The other person involved in the crime
wants to confess,

528
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:45,083
but if I help him confess,

529
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:48,044
it's against the interests of the client.

530
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,045
I see.

531
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:54,550
Will you reveal the truth
and achieve social justice

532
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:58,054
or stay loyal to the client's interests?

533
00:34:58,554 --> 00:34:59,889
I understand.

534
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,892
It's a dilemma
that an attorney cannot avoid.

535
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:05,394
It's also something
you've always struggled with.

536
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:10,650
Remember the Ihwa ATM case
or the Mir Life case?

537
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:11,567
Yes.

538
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:16,447
I've worked at Hanbada for over 14 years

539
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:22,787
and have always put the interests
of the client ahead of social justice.

540
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:28,793
If someone calls me a "law technician"
and criticizes me,

541
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:31,129
there's not much I can say to refute that.

542
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,421
Because it's true.

543
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,468
But Attorney Woo is not Attorney Jung.

544
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,097
Right? You're a completely
different person from me.

545
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,057
So how could I give you advice?

546
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,476
I'm just

547
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,980
curious about what you decide to do.

548
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:52,817
Because you're…

549
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,616
not just any ordinary attorney.

550
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,628
My name is Choi Sang-hyeon.

551
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,631
I'm in my first year of high school.

552
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:21,095
I hacked into Raon starting
on the night of January 18, 2022,

553
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,472
up until the morning of the 19th,

554
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:27,435
and took 40,954,173 personal data records.

555
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:33,024
Because Raon's CEO, Kim Chan-hong,
asked me to do it.

556
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,698
I'd like to confess…

557
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,784
to this wrongdoing.

558
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:56,422
Tae Su-mi's son came to you

559
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:59,675
and asked you
to use this video as evidence?

560
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,385
Why Attorney Woo of all people?

561
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,264
Do you two know each other?

562
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,267
We…

563
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,062
do not know each other.

564
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:19,028
Ma'am, I'm sure you see it too,
but that video is not beneficial for us.

565
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:23,157
We don't even know if what he's saying
is true or not, and if it is true,

566
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,408
we're in big trouble.

567
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:27,745
Because Mr. Kim Chan-hong
will be sentenced to criminal charges.

568
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:29,413
A firm that sends its clients to jail?

569
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,916
We can't be that kind of firm.

570
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:34,001
That's right. Even now, Taesan claims

571
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,338
Raon is directly responsible
for the personal data breach.

572
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:41,050
If it's revealed that the CEO of Raon
was behind the hack all along,

573
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,177
they may claim even more damages.

574
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:47,598
But don't attorneys have the duty
to not cover up the truth about a case?

575
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,767
If it is beneficial to the public,

576
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,770
attorney-client privilege
doesn't have to be kept.

577
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:55,106
That's a very naive thing to say.

578
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:56,607
This isn't law school.

579
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,318
Law school or not,
I feel uncomfortable too.

580
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,028
If that video is true,

581
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,447
then the person who ordered a hack
on his own company

582
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,033
is shamelessly representing Raon.

583
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,787
Hiding the identity of the hacker
for the sake of the client's interests

584
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,330
doesn't sit right with me.

585
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:17,211
Because Taesan filed
a class-action lawsuit against Raon,

586
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:21,674
many companies who are disappointed
in Taesan have come to us.

587
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:25,803
At times like this, we have to make
a good impression on those companies.

588
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:28,973
We can't take the lead
in getting Raon's CEO punished.

589
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,476
That would be the case.

590
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,314
But…

591
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,984
I really like this video.

592
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,322
This video has power.

593
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:49,118
It can stop an unsuitable person
from becoming the Minister of Justice.

594
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:56,584
How can a mother of a son who stole
40 million personal data records

595
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,544
become the Minister of Justice?

596
00:38:58,627 --> 00:38:59,920
Don't you agree?

597
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,342
I knew we could count on you.

598
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,969
You're always a few steps ahead.

599
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,847
So if that video is revealed,

600
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,933
the fact that Taesan
is representing Raon's customers

601
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,937
would also seem quite deceitful
to the public.

602
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,814
The problem is

603
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,943
the order in which
we should kill these two birds.

604
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:29,533
Protecting the client's interests
while revealing the truth of the case…

605
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,577
What if it's not two birds?

606
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,121
What?

607
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:49,637
What if protecting the client's interests
and revealing the truth about the case

608
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,014
aren't two birds but one?

609
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:53,766
What do you mean?

610
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:56,102
Kim Chan-hong is simply a man

611
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,396
who represents a corporation called Raon.

612
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,022
They are separate entities.

613
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,775
We're representing
the corporation of Raon,

614
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:05,319
not Kim Chan-hong.

615
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,445
If you think about it,

616
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:09,740
Raon's interests are not in conflict
with the truth here.

617
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,826
Really? How are the two…

618
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:16,372
Sang-hyeon gave the personal data he stole
to Mr. Kim,

619
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:18,249
but he encrypted the whole thing

620
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:21,043
so nobody could access
or use the personal data.

621
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,380
The damage due to the personal data breach

622
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:26,048
hasn't occurred yet!

623
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,722
Yes, Reporter Lee.

624
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:37,101
The article I told you about last time.

625
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,146
The one about the child
Tae Su-mi had out of wedlock?

626
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,314
Yes, that one.

627
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,733
Could you put that on hold?

628
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,318
Why?

629
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:50,156
Because I think I can give you
something much better.

630
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,240
Just a second.

631
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:52,575
Attorney Woo.

632
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,458
Don't go on that paid vacation.

633
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:01,876
What?

634
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,627
You heard from your father
about the vacation, right?

635
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,379
I'm telling you not to go.

636
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,965
Because there's something better
for you to do.

637
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,219
Yes, Reporter Lee.

638
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:19,477
Defendant's counselor,
you submitted video evidence?

639
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,604
And you requested a closed court.

640
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,566
Yes, Your Honor.

641
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:30,154
The witness in the video is a minor.

642
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:33,866
As the witness is confessing to a crime
related to this case,

643
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:37,411
we request the audience to vacate
the courtroom when we play the video

644
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,955
to protect the identity of the witness.

645
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,256
What…

646
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:55,638
What is it? Who confessed to what?

647
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,348
Well…

648
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,183
You'll find out soon enough.

649
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,060
All right.

650
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:03,437
If you are not involved in the incident,

651
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,897
please leave the courtroom for a moment.

652
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:06,899
And among the co-plaintiffs,

653
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:09,735
only the selected parties
may remain in the courtroom.

654
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,154
Excuse me.

655
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:28,754
My name is Choi Sang-hyeon.
I'm in my first year of high school.

656
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:32,675
I hacked into Raon starting
on the night of January 18, 2022,

657
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,010
up until the morning of the 19th,

658
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:38,973
and took 40,954,173 personal data records.

659
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,018
Because Raon's CEO, Kim Chan-hong,
asked me to do it.

660
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,067
I'd like to confess…

661
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,152
to this wrongdoing.

662
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:56,073
What's going on here?

663
00:42:56,865 --> 00:43:00,744
You submit something like this
without a single word with me?

664
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,373
You're my attorneys!

665
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:08,168
We are not your attorneys.

666
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:10,838
We are Raon's attorneys.

667
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,174
I am Raon!

668
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,759
I am the CEO!

669
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,052
Not anymore.

670
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:21,181
The board of directors at Raon
just dismissed you, Mr. Kim Chan-hong.

671
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,851
What? What did you just say?

672
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:27,062
-He's the co-CEO!
-What are we supposed to do?

673
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,272
All right.

674
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,899
It might be better to cover this up.

675
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:35,446
If it becomes known that Mr. Kim ordered
an underage hacker to hack into Raon,

676
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,698
what would happen to the company's image?

677
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,200
We'd be lucky if it ends
with only our image being damaged.

678
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:44,913
This is a matter that shareholders
can claim damages for if they find out.

679
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,957
So we just let him be?

680
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,084
Even in the hacking lawsuit,

681
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:52,713
Kim Chan-hong is sitting there
at the trial as the CEO.

682
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:55,633
Does this make sense to you?
We should dismiss him immediately.

683
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:58,844
-We have to dismiss him.
-Yes, we must.

684
00:43:58,927 --> 00:43:59,762
Wait!

685
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:03,057
What do you think about this, Mr. Bae?

686
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:07,269
-Should we cover it up or…
-Of course we shouldn't cover it up.

687
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:13,692
If we want to find out
if Chan-hong really did it,

688
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,821
we can't just cover it up.

689
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,115
If…

690
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,451
he did do it,

691
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,080
it won't end with just a dismissal.

692
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:26,997
I…

693
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:28,749
No.

694
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,629
Raon will take every legal action possible

695
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:38,592
and bring Kim Chan-hong

696
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,096
down.

697
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:48,769
EMERGENCY BOARD MEETING
DISMISSAL OF CEO KIM CHAN-HONG

698
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,775
RESOLUTION LETTER

699
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:03,992
Your Honor, once Kim Chan-hong's crime
against the defendant, Raon, was reported,

700
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:09,289
the defendant dismissed
Mr. Kim from his position as CEO

701
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,167
and made Mr. Bae the sole CEO per
the decision of its board of directors.

702
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,669
Therefore, the defendant

703
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:16,255
will be applying for the correction
of the party represented.

704
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:17,464
Your Honor!

705
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,632
This is unfair.

706
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:22,469
I don't know where they got that video,
but it's not true.

707
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:26,640
Where's the proof
that I ordered that kid to do it?

708
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:29,017
And they said
the board of directors dismissed me,

709
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:31,603
but I never received a notice
about a board meeting.

710
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:32,896
If the CEO deems it urgent

711
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,232
and it is in accordance
with the company's bylaws,

712
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,484
the defendant may notify
the directors by email

713
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,194
thirty minutes prior to the meeting

714
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,655
and gather the board of directors
that same day.

715
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:43,323
That is what happened today.

716
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:46,201
And they did notify Mr. Kim…

717
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:48,620
of the board meeting.

718
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,880
WE ARE HOLDING
AN EMERGENCY BOARD MEETING

719
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,798
DATE: TODAY, 2 P.M.
PLACE: RAON 21ST FLOOR, CONFERENCE ROOM

720
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,425
AGENDA: DISMISSAL OF CEO KIM CHAN-HONG

721
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:06,763
Your Honor, we cannot accept that video
as evidence.

722
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,892
It is not a credible statement recorded
through formal investigative authorities.

723
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:13,228
And we can't even ask
the witness in the video any questions.

724
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,356
It is evidence that restricts
the co-plaintiffs' right

725
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,566
to cross-examination.

726
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:18,901
Your Honor.

727
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,032
I'll address things one at a time.

728
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:29,077
First, despite the surprising spectacle
the defendant's counselor has put on,

729
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:33,999
the court cannot immediately recognize
the change of Raon's CEO.

730
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,293
However,

731
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:39,129
there is no reason to believe
that the delegation agreement

732
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,256
between the defendant
and Hanbada Law Firm is invalid,

733
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:46,887
so we will proceed on the premise
that Hanbada is the defendant's counselor.

734
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:52,392
The defendant should apply for
the correction of the party represented

735
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,729
with the proper paperwork,
such as the registry of the corporation.

736
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:57,689
Your Honor.

737
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,317
Second, your innocence is not something

738
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,569
that will be dealt with
in this trial, Mr. Kim.

739
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,530
That is something that should be revealed

740
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,532
through an investigation
conducted by investigative authorities.

741
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:11,119
Finally, as for the admissibility
of the video we just saw…

742
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:20,462
I will not accept it as evidence.

743
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:26,426
The plaintiff's counselor is correct.

744
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,847
It's hard to say that the testimony
has credibility through that video alone.

745
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,225
And since the witness is not here,

746
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:36,979
it's also reasonable to point out
that the plaintiffs cannot cross-examine.

747
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:41,483
Then please summon Mr. Choi Sang-hyeon
to this trial as a witness.

748
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,651
Overruled.

749
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,487
-Excuse me?
-We can't be sure from that video alone

750
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:48,991
if the additional examination
of the evidence on Choi Sang-hyeon

751
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:50,450
is absolutely necessary.

752
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,661
For all we know,
it could've been sent in as a joke.

753
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:53,912
If the defendant's counselor

754
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:56,915
confirms Choi Sang-hyeon's intention
to attend trial

755
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:59,084
and applies for a witness summons,

756
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:00,794
I will accept that.

757
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:04,715
But this court
will not be summoning him first.

758
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:28,113
Did Choi Sang-hyeon reply?

759
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:30,699
No.

760
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:33,285
It's an ad from a figurine company
called Manjijak

761
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:35,746
for their newly released
gray whale figurines.

762
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:39,958
Whale lice and barnacles are often found
attached to the body of a gray whale.

763
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:43,086
I wonder if they captured all of that.
I should hurry and pre-order…

764
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:47,716
That's Choi Sang-hyeon, right?
What did he say?

765
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:53,472
"Young-woo,
I don't think I'll be able to testify."

766
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:55,349
"You won't be able
to reach me now either."

767
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,559
"I'm going to the States,
so I'm at the airport right now."

768
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,811
He's going to the States all of a sudden?

769
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:01,855
It's obvious.

770
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,733
Tae Su-mi is sending him away

771
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:06,860
to stop him from testifying.

772
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:13,325
Let's go with a public opinion battle.

773
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:15,160
A public opinion battle?

774
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:18,288
Are you saying we should
leak the video of Sang-hyeon to the press?

775
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,999
No matter how great Tae Su-mi is,

776
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:24,753
if public opinion calls for it,
the police will have to investigate.

777
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:27,631
Then Sang-hyeon will be summoned
back to the country.

778
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:32,344
Tae Su-mi's confirmation hearing
will be starting soon.

779
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:35,055
If we want to leak it,
we have to do it now.

780
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,307
Because we'll have time
to build public opinion

781
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,810
while Tae Su-mi can't do anything
to retaliate.

782
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:43,230
I'll talk to a reporter at Jeongui Ilbo.
You all--

783
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:44,398
No!

784
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:47,567
You can't do that.

785
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:49,945
I can't?

786
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:52,906
Attorney Woo, be quiet.
How dare you talk to the CEO like--

787
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:55,325
If you hand the confession video
over to the press,

788
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:58,245
Sang-hyeon will forever lose
the chance to turn himself in.

789
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,539
Sang-hyeon came to me

790
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:03,875
to reveal his wrongdoings on his own
and to make things right.

791
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,419
We can't turn him into

792
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:09,548
some privileged kid who was caught
by the police trying to flee the country.

793
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:11,842
Like the foul rich people
you see on the news.

794
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:13,885
Are we Sang-hyeon's attorneys?

795
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,346
Get yourself together!

796
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,725
Do you think he's your real brother
just because he calls you "big sister"?

797
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,613
I…

798
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,658
will try to convince them.

799
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,120
Convince who?

800
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:41,663
Choi Sang-hyeon?

801
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:42,748
No.

802
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,750
Attorney Tae Su-mi.

803
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:50,464
How are you going to convince Tae Su-mi?

804
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:53,675
Will she even meet with you
when her confirmation hearing is so close?

805
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,844
She might not meet me,

806
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:58,805
but I'll try!

807
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:04,019
I'll meet with Attorney Tae
and ask her to allow Sang-hyeon

808
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:05,687
to testify in court.

809
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,523
And I'd like to ask you to sit down.

810
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:09,524
All right.

811
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,112
We'll give Tae Su-mi and her son…

812
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:17,574
a chance.

813
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,201
Sorry?

814
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:26,666
I'll go with Attorney Woo
to the National Assembly.

815
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,543
So she can meet with Attorney Tae.

816
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,761
We know she's busy
because it's right before the hearing.

817
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:39,387
But it's that urgent.

818
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:41,681
Please just tell her
it's Attorney Woo Young-woo.

819
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,934
Then Attorney Tae
will want to see her too.

820
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:46,061
I'll see if I can find the right time
to tell her.

821
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:48,897
But Candidate Tae is very busy,
so please understand.

822
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,316
You can't wait for the right time.

823
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:52,943
Hello?

824
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,070
Hello? Mr. Kim?

825
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:15,131
The confirmation hearing starts at ten.

826
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:17,551
Even if Attorney Tae says she'll meet me,

827
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,928
I don't know if we'll be able
to get there in time.

828
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,806
It'll work out. Don't worry.

829
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:28,979
Thank you

830
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,231
for helping.

831
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,159
Earlier, when you bravely said

832
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,704
you would convince Attorney Tae Su-mi

833
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:51,126
in front of Ms. Han,

834
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,921
I made up my mind

835
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,757
to be brave

836
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,719
and say this.

837
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:06,933
What is it you want to say?

838
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,937
My feelings toward you, Attorney Woo,

839
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:18,403
are like the unrequited love toward a cat.

840
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:23,491
"The unrequited love toward a cat"?

841
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,161
Cats sometimes

842
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:29,122
make their owners lonely.

843
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,835
But they make them just as happy too.

844
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,927
When I eat lunch with you

845
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,554
and listen to you talk about whales.

846
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:49,809
When we carry out each agenda

847
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:52,103
from your strange list of dates.

848
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:54,814
When I

849
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:58,151
hold hands with you
for less than 57 seconds.

850
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,738
When our teeth knock together

851
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,240
as we kiss.

852
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:12,290
When I see the sparkle in your eyes

853
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:15,502
when you come up with a good idea.

854
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,714
When I can calm you down
by hugging you tight

855
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:22,592
when you're feeling anxious.

856
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:26,930
Those things make me happy.

857
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,230
So let's…

858
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,074
not break up.

859
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:07,637
Hello?

860
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:10,265
Come to Gate Five. I'll see you there.

861
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:11,349
Okay.

862
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:28,241
Attorney Woo, I think you can go now.

863
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:31,786
Only official government vehicles
are allowed to park in there,

864
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,371
so I'll be waiting nearby.

865
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:34,497
Okay.

866
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:40,170
The expression,
"the unrequited love toward a cat,"

867
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,379
is inappropriate.

868
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:45,050
Because cats love their owners too.

869
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:46,676
Right.

870
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,344
Okay.

871
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:50,930
So let's…

872
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,224
not break up.

873
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:39,562
I put together new responses

874
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,272
for Assemblywoman Min Hyo-jin's
list of questions.

875
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:43,108
Would you like to take a look
at the revisions?

876
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:45,276
Have these been fact-checked?

877
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,654
Yes, it matches the material
that has already been submitted.

878
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:58,248
CANDIDATE FOR MINISTER OF JUSTICE
WAITING ROOM

879
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:02,836
May we have the room please?

880
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:10,927
Madam Candidate,
the hearing is about to start.

881
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,011
You don't have much time.

882
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,388
Yes, I know.

883
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,233
What brings you here?

884
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,404
I don't think

885
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:33,366
you're here to tell me
you'll go to the States.

886
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:35,702
No.

887
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:37,745
I won't be going to the States.

888
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:39,164
Why not?

889
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:43,918
Isn't it hard for you at Hanbada?

890
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:49,215
The mentor who was good to you is ill,
the senior attorney bullies you,

891
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:51,926
and you and your co-worker broke up.

892
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:56,431
I'm…

893
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:01,227
like a narwhal in a pod of belugas.

894
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:03,897
A narwhal?

895
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:08,193
It has a helical tusk that projects
from its upper jaw.

896
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,652
That's why its scientific name means
"one-tooth one-horn."

897
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:12,906
It looks like a horn
on a unicorn's forehead.

898
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,283
What are you talking about?

899
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:17,410
I've seen a lost narwhal

900
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:21,289
coexisting with a pod of belugas

901
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,416
in a documentary.

902
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:25,752
I'm…

903
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:28,880
like that narwhal.

904
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:35,929
I live in an unfamiliar ocean
with unfamiliar belugas.

905
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:39,182
Because everyone's different from me,

906
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:41,935
it's not easy to adjust

907
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:46,689
and there are lots of whales
that hate me too.

908
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,072
But it's okay.

909
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,449
Because this is my life.

910
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,493
Though my life…

911
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:02,497
is unusual and peculiar,

912
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:06,125
it's valuable

913
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,753
and beautiful.

914
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:18,638
I have to go.

915
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,140
We'll continue this talk next time.

916
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:27,772
Please help so that Sang-hyeon
can testify in court about what he did.

917
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,527
What he did?

918
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:38,533
Hacking into Raon and leaking
40,954,173 personal data records.

919
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:41,869
Sang-hyeon…

920
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:47,292
believes that you're a good mom.

921
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,420
A mom

922
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:54,299
who scolds her child properly
and gives him reasonable punishment

923
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,175
when he does something wrong.

924
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,931
Don't betray…

925
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,143
your child's belief

926
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:10,398
that his mother is a good person

927
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:13,735
just for your own benefit.

928
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:18,698
He'll be hurt if you do that.

929
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:22,368
That wound…

930
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:25,997
will be very painful

931
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:29,167
and won't heal for a long time.

932
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:37,675
You weren't a good mother to me,

933
01:00:39,093 --> 01:00:40,845
but at the very least,

934
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:46,768
please be a good mother to Sang-hyeon.

935
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,364
It's time to get going, ma'am.

936
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:49,747
We will now begin
the confirmation hearing for Tae Su-mi,

937
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:51,874
the Candidate Member of the State Council
for the Minister of Justice.

938
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:58,214
Candidate, please step up to the podium,

939
01:01:58,297 --> 01:02:02,051
raise your right hand,
and recite the oath.

940
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,443
I pledge this.

941
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:21,279
"I, the Public Official Candidate,

942
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:24,073
swear to tell the truth

943
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:28,077
in the confirmation hearing
conducted by the National Assembly

944
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:32,206
according to my conscience,
without withholding or adding anything."

945
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:36,043
Public Official Candidate, Tae Su-mi.

946
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,768
Welcome.

947
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:01,027
Would you like something to drink?

948
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,153
No, thank you.

949
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:05,782
We'll just inform you of the conditions
for the witness questioning

950
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:06,991
and be on our way.

951
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,160
Then please go ahead.

952
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:11,704
CONDITIONS FOR WITNESS QUESTIONING

953
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:16,250
First, Choi Sang-hyeon is a young student.

954
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:19,504
Testifying in court
could be uncomfortable for him,

955
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:21,214
so refrain from creating
a hostile environment

956
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:23,591
or asking questions
that play on his emotions.

957
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:24,717
And most importantly,

958
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:27,720
you cannot question him
like you're interrogating a criminal.

959
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:29,222
Of course.

960
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:32,266
We have at least that much decorum.

961
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:33,768
Second.

962
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:38,272
Any questions related to
Attorney Tae Su-mi are not allowed.

963
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:41,234
Even if Sang-hyeon brings it up first,

964
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:46,531
Hanbada attorneys cannot ask
follow-up questions about Attorney Tae.

965
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:49,951
Third, Sang-hyeon will be questioned

966
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,537
by Attorney Woo Young-woo.

967
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:01,963
-What?
-If you do not follow

968
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,340
any one of these three conditions,

969
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:06,968
Choi Sang-hyeon will not testify.

970
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,515
Are you Choi Sang-hyeon's attorneys?

971
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,141
Are you?

972
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:15,643
What gives you the right

973
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:18,354
to appoint the attorney
that will question the witness?

974
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:19,605
All right then.

975
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:21,524
What? Ma'am.

976
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:23,776
Choi Sang-hyeon's questioning

977
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:25,945
will be handled…

978
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:30,241
by Attorney Woo.

979
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:35,496
We'll keep to all three conditions,
so don't worry.

980
01:04:46,924 --> 01:04:49,051
Witness, step forward.

981
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:14,994
"I solemnly swear
that I will tell the truth,

982
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,371
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

983
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:19,206
and agree to receive punishment
in accordance with perjury

984
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:22,585
should there be any falsehood."

985
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:25,838
Defendant's counselor,
begin questioning the witness.

986
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:28,215
Woo Young-woo, you got this.

987
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:31,177
"Woo Young-woo, you got this."

988
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:33,429
You got…

989
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:39,310
What are you doing?

990
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:04,543
Witness, please introduce yourself.

991
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:08,923
Choi Sang-hyeon.

992
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:11,676
I'm 17 years old.

993
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:17,682
I'm in my first year of high school.

994
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:21,185
Starting the night of January 18, 2022,

995
01:06:21,268 --> 01:06:22,645
into the morning of the 19th,

996
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:28,901
did you hack into Raon and take
40,954,173 personal data records?

997
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:30,444
Yes.

998
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:37,702
Why did you do it?

999
01:06:38,285 --> 01:06:39,412
Because Chan-hong

1000
01:06:40,204 --> 01:06:42,331
asked me to do it.

1001
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:44,583
By "Chan-hong,"

1002
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:48,295
do you mean the co-founder
and former co-CEO of Raon,

1003
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:50,172
Mr. Kim Chan-hong?

1004
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:51,340
Yes.

1005
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:53,551
I met Chan-hong

1006
01:06:54,635 --> 01:06:56,554
at a cybersecurity competition.

1007
01:06:57,805 --> 01:06:59,849
He was someone who always treated me well.

1008
01:07:00,891 --> 01:07:02,852
But one day, he asked me for a favor.

1009
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:05,563
He said that if I hack into Raon
and startle In-cheol,

1010
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:07,314
then In-cheol would

1011
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,775
spend a lot more money

1012
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:12,570
on software development
and building a security system.

1013
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:19,160
What did you do with
the 40,954,173 personal data records

1014
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:20,661
obtained through the hack?

1015
01:07:21,245 --> 01:07:23,539
I encrypted everything
and gave it to Chan-hong.

1016
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:27,585
He asked me to decrypt it, but I didn't.

1017
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:30,379
So that he wouldn't be able to sell it.

1018
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:34,091
Is there any possibility
that he could have decrypted it himself?

1019
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:35,301
No.

1020
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:38,471
As far as I know,
he doesn't have the skills

1021
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:40,556
to do that.

1022
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:45,061
You will be subject to legal punishment

1023
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:49,315
because you hacked and stole
the personal data of Raon users.

1024
01:07:49,815 --> 01:07:51,859
Are you aware of this?

1025
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,121
Yes.

1026
01:08:04,955 --> 01:08:06,082
I am aware.

1027
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:11,045
Then why are you

1028
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,464
willingly testifying to your crimes?

1029
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:18,094
Because I did a bad thing.

1030
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:22,139
I'm sorry to In-cheol…

1031
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:25,101
and to Raon users.

1032
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:30,731
I apologize.

1033
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:43,369
That is all.

1034
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:18,904
COURT

1035
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:21,282
Shortly after the confirmation hearing,

1036
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:24,368
I realized that my son
had hacked into Raon

1037
01:09:24,451 --> 01:09:28,497
and leaked the personal data
of Raon's customers.

1038
01:09:30,457 --> 01:09:31,709
I was ashamed.

1039
01:09:32,209 --> 01:09:34,420
I didn't even know I raised my child wrong

1040
01:09:35,045 --> 01:09:38,716
and wanted to be the Minister of Justice,
working for the country and the people.

1041
01:09:40,968 --> 01:09:43,554
And without knowing
that it was my son's doing,

1042
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:46,557
I watched Taesan,
the law firm I am affiliated with,

1043
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:51,103
file a lawsuit
on behalf of the users of Raon.

1044
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:55,733
My son is deeply remorseful of his crimes.

1045
01:09:55,816 --> 01:09:58,986
He will also sincerely oblige
to all investigations by the police

1046
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:02,114
and receive proper punishment.

1047
01:10:05,242 --> 01:10:06,368
Today…

1048
01:10:08,787 --> 01:10:12,333
I am stepping down from my candidacy
for the Minister of Justice.

1049
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:16,670
I will deeply reflect on myself.

1050
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:19,965
And although my son is not perfect,

1051
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:23,928
I will faithfully
carry out my role as a mother,

1052
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:25,888
which I haven't been able to do properly.

1053
01:10:27,848 --> 01:10:31,560
I sincerely apologize

1054
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:34,396
to everyone.

1055
01:10:57,544 --> 01:10:59,421
I let you off easy this time.

1056
01:11:09,139 --> 01:11:12,268
Mr. Kim Chan-hong, the former CEO of Raon,
admitted during a police investigation

1057
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:15,271
to ordering the son of former
Minister of Justice candidate, Tae Su-mi,

1058
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:17,690
to hack into Raon.

1059
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:21,318
The police found and confiscated
40,954,173 records

1060
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:25,239
of encrypted personal data
at Mr. Kim Chan-hong's residence

1061
01:11:25,322 --> 01:11:27,741
and revealed that there is
no circumstantial evidence

1062
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:29,660
that suggests that he leaked them
to a third party.

1063
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:33,914
Meanwhile, the lawsuit for damages
filed by Raon users against Raon

1064
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:35,749
was dismissed by the Civil Court

1065
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:39,420
of the Seoul Central District Court
upon the decision

1066
01:11:39,503 --> 01:11:43,674
that there was no emotional distress
caused by the personal data breach

1067
01:11:43,757 --> 01:11:45,926
since the data was confiscated
by investigative authorities.

1068
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:49,263
The lawsuit was dismissed?

1069
01:11:49,346 --> 01:11:50,431
That means you won, right?

1070
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:51,390
Yes.

1071
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:54,184
If we had lost, we would have had to pay
three trillion won in compensation,

1072
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:56,395
but we won, thanks to our attorneys.

1073
01:11:58,397 --> 01:11:59,690
Cheers!

1074
01:11:59,773 --> 01:12:01,942
Cheers to saving three trillion won!

1075
01:12:02,026 --> 01:12:03,652
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1076
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:08,115
Gosh, welcome!

1077
01:12:08,198 --> 01:12:10,284
Attorney Jung!

1078
01:12:10,367 --> 01:12:13,746
I made a lot of abalone porridge
because I heard you were coming.

1079
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:15,539
Goodness, thank you.

1080
01:12:15,622 --> 01:12:16,623
You're welcome.

1081
01:12:18,542 --> 01:12:20,419
Ms. Dong Geu-ran.

1082
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:21,670
Yes.

1083
01:12:23,297 --> 01:12:24,590
Sit over here.

1084
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:25,674
Okay.

1085
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:29,219
Eat up.

1086
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:30,929
Thank you.

1087
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:32,556
Thank you for the food.

1088
01:12:32,639 --> 01:12:33,515
Enjoy.

1089
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,477
I heard about the Raon trial.

1090
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,395
It was a big win.

1091
01:12:38,979 --> 01:12:42,858
It feels like only yesterday
that these three were clumsy rookies.

1092
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:44,943
My heart is so…

1093
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:48,655
You've all grown a lot.

1094
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:49,907
Thank you.

1095
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:51,325
It's all thanks to you.

1096
01:12:51,408 --> 01:12:54,870
Are you returning to Hanbada,
Attorney Jung?

1097
01:12:54,953 --> 01:12:56,497
Yes. Yes?

1098
01:12:57,706 --> 01:12:59,249
Yes? No.

1099
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:01,168
I don't know.

1100
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:06,924
What?

1101
01:13:11,011 --> 01:13:12,137
What?

1102
01:13:13,597 --> 01:13:16,558
Never mind. I'm still thinking about it.

1103
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:20,479
Do the three of you

1104
01:13:21,605 --> 01:13:23,690
-like working at Hanbada?
-Sorry?

1105
01:13:24,316 --> 01:13:25,317
Well…

1106
01:13:27,152 --> 01:13:29,154
Why would you ask them that?

1107
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:30,823
Of course, they'll say they like it
since I'm here.

1108
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:32,116
Would they say no to my face?

1109
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:33,283
Well…

1110
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,910
I like it.

1111
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:39,790
Even if I weren't
in front of Attorney Jung,

1112
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:41,625
I would say I like it.

1113
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:45,796
Right.

1114
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:55,973
Okay.

1115
01:13:56,056 --> 01:13:57,599
That's a relief.

1116
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:00,602
Cheers because that's a relief!

1117
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:01,687
-That's a relief!
-Cheers!

1118
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:02,938
Gosh, that's such a relief.

1119
01:14:03,021 --> 01:14:03,897
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1120
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:05,023
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1121
01:14:08,068 --> 01:14:09,862
-It's good, right?
-Yes, it's so good.

1122
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:10,904
-It's really good, right?
-The best.

1123
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:12,448
So who's paying
for all this good food today?

1124
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:13,365
Well…

1125
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:17,369
-Jung Myeong-seok!
-Jung Myeong-seok!

1126
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:20,622
-Jung Myeong-seok!
-Jung Myeong-seok!

1127
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:21,999
Thank you!

1128
01:14:22,082 --> 01:14:23,208
Thank you!

1129
01:14:27,671 --> 01:14:32,926
WOO YOUNG-WOO GIMBAP

1130
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:35,679
One Woo Young-woo gimbap, please.

1131
01:14:35,762 --> 01:14:37,347
Okay.

1132
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:39,224
I have it ready.

1133
01:14:49,776 --> 01:14:54,156
I think a new emotion needs to be added
to the human emotions poster.

1134
01:14:55,949 --> 01:14:57,034
A new emotion?

1135
01:14:57,951 --> 01:14:59,161
Which one?

1136
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:03,999
I'm not exactly sure what
the emotion I'm feeling this morning is.

1137
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:07,085
It's not satisfaction

1138
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:09,796
or enjoyment.

1139
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:13,175
Or joy either.

1140
01:15:13,258 --> 01:15:14,843
Then what is it?

1141
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:16,678
Starting today,

1142
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:20,891
I'm Hanbada Law Firm's full-time attorney,
Woo Young-woo.

1143
01:15:20,974 --> 01:15:22,809
Whether it's read straight or flipped,
it's still Woo Young-woo.

1144
01:15:22,893 --> 01:15:25,729
Kayak, deed, rotator,
noon, racecar, Woo Young-woo.

1145
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:28,774
Full-time?

1146
01:15:34,446 --> 01:15:36,198
You got your contract renewed?

1147
01:15:36,281 --> 01:15:37,324
Yes.

1148
01:15:38,116 --> 01:15:40,035
Gosh, that's great.

1149
01:15:41,286 --> 01:15:43,705
But why didn't you tell me sooner?

1150
01:15:44,414 --> 01:15:46,208
I'm telling you right now.

1151
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:47,501
Right, okay.

1152
01:15:48,585 --> 01:15:49,670
My Young-woo.

1153
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:52,422
I'm so proud of you.

1154
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:57,636
But what you're feeling right now
isn't joy?

1155
01:15:57,719 --> 01:15:59,221
I'm so overjoyed right now.

1156
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:01,682
Well, I am happy.

1157
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,309
But I don't think that's all of it.

1158
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:05,602
Then are you proud?

1159
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:11,525
I don't think that's it.

1160
01:16:11,608 --> 01:16:13,277
-Do you feel praiseworthy?
-No.

1161
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,820
-Commendable?
-No.

1162
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:17,197
Should I feel that I could die right now
with no regrets

1163
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:19,116
because my daughter is
a respectable, full-time attorney?

1164
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,536
We're getting further away
from the answer I'm looking for.

1165
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:28,375
This is great.

1166
01:16:38,218 --> 01:16:39,595
See you later.

1167
01:16:39,678 --> 01:16:40,971
All right.

1168
01:16:55,485 --> 01:16:56,987
My daughter's all grown up.

1169
01:18:34,418 --> 01:18:37,462
One, two, three.

1170
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:41,174
One, two, three. One, two…

1171
01:18:55,313 --> 01:18:58,275
One, two, three.

1172
01:18:58,358 --> 01:19:01,611
One, two, three.

1173
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:05,198
One, two…

1174
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:33,351
Attorney Woo!

1175
01:19:40,192 --> 01:19:41,359
A sense of fulfillment!

1176
01:19:41,985 --> 01:19:42,903
What?

1177
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:46,823
The emotion I'm feeling this morning is

1178
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:49,367
a sense of fulfillment!

1179
01:22:37,327 --> 01:22:42,332
