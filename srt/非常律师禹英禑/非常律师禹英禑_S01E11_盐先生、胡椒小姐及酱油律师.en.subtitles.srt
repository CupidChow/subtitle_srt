1
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:07,984
Yes!

2
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,527
Again?

3
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,779
You won again?

4
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:15,366
-Call.
-I'll take these away for you.

5
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,994
-Hang on.
-Oh, thank you.

6
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,080
Lighter!

7
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,414
Lighter!

8
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,166
Okay.

9
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,168
Patron number four.

10
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,129
Patron number four, your coffee is ready.

11
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,343
What will be the fourth lucky number?

12
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,345
The fourth lucky number is…

13
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,138
Number 38.

14
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,640
Yes!

15
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,519
We will continue and draw

16
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,437
-the fifth number.
-I have 18. Jeez.

17
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,855
And the fifth number is…

18
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,275
Number nine.

19
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,904
-I have it. Number nine.
-Let me read off the numbers again.

20
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:56,574
Gosh, I had a dream last night
that I’d get lucky.

21
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,576
I guess it meant nothing.

22
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,161
These are the numbers so far.

23
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,706
For the last number
of the 1,011th lottery.

24
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,959
The sixth lucky number is…

25
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,339
The last ball will be drawn
any moment now.

26
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,466
The sixth lucky number is…

27
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:24,394
The sixth lucky number is number 26!

28
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,187
Number 26, the sixth lucky number!

29
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,898
-Jeez, five thousand won.
-We're drawing the bonus ball

30
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,024
for second place.

31
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,193
The bonus ball is number 42!

32
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,194
No way!

33
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:38,032
-The numbers are all in.
-What?

34
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,869
All right. The lucky numbers
of the 1,011th lottery draw

35
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,746
-are numbers one, thirty-five, twelve,
-What is going on?

36
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,250
thirty-eight, nine, and twenty-six.

37
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:51,129
And the number of the bonus ball
for second place is 42.

38
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,843
-First place!
-First place!

39
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,262
First place!

40
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:03,224
First place!

41
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,976
First place!

42
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:05,935
First place!

43
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,854
Life really can change overnight!

44
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,108
First place!

45
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:20,283
CASE 11: MR. SALT, MS. PEPPER,
AND ATTORNEY SOY SAUCE

46
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,431
Do your teeth

47
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:48,269
usually knock against each other
when kissing?

48
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,564
No?

49
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,277
Then what am I supposed to…

50
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:58,905
Well…

51
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,200
I think…

52
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:07,497
it would be better
if you open up your mouth a bit more.

53
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,208
And it would be better…

54
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,045
if you closed your eyes a bit more.

55
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,172
Right.

56
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:45,410
Hey, Attorney Woo.

57
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,416
What are you doing here?

58
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,253
I wanted to see you.

59
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:56,796
What?

60
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,217
I waited here because I wanted to see you.

61
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,388
Then you should have called me over.

62
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,515
I almost walked right past you.

63
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:08,891
Well…

64
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,563
I waited to see you and I did.

65
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,898
I see. So that's all you needed?

66
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,736
I can see your desk
from the window of my office.

67
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,488
I got curious
because you hadn't come even though

68
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,990
it was 12 minutes past
the usual time you arrive.

69
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,123
Hello.

70
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,583
Yes, Attorney Woo.

71
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,877
Come up to the conference room
on the 17th floor.

72
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,879
We have a client meeting about a new case.

73
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:38,921
Yes, okay.

74
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,385
I…

75
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,553
You have to go?

76
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,931
-Yes.
-I'll see you at lunch then?

77
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,976
Yes.

78
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:23,758
Attorney Woo, is it manageable?

79
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,301
Sorry?

80
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,178
Is it manageable?

81
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:33,017
Is what manageable?

82
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,018
What?

83
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,189
Well…

84
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,359
I was wondering
if anything was bothering you.

85
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,360
Well…

86
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:49,283
I do have concerns, but I can't tell you
because it's personal.

87
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,789
Personal?

88
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:56,499
What is it?

89
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:03,714
The concerns of a Hanbada attorney
are the concerns of Hanbada as a whole.

90
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,634
They are also my concerns as CEO.

91
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,804
It's okay. You can talk to me.

92
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,441
When you kiss, you have to open your mouth

93
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,151
so that your front teeth
don't knock against each other.

94
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,861
But it's hard to breathe like that.

95
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:28,739
I'm concerned about
whether or not there is a way to kiss

96
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,450
and breathe at the same time.

97
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,164
I see.

98
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,670
That is your concern.

99
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,389
Excuse me, where's the conference room?

100
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,891
It's up the stairs.

101
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,184
Thank you.

102
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,352
-You can put me down now.
-Jeez, just stay put.

103
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,688
-You have to go up the stairs.
-So what?

104
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,065
-You're going to break your back.
-The firm…

105
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,652
is a bit weird.

106
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,489
-My back's fine.
-I'm not fine with it.

107
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,199
Is it this one? No, it's not.

108
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,451
Where could it be?

109
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:15,786
Isn't it that one?

110
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,832
Gosh, it's nice here.

111
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,878
Is it this one? It is.

112
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,339
-Now put me down.
-The floor is cold.

113
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,508
Stay there until I put you down
in a chair.

114
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,593
Gosh, this is so embarrassing.

115
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,054
Yes, come in.

116
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,598
-Hello.
-Hi.

117
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,849
Hello.

118
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,476
Attorney Woo, come in.

119
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,399
You're an attorney too.

120
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,568
Yes, hello. I'm Woo Young-woo.

121
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,112
Whether it's read straight or flipped,
it's still Woo Young-woo.

122
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,823
Kayak, deed, rotator,
noon, racecar, Woo Young-woo.

123
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:56,827
Are you unwell? Should I see
if there's a wheelchair you can use?

124
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:57,870
No.

125
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:01,040
This is my wife, and one of her heels
broke off on our way here.

126
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,709
-I told you to put me down.
-I said the floor is cold.

127
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,546
-Please take a seat over here.
-Thank you.

128
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,547
Thank you.

129
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,049
-Be careful.
-Okay.

130
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:15,096
My wife wore heels to visit you,

131
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,181
but they were so worn

132
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,142
that one broke right off on our way here.

133
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,812
I can't even buy her a new pair of heels.

134
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,648
All I've done is give her a hard time.

135
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,568
It's because I usually don't have
an occasion to wear heels.

136
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,903
-Sit.
-Yes, take a seat.

137
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,321
Yes, thank you.

138
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:36,284
It's nice to see
how you care for your wife.

139
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,745
You are like a pair of mandarin ducks.

140
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,790
Gosh, please.

141
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:46,252
Since I don't make a lot of money,
the least I can do is be good to her.

142
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,880
But actually, mandarin ducks
are not that loving to each other.

143
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,466
During the mating period,
the male mandarin duck

144
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,218
stays with the female
and builds a nest together.

145
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,929
But once that period is over,
the male leaves for another female,

146
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,974
leaving the female mandarin duck
to raise the babies on her own.

147
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,186
What brings you here?

148
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,438
Right.

149
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:09,734
Recently, two other people and I pooled
our money and bought lottery tickets.

150
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,904
And we promised
to split it evenly if any of us won.

151
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:19,160
And one of us
actually did win first place.

152
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,828
Gosh, that's amazing!

153
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,079
"Gosh, that's amazing."

154
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,289
Amazing, right?

155
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,624
It sure is amazing, but…

156
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,795
Men become fools in the face of money.

157
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,673
The bastard who won first place

158
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,301
suddenly went off the grid.

159
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:38,596
So I went to his house.

160
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:42,266
But he said he never made such a promise.

161
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,643
He was completely shameless.

162
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,395
He said he won't share a single penny.

163
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:51,776
Did you only talk about
promising to divide the prize?

164
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:56,822
Did you not put what you promised
in writing or record it?

165
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,951
No, nothing like that.
We only talked about it.

166
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:05,039
Then it won't be easy to prove
that the promise was made.

167
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:08,292
If you don't mind me asking,
how do the three of you know each other?

168
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,254
Well…

169
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,925
They're his gambling buddies.

170
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,010
-Gambling?
-Gambling?

171
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,345
Yes.

172
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,889
I frequented gambling houses.

173
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,225
The lottery tickets
were also bought with the stakes.

174
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:27,686
You're talking about
illegal gambling houses, right?

175
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:29,897
Yes.

176
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,526
Would that be some kind of an issue?

177
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,822
Yes, it could be an issue.

178
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:41,200
Especially the part about how the ticket
was bought with gambling money.

179
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:44,662
As you know, gambling is an illegal act
that goes against the social order.

180
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,582
So the court may consider
the promise itself to be invalid.

181
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,961
What kind of law is that?

182
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,838
Gambling and a promise
are two different matters.

183
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,924
"Article 103 of the Civil Law.
A juristic act that can be described

184
00:11:57,007 --> 00:12:00,636
as contrary to good morals and other
social order shall be null and void."

185
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:03,639
According to this law, you don't have to
pay off gambling debts.

186
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:06,976
Gambling itself is an illegal act
that goes against the social order,

187
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,479
so the law does not protect the promise
to pay off gambling debts.

188
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:14,066
The lottery prize is over 6.2 billion won.

189
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,943
Even after taxes, it's 4.2 billion.

190
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,571
If we split it 3 ways,
my cut is 1.4 billion.

191
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,783
I'll bring the other person
who didn't get his share to Hanbada.

192
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,912
If you represent us together, it would be
a lawsuit worth over 2.8 billion.

193
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,706
I can't pay you at the moment,

194
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,083
but as soon as we win the trial…

195
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,501
What was it?

196
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,044
The…

197
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,796
-The contingency fee!
-Right!

198
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,840
I'll pay you plenty!

199
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,302
Well, it's not about the commission fee.

200
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:47,433
As I said, I'm just letting you know that
this case may not even be legally valid.

201
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:51,061
Then can't we say that the lottery tickets
were not purchased with the stakes?

202
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,229
-Excuse me?
-Excuse me?

203
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,316
I mean, the other friend
and I can agree to say--

204
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,610
Are you saying you're going to lie?

205
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,028
In court?

206
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,779
You can't!

207
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,120
My husband isn't into gambling
because he likes it.

208
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,498
He's actually a very diligent person.

209
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,208
After we got married,

210
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,960
he opened up an internet cafe,
but lost all our money

211
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,754
because he was conned by his partner.

212
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,381
That's when he started gambling
to make up for it.

213
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,092
You saw how he carried me
on his back here, right?

214
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:26,472
He might be a gambler,
but he's a good husband to me

215
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,225
and a sweet dad to our kids.

216
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,809
Yes, it seems so.

217
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,394
But as I said--

218
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:36,148
Attorney Jung, we have a connection.

219
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,945
You're the son of the acquaintance
of my third aunt's friend.

220
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:46,659
Yes, I heard that you are the niece
of my mother's acquaintance's friend.

221
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:50,663
I really need the 1.4 billion won.

222
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,874
My husband and I
have been married for 15 years.

223
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,752
Our kids are 13 and 11 already.

224
00:13:56,835 --> 00:14:01,173
We've never had a proper house,
so we’ve always been moving around,

225
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,635
living on what I make from my gimbap shop.

226
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,472
Given my unfortunate life,
this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

227
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,431
Please.

228
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,308
Please…

229
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,269
Please help my family.

230
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,525
Please, help us.

231
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,411
Here's your seaweed sushi.

232
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,371
Thank you.

233
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,126
Is Su-yeon doing well?

234
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:38,878
What?

235
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:39,920
Jeez.

236
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:43,424
Do you have no pride? Why would you ask
about someone who ran away from you?

237
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,012
Su-yeon ran away?

238
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,432
You didn't hear about the blind date
from the angel?

239
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,976
All she said was that it didn't work out.

240
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,102
That's it?

241
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,730
Gosh, she's a good person.

242
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,815
She's a real angel.

243
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,984
She didn't expose
Hairy's atrocious behavior.

244
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,069
-"Atrocious behavior"?
-Yes.

245
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:07,907
Apparently, the first thing he said
to her was "I'm Kim Min-sickly prickly."

246
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,409
Jeez, anyone would've gone nuts!

247
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,077
Were you possessed
by the spirit of a lame dad?

248
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:15,372
He cracked dad jokes,
thinking he was so funny.

249
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,250
I mean, I'm usually not like that.

250
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,462
But I guess I was
particularly nervous that day.

251
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,213
"Dad jokes"?

252
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,758
Hairy, tell me what you said that day.

253
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,135
Well…

254
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,138
"Orange" you glad you came out tonight?

255
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,640
And?

256
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,600
I'll go with the gorgonzola cheese pizza,
hoping it'll be "grate."

257
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,101
And?

258
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,020
If you eat bananas,
will you find me "a-peeling"?

259
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,105
Absolutely nuts!

260
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,858
Jeez. You're so frustrating.

261
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,151
Right.

262
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:48,364
Are these jokes that use words
with similar pronunciations?

263
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,241
I think they're funny.

264
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,036
-Seriously?
-Really?

265
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,998
I see.

266
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,710
Then the food jokes
were the problem, right?

267
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,253
The angel is an attorney.

268
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,839
So you should have made
attorney jokes to an attorney.

269
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,300
"Attorney jokes"?

270
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,094
All right.

271
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:14,431
The thread and the needle were fighting
and the police arrested the thread.

272
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,350
Do you know why?

273
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,434
No.

274
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,061
Because the needle

275
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,729
sewed the thread.

276
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,273
-"Sewed"?
-Yes.

277
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,901
I get it!

278
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,611
Sued!

279
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,698
It's funny, right?

280
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,117
Ma'am…

281
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,453
Eight vowels, eleven consonants,
an exclamation mark,

282
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,455
and a comma appeared in court today.

283
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,498
Because…

284
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,001
they are due to be sentenced next week.

285
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,339
"Sentenced next week"?

286
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,050
I get it!

287
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,971
"Sentenced next week."

288
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,810
You should have used this!

289
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,062
-I should have.
-Seriously.

290
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,690
What a shame.

291
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,608
-More.
-More?

292
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,943
-There's no more.
-What?

293
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,112
He probably doesn't have more.

294
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,497
JONG-GWON

295
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,218
Hi, Jong-gwon.

296
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,596
Hi, Su-yeon.
Can you step out for a second?

297
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:39,016
-What?
-I'm outside your firm.

298
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,101
Step outside real quick
and let me see you.

299
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,186
Right.

300
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,562
I'll be right down.

301
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,586
What are you doing here?
This was unexpected.

302
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,379
And what's that behind your back?

303
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,882
I have something
in my right hand and my left hand.

304
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:12,925
Which one do you want to see first?

305
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,512
Left hand?

306
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,681
It's a "good-for-your-body cocktail."

307
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,518
A "good-for-your-body cocktail"?

308
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,812
You said you felt a cold coming.

309
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,022
I was just going to make you honey water,

310
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,108
but I ended up adding things
that are good for the body.

311
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,693
You can call it honey water
with lemon, yuzu,

312
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,696
lime, mint, cinnamon, and turmeric.

313
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,034
Honey water with lemon, yuzu,
lime, mint, cinnamon, and turmeric?

314
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,830
-How does it taste?
-Taste?

315
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,207
Well, it's awful.

316
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,752
It's just like medicine.

317
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,295
I'll enjoy it even if it tastes awful.

318
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,256
What's in your right hand?

319
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,590
In my right hand…

320
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,431
I don't really know its exact name.

321
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,724
It's called marigold, French marigold,

322
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,853
or calendula, but I just bought it
because I like the meaning of it.

323
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,522
What does it mean?

324
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,901
"Happiness that will surely come."

325
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,158
It's so pretty.

326
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,952
If you put it in water,
it will bloom in about three days.

327
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,415
Watch your head.

328
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,296
Hello. Can we go in?

329
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,344
Come in.

330
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,903
Why are you here so early?
We're not even open yet.

331
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:57,988
Who's this?

332
00:19:58,655 --> 00:19:59,948
She's an attorney.

333
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,867
I'm in the middle of a lawsuit
for the lottery prize.

334
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,620
Is Ashtray here?
Can you go get him for me?

335
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,581
Gosh. You're an attorney.

336
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,001
-Would you like some coffee?
-No. I'm okay.

337
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,965
Byeong-gil!

338
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,302
Is that the person who'll be testifying?

339
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:24,848
No. She's Coffee Shop.
The kid who'll be testifying is Ashtray.

340
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,850
"Coffee Shop"? "Ashtray"?

341
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:30,687
The person who sells coffee here
is called Coffee Shop,

342
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:34,316
and the person
who runs small errands is called Ashtray.

343
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,651
There he comes. Ashtray.

344
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,735
Over here.

345
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,948
I'll get straight to the point.

346
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:45,077
Do you remember the day you went on
that errand to buy lottery tickets?

347
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:52,751
Park Seong-nam, Yun Jae-won, and I
pooled our stakes together and asked you

348
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,420
to go buy some lottery tickets.

349
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,965
Yes, you won first place that night.

350
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,132
Yes, right.

351
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:05,555
Did you hear how we promised to
split the prize?

352
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,349
Yes.

353
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,559
I heard you say,

354
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,145
"If one of us wins,

355
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:15,315
we'll split it evenly no matter what."

356
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,734
Evenly?

357
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,735
Yes.

358
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,654
There were three of them, so three ways.

359
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,825
Can you testify
what you just said in court?

360
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:25,951
What?

361
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,453
Testify in court?

362
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,746
No.

363
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,500
There's not much to it. All you have to do
is repeat what you just said.

364
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,919
I've never done
something like that before.

365
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,131
-Things are busy here too, so I…
-No, wait!

366
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:43,510
Hey. There are billions on the line
and you're worried about this place?

367
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,307
Please help me.

368
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,474
If you testify,

369
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,769
I'll give you a lot of money,
enough for you to quit this job.

370
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,647
What? You can't give him a lot of money.

371
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:59,109
Agreeing to provide travel expenses
or excessive benefits that exceed

372
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,528
the typical expenses
makes that testimony invalid

373
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:04,364
as it falls under the illegal acts
contrary to social order.

374
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,657
Attorney Woo!

375
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,828
We came here
to convince him together, right?

376
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:12,789
And why can't I give him money?
It's my money.

377
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:16,293
It's not like I'm asking him to lie.
I'm just asking him to tell the truth!

378
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,586
You can't!

379
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,213
Have you forgotten
Article 103 of the Civil Law already?

380
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,007
Jeez, Attorney Woo!

381
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,887
You should know when to be flexible!

382
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,600
-I have to get back to work now.
-No, wait.

383
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:32,809
Wait.

384
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,730
Please testify for me.

385
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,649
I'll give you enough for you to quit…

386
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,155
I mean, even if it's not that,

387
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,450
I'll return the favor, big time.

388
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:53,288
Within the bounds of civil law.

389
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,499
Nothing excessive.

390
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:59,544
Nothing excessive.

391
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:09,971
Jun-ho.

392
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:11,723
Yes?

393
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,768
What's wrong?

394
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:25,821
She's been like that for a while now.
She's freaking me out.

395
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,467
Jun-ho.

396
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,136
Yes.

397
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,513
It's about the Jaejin Construction
apartment defect lawsuit.

398
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:52,430
Yes.

399
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:55,600
How many credit transfer documents
did they get from the residents?

400
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,979
I think from around 400 households.

401
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,565
Jeez, that's not even half.

402
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,109
The resident representatives
are working as fast as they can,

403
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,319
but things aren't really moving ahead.

404
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,113
We still have a long way to go.

405
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,449
Why don't you get involved?

406
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:14,494
I was actually planning to go tomorrow.

407
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:42,606
The plaintiffs claim that there is
an agreement between the defendant

408
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,692
and the plaintiffs on the distribution
of the lottery prize.

409
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:49,613
However, the defendant
denies the existence of such an agreement.

410
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,199
Even if there is such an agreement,

411
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,285
it is merely a light joke that was made

412
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:59,664
while imagining the very rare situation
of winning the lottery,

413
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,958
not a legal act with validity.

414
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:06,338
The defendant and the plaintiffs didn't
even put the said agreement in writing

415
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:11,092
nor did they specify the ranking of the
lottery tickets that were to be divided.

416
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:14,304
When the defendant won first place,

417
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:18,433
Shin Il-su, one of the plaintiffs,
also won fifth place.

418
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:23,521
Now, which of the award money
should be divided?

419
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,815
Were any specific decisions
made about this?

420
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:26,942
What?

421
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,026
Wait.

422
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,779
Are you saying that it's a problem
that we didn't split 5,000 won?

423
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:34,282
I'll share it right now then.
We'll split it right now.

424
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,492
Hey, let's split this.

425
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:38,119
Okay, 5,000 won. If you divide this
by 3, how much is it?

426
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,414
Well, 5 times 1 is 5, 5 times 2 is 10,
5 times 3 is 15. 1,500…

427
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,666
What? No.

428
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:45,502
To be exact, it's 1,666.6666--

429
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:48,380
I don't care how much it is.
Let's just split it.

430
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:51,591
-We'll split it in front of the judge.
-I'll pay.

431
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,427
-How many coins do you have?
-Plaintiffs, what are you doing?

432
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:56,888
Order.

433
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,891
-Put that away.
-Okay.

434
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,685
-And take a seat.
-Okay.

435
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,771
Defendant's counselor.

436
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,898
Do you have anything else to say?

437
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,149
Yes, Your Honor.

438
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,320
As I said before, the agreement
that the plaintiffs are claiming

439
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,239
was not put in writing

440
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,742
nor was there anything regarding
the legality of the act.

441
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:19,744
Therefore, it is invalid.

442
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,371
Your Honor.

443
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:25,000
Oral agreements are also agreements
and are legally binding.

444
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,628
The defendant and the plaintiffs promised
that no matter who won the lottery,

445
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,464
the prize would be
split evenly three ways.

446
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:35,093
Then, it's fair to say
that they decided to divide

447
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,220
all the lottery tickets they won that day.

448
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,139
Whether it's first place or fifth place,

449
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:42,976
it's obvious that
there's no need to specify the ranking.

450
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,228
I understand the argument for both sides.

451
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,564
But the issue at hand is whether or not

452
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:50,108
there really was
a joint distribution agreement.

453
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:53,278
Plaintiff's counselor. You filed
for a witness in this regard, right?

454
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,071
Yes, Your Honor.

455
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,949
At the time of the incident,
the defendant and the plaintiffs

456
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,993
gave money to a guy
to buy their lottery tickets.

457
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,661
We call Mr. Han Byeong-gil as a witness--

458
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:02,579
Not at this time.

459
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:03,788
Not at this time.

460
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,917
I apologize.

461
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,170
Not at this time?

462
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,088
I can't get in touch with Mr. Han.

463
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,882
He's an undocumented
Korean Chinese immigrant,

464
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,760
so I think he went into hiding because
he might get deported if he testifies.

465
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,099
Plaintiff's counselor?

466
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,601
Yes, I'm sorry.

467
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:28,021
The witness we summoned, Mr. Han,
is not able to come today.

468
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:30,815
So I think we're going to have to
review another witness.

469
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,526
May we reapply for another witness?

470
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:43,953
So…

471
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:47,791
Is there anyone else
who would have heard your promise?

472
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:51,878
If there's no one else,
we can just make one up, right?

473
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:52,796
I mean,

474
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,964
we'll give them some money.

475
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:56,966
What?

476
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,595
Are you saying you're going to buy a fake
witness and make them commit perjury?

477
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,180
You can't.

478
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,474
Then what are we supposed to do?

479
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,143
You should know when to be flexible.

480
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,854
Gosh, there is someone
who would have heard.

481
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:14,192
There were so many people
at the gambling house that day.

482
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,694
You think none of them would've overheard?

483
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,655
There must be someone who heard us.

484
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:21,866
We'll find another witness. Don't worry.

485
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,493
-Okay.
-It's 1.4 billion won--

486
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,495
-There should be someone.
-She's so frustrating.

487
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:28,373
-There should be someone.
-It's not a small amount of money.

488
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,375
There's someone.

489
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:31,751
-There is?
-Yes.

490
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,003
-Gosh, how frustrating.
-I said there is.

491
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:38,007
Attorney Woo, gather more material
that would be advantageous for us.

492
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:42,262
We didn't get there today,
but the point of this case

493
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:45,348
is whether the agreement to divide
the prize of a lottery that was bought

494
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,559
with gambling money
is legally valid or not.

495
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:51,855
Look into Juristic Acts Contrary to Social
Order, Performance for Illegal Cause,

496
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,064
and other things related to illegal acts.

497
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:54,858
Yes, okay.

498
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,480
INCOMING VIDEO CALL
ATTORNEY WOO

499
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:52,957
Hello?

500
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,126
Hello?

501
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,670
Attorney Woo,
I can't really see your face.

502
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:00,173
I can see your face well.

503
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:02,717
I see.

504
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,970
Let me look at your face too.

505
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,556
Just hold the phone a bit farther away.

506
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,392
Right.

507
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,769
Yes, I can see you now.

508
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:17,357
You're still in the office, right?
You must be exhausted.

509
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,109
Yes. I'm going to hang up now.

510
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,820
What?

511
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:25,448
Then why did you call me?

512
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,034
Because I wanted to see you.

513
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:31,871
I called you
because I wanted to see you and I did.

514
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:35,625
Right, so that's it then?
Since you got what you wanted?

515
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,293
Yes.

516
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:39,879
But…

517
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,258
what about how I feel as the person
who answered the call?

518
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,720
From now on, please ask
if I want to hang up too.

519
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,764
I'm sorry.

520
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,100
Do you want to hang up?

521
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:53,810
No.

522
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,061
I see.

523
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:57,313
Let's talk just a little bit more.

524
00:30:58,314 --> 00:30:59,899
-Okay.
-Well…

525
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,279
Do you have anything you want to tell me?

526
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:09,075
Not about work or whales,
but just small talk?

527
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,618
Well…

528
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,372
The thread and the needle were fighting

529
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,583
and the thread was taken
to the police station.

530
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:17,834
Do you know why?

531
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:20,253
Because the needle sewed the thread?

532
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,132
Correct.

533
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,593
Eight vowels, eleven consonants,
an exclamation mark,

534
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:29,012
and a comma
appeared in court today, because…

535
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,889
They are due to be sentenced next week.

536
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,228
Maybe it's because you're telling them,

537
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,813
but even dad jokes are funny.

538
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,024
Yes, they're funny.

539
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,402
You should get back to work now, right?

540
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,695
Should we hang up?

541
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:46,654
Right.

542
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,156
Yes.

543
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,240
Well…

544
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:51,618
But…

545
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,832
You keep popping into my head

546
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,209
like whales.

547
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,588
Even though you're not one.

548
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:10,637
This is the first time
I've constantly thought of someone,

549
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,015
so it's quite strange.

550
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:48,675
The defendant still denies
the existence of the agreement.

551
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,594
And even if there is an agreement,

552
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:55,014
it's a distribution agreement
for the prize of a lottery ticket

553
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,392
that was bought with gambling money,
which is a criminal act.

554
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,144
This falls under Article 103

555
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,480
of the Civil Law Juristic Acts
Contrary to Social Order.

556
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:04,857
Thus, it is invalid.

557
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,735
Gambling is gambling,
and an agreement is an agreement.

558
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,530
Just because gambling money was used
to purchase the lottery ticket

559
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:13,783
does not mean the agreement to share
the prize can be considered

560
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:16,953
invalid due to violations of good morals
and other social orders.

561
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:21,499
For example, in a case where a secret fund
was entrusted to someone else to hide,

562
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,835
there is a Supreme Court ruling that says,

563
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:26,170
"Even if the secret fund was illegally
created by acts contrary to social order,

564
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:29,382
the act of entrusting money
to others should not be seen

565
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:32,552
as a Juristic Act Contrary
to Social Order."

566
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:35,346
There are many precedents that support
the defendant's claim as well.

567
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:39,225
A financial institution gave a loan to an
illegal entertainment business employee,

568
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:42,937
and the loan agreement was considered
as a Juristic Act Contrary to Social Order

569
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,189
in violation
of Article 103 of the Civil Law.

570
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,108
Thus, this case received
the verdict of being invalid.

571
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,068
Even in this case, are the plaintiff's
counselors still going to consider

572
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:53,489
the illegal entertainment business
and a loan agreement as different matters?

573
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,867
Isn't it more appropriate to view
that case as being invalid

574
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,619
due to the violation of Article 10 of
the Act on the Punishment of Arrangement

575
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,997
of Commercial Sex Acts
than Article 103 of the Civil Law?

576
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,042
Since there is a clear clause that says,
"Any claims held to a person who has

577
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:07,086
engaged in acts of selling sex
shall be invalidated

578
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,422
regardless of the form
or title of the contract."

579
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:14,343
You can't compare that case to the joint
distribution agreement of this case!

580
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,471
I understand the argument for both sides.

581
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:20,016
In actuality, the expression of
"good morals and other social order"

582
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,100
itself is abstract.

583
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:25,730
That being said, whether this case falls
under Article 103 of the Civil Law or not

584
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,733
will be judged based on specific points.

585
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,193
For that to happen,

586
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:33,321
we first need to know
whether this agreement exists or not.

587
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,073
Plaintiff's counselor.

588
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,909
Are you sure that the witness
you filed for today is present?

589
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,202
Yes, Your Honor.

590
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:42,622
The witness, Ms. Choi Da-hye,
is already in this courtroom.

591
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,876
Okay, then. Witness.

592
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,462
Step forward.

593
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,688
"I solemnly swear that
I will tell the truth, the whole truth,

594
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,524
and nothing but the truth,

595
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,317
and agree to receive
punishment in accordance with perjury

596
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,820
should there be any falsehood."

597
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,698
Plaintiff's counselor,
you may begin questioning the witness.

598
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:18,741
Okay.

599
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,962
You sold coffee at the gambling house

600
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:33,214
where the defendant and plaintiffs
used to go to, right?

601
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,301
-Yes.
-And do you know Mr. Han Byeong-gil,

602
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:40,638
who used to run small errands
at the same gambling house, well?

603
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:45,017
I wouldn't say I know him well.
We were just coworkers.

604
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:48,187
If I made the coffee,
Byeong-gil would serve it.

605
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,941
On the day of the incident,
Mr. Han cashed in some of the stakes

606
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:54,360
per the request
of the defendant and the plaintiffs

607
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:57,989
and went out and bought
lottery tickets for them.

608
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,782
Witness, were you aware of this?

609
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,409
Yes.

610
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:06,455
I saw Byeong-gil leaving,
so I asked where he was going.

611
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,749
And what was Mr. Han's response?

612
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,836
That he was getting lottery tickets
as an errand for table three.

613
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:17,091
Table three is where the defendant
and the plaintiffs were seated, correct?

614
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:21,888
Yes.

615
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:25,057
So I asked, "Why lottery tickets?"
and he laughed and said,

616
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:30,563
"If one of them wins, it's going to be
split evenly no matter what."

617
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,024
That's a damn lie!

618
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:35,651
Ashtray said all that without you asking?

619
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,446
Defendant, don't interrupt
during witness questioning.

620
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,740
Your Honor, this is all a lie!

621
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:44,243
This woman and Shin Il-su
are seeing each other.

622
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,454
She's in on this!

623
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,413
What?

624
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,415
What did you just say?

625
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:52,043
What kind of nonsense
are you blabbering right now, you bastard?

626
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,461
Hey! Do you have proof?

627
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,963
Do you have proof
that they are seeing each other?

628
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,089
Stay out of this, you bastard!

629
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,466
I should beat you up with this mouse.

630
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,800
Order in the court.

631
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,804
Witness, is what the defendant said true?

632
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,349
Are you giving false testimony because
of your relationship with the plaintiff?

633
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,767
What?

634
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,976
No.

635
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,313
Mr. Shin Il-su and I
are not seeing each other.

636
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:15,942
I'm just telling you exactly
what Byeong-gil said.

637
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:19,320
All right. Plaintiff's counselor,
continue with the questioning.

638
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,239
You brat. Lying whenever…

639
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,035
I will resume questioning.

640
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:55,856
An elite like Tae Su-mi
was in university for six years?

641
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:59,277
And the Jeongui Ilbo
reporter caught a whiff of this.

642
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,194
MEMBERS

643
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,426
What should I do with this?

644
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:38,024
-I'm home.
-Hey.

645
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,569
Young-woo, just a moment.

646
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:43,988
Well…

647
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,364
I was wondering.

648
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,035
Is there anything you want from me?

649
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:53,414
Anything Dad can do for Young-woo?

650
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,500
"Anything Dad can do for Young-woo?"

651
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,087
Well, let's see.

652
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:05,801
Maybe you wanted me to find you a doctor
or counselor who specializes in autism

653
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,679
to take exclusive care of you.

654
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,517
Sometimes,

655
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,772
I thought it would be nice
to have a doctor or counselor like that.

656
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:20,566
I see.

657
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:24,445
When it was too difficult for me to know
what others were thinking or feeling,

658
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,740
when I didn't understand
how I was feeling,

659
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:33,162
or when I got anxious because there was
a sudden loud noise while I was working.

660
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:35,206
Every time something like
that would happen,

661
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,416
I wanted to hear expert advice
on how to handle these situations

662
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,337
or hear about the experiences
of others with autism.

663
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:45,132
Why didn't you tell me any of this?

664
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:48,469
Did you think
I wouldn't be able to afford it?

665
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,138
Well…

666
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,517
I'm not sure.

667
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,894
All right.

668
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,271
You must be tired.
Head upstairs and get some rest.

669
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,398
Okay.

670
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,670
Now, for the verdict.

671
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:27,341
Formal adjudication.
The defendant is ordered to pay

672
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:31,554
a total of 1,403,420,000 won
to each of the plaintiffs.

673
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,432
And the litigation costs
are to be paid by the defendant.

674
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:42,314
At the time of the agreement of this case,
the plaintiffs and the defendant

675
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:46,152
had decided that the winning lottery
ticket was subject to distribution,

676
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:49,405
regardless of the rank
of the winning tickets.

677
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:53,492
Therefore, it cannot be said that there is
no specific target for distribution.

678
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:57,997
Also, the agreement on the distribution
of the prize can't be deemed invalid

679
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,666
merely based on the fact
that the money used

680
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:04,086
to purchase the lottery tickets
came from gambling money.

681
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,756
Four, conclusion.

682
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:11,760
Thus, the plaintiffs' claims
are reasonable and should be cited,

683
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,804
so it is decided

684
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,765
-I know it was rough.
-as per formal adjudication.

685
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:20,519
-Providing for me and the kids
-Presiding Judge Park In-yeong,

686
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,688
-for all these years.
-Judge Jung Hyeon-ju,

687
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:25,566
-I know how hard it was for you.
-Judge Kim Eun-su.

688
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:41,999
Come in.

689
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,295
Gosh, Attorney Woo. Thank you.

690
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,923
Thanks to you, we won.

691
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,716
Yes, congratulations.

692
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:53,677
This is a department store gift card,

693
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,971
so you can treat yourself
to something nice.

694
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:56,931
Well…

695
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:59,725
You already paid
the contingency fee to Hanbada,

696
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:02,019
so you don't have to give me
anything separately.

697
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:05,648
You said gambling is gambling
and an agreement is an agreement, right?

698
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,525
A contingency fee is a contingency fee.

699
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,736
This is just a gift from me to you.

700
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:12,571
Jeez, it's not even that much.

701
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:13,656
No!

702
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:14,782
I can't take it.

703
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,201
Goodness.

704
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,537
All right.

705
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,622
The inflexible Attorney Woo.

706
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,457
Then…

707
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,000
Please,

708
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:26,919
accept this.

709
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:28,879
My wife made it.

710
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,130
Gimbap.

711
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,510
Did I not tell you my wife
runs a snack bar?

712
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,846
-I guarantee that it'll be good.
-Okay, thank you.

713
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,893
What?

714
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,520
Attorney Woo.

715
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:47,231
Can I ask you something?

716
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,191
Yes.

717
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:51,235
If…

718
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:55,531
you get a divorce
after winning the lottery,

719
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,783
does the prize have to be divided as well?

720
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,830
It depends on the specifics,

721
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,457
but according to precedents so far,

722
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:07,751
it doesn't in most cases.

723
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:08,961
The division of assets

724
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:11,964
can be claimed for the assets
jointly accrued by the couple,

725
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:15,718
but a lottery prize
is entirely due to the luck of the winner

726
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,886
and is not subject
to the division of assets.

727
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:22,433
So you're saying
it doesn't have to be divided, right?

728
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,184
Yes. Why do you ask?

729
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,895
It's nothing.
Someone asked me to inquire about it.

730
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,399
Gosh, I better get going.

731
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:33,527
Have a good day, Attorney Woo.

732
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:34,653
Thank you.

733
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:55,799
OH, RIGHT. THE FLOWERS WERE SO PRETTY.

734
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:02,264
I'LL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU, SU-YEON!

735
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,434
Gosh.

736
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:07,645
He's so cute!

737
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:11,357
Su-yeon, you've been through
a divorce, right?

738
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,274
What?

739
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,735
Why would I have been through a divorce?
I haven't even been married yet.

740
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,112
You've taken on divorce cases before.

741
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,989
Right. Yes.

742
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:22,534
If a man asked an attorney

743
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:25,788
about the division of assets
in the case of a divorce,

744
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:28,165
did he have divorce in mind?

745
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,292
There's no way to know
with just that inquiry.

746
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:31,418
Were there any other signs?

747
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,586
Well…

748
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:34,463
A finger heart.

749
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:37,091
The man held up a finger heart

750
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,468
to a woman who is not his wife.

751
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:42,554
Could they be seeing each other?

752
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:45,724
Are you talking about the client
from the lottery case?

753
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,686
The one who came
with his wife on his back?

754
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:53,607
I can't answer that question

755
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,859
because of attorney-client privilege.

756
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:57,694
Then…

757
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,447
Let's call them Mr. Salt and Ms. Pepper.

758
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,032
What?

759
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,409
So, Mr. Salt asked you…

760
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:04,535
I mean…

761
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:05,786
He asked Attorney Soy Sauce

762
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,830
about the division of assets
in the case of a divorce, right?

763
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,666
Mr. Salt asked Attorney Soy Sauce?

764
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:11,959
Right, so…

765
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:15,921
Since you can't speak about the matter
because of attorney-client privilege,

766
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:18,465
she's saying we should
make up fake characters.

767
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:21,260
Like Mr. Salt, Ms. Pepper,

768
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:24,263
and Attorney Soy Sauce.

769
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:25,222
Right.

770
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:26,140
Fake characters.

771
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:27,891
Yes.

772
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:30,060
Mr. Salt asked me.

773
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:34,565
No, he asked Attorney Soy Sauce.

774
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:36,859
The question must have been
about the lottery prize, right?

775
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:40,362
I can't answer if you ask like that.

776
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:43,031
Okay, let me rephrase it then.

777
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:44,616
It must have been a question
about a peculiar property

778
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,201
that he acquired in his own name
during his marriage, right?

779
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:49,538
Yes. To be exact, he asked me
whether this peculiar property

780
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:53,750
is subject to a claim for division
of assets in the event of a divorce.

781
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,294
I mean, he asked Attorney Soy Sauce.

782
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,630
-And Ms. Pepper has no idea?
-No.

783
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:01,717
Is there anything
that Mr. Salt promised Ms. Pepper?

784
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,968
For example, if he won…

785
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:06,513
I mean, perhaps he expressed
his intention to give a conditional gift

786
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,016
to Ms. Pepper
if he acquired a peculiar property.

787
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,642
It would be better if there was proof.

788
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,188
I'm not sure.

789
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,356
I would have to ask Ms. Pepper.

790
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,276
I haven't taken on a lot of divorce cases,

791
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,279
but ultimately, securing evidence
is also the key to said cases.

792
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:24,281
If there's no evidence, it'll only turn
into a psychological battle.

793
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:27,284
Like appealing to the judge's
emotions about who is more pitiful.

794
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:31,538
But Attorney Soy Sauce cannot give

795
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,416
any legal advice to Ms. Pepper.

796
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,960
Right, because Mr. Salt was her client.

797
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:40,214
Attorney Soy Sauce
must be in a difficult position.

798
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:49,056
HAPPY HOUSE

799
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:57,022
So what do you want us to do?

800
00:46:57,105 --> 00:47:00,234
Are you saying we should
at least tell Ms. Sung Eun-ji?

801
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,487
That we think Mr. Shin
is planning to divorce her?

802
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:06,156
That way Ms. Sung can come up
with her own contingency-

803
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,282
Who are you?

804
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,786
-What?
-"Article 26 of the Attorney-at-law Act."

805
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:13,372
"No attorney or former attorney
shall divulge any confidential matter

806
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:15,541
that he or she has learned in the course
of performing his or her duties."

807
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:19,628
What happened to Attorney Woo Young-woo,

808
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:22,839
who was so strict about the law
to the point where she was inflexible?

809
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,341
Ma'am, who are you?

810
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:27,970
What?

811
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,556
Mr. Shin Il-su was our client.

812
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:34,851
Who he sent a heart to
and what he asked you…

813
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,062
Aren't all these the client's secrets?

814
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,691
Don't even think about saying a peep.

815
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:42,526
Especially to Ms. Sung Eun-ji.

816
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:43,652
Got it?

817
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:02,504
The gimbap made by Ms. Sung is special.

818
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:04,923
Because there's fried tofu inside.

819
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,383
Yes, I can taste it.

820
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:10,804
The Woo Young-woo gimbap that
my father makes does not have fried tofu.

821
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:15,726
Fried tofu that is finely chopped
and boiled down in soy sauce.

822
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,186
Savory…

823
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,272
and sweet.

824
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,566
Soft…

825
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,401
but rough.

826
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:25,777
Fried tofu!

827
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:28,447
Has fried tofu replaced whales?

828
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:32,784
So isn't it okay to go to Happy House
to buy fried tofu gimbap?

829
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,203
That's not a violation
of the Attorney-at-Law Act!

830
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,417
Why bother asking me
if you were going to go anyway?

831
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:43,754
Why did she even come?

832
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,803
We are on our way
to buy fried tofu gimbap,

833
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,264
not to violate the Attorney-at-Law Act.

834
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:55,557
Yes, of course.

835
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,776
Why?

836
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,695
-Why?
-Honey!

837
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,280
It's my money to use!

838
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,115
Who are you to tell me what to do?

839
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,201
We have two kids!

840
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:18,246
We have two little kids
who we have to provide for!

841
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:21,333
How can a father be so thoughtless?

842
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:24,670
Aren't you sick and tired
of constantly having to move

843
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:28,090
because we don't have
a house or a shop of our own?

844
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:30,926
I'm sick of it.
I'm sick of your complaints!

845
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:32,678
Honey!

846
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,474
I'm so sick of them.

847
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:23,937
Are you okay?

848
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:27,816
You're from Hanbada.

849
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,277
What are you doing here?

850
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:33,780
Attorney Woo told me
the fried tofu gimbap here is special.

851
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:38,577
We came to get gimbap
and saw the two of you arguing.

852
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,122
He said he wants to buy this

853
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,250
with the money he gets
from winning the lawsuit.

854
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:50,756
In our situation, does it make sense to
get a car that costs over 300 million won?

855
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:52,466
Right.

856
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:55,552
It must be really hard for you.

857
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:58,847
My husband might have been a gambler,

858
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,185
but he was sweet and kind
to me and the children.

859
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,438
That's the one thing
that got me through to this day.

860
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:12,402
But how could a person
change like that in an instant?

861
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:18,533
How much more do I have to take and wait

862
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,620
for him to come to his senses?

863
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:28,043
The sperm whale written about
in Moby-Dick, the classic American novel.

864
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:31,213
This is the first time
a sperm whale was seen in the East Sea…

865
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:44,184
You should know when to be flexible!

866
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:47,854
Excuse me, Attorney Woo?

867
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:50,106
No!

868
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,317
I'm not an attorney. I'm a customer.

869
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,027
One fried tofu gimbap, please.

870
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:58,782
As you can see, the ingredients are all on
the floor, so I have to make them again.

871
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:00,784
Then please do that.

872
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:02,577
We will wait.

873
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,538
But…

874
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:06,706
Okay.

875
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,334
Take a seat over there.

876
00:52:11,127 --> 00:52:13,713
-It'll take a while.
-Okay.

877
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:24,683
Jun-ho.

878
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:29,563
Do you know the story

879
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,732
of Mr. Salt, Ms. Pepper,
and Attorney Soy Sauce?

880
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:35,235
No, I don't.

881
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:38,446
Once upon a time, there lived Mr. Salt.

882
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:43,076
He married Ms. Pepper
and recently acquired a peculiar property.

883
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:44,828
"Peculiar property"?

884
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:46,121
What's that?

885
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:50,500
It refers to an asset
that one had before marriage

886
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:53,461
or an asset acquired
in their own name during the marriage.

887
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:56,798
Peculiar properties are excluded
from a division of assets claim

888
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:59,342
in the event of a divorce
because each makes profits--

889
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,552
So…

890
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:04,556
For example, like the prize
from winning the lottery?

891
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:07,100
Yes. That could be an example.

892
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:12,355
Mr. Salt wanted to know
if he had to divide this peculiar property

893
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:15,817
if he were to divorce Ms. Pepper.

894
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:21,364
And Attorney Soy Sauce replied
that he most likely wouldn't have to.

895
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:22,324
Excuse me.

896
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:24,910
Are you talking about my husband?

897
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:26,745
No.

898
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:31,374
I was talking to Jun-ho about Mr. Salt,
Ms. Pepper, and Attorney Soy Sauce.

899
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,376
What do you mean he asked
if he has to divide the prize

900
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,461
if he gets a divorce?

901
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:38,048
My husband wouldn't do that.

902
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:41,927
You might have misunderstood
after seeing what just happened.

903
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:44,179
The day he won the lawsuit,

904
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:46,389
he promised he'd give me all of the prize

905
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,808
with tears running down his face.

906
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:52,145
We cried in each other's arms
and he told me

907
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:54,731
that the kids and I
would have a better life now.

908
00:53:56,733 --> 00:54:00,820
Apparently, Mr. Salt promised
to give Ms. Pepper

909
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,156
the whole prize while crying.

910
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,408
I heard this from Ms. Pepper.

911
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:11,748
Did Ms. Pepper have the promise
put in writing or recorded?

912
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:15,001
Was the promise put in…

913
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:18,713
What kind of married couple
does something like that?

914
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:21,591
Right. Apparently, there's none of that.

915
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:29,432
Can you let Ms. Pepper know
that it's not too late?

916
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:34,396
She must at least find a witness
who heard Mr. Salt making such a promise.

917
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:37,691
Evidence is necessary to receive

918
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,359
Mr. Salt's peculiar property!

919
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,492
Really?

920
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:52,831
You know, Su-yeon,

921
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:55,125
I'm personally not that interested
in things like the lottery.

922
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:56,376
You're not?

923
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,837
Are you the type of person
that's not fazed by money?

924
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:01,339
Well, not exactly…

925
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:04,009
I won the lottery.

926
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,135
What?

927
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:08,513
You're my lottery, Su-yeon.

928
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:09,931
Goodness.

929
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,308
Jong-gwon.

930
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:16,438
-I'm going to go use the restroom.
-Okay.

931
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:33,788
-What?
-Are you a doctor too?

932
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:34,873
Excuse me?

933
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:36,124
Or a prosecutor?

934
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:37,792
Attorney?

935
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,462
Judge, accountant, certified appraiser?

936
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:42,422
Who are you?

937
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:43,548
What's wrong with you?

938
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,301
Seeing as he brought you
to this steak house,

939
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:48,470
it must be about two weeks
since you met him, right?

940
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,722
Eat up today.

941
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:53,767
Today's most likely going to be
the last day he spends his money.

942
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,561
And from now on,
he'll keep saying he lost his wallet.

943
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:59,856
What are you saying right--

944
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,941
You still don't know what I'm saying?

945
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:06,946
That bastard, Lee Jong-gwon.

946
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,282
He only goes after women with elite jobs.

947
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:13,453
He's a bastard who uses women's feelings
to take money from them.

948
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,711
He gave you flowers, right?

949
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:24,047
He probably went on about the meaning too.

950
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:25,131
Right.

951
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:27,675
Did you drink
the "don't-get-sick cocktail"?

952
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:31,888
The honey water
with all these ingredients mixed in.

953
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:34,015
-"Good-for-your-body."
-What?

954
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:37,519
I had the "good-for-your-body cocktail."

955
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:43,441
Hey, Lee Jong-gwon.

956
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:48,071
You said you had to make money
for your father's operation.

957
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:49,531
That's why you were going to work
on a fishing trawler.

958
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:51,324
Does this look like
a fishing trawler to you, you bastard?

959
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:53,284
Do you catch fish while you eat steak?

960
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:56,663
-Su-yeon, hold on.
-Give me back my money.

961
00:56:57,288 --> 00:57:00,667
Give me back my 50 million won you took
for your supposed father's surgery!

962
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,419
Su-yeon, this is my business partner.

963
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:05,046
What business partner?

964
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,841
Hey, what did you use the money for?
You said it was for your father's surgery.

965
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,927
-Su-yeon, wait. What's wrong with you?
-What did you use it for?

966
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,680
-What's wrong with me?
-Su-yeon, just a moment!

967
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:14,973
You really don't know?

968
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:19,394
-You're making a mistake right now.
-Mistake?

969
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:21,646
Give me the most expensive drink here.

970
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:24,232
-Su-yeon, I can explain everything.
-Excuse me? A drink?

971
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:27,610
You have so many bottles behind you.
Give me the most expensive one.

972
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:28,736
That bastard will…

973
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:31,114
-I mean…
-My father passed away.

974
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:32,115
He'll pay for it.

975
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,576
Hurry up!

976
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:35,743
All right.

977
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:39,330
Here you go.

978
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:46,129
Hey, Su-yeon. I'll see you on Wednesday.
I'll call you. I can explain everything.

979
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:16,576
It really doesn't take long
for a person to show their true colors.

980
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:21,581
Now, he's asking for a divorce outright.

981
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,251
He hits me

982
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,754
and smashes everything in the house.

983
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:31,090
He comes to the shop every day
and gets in the way of my business.

984
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,217
Two days ago,

985
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:37,347
my oldest kid charged at him
to try to stop him.

986
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:41,726
He even hit his own kid.

987
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:46,481
I can still picture how Mr. Shin
came in here with you on his back.

988
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:50,610
His drastic change
must be so hard for you.

989
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:52,153
I don't want to…

990
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:55,240
live with this kind of man anymore.

991
00:58:56,783 --> 00:59:00,245
I made all the money,

992
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,832
did all the chores, and raised the kids
all by myself anyway.

993
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:10,129
But I want to receive
a proper division of assets.

994
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,466
That's why I came back to see you.

995
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:18,930
That man received the prize
through his older brother's bank account

996
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:21,558
just in case I'd go after it.

997
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:25,144
He just doesn't want to share
a single penny with me.

998
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:27,939
Has he ever made a promise

999
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:31,818
to share the prize with you
before he changed all of a sudden?

1000
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:35,697
You said last time that I needed proof.

1001
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:37,740
-What?
-Excuse me?

1002
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:43,746
Well…

1003
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:48,334
I had a customer at my shop
who was also an attorney.

1004
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,712
Right. Soy Sauce!

1005
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:51,879
Attorney Soy Sauce.

1006
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:53,047
"Soy Sauce"?

1007
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:54,549
Yes.

1008
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:59,887
Well, anyway, I tried to get proof
like the other attorney told me.

1009
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:01,931
I sent my husband texts

1010
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:04,267
and tried recording our phone calls.

1011
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,853
But he seemed to be onto me already

1012
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:09,856
because he just played dumb
and asked if I'm trying to get proof.

1013
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:11,816
Then are there no witnesses?

1014
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:16,404
Someone who heard him promising
to split or give the prize to you.

1015
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:19,532
No. We talked about it when we were alone.

1016
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:23,244
I'm sorry to break it to you,

1017
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:26,456
but we can't take on this lawsuit.

1018
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:29,542
We already represented Mr. Shin Il-su
in a different case.

1019
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:32,879
And this case is relevant to that one.

1020
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:37,800
Can we introduce you to another attorney
who specializes in divorce?

1021
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:39,218
And one who is good at it.

1022
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,304
I would appreciate it.

1023
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,683
But how do you feel about it?

1024
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:49,187
Is there a possibility for me
to get some of the prize?

1025
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:54,233
You should talk to the attorney in charge
about the specifics,

1026
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:55,943
but my personal opinion is that

1027
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:58,738
the chances of you
legally winning are low.

1028
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:03,910
As of right now, I think the best way
would be to try to get as much alimony

1029
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:06,079
and child support expenses as possible.

1030
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:24,597
Thank you so much for the ride back.

1031
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,724
We're just here to buy fried tofu gimbap.

1032
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:29,352
We're just here to buy fried tofu gimbap.

1033
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:32,939
I'll make them extra delicious for you.

1034
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:51,082
Goodness.

1035
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:54,711
You met with an attorney?

1036
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,213
I should have known.

1037
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:58,840
That's why you weren't
signing the divorce papers.

1038
01:01:58,923 --> 01:02:00,133
So what?

1039
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:02,009
Are you going to sue me?

1040
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,512
Jeez, he's here early today.

1041
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:05,638
Come here.

1042
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:08,433
Come here!

1043
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:10,977
Can we avoid him for now?

1044
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,020
He's here to cause a scene
to get me to sign the divorce papers.

1045
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:15,356
-Yes, let's go back to the car.
-Okay.

1046
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:17,316
That little…

1047
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:48,723
Attorney Woo, are you all right?

1048
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:51,726
Ms. Sung.

1049
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:53,436
Are you hurt?

1050
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:57,148
Ms. Sung.

1051
01:03:04,071 --> 01:03:06,032
Honey!

1052
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:08,034
-Honey!
-Sir!

1053
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:09,744
-Wake up!
-Ms. Sung, it's dangerous.

1054
01:03:09,827 --> 01:03:11,662
-Honey!
-Wait here while I call 911.

1055
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:12,789
Honey!

1056
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:15,124
-Somebody call 911, please!
-Honey!

1057
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,250
Oh, no. Ms. Sung!

1058
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:18,836
Ms. Sung, please!

1059
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,839
-Goodness.
-Sir.

1060
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:24,592
Ms. Sung, no!

1061
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:26,886
-Please, it's dangerous!
-Honey!

1062
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:28,888
-Honey!
-Someone call 911!

1063
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:30,681
-Honey!
-Ms. Shin!

1064
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:47,573
Attorney Woo. It's okay.

1065
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:49,659
It's okay, Attorney Woo.

1066
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:54,247
It's okay, Attorney Woo.

1067
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:02,338
Tighter.

1068
01:04:12,723 --> 01:04:14,016
Tighter.

1069
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:33,119
Ms. Sung Eun-ji came to see me
and Attorney Jung today.

1070
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:34,203
Really?

1071
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:37,164
I haven't seen her
since Mr. Shin's funeral.

1072
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:38,165
Is she doing okay?

1073
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:41,669
Yes, she didn't bring fried tofu gimbap

1074
01:04:41,752 --> 01:04:44,297
because she closed her shop for now,

1075
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:46,507
but she had good news.

1076
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:50,595
Ms. Sung and her kids will be inheriting
the remaining 1.1 billion won

1077
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:53,890
from the lottery prize that Mr. Shin left.

1078
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:58,102
Because he was still married
at the time of his death.

1079
01:04:58,185 --> 01:05:00,938
Gosh. So that’s how things turned out.

1080
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:05,985
On top of that,
they will receive 300 million won

1081
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:08,070
from his life insurance.

1082
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:10,114
So a total of 1.4 billion won.

1083
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:16,120
The same amount that was distributed
to him through the trial.

1084
01:05:16,203 --> 01:05:17,914
That 1.4 billion

1085
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:20,917
really took a long way to find its owner.

1086
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:33,763
I wanted to thank you for hugging me

1087
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:36,891
when we witnessed

1088
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:39,602
Mr. Shin's death.

1089
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:41,604
Oh, that?

1090
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:46,067
It's fine.

1091
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:48,778
For people with autism--

1092
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:52,406
Anxiety can be relieved
if pressure is put on the body

1093
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:53,908
during sensory overload, right?

1094
01:05:55,242 --> 01:05:56,202
Yes…

1095
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:59,205
Yes, that's right.

1096
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:03,501
In France, they have hug chairs
for people with autism.

1097
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,252
Hug chairs?

1098
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:09,006
Yes, the back is blocked like this,

1099
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:12,218
and when someone sits down,
the inside of the chair swells up

1100
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:14,178
and hugs the person really tight.

1101
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:16,847
You can control the pressure
with the remote control too.

1102
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:21,310
Can I buy that chair in Korea?

1103
01:06:23,854 --> 01:06:25,773
Do you really have to buy one?

1104
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:27,692
What?

1105
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:31,696
I'll be one for you.

1106
01:06:32,738 --> 01:06:34,824
Your personal hug chair.

1107
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:22,473
Come in.

1108
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:35,194
Hello, Attorney Tae.

1109
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:37,655
My name is Kwon Min-woo.

1110
01:08:38,739 --> 01:08:40,783
Thank you for making time for me.

1111
01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:44,286
From what I heard from my secretary,
you left me no choice but to do so.

1112
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:46,622
What on earth is the reason

1113
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:50,167
you had to see me?

1114
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:55,422
I would like to work for you at Taesan.

1115
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:58,759
That's something
you should talk to HR about.

1116
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:01,345
Why don't you apply next year?

1117
01:09:01,428 --> 01:09:06,225
I'll be sure to remember your name,
Attorney Kwon.

1118
01:09:07,184 --> 01:09:08,978
I work at Hanbada…

1119
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:12,106
with Attorney Woo Young-woo.

1120
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:21,949
You took a break from university
during your senior year in 1995

1121
01:09:22,032 --> 01:09:24,243
and went back 2 years later in 1997.

1122
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:26,620
You told people
that you were leaving to study abroad,

1123
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:29,039
but there are no specific records of that.

1124
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:33,210
Most importantly, in 1996 while you were
taking a break from school,

1125
01:09:34,795 --> 01:09:36,463
Attorney Woo was born.

1126
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:39,758
What…

1127
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:41,844
are you doing?

1128
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:44,680
I'm trying to impress you, Attorney Tae.

1129
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:48,309
I want to work at a firm where
knowing the secrets of other people

1130
01:09:48,392 --> 01:09:50,728
can be my strength and weapon.

1131
01:09:51,395 --> 01:09:53,272
I want to work at a firm
where attorneys know

1132
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:57,443
how to take risks to win
and to be political if needed.

1133
01:09:57,943 --> 01:10:00,487
The way I see it, Taesan is like that,
but not Hanbada.

1134
01:10:01,655 --> 01:10:04,366
I don't want to become weak by working
under a hypocritical senior lawyer,

1135
01:10:05,075 --> 01:10:06,744
who only pretends to be nice.

1136
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:28,641
It's not enough to know
other people's secrets.

1137
01:10:29,975 --> 01:10:31,185
You have to be capable.

1138
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:32,686
I am capable.

1139
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:34,230
Then show me.

1140
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:38,400
You said you work
with Attorney Woo, right?

1141
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:41,779
-Yes.
-Do you think you can make

1142
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:46,992
Attorney Woo quit Hanbada?

1143
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:48,953
Excuse me?

1144
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:51,956
It doesn't matter
if she quits or gets fired.

1145
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:54,625
Why would you want that?

1146
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:56,460
That's not your business.

1147
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:03,175
If you make this happen, Attorney Kwon,

1148
01:11:03,717 --> 01:11:05,386
you'll become an attorney at Taesan…

1149
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,138
working directly under me.

1150
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:11,809
Yes, ma'am.

1151
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:13,435
I understand.

1152
01:11:27,908 --> 01:11:29,326
"Employees who are married
within the company

1153
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:31,412
are eligible for voluntary resignation."

1154
01:11:31,495 --> 01:11:32,913
-Condemn!
-She is loud.

1155
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:34,039
I've never seen
an attorney like her before.

1156
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:36,667
All this was a trick
that Hanbada taught Mir Life.

1157
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:41,797
It's the judge's job to decide
which side is socially just, not ours!

1158
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,341
But attorneys are human.

1159
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:45,384
Are we…

1160
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,344
dating?

1161
01:11:47,428 --> 01:11:48,512
We're still not officially together?

1162
01:11:48,595 --> 01:11:51,015
That really…

1163
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:53,726
just hurts me, you know that?

1164
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:59,940
