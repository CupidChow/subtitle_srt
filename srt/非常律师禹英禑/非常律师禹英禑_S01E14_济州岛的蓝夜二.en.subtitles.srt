1
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,937
Is there really a law
that states that even those

2
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:06,066
who did not view a cultural heritage
must pay the admission fee?

3
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,026
May I go on a business trip?

4
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,110
Where to?

5
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,278
Jeju Island.

6
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,614
I'll do my best to earn my keep

7
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,075
since I'm taking
several rookie attorneys with me.

8
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,952
I don't get what we're all doing.
I'm already busy as it is.

9
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,079
And then we'll go

10
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,206
to the meat noodle restaurant
you recommended.

11
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,499
Gosh.

12
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,417
It looks like it's been closed
for quite some time.

13
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,211
Haengbok Noodles
makes the best meat noodles.

14
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,296
Have you been to Hwangjisa?

15
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,548
What you see isn't everything.

16
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,885
Don't be blinded by what you can see.

17
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,430
Keep in mind the essence
of what lies beyond that.

18
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,099
Why are you acting
like a grown-up all of a sudden?

19
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,893
I'm not acting like a grown-up.

20
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,188
I am one.

21
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,648
Hey, Jun-ho, you're here.

22
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:47,982
Jun-ho.

23
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,859
You're not going to
tell our parents, right?

24
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,654
We just want you to be happy.

25
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:56,699
You should bring home a girl
who can make you happy.

26
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,576
Not someone you have to take care of.

27
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,246
Attorney Jung!

28
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,207
-Are you all right?
-Are you okay?

29
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:14,259
CASE 14
THE BLUE NIGHT OF JEJU II

30
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:18,847
They say Korea is number one in the world
for treating stomach cancer.

31
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,601
And mine's not even stage four.
It's stage three, so it should be fine.

32
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:24,978
Don't worry too much.

33
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,231
No, I'm going to
finish up the Hwangjisa case here

34
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,567
and will get surgery
as soon as I'm back in Seoul.

35
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,529
Okay, ma'am. Bye.

36
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,741
Korea might be number one in the world
for treating stomach cancer,

37
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,286
but you shouldn't think it'll be okay
because it's stage three.

38
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,954
Stage three stomach cancer
is the stage in which the cancer

39
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,247
has grown into the muscle,
subserosa, or serosa layers,

40
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,999
or spread to the surrounding lymph nodes.

41
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,667
Despite surgery,
its recurrence rate is high

42
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,919
so supplementary chemotherapy
is recommended.

43
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,547
Plus, the five-year survival rate
is only about 30 to 40 percent.

44
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,133
The five-year survival rate is that low?

45
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:00,346
Attorney Jung,
did you make a surgery appointment?

46
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,931
Of course.

47
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,350
I booked a surgery
at the hospital in Seoul

48
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,769
where I got diagnosed
before coming to Jeju.

49
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:10,481
I'm doing fine on my own,
so don't worry about me.

50
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:13,902
Shouldn't you eat a bit more?

51
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:14,986
You barely had a bite.

52
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:18,615
I have no appetite and my stomach
gets upset if I force myself to eat.

53
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,659
Then should I ask them
to make you some porridge?

54
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,119
No, it's all right.

55
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,204
I doubt it'll be any different.

56
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,414
Well…

57
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,750
What about meat noodles?

58
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,460
Meat noodles from Haengbok Noodles.

59
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,505
Haengbok Noodles!
But they're not in business.

60
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,425
What if we find the owner
of Haengbok Noodles and ask them?

61
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:42,013
That it's for an attorney who might die
of stage three stomach cancer?

62
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,642
There's no need for that.

63
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,061
Don't think about
doing anything unnecessary

64
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,854
and just focus on the Hwangjisa case.

65
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:51,731
Understood?

66
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:55,276
What do we have to do
to find the owner of Haengbok Noodles?

67
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,778
You're really going to?

68
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,822
Attorney Jung said not to do
anything unnecessary.

69
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,117
Attorney Jung did say
not to do anything unnecessary,

70
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,620
but I never agreed to that.

71
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,080
Gosh.

72
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,123
I raised her well.

73
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,708
Attorney Jung…

74
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,378
might not have a lot of time left to live.

75
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:17,382
If not now, he might never
be able to eat Haengbok Noodles again.

76
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,508
You're right.

77
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,386
They do say we only regret
the chances we didn't take.

78
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:24,639
It's been bothering me a bit too.

79
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:30,186
He did seem quite disappointed
while eating at Haengun Noodles.

80
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,356
Then shall we all
look for the owner together?

81
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,361
Why are you so quiet?

82
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,445
What do you mean?

83
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,907
I mean, this is usually when you would
say something and sound like a jerk.

84
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,620
"Why would we all do that together?
You guys do it. I'm out."

85
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,080
I mean, well…

86
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,041
It wouldn't be a bad thing
if we can find the owner.

87
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,794
I wanted to try those meat noodles too.

88
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,171
It must be really delicious
for him to describe them like that.

89
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,674
Are you sure you're not
the one who's sick?

90
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,884
I heard people suddenly change
when they're nearing death.

91
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,138
What did I do? Why are you…

92
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,180
All right.

93
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,934
We have to canvass the area
to find the owner's whereabouts.

94
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,811
Instead of going in one group,

95
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,271
should we split up into teams?

96
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,981
How do we split up into teams?

97
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,232
We'll do "up or down."

98
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,358
You mean "down or up"?

99
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,609
No, "up or down."

100
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,694
Are you talking about "dedenjji"?

101
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:22,030
Every region has
a different name for this.

102
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,489
Jeju's version is really long.

103
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,867
"Sky and land.
Even if you know, you don't know."

104
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,578
"This is real, this is fake.
Even if you don't win, it's useless."

105
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,620
Something like this.

106
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,665
For us, it's just
"sky is land, sky is land."

107
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,751
No, in my neighborhood, it was…

108
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,503
Well…

109
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,839
In your neighborhood, what?

110
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,215
Spit it out. What is it?

111
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,051
In my neighborhood, it's…

112
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,929
"Up or down. Can't say a thing even
if you lose. Shove crap in your trap."

113
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,514
We do it like that in my neighborhood.

114
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,685
"Shove crap in your trap!"

115
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,984
-We'll just go with "up or down."
-Okay.

116
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,946
Up or down!

117
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,076
Again.

118
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,786
Up or down!

119
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,454
Again.

120
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,082
Up or down!

121
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,917
Gosh, seriously.

122
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,170
You two should just team up.
You're so in sync.

123
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,798
Yes, and we don't have to
split into groups of three.

124
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,842
Then Geu-ra-mi, Jun-ho, Mr. Hairy,
and I will be on one team.

125
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,803
Su-yeon and Attorney Kwon
will be on one team.

126
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,429
-Done.
-Why? No.

127
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,307
-Let's do it again!
-We will now start investigating in teams.

128
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,809
Hey, let's do it again, okay?

129
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,228
-Up or down!
-Isn't "shove crap in your trap" funny?

130
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:41,901
HAENGUN NOODLES

131
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,987
THE ORIGINAL FLAVOR OF MEAT NOODLES!
INTRODUCED ON VARIOUS PROGRAMS

132
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:52,620
Welcome.

133
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,789
-Just a moment.
-Okay.

134
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,127
Thank you.

135
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,169
Welcome.

136
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,297
Could we ask you something?

137
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,757
Wait.

138
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,677
Weren't you here to eat recently?

139
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,637
Yes, that's right. We're--

140
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,431
Do you know where we can find
the owner of Haengbok Noodles?

141
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,060
The owner of Haengbok Noodles?

142
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,690
Why are you looking for him?

143
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:24,318
Well, we remember it being in business
the last time we were in Jeju,

144
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,113
but when we went this time,
it seemed like it was closed.

145
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:31,617
So we were just wondering
if you know what happened.

146
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,078
What do you think? He fell behind.

147
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:35,496
Fell behind?

148
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,414
He fell behind.

149
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:41,377
Our restaurant grew,
so he lost his place in the market.

150
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:46,132
The man tried so hard
to match our quality.

151
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:49,051
But he couldn't beat the original.

152
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,388
They've been out of business for a while
since they had no customers.

153
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,514
"Original"?

154
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,933
Haengun Noodles is the original?

155
00:07:56,601 --> 00:08:00,480
So he named Haengbok Noodles
after Haengun Noodles too?

156
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,898
Yes.

157
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:02,982
That's right.

158
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:08,237
I've already had enough stress
from dealing with Haengbok Noodles.

159
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,616
Just hearing the name gives me a headache.

160
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,952
-I'm done talking about them, okay?
-Excuse me.

161
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,329
Yes, just a second!

162
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,292
Darn it.

163
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,628
I'm going to go get some fresh air.

164
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:24,712
I'm sorry.

165
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,636
I have no clue where he went.

166
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:36,682
You can ask anyone in this neighborhood,
but I doubt anyone knows.

167
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,519
He just closed his restaurant
and disappeared overnight

168
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,354
without letting anyone know
where he was going.

169
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:44,357
Why would he close his restaurant?
Do you know?

170
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,526
He couldn't keep up.

171
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,860
With that, you know.

172
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,029
-With what?
-What could it be?

173
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,155
Trend.

174
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:55,368
Even those people were at Haengun Noodles.

175
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,912
What were they called again?

176
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,539
You know, on the Internet.

177
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,623
Celebrities?

178
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,624
Celebs?

179
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,334
Gosh, no!

180
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,002
Influencers!

181
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,720
While Haengun Noodles was always on TV

182
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:18,849
and crowded with influencers and celebs,

183
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,979
Haengbok Noodles couldn't do the same.

184
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,565
So what could they do
other than be pushed out?

185
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:30,987
But the noodles at Haengbok Noodles
really did taste amazing.

186
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:35,241
Did you think Haengbok Noodles
was better than Haengun Noodles too?

187
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:40,580
Haengbok Noodles was run
by a mother and her son for a long time.

188
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:45,876
The broth made by the mother
was very bejigeun.

189
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,296
It was delicious.

190
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,798
Goodness, it's a shame.

191
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,887
Can you clean that part too? I'm sorry.

192
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,681
I'm late. Yes.

193
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,558
Have a good night.

194
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:08,858
Damn it.

195
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:14,155
HAENGUN NOODLES

196
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,153
HAENGBOK NOODLES

197
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,697
Haengbok Noodles.

198
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:34,735
My gosh.

199
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,153
Goodness.

200
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,071
Who…

201
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,865
You're the chef at Haengun Noodles, right?

202
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,411
What are you doing here?

203
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:44,995
Well…

204
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,123
Well, I…

205
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:54,839
To tell you the truth,

206
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,007
he taught me everything.

207
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:00,719
By "he," do you mean
the owner of Haengbok Noodles?

208
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:01,762
Yes.

209
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,265
To be honest,

210
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,560
I worked in this kitchen for a long time.

211
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:11,647
Although, I'm still not
as good as the owner or his mother.

212
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,609
So did you move to Haengun Noodles
because Haengbok Noodles closed?

213
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,070
No.

214
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,990
When I was still working
at Haengbok Noodles,

215
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,826
the owner of Haengun Noodles…

216
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,745
recruited me.

217
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,000
But I guess the owner of Haengbok Noodles

218
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,918
doesn't see it like that,

219
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,546
but rather that I betrayed him.

220
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,968
But I do want to make one thing clear.

221
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,220
Haengbok Noodles is the original.

222
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:47,808
Haengbok Noodles was doing well because
word got out about how good they were.

223
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:51,312
So the owner of Haengun recruited me
and asked me to make the noodles.

224
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,064
He even changed the name
to Haengun Noodles.

225
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,610
Haengun Noodles used to be BuBu Diner

226
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,153
and they sold home-cooked meals.

227
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,237
I see.

228
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,909
So after stealing all the customers
from Haengbok Noodles

229
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,328
and going on television,

230
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,705
Haengun Noodles became a stable business

231
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:12,041
while things got tough
for Haengbok Noodles.

232
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,835
Eventually, he closed his restaurant.

233
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,380
Do you know where he went?

234
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:20,966
Well…

235
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:26,013
I came here once, without the owner
of Haengun Noodles knowing.

236
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,848
I asked him where he would go

237
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,600
and what he would do if they closed.

238
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,310
And?

239
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,689
He laughed

240
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:41,779
and said he would relax at a place where
the mountains and waters are nice.

241
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,616
"A place where
the mountains and waters are nice."

242
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,201
Where could that be?

243
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,744
Is he even in Jeju?

244
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,580
The chef doesn't know that either.

245
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:55,209
Just that he'd go relax at a place
where the mountains and waters are nice.

246
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,921
That could literally be anywhere.
This is becoming a headache.

247
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,800
"A place where
the mountains and waters are nice."

248
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,635
Don't get too caught up on that.

249
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,262
It's just an idiomatic phrase.

250
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,639
It means a place
with beautiful natural scenery.

251
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,767
That's right. When people say
good mountains and waters,

252
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,311
they usually mean
the scenery is beautiful.

253
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:15,896
Right.

254
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,942
Then could it perhaps have anything to do
with Mountain Water Nursing Home?

255
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,195
Mountain Water Nursing Home?

256
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,074
There was a pile of unopened mail
in front of Haengbok Noodles.

257
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:30,369
Most of them were sent
from Mountain Water Nursing Home.

258
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,956
Do you remember the address?

259
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,885
Thirty Gyeongo-ro, Hanbaek-eup,
Jeju-si, Jeju-do.

260
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,178
Open parenthesis, Sansu-dong 1037,
close parenthesis.

261
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,639
Mountain Water Nursing Home is in Jeju.

262
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,143
Gosh! That's great.

263
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,145
Then we just have to go
to the nursing home

264
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,646
and ask where the owner is.

265
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,023
I'll go.

266
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,816
I want to go too.

267
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,109
Okay, sure.

268
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:11,327
MOUNTAIN WATER NURSING HOME

269
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,377
Hello, can I ask you a question?

270
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,254
Yes.

271
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,965
We were at this restaurant
called Haengbok Noodles.

272
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:29,136
But it was closed and all this mail
was just scattered on the ground.

273
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,304
I see.

274
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,389
Maybe it was being sent
to the wrong address?

275
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,100
Oh, this man?

276
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,435
Do you know him?

277
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:39,730
Yes, his mother is staying
at our nursing home.

278
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:42,024
He makes sure to visit
at least once a month,

279
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,193
so I didn't know
he wasn't getting our mail.

280
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,987
-He was here yesterday too.
-He was here yesterday?

281
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:47,988
Yes.

282
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,281
I see.

283
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:54,745
Then could we maybe
meet his mother for a moment?

284
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,246
Sorry? What for?

285
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:57,790
Well…

286
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:00,834
We're curious to know
when Haengbok Noodles will be open again.

287
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,671
We came a long way
because we heard about their meat noodles.

288
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,797
I see.

289
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,217
But even if you do meet her,
it'll probably be hard to get an answer.

290
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,762
She has severe dementia, so it's hard
to have a normal conversation with her.

291
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,431
I see.

292
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,310
I think the owner is in Jeju

293
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,814
since he comes here once a month
to see his mother.

294
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:25,192
Yes, but he'll be back in a month.

295
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,236
Even if we wait here,

296
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,781
we won't be able to meet him
before we go back to Seoul.

297
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:38,747
Hello?

298
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,833
Attorney Woo, where are you?

299
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,670
Well…

300
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,383
-It's none of your business.
-What?

301
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,593
What did you just say?

302
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,680
We're totally not looking
for the owner of Haengbok Noodles.

303
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:58,934
So did you find him?

304
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,520
What? No, not yet.

305
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,898
Attorney Woo,

306
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:08,485
we came to Jeju
because of the Hwangjisa case, right?

307
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,696
So let's focus on preparing for the trial.

308
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,613
Right.

309
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:13,866
Yes, okay.

310
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,631
In 1983,

311
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,592
when the government announced

312
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,803
the construction of Local Highway
Number 3008 on Hwangjisa's property,

313
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,513
what was Hwangjisa's position
on the matter?

314
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:39,725
We were against
the construction of the road.

315
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,145
Because it would destroy
the temple's environment

316
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,522
and disturb the monks' practice.

317
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:51,487
Most importantly, building a road
meant countless lives would be taken.

318
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,655
Countless trees would be cut down,

319
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:58,827
and countless animals and people
would lose their lives to car accidents.

320
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,080
Did the government
proceed with the construction

321
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,706
despite Hwangjisa's objection?

322
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,999
Yes.

323
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,378
Instead, they told us to collect
cultural heritage admission fees.

324
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:11,507
So we agreed.

325
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,343
Why did you agree?

326
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:17,638
Was it because the admission fees
were enough to compensate

327
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:20,432
for the damage done to Hwangjisa
by the construction of the highway?

328
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,601
Rather than that…

329
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,398
We thought fewer people would come
if they were asked to pay money.

330
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,609
So we liked the idea.

331
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,237
The best way to delay damage
to cultural heritage

332
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,781
and reduce the number of lives lost

333
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,743
is to stop people from coming
as much as possible.

334
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:43,747
I still believe
that's the most important function

335
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,708
of the admission fee.

336
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,211
Thank you. That is all.

337
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,798
Plaintiff's counselor,
you may begin cross-examination.

338
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,855
How much is the profit that
Hwangjisa earns from the admission fees?

339
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,481
I'm not sure.

340
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,901
I do not know the exact numbers.

341
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,444
Based on the statistics surveyed

342
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,947
by the Ministry of Land,
Infrastructure, and Transport,

343
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,032
Hwangjisa earns about
one billion won in profits every year

344
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,994
from the collection
of the admission fees. Correct?

345
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,495
I told you.

346
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,748
I am not aware of the exact amount.

347
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:31,295
How does Hwangjisa use the money
collected as admission fees?

348
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:35,507
It's used to maintain and repair Hwangjisa

349
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,676
and the cultural heritage
that Hwangjisa owns.

350
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:41,013
Aren't you already receiving the budget
necessary to maintain and repair

351
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:44,725
Hwangjisa and the cultural heritage
that Hwangjisa owns from the government?

352
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,437
This year, the Cultural Heritage
Administration has set aside

353
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,148
a budget of 400 billion won for the repair
and maintenance of cultural heritage,

354
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,983
of which 12 billion won was set aside

355
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,735
for the repair and maintenance
of traditional temples.

356
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,905
Hwangjisa will also be receiving support
from the Cultural Heritage Administration,

357
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:01,533
so isn't collecting admission fees
from citizens double collection?

358
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:05,996
It only seems like a lot when you use
numbers like one billion and ten billion.

359
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,957
Hwangjisa has nothing to be ashamed of.

360
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,501
We only receive the bare minimum

361
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:15,923
from the government and visitors
and use it wisely.

362
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:19,760
Then could you reveal Hwangjisa's
budget breakdown?

363
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,346
That would be difficult.

364
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,473
Because that's private to Hwangjisa.

365
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,184
You just said you have
nothing to be ashamed of and yet,

366
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,519
revealing the budget breakdown
would be difficult?

367
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:40,530
Objection!

368
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,575
Is the plaintiff's counselor
asking a question or being sarcastic?

369
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:47,037
The witness is the Abbot of Hwangjisa

370
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,081
who is widely respected
by many monks and Buddhists.

371
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,624
Please show some respect.

372
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,461
Plaintiff's counselor,
refrain from asking sarcastic questions.

373
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,130
Okay.

374
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:00,968
Last year, there were 62 reports
filed to the police

375
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,972
about Hwangjisa obstructing traffic
by stopping cars at the ticket booth.

376
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,599
Are you aware of this fact?

377
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:11,353
I am aware that there are people
who complain from time to time.

378
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,147
Then why won't you come up
with a solution?

379
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,525
Aren't there various alternatives,
like moving the ticket booth

380
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,277
to right in front of Hwangjisa?

381
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,949
It's not wrong for Hwangjisa to collect
cultural heritage admission fees.

382
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:28,036
It's justifiable under the
Cultural Heritage Protection Act,

383
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,164
and it is absolutely necessary
for Hwangjisa, its cultural heritage,

384
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:36,253
and the nature
surrounding Hwangjisa as well.

385
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:41,717
Why do we have to come up
with a solution while we do this work?

386
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,604
I mean…

387
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,650
What are you still doing here
when you're too sick to even go to court?

388
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,570
You should go back to Seoul
as soon as possible to get surgery!

389
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,947
Even if I go back right now,
I can't get surgery.

390
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,532
My appointment isn't until later.

391
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:09,244
What kind of hospital
sets a surgery date so late?

392
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,079
Can't you look into another hospital?

393
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,164
No, I can't.

394
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:15,042
Then I would have to make
another appointment and wait again.

395
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,418
Then it'll take even longer…

396
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,212
Come in.

397
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,012
Attorney Woo.

398
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:29,848
The plaintiff's claim that he will not pay
the admission fee because he did not visit

399
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:32,267
the cultural heritage is valid,
so why are we…

400
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,519
Go on.

401
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,521
Why are we losing the trial?

402
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,274
We're not able to make even a dent
into the defendant's simple claim

403
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:41,151
that Hwangjisa hasn't done anything wrong.

404
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:43,987
Excuse me,

405
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,489
but who are you?

406
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:46,656
What?

407
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,867
I'm Woo Young-woo.

408
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,285
Whether it's read straight or flipped,
it's still Woo Young-woo.

409
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,412
Kayak, deed, rotator,
noon, racecar, Woo Young-woo.

410
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:57,000
-What?
-She's an attorney I work with.

411
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,960
Excuse me, but who are you?

412
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,672
-I'm…
-She's…

413
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:03,965
my ex-wife.

414
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,219
By ex-wife…

415
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:10,305
You mean the ex-wife
who endured you for eight years

416
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,599
while you only worked
and neglected your family,

417
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,476
and who eventually asked for a divorce?

418
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:17,687
What?

419
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:18,855
Honey…

420
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,734
Ji-su, could I speak to Attorney Woo
for a moment?

421
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,071
Go ahead.

422
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,754
Go ahead.

423
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,927
Right, so…

424
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,887
In my opinion,

425
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,516
I don't think
there is legal justification.

426
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,977
-Legal justification?
-Yes.

427
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,646
Hwangjisa's justification is clear.

428
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,066
Not only do they have the justification
that they're lawfully collecting fees

429
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,693
based on the
Cultural Heritage Protection Act,

430
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,778
but they also have a theoretical
justification that the concept

431
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:10,365
of temple cultural heritage should be
expanded to include its surroundings.

432
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,076
On the other hand,
our argument is lacking.

433
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:17,831
All we're doing is pushing the fact
that the plaintiff didn't visit Hwangjisa.

434
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:21,418
So it's hard for the judge
to take our side even if she wants to.

435
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,379
Because there's no legal basis
for a ruling.

436
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:25,547
I see.

437
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,091
Then how about if we claim the fact
that the system to collect

438
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:31,386
national park entrance fees
was abolished in 2007 as justification?

439
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:34,055
Since Hwangjisa is located
within the Hanbaek Mountain National Park.

440
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,309
But Hwangjisa is collecting
cultural heritage admission fees,

441
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:38,560
not a park entrance fee.

442
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,354
Then what if we request the judge

443
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,898
to get Hwangjisa
to reveal their budget breakdown?

444
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,150
Earlier in court,
I argued that it's double collection

445
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:48,737
to receive government support
and to collect admission fees,

446
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,823
but that had limitations since I do not
know their exact budget breakdown.

447
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:55,327
But the judge probably won't allow that.

448
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,580
This trial isn't about
how Hwangjisa's budget is executed.

449
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,415
It's about whether it's right or wrong

450
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:03,084
for the plaintiff
to pay the admission fee.

451
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,879
Well…

452
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:09,382
Then what kind of legal justification
could there be?

453
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,262
What could there be?

454
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:19,017
Well…

455
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:23,813
Ji-su?

456
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:25,273
Ji-su…

457
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,566
What could there be?

458
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:28,610
Hold on.

459
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:38,787
Are you done talking?

460
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:41,873
Yes.

461
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:52,175
He really hasn't changed one bit.

462
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,886
Sorry?

463
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,474
He looks more alive
talking to the attorney he sees every day

464
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:03,687
than talking to me,

465
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:08,817
who he hasn't seen in five years.

466
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,820
When he was with me,

467
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,781
his eyes were so lifeless.

468
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,199
But right now…

469
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:21,246
there truly seems to be life in them.

470
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:27,294
You made me remember…

471
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:32,382
why I left him.

472
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,845
Why did you leave him?

473
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,267
When I was with him…

474
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,316
I was lonely.

475
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,361
I wasn't happy.

476
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,504
DAD

477
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,507
I'm glad you're doing well.

478
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:19,137
Anyway, call me right away
if something happens, okay?

479
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,306
Okay.

480
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,310
-Dad.
-Yes, what is it?

481
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,439
What were you going to do

482
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,692
if I brought Lee Jun-ho home?

483
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,070
Who's Lee Jun-ho?

484
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,154
Well…

485
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,198
The person I kissed in front of the house.

486
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:40,241
That punk?

487
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,203
Why? You're going to bring him home?

488
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,412
No.

489
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,958
I'm just curious
why you wanted to meet him.

490
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,543
What do you mean why?

491
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,879
I wanted to see what kind of guy he is

492
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,633
and whether or not he's capable of
making my daughter happy.

493
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,426
I wanted to see

494
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,721
if he's a guy who's capable of
taking care of my daughter the way I do.

495
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:02,889
I see.

496
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:04,724
Right.

497
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,229
Jun-ho…

498
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,606
is that type of person.

499
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,276
He's someone who can make me happy.

500
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:19,781
And he can take care of me like you do.

501
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:21,866
The problem is…

502
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,620
me.

503
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,665
Am I…

504
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:31,793
someone who can make

505
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:36,214
Jun-ho happy?

506
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,592
Wouldn't I…

507
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,681
make him lonely?

508
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,078
Gosh, this is weird.

509
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,165
I heard there were a lot of people
who saw dolphins here every day.

510
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,585
How come there aren't any when we come?

511
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:18,673
Jun-ho.

512
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,341
Yes?

513
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,554
I don't think…

514
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,057
you and I should date.

515
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:51,664
Why are you saying that all of a sudden?

516
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,761
Is it because Attorney Jung is sick?

517
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:08,765
Is it because you feel guilty
that we're out on a date

518
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,726
when Attorney Jung
is going through a rough time

519
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:16,689
after being diagnosed with stomach cancer?

520
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,276
I didn't think about that

521
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,278
but you do have a point.

522
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:27,033
If it's not that,
then why on earth would you say that?

523
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:41,756
It's not because you're disappointed
about not seeing any dolphins, is it?

524
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,216
Gosh.

525
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,301
That's not the reason, right?

526
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,095
The dolphins…

527
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,722
are in the ocean.

528
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,766
We just can't see them right now.

529
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:55,603
Remember how the Abbot said
that what you see isn't everything?

530
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,400
"What you see isn't everything."

531
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,987
"Don't be blinded by what you can see."

532
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,656
"Keep in mind the essence
of what lies beyond that."

533
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:09,784
Yes, that's what the Abbot said.

534
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,495
That's right!

535
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,956
I was blinded by what I could see

536
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,333
that I forgot the essence
of what lies beyond that.

537
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,837
Local Highway Number 3008
is on Hwangjisa property.

538
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,381
It was built for tourism purposes
from the start.

539
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:26,843
Hwangjisa and the entire surrounding area
are temple cultural heritage.

540
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:29,137
I need to look beyond these things.

541
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,348
Local Highway Number 3008
is ultimately a road!

542
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,642
That's the essence!

543
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,480
Are you talking about the case right now?

544
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,442
There's a concept called "public property"
in Administrative Law.

545
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,319
Public property is made
by an administrative body

546
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,614
like the state or local governments
to provide administrative purposes.

547
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:52,160
Roads are provided to anyone for transit
and are an example of public property.

548
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:56,080
This concept of public property
will serve as justification.

549
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,707
Legal justification!

550
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:00,668
Where are you going?

551
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,881
I have to go discuss this
with Attorney Jung.

552
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,302
Are you kidding me?

553
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,684
You say we shouldn't be together,
and you're just leaving like this?

554
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,269
Am I…

555
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,271
Am I a joke to you?

556
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,775
What on earth do you think of me as?

557
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,283
Why are you doing this to me?

558
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,668
I'm sorry.

559
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:49,819
Do the plaintiff and defendant
have anything else to claim or prove?

560
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,530
The plaintiff has something.

561
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,491
The defendant has none.

562
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,745
Then you may go ahead,
plaintiff's counselor.

563
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,248
Your Honor,

564
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:06,169
Local Highway Number 3008
is public property.

565
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:08,546
Public property?

566
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:09,547
Yes.

567
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,924
While using Local Highway Number 3008,

568
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,593
the plaintiff passed through
a part of Hwangjisa

569
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:18,556
which is land owned by the defendant
and also a scenic spot.

570
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,351
However, this only came about
in the process of using the highway,

571
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:27,065
which is public property provided by
the local government for public transit.

572
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,859
I am claiming that
the plaintiff cannot be deemed

573
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:32,695
as having performed the act
of visiting the cultural heritage

574
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:35,907
owned by the defendant,
just because he used public property.

575
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:14,153
I'll get in the car
with Dong Geu-ra-mi and Mr. Hairy.

576
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,697
Why? Did you fight with Jun-ho?

577
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,501
Okay, I'll see you back at the house.

578
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:33,756
Take me with you.

579
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,054
What's up? You're not taking their car?

580
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,889
I can't.

581
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,808
It'll be uncomfortable…

582
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,477
because of Jun-ho.

583
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,895
Why do you feel uncomfortable with him?

584
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,438
I told him…

585
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:53,776
that we shouldn't be together.

586
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,444
-What?
-What?

587
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,446
What's going on? Did you two really fight?

588
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,283
No, it's not like that.

589
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,492
You did.

590
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,911
Do you want to go for a drink?

591
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,539
It's okay, right?

592
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,082
Sure. I don't mind.

593
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,751
Forget it. I don't feel like drinking.

594
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,882
What do you think the reason is?

595
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,842
Why?

596
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,511
Is it because Attorney Jung is sick?

597
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:27,727
Is it because we didn't get to see
Sampal, Chunsam, Boksun, and Jedol?

598
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:31,564
No, I don't think even Young-woo
would have done that for that reason.

599
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:34,650
Then why is she doing this?

600
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:39,238
We were fine and all of a sudden…

601
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,115
Maybe you put too much pressure on her.

602
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,409
Look.

603
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:46,996
Either way, she went to her boyfriend's
sister's house during a business trip.

604
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,415
She would have been so nervous, right?

605
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,210
If I were in that situation…

606
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,670
Gosh, I don't even want to think about it.

607
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,631
You think so?

608
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:58,841
Did I…

609
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,887
ask too much of her?

610
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,138
He has a point.

611
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,849
I guess going there could have been
too much for Young-woo.

612
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,436
Why are you acting like you have
some sense in you all of a sudden?

613
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,648
I'm not acting like I have…

614
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,484
Why do you keep picking on me?

615
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,569
You're right.

616
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,239
She did seem like she was really nervous.

617
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,741
There wasn't any gimbap,

618
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,994
but she still
tried to eat the meat and sashimi

619
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,706
even though she couldn't even swallow it.

620
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,377
Jun-ho, don't cry.

621
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,504
Maybe it's a good thing.

622
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:40,174
You don't know it yet, but things
would have gotten difficult anyway.

623
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,092
Attorney Woo…

624
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,053
is not someone you can handle.

625
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,221
What?

626
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,933
What do you mean
she's not someone Jun-ho can handle?

627
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:49,892
She's right.

628
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,853
What are you talking about?

629
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,982
I mean, Attorney Woo was born…

630
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,278
What are you talking about?

631
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:01,696
What?

632
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:06,951
Well, she was born…

633
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,661
The thing is…

634
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,998
Her existence itself is special.

635
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,333
I don't know! Let's drink.

636
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,045
Here.

637
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,171
Cheers.

638
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:22,300
Wait. There's a bug in your glass.

639
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:24,635
A bug?

640
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,431
You're observant.

641
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,266
Don't drink from it.

642
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,854
Excuse me,
could you bring us another glass?

643
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:44,196
In anger, I yelled at you to go away

644
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,283
You've already gone

645
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,369
So far away

646
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,706
We broke up today

647
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:56,917
We broke up today

648
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:00,588
If you understand how I feel

649
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:05,217
We loved each other

650
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,845
But we're over

651
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,221
We're over

652
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:15,936
Is everything over

653
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,606
Is it?

654
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:25,488
The many days we promised

655
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,198
I'm always drinking

656
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,824
Drinking

657
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,576
Drinking every day

658
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,203
Drinking

659
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,789
After losing you

660
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:39,168
Will I be able to say goodbye to you

661
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:42,421
To you

662
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:49,178
You're cluelessly

663
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:55,059
Crying

664
00:39:57,186 --> 00:40:01,857
But you cannot know

665
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:10,866
My true feelings behind leaving you

666
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:23,462
Please forget me

667
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:30,136
I'm only a burden to you

668
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:36,892
The memories of overwhelming love

669
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:41,605
We'll put them behind us

670
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:42,773
Behind us

671
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,123
You should go sleep.

672
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,458
Yes.

673
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:04,879
Can we talk?

674
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:06,589
What?

675
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,643
What has gotten into you?

676
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,731
-Excuse me?
-I mean,

677
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,567
you just changed out of the blue.

678
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,528
You're known to be an absolute jerk.

679
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:32,323
You get on my nerves every time you speak
and you make me want to smack you.

680
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,617
You should be scheming in the dark,
thinking of what tactics to use.

681
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,035
That's Kwon Min-woo.

682
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:38,120
Jeez, am I that bad?

683
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,622
You didn't know?

684
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:42,500
Where did that jerk,
the Tactician Kwon Min-woo, go?

685
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,836
Why are you suddenly being kind
and confusing everyone?

686
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:48,756
Gosh, I almost reported you to the police
for the crime of not staying in character.

687
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:50,925
What on earth did I do?

688
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,552
Why do you care if I eat a bug or not,

689
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,763
whether or not I can put my luggage
in the overhead bin,

690
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,473
or if I struggle to carry
the drinks by myself?

691
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:00,643
Why is Kwon Min-woo
going out of his way and being all nice?

692
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,854
Jogging in the morning
even when you're on a business trip.

693
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,981
Buying flowers from an old lady.

694
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,859
What act are you trying to pull?

695
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,945
Being cool like that doesn't suit you!

696
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,863
Why on earth are you acting like this?

697
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:14,532
Because…

698
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:16,575
we're in Jeju.

699
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:18,160
What are you saying?

700
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,995
Are you now pretending to be romantic?

701
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,790
Attorney Choi, are you interested in me?

702
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:24,625
What?

703
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,418
No. Are you crazy?

704
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:27,753
Then what's wrong with you?

705
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:30,381
Listing all those things about me
that I don't even know.

706
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,092
Be honest.

707
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,346
You like me, don't you?

708
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,431
I think you do.

709
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,275
Why aren't you denying it?

710
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,154
What?

711
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,574
Do you really like me?

712
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:16,844
Gosh.

713
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,637
I just got rejected.

714
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,681
What do you mean?

715
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:24,393
Can't you tell from the way Kwon Min-woo
and the angel are looking at each other?

716
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:32,192
All that extra hot and steamy
staring that's going on?

717
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:34,945
What staring? Shut up and let's go inside.

718
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,530
What are you talking about?

719
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,324
We have to go back to the karaoke.

720
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:43,245
We were just there but we're going back?

721
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,163
Hey.

722
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:47,166
I just got rejected by Kwon Min-woo.

723
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:48,834
I didn't even get to tell him how I feel.

724
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:52,129
Nothing really happened
for you to say you were rejected.

725
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:54,840
Did you like Kwon Min-woo?

726
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:58,761
I don't know.

727
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:00,095
Damn it.

728
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:03,641
I'm going to go sing
a bunch of breakup songs.

729
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,310
Because I was rejected!

730
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,316
I'll sing with you.

731
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:13,317
What?

732
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,454
Thank you, Jun-ho.

733
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:26,747
You're welcome.

734
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:32,461
What are the others up to?
Are they all at the house?

735
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:36,340
Yes, we wanted to go to Hwangjisa with you
once you were discharged.

736
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:39,468
-They should be getting ready now.
-I see.

737
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,518
Right.

738
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:54,108
Your guest? Did she leave already?

739
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:56,777
My guest…

740
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,070
My ex-wife?

741
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:02,199
Yes, she called this morning saying
she was getting on a flight back to Seoul.

742
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:03,325
I see.

743
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:08,622
Last night in my dream,
I was pleading with her,

744
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:10,416
saying that it was all my fault.

745
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:13,585
That I wouldn't be like that anymore.
So we should get back together.

746
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:19,133
But when she called me this morning,
I couldn't say one word.

747
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:22,261
I just acted cool and said,
"Okay, have a safe flight."

748
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:28,475
I guess you need to have a habit of
saying those things to actually say them.

749
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,022
Jun-ho, do you like anybody?

750
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,651
-Sorry?
-If you do,

751
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,570
hold onto them.

752
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:42,781
If something happens
and you let go of them,

753
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,867
go back and hold on tight.

754
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:50,038
But you don't seem like the type
to make the same mistakes I did.

755
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,685
Let's not be awkward like this.

756
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:14,897
What?

757
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,940
Nothing happened between us yesterday.

758
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,067
Nothing happened.

759
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:22,070
I don't even remember much.
I guess I had too much to drink.

760
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,365
You're not the only one who drank.
I don't remember anything either.

761
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:29,036
So let's just be comfortable
around each other like before.

762
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,208
Okay.

763
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:51,600
Is it me?

764
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:53,560
Or the angel?

765
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:55,020
Excuse me?

766
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:03,237
If you were going to a deserted island,

767
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,948
who are you going to bring with you?

768
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:10,202
Dong Geu-ra-mi or the angel?

769
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,079
What?

770
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,876
Ignore her and just go.

771
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:22,589
-Crazy things happen, right?
-Who would you choose?

772
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:16,768
HWANGJISA TICKET BOOTH

773
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,606
The ticket booth is closed.

774
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:23,567
FREE PASSAGE

775
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,820
Congratulations on winning the trial.

776
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,740
Yes, thank you.

777
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:55,057
What are you doing here at Hwangjisa?

778
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,517
I see.

779
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,228
Are you here for a free tour
before you head back to Seoul

780
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,231
since you don't have to
pay the admission fee anymore?

781
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,941
No, we're--

782
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:07,611
We are here to talk to the Abbot.

783
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,613
Where can we find him?

784
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,788
The Abbot is at the Main Hall.

785
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:24,127
You must have a lot of concerns
due to the result of the trial.

786
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,213
I'm sorry.

787
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:30,217
If I got concerned
about little things like this,

788
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,094
how could I call myself a monk?

789
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:38,100
If that is what the court has decided,
we'll have to comply.

790
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:41,186
Although we were on opposing sides
during the trial,

791
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:45,273
I learned a lot about the position
Hwangjisa is in through this lawsuit.

792
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:48,110
The damage caused by
Local Highway Number 3008

793
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:50,737
all falls on Hwangjisa
as the owner of the land.

794
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,115
But the government
is turning a blind eye to this

795
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:55,534
and is just using all kinds of laws
to restrict you.

796
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:56,952
Goodness.

797
00:49:57,035 --> 00:50:01,665
During the trial, you were pushing me
to reveal a budget breakdown

798
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,959
and said it was double collection.

799
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,378
What's gotten into you?

800
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,550
Since Hwangjisa has given up

801
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:14,428
a major source of income
with the admission fees,

802
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:16,638
I believe the government should step up

803
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:20,058
and lay the foundation
for Hwangjisa's self-management.

804
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,644
Why don't we bring together
the relevant organizations

805
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,938
such as local governments,
Korea National Park Service,

806
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:27,482
Korea Rural Community Corporation,
and Cultural Heritage Administration,

807
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:29,484
and discuss this?

808
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:33,029
We should draft an MOU
on creating a foundation

809
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:34,740
for Hwangjisa's self-management.

810
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:41,037
To be honest,
I've been thinking the same thing.

811
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:45,625
This issue is something Hwangjisa
needs to handle with the government,

812
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:48,128
not the people.

813
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:53,592
But it's not an easy task
to communicate with the government.

814
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,385
Yes.

815
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:58,638
Communicating with the government
is always difficult.

816
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:01,725
What if this time…

817
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:10,150
you negotiate with the administration?

818
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:12,194
The administration?

819
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:17,282
The Hyeseok Order is a powerful order
with many followers.

820
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:21,453
And Hwangjisa is the most famous
out of all the temples in the order.

821
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,289
I believe it'll be more than possible.

822
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:35,884
Since this is something
I shouldn't be deciding on my own,

823
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:41,056
I'll have to confer with others
in the Hyeseok Order.

824
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,350
By the way,

825
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:46,144
why are you telling me all this?

826
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:48,605
Don't you think
you'll need help from experts

827
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:51,817
if you are to bring together
the government and relevant organizations

828
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:54,903
to sign a deal that is
advantageous for Hwangjisa?

829
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:58,448
There is a government relations team
at Hanbada.

830
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:02,661
They go beyond the scope of legal services
provided by other law firms

831
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:03,995
and act as a bridge

832
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,997
between the government
and individual organizations.

833
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:09,417
They communicate with the government
and the administrative agencies,

834
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:12,379
and convince them so that
an organization's needs are reflected.

835
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:16,007
So far, we've mostly
been representing companies,

836
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:19,052
but I am confident about the agreement
to create the foundation

837
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:20,971
for Hwangjisa's self-management as well.

838
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:30,647
I understand what you're saying.

839
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,817
I'll discuss this with the others
and be in touch.

840
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:35,986
Yes, sir.

841
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:44,703
My goodness, it's already time to eat.

842
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:47,455
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

843
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:51,334
If you're okay with temple food, join us.

844
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,712
Shall we?

845
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:58,174
How are you feeling?

846
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:03,430
Your face looks more gaunt
than before you collapsed.

847
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:05,932
Thank you for your concern.

848
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,728
I'm not feeling well.

849
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:14,399
Pray to the Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva.

850
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:16,151
Excuse me?

851
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:20,989
The Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva
is an almighty being

852
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:24,743
with a thousand eyes
that see the sufferings of all people

853
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:26,953
and a thousand hands

854
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:33,460
that relieve the suffering
of all living creatures.

855
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:39,049
So if you desperately call upon the name
and devote yourself,

856
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:42,469
the Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva

857
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,347
solves all suffering.

858
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:48,558
Well…

859
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:51,227
how do I pray?

860
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:56,441
Namu Gwanseeumbosal.

861
00:53:58,109 --> 00:53:59,819
Like this.

862
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:03,073
It means to devote yourself
to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva.

863
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:25,804
This is the first time
I thought you were amazing.

864
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:28,640
The first?

865
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:32,560
Yes, I didn't expect you'd make
that kind of offer to the Abbot.

866
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:34,729
It was worth working so hard
after your divorce

867
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,940
to the point where you got stomach cancer.

868
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:39,943
Really?

869
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:46,783
Was that time really all worth it?

870
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:49,786
Yes, I think so.

871
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:55,458
Okay.

872
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,002
Yes.

873
00:55:01,297 --> 00:55:05,093
Monks really enjoy eating noodles.

874
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:10,181
No one answers if someone asks a monk,
"Do you want some porridge?"

875
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,934
But if someone asks a monk,
"Do you want some noodles?"

876
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:16,187
Everyone answers yes.

877
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:19,733
It looks very delicious.

878
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:22,819
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

879
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:24,446
Thank you for the food.

880
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:26,489
Thank you for the food.

881
00:55:58,313 --> 00:55:59,189
What?

882
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:04,611
What is this? The steps in this flavor?

883
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:07,030
Sour.

884
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:08,823
Sweet.

885
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:10,450
Spicy.

886
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:17,499
Those who cook and practice Buddhism
at temples are called gongyangju.

887
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:22,629
Hwangjisa's gongyangju
is especially good at making noodles.

888
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:25,715
I heard it's hard to control
the boiling time

889
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:28,676
when you make a lot of noodles at once.

890
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:32,639
But our gongyangju
can tell the exact time right away

891
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,433
just by looking
at the color of the noodles.

892
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:38,853
I guess that's why
the noodles are so chewy.

893
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:43,983
There was a place that made really good
meat noodles called Haengbok Noodles.

894
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:46,778
These noodles
taste like the ones I had there.

895
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:50,115
He used thicker noodles like these
instead of thin ones.

896
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:54,702
And the mushroom toppings used here
look like big pieces of boiled pork.

897
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:08,424
Why didn't I think of this sooner?

898
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:11,928
Hwangjisa is on Hanbaek Mountain,

899
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,888
and there's a mineral spring
in the temple.

900
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,056
You're right.

901
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:16,891
Then is this…

902
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,518
"A place where
the mountains and waters are nice."

903
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:21,271
I want to check
if the gongyangju of Hwangjisa

904
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,481
is the owner of Haengbok Noodles!

905
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:25,358
Wait…

906
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,501
Are you the gongyangju of Hwangjisa?

907
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:47,547
Sorry?

908
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:51,176
Yes.

909
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:54,012
And were you also
the owner of Haengbok Noodles?

910
00:57:57,182 --> 00:58:00,643
How did you know that?

911
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,780
We've been looking all over for you.

912
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:13,740
Me?

913
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,200
Why?

914
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:19,621
We wanted to find you and ask
if you could make meat noodles

915
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:23,082
for an attorney who might soon
die of stage three stomach cancer.

916
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:36,304
Well…

917
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:42,268
I told you not to do anything unnecessary,
but you just had to, didn't you?

918
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:45,563
If you've been looking for me,
you should know.

919
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:48,733
Haengbok Noodles is out of business.

920
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:54,656
And it's not appropriate
to make meat noodles in a temple.

921
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:57,450
Then you can open Haengbok Noodles again.

922
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:00,578
We are attorneys. We can help you.

923
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:01,871
Really?

924
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:04,874
How would an attorney help
with opening a restaurant?

925
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:08,127
If it's true that Haengun Noodles
named themselves

926
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:11,172
after Haengbok Noodles,
an attorney can help.

927
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:14,676
And Haengun Noodles recruited
an employee from Haengbok Noodles

928
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:16,844
which resulted in your
special recipe getting leaked.

929
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:19,430
If this is true, we can help.

930
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,974
Is this all true?

931
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:25,270
That's all true.

932
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:29,941
But even if it is, what can I do?

933
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:31,025
Have you ever heard of

934
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:34,195
the Unfair Competition Prevention
and Trade Secret Protection Act?

935
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:35,697
Pardon?

936
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,116
Copying the brand name
of a famous restaurant

937
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:39,993
is called an act of unfair competition.

938
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:43,204
An example would be changing
a restaurant's name to Haengun Noodles

939
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:45,248
after Haengbok Noodles became famous.

940
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:49,961
This kind of action confuses consumers,
so the law prohibits it.

941
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:51,212
And that law is called

942
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:54,632
the Unfair Competition Prevention
and Trade Secret Protection Act.

943
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:55,883
So what?

944
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:57,468
I mean,

945
00:59:58,344 --> 01:00:00,597
the owner of Haengun Noodles claimed

946
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,600
that I hadn't trademarked
the restaurant's name,

947
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:06,644
and that there was nothing I could do
because of that.

948
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:08,688
Even if you hadn't done that yet,

949
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,816
this can be dealt with by making it
an issue of unfair competition.

950
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:13,318
What if we send Haengun Noodles

951
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,694
a certification of content
as your attorneys

952
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:17,155
and request them
to stop using the restaurant name?

953
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:19,073
But in this case,
isn't a lawsuit also possible?

954
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:21,075
You will be compensated
for all the damage caused

955
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:24,037
by the unfair competition initiated
by Haengun Noodles through a trial.

956
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:27,123
If you open your restaurant again
under the name Haengbok Noodles,

957
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:29,792
you should register the trademark then.

958
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:33,838
The intellectual property team at Hanbada
can help you with this as well.

959
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:35,214
From now on,

960
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:38,384
you can even prevent your staff
from leaking your recipes.

961
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,928
You can protect the recipe
as a trade secret.

962
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:42,972
A trade secret?

963
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:46,225
Yes, the reason why we don't know
the recipe for Coca-Cola

964
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:48,895
is because the company
has it protected as a trade secret.

965
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:50,688
You can do that
for your meat noodles recipe.

966
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:51,856
Of course, the process is a bit tricky,

967
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:53,775
and you need to get sworn statements
from employees as well.

968
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:56,944
But the experts at Hanbada
can also help you with this too.

969
01:00:58,613 --> 01:00:59,447
Wow.

970
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:02,867
Goodness.

971
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:07,080
I didn't know all that was possible.

972
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:10,458
I didn't think the law could save me.

973
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:11,876
I thought…

974
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,879
all I could do was let my heart heal.

975
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:21,678
It pained me to think
that I couldn't protect

976
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:24,138
or carry on the noodle recipe

977
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:27,225
my mother taught me.

978
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:32,980
It was so painful.

979
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:36,025
Thank you.

980
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:39,028
Thank you.

981
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:40,780
Thank you.

982
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:12,937
All right.

983
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:14,814
The noodles are ready.

984
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:19,068
Thank you so much for opening
the restaurant for us like this.

985
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:21,154
You said you'll be
going back to Seoul soon.

986
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:25,658
The least I could do before you go
is make you some noodles.

987
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:30,329
Though I'll be seeing you soon
when I commission the case.

988
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:33,374
Yes, take your time to think about it
and contact us.

989
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:38,629
Are you sure you don't want meat noodles?

990
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,257
I made this
so you could at least try the broth.

991
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:43,509
No, I'm okay.

992
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:48,848
Shall we try it?

993
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:50,183
-Thank you for the food.
-All right.

994
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:51,893
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

995
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:56,230
The richness of the broth

996
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:57,899
looks so good.

997
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:21,714
This is so good.

998
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:24,967
Thank you. Enjoy.

999
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,053
Thank you.

1000
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:25,945
Take my seat.

1001
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:28,614
I'll tell the flight attendant.

1002
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:29,824
Okay.

1003
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:44,255
I heard you guys broke up.

1004
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:45,882
It'd be uncomfortable
for you to sit together.

1005
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,784
Is it me or the angel?

1006
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:58,097
The confirmation hearing for the
Ministry of Justice candidate, Tae Su-mi,

1007
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,807
is only a month away.

1008
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:03,561
Today, Candidate Tae went to the office
of the hearing preparation team

1009
01:07:03,644 --> 01:07:08,065
at the Seoul High Prosecutors' Office
to begin preparations.

1010
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:09,692
This hearing will see the opposing parties

1011
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:12,778
fiercely at odds as they discuss
the controversies surrounding her,

1012
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,739
such as her hereditary succession,

1013
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:18,034
going abroad to give birth to her son,

1014
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:21,287
and the close relationship she has
with Gangcheon Group

1015
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:23,789
where her husband is the chairman.

1016
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:28,711
Since everyone will be watching
the confirmation hearing live,

1017
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:30,504
I will be thoroughly prepared.

1018
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:33,966
I will do my best with an honest attitude.

1019
01:07:34,508 --> 01:07:37,178
CONTROVERSIES AROUND SUCCESSION,
BIRTH TOURISM, AND TIES TO GANGCHEON

1020
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:38,804
Please tell us about your response plan.

1021
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:42,016
Give us a comment about the controversy
around your going abroad to give birth.

1022
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:43,309
Come in.

1023
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:47,188
Ma'am. Reporter Lee Jun-beom
of Jeongui Ilbo is here.

1024
01:07:47,271 --> 01:07:48,939
Tell him to come in.

1025
01:07:53,819 --> 01:07:54,695
You're here.

1026
01:07:58,657 --> 01:08:00,701
How have you been, ma'am?

1027
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:02,244
It's been a while
since you last called me.

1028
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:04,789
Have you been well?

1029
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,709
Did you find Tae Su-mi's daughter?

1030
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:09,794
Excuse me?

1031
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:12,755
I heard that you were
thoroughly looking into

1032
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:16,425
the daughter she had
before she was married.

1033
01:08:17,843 --> 01:08:18,719
Yes.

1034
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:20,930
Considering the circumstances,

1035
01:08:21,722 --> 01:08:24,391
there is one person
who I believe to be her daughter.

1036
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:25,810
Who?

1037
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:30,523
I'm not sure if you know her.

1038
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:33,692
She works here at Hanbada.

1039
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:35,569
Attorney Woo Young-woo.

1040
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:39,907
I have a hunch but there's no proof.

1041
01:08:40,574 --> 01:08:42,243
So I haven't been able to
publish an article on it.

1042
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:47,957
You're right.

1043
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:50,751
What?

1044
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:54,046
Attorney Woo is Tae Su-mi's daughter.

1045
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,005
Wait.

1046
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,800
So you knew when you hired her?

1047
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:02,179
What about Tae Su-mi? Does she know?

1048
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:08,769
I'll tell you everything you want to know
in due time.

1049
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:12,565
On one condition.

1050
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:13,983
Condition?

1051
01:09:15,734 --> 01:09:17,319
Publish the article…

1052
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:21,282
right before Tae Su-mi's
confirmation hearing.

1053
01:09:21,365 --> 01:09:22,950
So she won't be able to
refute it right away.

1054
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:26,954
Sure.

1055
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:30,791
I'll have to discuss it with my editors,
but it should be possible.

1056
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:32,877
Well…

1057
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:36,088
Since I'm here,

1058
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:39,967
can I meet with Attorney Woo?

1059
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:43,012
First, you should speak to me.

1060
01:09:43,095 --> 01:09:47,808
Hold off on asking Attorney Woo questions
for a little while.

1061
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:49,518
At least until the article is out.

1062
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:53,105
Sure.

1063
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:13,334
Fining us 300 billion won just because
we couldn't safeguard some personal data?

1064
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:14,835
That's just ridiculous, isn't it?

1065
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:17,755
I think the KCC accidentally added
a few too many zeros.

1066
01:10:17,838 --> 01:10:21,008
The KCC didn't accidentally add
a few too many zeros.

1067
01:10:21,091 --> 01:10:22,760
She's so arrogant.

1068
01:10:22,843 --> 01:10:25,304
Our users are filing
a class-action lawsuit against us.

1069
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:26,847
For your colleague,

1070
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:28,307
can't you just be a fool for once?

1071
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:29,475
There is room for adjustment--

1072
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:30,976
Stop it already!

1073
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,145
If you're so great,
you can do it by yourself!

1074
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:35,731
As of today, Attorney Woo,
you are off this case.

1075
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:40,945
