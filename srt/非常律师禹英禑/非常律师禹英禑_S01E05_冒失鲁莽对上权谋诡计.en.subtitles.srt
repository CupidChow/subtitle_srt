IHWA ATM NEW PRODUCT
MODEL NAME: WIAQ8521

2
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,817
The biggest strength of the 2022 model
of the automatic teller machine

3
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,862
developed by Ihwa ATM is…

4
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,032
Before I reveal this,

5
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:20,080
I've prepared some news that could
be a bit upsetting for you to see.

6
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,456
All right, now.

7
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:23,917
This may sting a bit.

8
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,629
You've all seen this article, right?

9
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:31,216
"A bold bank clerk embezzles a billion won
in cash by rigging an ATM."

10
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,884
"Continuous insider embezzlement."

11
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,427
"The discovery of a bank clerk
responsible for embezzlement

12
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,346
leads to other banks' hasty inspection."

13
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:40,350
A total of 42 ATM-related
embezzlement cases this year alone.

14
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,019
And the damages go way over ten billion.

15
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:47,106
The press always says there was negligence
in the management and supervision

16
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,359
by the bank and that the system
of inspection is the problem.

17
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,903
But you know how this is.

18
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:56,157
If someone is determined to deceive,
how could you not fall for it?

19
00:01:56,241 --> 00:02:00,537
It's impossible to know
what goes on in someone's head.

20
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,539
This concern of yours

21
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,792
will be solved by Ihwa ATM.

22
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,003
This is the inside of an ATM,
which all bank clerks would know about.

23
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:13,091
This here is the cassette,
where cash is loaded in.

24
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,927
If the employee in charge puts
50 million won in the cassette

25
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,097
but records in the system
that he put in 100 million, would we know?

26
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,224
No, we wouldn't.

27
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,017
We'd be fooled without even knowing.

28
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:26,437
So Ihwa ATM thought,

29
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,274
"Let's create a new cassette."

30
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,193
"Let's make an honest cassette

31
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,113
where lies and tricks won't work."

32
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,785
A bill's weight is always the same.

33
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:44,080
Unless it's torn or severely
damaged, it's similar in weight.

34
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,458
We at Ihwa ATM focused on that.

35
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,626
The employee in charge

36
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,338
not only has to record the amount
of the bills that he loads in the system

37
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,091
but also has to enter it here as well.

38
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:59,304
If the employee in charge
enters into the system to load 300 bills…

39
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,226
but only puts in 299,

40
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,520
you see the red light come on?

41
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,982
Also, the cassette door doesn't lock

42
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,109
because this honest cassette

43
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:16,112
calculates the weight
of the bills on its own.

44
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:20,199
Its accuracy doesn't even allow
an error of a single bill.

45
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,869
Isn't this the thing from before?

46
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,623
Is that the strength you mentioned?

47
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:27,707
Yes, it is.

48
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,877
It is our new product
using Ihwa's technology.

49
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,587
Geumgang uses this too.

50
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:34,714
What?

51
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,008
Leaders' products had it as well.

52
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,636
You know the model
that was recalled last year, right?

53
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,056
Their cassettes had this too.

54
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,352
But this technology is ours.

55
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:50,647
We developed it two years ago
and applied for model utility rights too.

56
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,023
Model utility rights?

57
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,234
Oh, like a patent?

58
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,360
That's right.

59
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:59,030
This isn't technology
that can be patented,

60
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:01,407
but we worked very hard
into designing this.

61
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,743
The technology is enough
to get model utility rights.

62
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,120
Maybe the technology was leaked then.

63
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,331
You should look into that, Director.

64
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,793
Whether or not another company
stole what Ihwa developed.

65
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,211
Well…

66
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,129
Right, yes.

67
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,215
I will check.

68
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,009
To be honest,
what matters to the bank is the cost.

69
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,053
Copied or not,

70
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:25,682
the same technology is also used
in Geumgang's ATMs, and they're cheaper.

71
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,685
Then we have no other option
but to sign a contract with them.

72
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,727
I see.

73
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,521
We're really not interested in

74
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,731
who originally came up
with this technology.

75
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:42,198
CASE 5
WILD CARD VS TACTICIAN

76
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,121
Hello.

77
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,372
-Hello.
-Hello.

78
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,710
Young-woo, did you eat?

79
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,212
Su-yeon, I did.

80
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,425
Did Attorney Kwon tell you?

81
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,509
What?

82
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,387
He didn't tell you yet?

83
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,930
I knew this would happen.

84
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,476
The ATM company case.

85
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,895
You've been assigned to it
with Attorney Kwon.

86
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:14,939
What?

87
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,775
Attorney Jung was about to call
and tell you himself,

88
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,987
but Attorney Kwon stopped him
and said he would tell you.

89
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,657
I had my suspicions
but he really didn't tell you.

90
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,915
My friend who went to
Hana University law school

91
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,252
told me Attorney Kwon's nickname.
Guess what it was.

92
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,881
-I don't know.
-Tactician Kwon Min-woo.

93
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,009
"Tactician Kwon Min-woo"?

94
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,260
Watch out.

95
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:47,346
It seems like Min-woo's
tactics have already begun.

96
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,016
-You think so?
-Of course.

97
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:53,352
Why wouldn't he have told you
that you were assigned a case together?

98
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:56,856
Right.

99
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,279
Come in.

100
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,535
Attorney Kwon.

101
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,790
Why didn't you tell me
we were assigned a case together?

102
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,083
I didn't tell you?

103
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,584
No, you didn't tell me.

104
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,754
I'm sorry. It must've slipped my mind.

105
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:25,676
So there's a lot to look at
in terms of the structure of ATMs.

106
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,390
But this is a piece of cake
for you, right?

107
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,059
Since you're a genius.

108
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,270
Here.

109
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,482
Right. Did I tell you?

110
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,901
-We're meeting with the client today.
-What?

111
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,611
At 2 p.m.

112
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,822
Gosh, it slipped my mind again.

113
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,007
-Did you take a look at the materials?
-Well…

114
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,177
Yes. It was a bit difficult because
there was a lot of unfamiliar jargon.

115
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,055
-But I managed to go over all of it once.
-Okay, let's go in.

116
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,059
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

117
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,520
I'm Attorney Jung Myeong-seok,
and I'll be handling your case.

118
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,272
Hello, I'm Woo Young-woo.

119
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,481
Whether it's read straight
or flipped, it's--

120
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,608
She's Woo Young-woo, and I'm Kwon Min-woo.

121
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,153
-Kayak, deed, rotator, noon, racecar.
-Right.

122
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,405
I'm Hwang Du-yong, the one who called.

123
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,782
-Nice to meet you. Please, have a seat.
-Okay.

124
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,909
Before we start,

125
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,912
I brought some mulberry juice.

126
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:38,541
They're made with farm-fresh mulberries
from Yanggu.

127
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:42,503
It's been a while since I heard of Yanggu.
I did my military training in Yanggu.

128
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,755
Really? I also did mine in Yanggu.

129
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,716
Were you at the Baekdusan unit?

130
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,633
Baekdusan.

131
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,052
Salute!

132
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,679
Salute.

133
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,682
You must've shoveled a lot of snow.

134
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:55,975
Guns and knives may rust,

135
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,560
-but the shovel still shines.
-But the shovel still shines.

136
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,814
So, where did you serve?

137
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,275
Yes, I was at the Chilseong unit.

138
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:08,070
United we can!

139
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,990
A top name!
You're from one of the famous infantries.

140
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,367
I'm from the Seventh Infantry,
where they say only people

141
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,869
who committed the seven sins
in their past lives can get in.

142
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:18,581
Gosh, the Seventh Infantry.
I wonder where he served.

143
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,209
You look like you served in the marines.

144
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:22,919
No.

145
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,215
Well, it's nice to meet everyone.

146
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,634
We should be drinking to this.

147
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,969
Why don't we make a toast
with the mulberry juice?

148
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,596
-Should we?
-Yes, that sounds good.

149
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,934
I look forward to working with you.

150
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,186
-Same here.
-I will do my best!

151
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,738
-It's good, right?
-Yes.

152
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,492
Now then, your request

153
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:58,955
is that you wish to file for a sales
ban injunction against Geumgang ATM?

154
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:03,042
Yes, Ihwa ATM and Geumgang ATM

155
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,420
are Hanbada Law Firm
and Taesan Law Firm of the ATM industry.

156
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,006
Neck and neck, destined to be rivals?

157
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,426
Yes, it's so close
that you can't really pick one.

158
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,636
Ocean or mountain?

159
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,179
Jjajangmyeon or jjamppong?

160
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,472
To pour the sauce or dip in the sauce?

161
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,224
Blue whales or humpback whales?

162
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,475
What?

163
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:26,107
Anyway, it's like that
for Ihwa and Geumgang.

164
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,193
And there was Leaders ATM,
a new player in the industry,

165
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,904
but they went out of business last year.

166
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,614
It's always fun to hear
these kinds of stories.

167
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,532
Yes.

168
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:39,120
Gosh, I hope the Geumgang people
learn a lesson this time.

169
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:42,373
They shouldn't be sneaking around,

170
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:46,794
taking the technology that we worked
really hard to develop.

171
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:50,006
They've done this a few times already.
Including this cassette.

172
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,133
You must be so upset.

173
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,010
What's a cassette?

174
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,637
Oh, well…

175
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,559
The cassette is…

176
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:02,810
I can explain what it is.

177
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,980
It's the container where cash
is put with a handle on the front.

178
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,566
I did a little homework
before we came here to meet you.

179
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,819
Attorney Kwon.

180
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,863
Attorney Kwon Min-woo.

181
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,998
Anyway, the cassette was developed by us

182
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,083
and we applied
for its model utility rights.

183
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:30,296
So you've applied for it,
but it hasn't been registered yet?

184
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:34,300
No, there were a lot of procedures
to go through even after the application.

185
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,136
There wasn't much material
on the application for the rights.

186
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,638
Could you perhaps give us more?

187
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,515
Of course. I'll send you
everything I have.

188
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,644
Then please send them
to the number on my business card.

189
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,020
Yes, I will.

190
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:52,735
I came in today thinking it was
going to be a brief introduction.

191
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,111
Would it be okay
if we end things here for now?

192
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,529
Yes, of course.

193
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,947
All right.

194
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,950
I look forward to working with you.

195
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,911
Thank you for the juice.

196
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,162
It was nice to meet you.

197
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:04,997
Take care.

198
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,457
-Yes, thank you.
-Sure.

199
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,044
As I mentioned before,

200
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:14,715
this case will be led by the two of you,
Attorney Woo and Attorney Kwon.

201
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,425
I'll just be mentoring on the side.

202
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,760
-Got it.
-Got it.

203
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,804
I know there are a lot of unfamiliar terms

204
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,014
but review the materials thoroughly.

205
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,558
The model utility rights
for the cassette is key to this case.

206
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,811
Shouldn't you be aware
of what a cassette is?

207
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,313
Well…

208
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:34,026
-Yes, I should.
-Make sure this doesn't happen again.

209
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,154
-All right.
-Right.

210
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,366
Here you go.

211
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,910
-I'll get going.
-Okay.

212
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,838
I had a hard time because I didn't
get to see the case materials beforehand.

213
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,424
Please share them with me
without forgetting next time.

214
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,384
Well, no.

215
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:00,761
What?

216
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,681
Why should I share materials
with my competition?

217
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:08,602
It's not just Hanbada and Taesan,
Ihwa and Geumgang that are competing.

218
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:09,645
We're competing too.

219
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,440
You and I are both here
on a one-year contract.

220
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,942
And we need good performance reviews
to get our contracts renewed.

221
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:19,405
Every single action, every single case.
They'll all be evaluated.

222
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:24,160
But I guess you're not really interested
in getting your contract renewed, right?

223
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,746
If you were, you wouldn't have been
absent without notice like that.

224
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,457
That's…

225
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,878
I'm interested in getting
my contract renewed too.

226
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,882
Then we're competitors.

227
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,634
Though it seems as if I'm winning again.

228
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,052
What?

229
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,514
Over there.

230
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:50,561
It seems like you won't be receiving
the next batch of materials either.

231
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,579
Obligor's counselor.

232
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,664
You submitted additional material today.

233
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,416
Yes, Your Honor.

234
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,044
They are materials to substantiate
that Ihwa ATM's application

235
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,546
for model utility rights itself
is false in action.

236
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,132
Could you please look at the screen?

237
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:23,886
EVIDENCE TO SUBSTANTIATE
IHWA ATM'S CLAIMS AS FALSE

238
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,387
In October 2020,

239
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:30,309
Ihwa ATM applied for model utility rights
for a security device for the cassettes

240
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,102
in automatic teller machines.

241
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,521
But this technology

242
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,439
was plagiarized.

243
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,400
In the United States, an exhibition called

244
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,987
the Chicago International Engineering Fair
is held every April.

245
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,532
A lot of technology
regarding ATMs are introduced there.

246
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,576
So it's also well-known
among ATM companies in Korea.

247
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,078
Your Honor.

248
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:52,122
Please compare the two designs
shown on the screen.

249
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:57,127
One was presented by an American company
at the exhibition back in 2019.

250
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,671
And the other is the one

251
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:02,508
that Ihwa ATM is arguing
to have developed on their own in 2020.

252
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:08,138
The American company made this technology
public as open-source technology.

253
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,726
They did it so that anyone can freely use
and modify it without any restrictions.

254
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,853
However, Ihwa ATM

255
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:18,482
took this technology and pretended
that they developed it themselves,

256
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:22,069
and applied for its model utility rights
so that other companies can't use it.

257
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:25,906
Well, they did not take
the American company's design as is.

258
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,244
The two designs look similar,
but there is a clear difference.

259
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:34,039
The security device on Ihwa ATM's cassette
has a much more segmented sensor

260
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,126
for measuring the weight of the bills
than the American company's.

261
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,545
They didn't copy
the technology made public as is,

262
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,881
but they developed it
by adding new technology.

263
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,425
So the grounds to apply
for model utility rights may…

264
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,635
not be enough.

265
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,764
But we do have grounds.

266
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,684
Gosh, Attorney.

267
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:56,353
That level of segmentation is common.

268
00:14:56,854 --> 00:15:00,357
Unlike the United States,
Korean bills vary in size,

269
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,818
whether it's ten thousand won,
or fifty thousand won.

270
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,445
That's why segmentation is done.

271
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,282
If they applied for the model utility
rights because of that,

272
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,326
they really have no conscience!

273
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,078
The key technology was developed
by the American company!

274
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,747
What do you mean by no conscience?

275
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:22,046
No one in our company, including myself,

276
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,715
has ever attended
the exhibition in Chicago.

277
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,968
This is the first time I'm finding out
about something like that.

278
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:33,390
Geumgang ATM first made
their cassette security device in 2021.

279
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:37,811
Meanwhile, Ihwa ATM already applied
for model utility rights back in 2020.

280
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:38,979
The obligor claims

281
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:42,566
they used the open-source technology
of the American company, but in truth,

282
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,526
didn't they copy Ihwa's technology?

283
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,405
Listen. If you're going to argue
when it was produced,

284
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,074
Leaders is the original.

285
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:54,495
Leaders ATM made theirs
as soon as the exhibition was over.

286
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,246
All the way back in 2019!

287
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,960
If you look at Leaders' product,
it looks exactly like Ihwa's!

288
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,586
Is that so?

289
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,131
Can you substantiate what you just stated?

290
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,008
Your Honor,

291
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,678
we also attempted to find evidence,

292
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,681
but unfortunately, Leaders ATM
went out of business last year.

293
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,518
They went out of business after their
products were recalled due to a defect,

294
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,645
so there aren't any Leaders
products left in the market.

295
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:28,487
It's difficult to make a ruling
on whether this technology

296
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:33,367
was solely developed by Ihwa ATM or
if it's a slight variation of technology

297
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:37,246
that was already released
based on these materials alone.

298
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:41,125
Since the KIPO's evaluation result for
the model utility rights hasn't come out,

299
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,418
it's even more difficult.

300
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,462
Is there any other material to present?

301
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,256
Your Honor.

302
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,341
In order to substantiate the novelty

303
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,135
of the model utility rights
application by Ihwa ATM,

304
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,846
we also need some time
to put together the materials.

305
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,389
Yes, I agree.

306
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,308
Then we'll set the date
for the next questioning.

307
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,518
The court is adjourned.

308
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,520
All rise.

309
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,582
-Good work.
-Of course.

310
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,876
Is Geumgang ATM's claim true?

311
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,294
What?

312
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,677
I'm going to go answer this call.

313
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:34,678
Okay.

314
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,641
I have other plans,
so I'm going to head out.

315
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,685
-Wrap things up here.
-All right.

316
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,354
I'm headed out as well.
I have a lot to do.

317
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,439
What?

318
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,194
Shouldn't we check
the facts with the client?

319
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:53,155
We can only check the facts
if he tells us the truth.

320
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:58,535
So do you think
Mr. Hwang Du-yong is lying?

321
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,703
I'm not sure.

322
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,914
It could be that Geumgang
is committing fraud.

323
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,916
Isn't everyone in business like that?

324
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,960
The direction of the defense
depends on whether or not Ihwa ATM

325
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:10,714
developed the technology themselves.
We have to find out what the facts are.

326
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,801
Then you go find out.

327
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,095
I'll do my own thing.

328
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:21,350
But don't interrogate the client
about what the facts are.

329
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,559
You'll get me fired too.

330
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:23,977
What?

331
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,815
You know that we're being
employed by the client, right?

332
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:28,899
The customer is king.

333
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:32,903
Come to think of it,
you never handle cases quietly.

334
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:33,862
Right.

335
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,323
That time you were taken off a case

336
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:39,034
because you upset the Chairman
of Sangjeong Pharmaceutical.

337
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,120
It's not like you're
Wild Card Woo Young-woo.

338
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,580
Wild…

339
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,916
"Wild Card Woo Young-woo"?

340
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:46,917
Yes.

341
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,460
You…

342
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,337
You Tactician Kwon Min-woo!

343
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,970
What?

344
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,179
"Tactician"?

345
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,563
Have you no conscience?

346
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,691
I'm saying we never went there!

347
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,192
Stop with the lying!

348
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:17,156
What ATM company in Korea
has never gone to the Chicago exhibition?

349
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,908
Every time new technology was presented
in Chicago, everyone copied it!

350
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,369
That may be true
for Geumgang, but not Ihwa!

351
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,955
The employees on our
Development Team all came together

352
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,124
and toiled for years to make it.

353
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,126
Is it not enough
that you stole this technology?

354
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,086
Why are you trying to swipe
other people's efforts too?

355
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,005
Effort? What effort?

356
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,464
-An effort to come up with a dirty trick
-Look.

357
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,550
-to ruin other companies?
-Can you tell who's lying?

358
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:40,012
Why do you keep speaking
disrespectfully to me, old man?

359
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,723
-You can't speak like that to people!
-What?

360
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,308
"Old man"?

361
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:47,686
That's the nicest thing I could call you.
Should I say what I'm thinking?

362
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,688
-Go ahead!
-You can't, can you?

363
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,690
So why bother asking?

364
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:55,444
-You can't even tell who's lying.
-Do you think you can keep insisting?

365
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:59,907
Let me tell you this. We don't do
anything that's this lousy like you.

366
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,074
"Lousy"?

367
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,785
We came all this way by working hard,

368
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,663
and we're claiming the rights
that should be rightfully ours.

369
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:11,168
So Geumgang should stop trying to get
a free ride on other people's hard work.

370
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,590
Cham, cham, cham.

371
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:24,973
Cham, cham, cham!

372
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,058
Gosh.

373
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,478
Cham, cham, cham!

374
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,731
Cham, cham, cham!

375
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,736
Hey! How come you're so good at this?
You should enter a competition!

376
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,988
But is there really a connection
between being good at this game

377
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,033
and differentiating
between true and false?

378
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,451
Hey.

379
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,578
Are you doubting my method?

380
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,372
What do those books say?

381
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,415
THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF BODY LANGUAGE
DIGGING UP LIES

382
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,333
Well…

383
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,921
If a person is lying, their body releases
a chemical called catecholamine.

384
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,798
And it causes the tissues
inside the nose to swell up.

385
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:00,342
Pinocchio was actually
a fairy tale based on facts.

386
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,636
And if a person lies,
their blood pressure rises

387
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:06,223
and it stimulates the nerve tissue at
the tip of the nose, making it feel itchy.

388
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,269
Hearing that makes my nose
really itchy right now.

389
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,981
Was this just now true or false?

390
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,568
-What?
-Hey.

391
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,780
What kind of person's nose grows bigger
and becomes itchy just because they lied?

392
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,365
I've never seen anyone like that.

393
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:27,995
Hey, you don't need any of this.
Just remember Cham Cham Cham.

394
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,873
Look straight into
the other person's eyes.

395
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:35,419
Looking straight
into the other person's eyes

396
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:38,463
is the most difficult thing
in the world for someone with autism.

397
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,966
That's right.

398
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:45,387
Then look between their eyebrows.
The area of truth.

399
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:53,687
Then you'll get a feeling.

400
00:21:54,313 --> 00:22:00,444
If what they're saying is true,
you'll get the feeling of it being true.

401
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:05,699
If they're lying, you'll get
the feeling of it being a lie.

402
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,119
Got it?

403
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,748
-Yes.
-Now!

404
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:16,084
I'll guess first.
Say anything that comes to mind.

405
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,174
I don't want to lose
against Attorney Kwon Min-woo.

406
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,258
Kwon Min-woo?

407
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,178
-The good-looking guy?
-What?

408
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,056
No, not Lee Jun-ho. Kwon Min-woo.

409
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:32,350
Yes, not Lee Jun-ho. Kwon Min-woo.
The good-looking guy.

410
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,605
What about Min-woo?

411
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:40,484
Well, I'm working on this case with him.

412
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,488
Attorney Kwon…

413
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,198
Attorney Kwon?

414
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,701
is a jerk.

415
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,704
That's true.

416
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,416
You really want to beat Min-woo right now.

417
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,168
Yes, I do.

418
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,962
Okay, it's your turn now.

419
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,216
Focus, in the spirit of Cham Cham Cham.

420
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,510
"Focus, in the spirit of Cham Cham Cham."

421
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:07,719
Yes, are you ready?

422
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:08,804
Yes.

423
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,350
Lee Jun-ho

424
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,227
likes…

425
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:18,939
Woo Young-woo.

426
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,444
What is that?

427
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,280
You're supposed to guess.
I know the answer.

428
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,157
How would you know that?

429
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,954
Did you guys go to Nakjo Village or not?

430
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,289
Nakjo Village?

431
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,458
We did.

432
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,293
Now.

433
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,754
Lee Jun-ho likes

434
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,006
Woo Young-woo.

435
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,592
True…

436
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,220
or false?

437
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,324
-Give me one second.
-Okay.

438
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,621
Yes, Attorney Jang.

439
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,500
No. I was just playing basketball.

440
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,296
Attorney Woo?

441
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,173
Yes. I know.

442
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,717
We're on this case together.

443
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,013
You know Attorney Woo
has a disability, I mean, a handicap.

444
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,850
Yes, so there's no choice
but for me to shoulder certain things.

445
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,393
No, it's no trouble.

446
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,646
There are people who make time
to go do volunteer work.

447
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,733
This is the least I could do. Isn't it?

448
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,111
Yes. All right.

449
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,779
Let's get dinner together soon.

450
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:52,199
Okay, goodbye. Salute.

451
00:24:58,788 --> 00:24:59,998
Hey, let's go.

452
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,958
Hey, is it my turn? Your turn?

453
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,878
Okay, you first?

454
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,296
Okay.

455
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,593
Jeez.

456
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,821
What's wrong with you?

457
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,198
Hey!

458
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:35,408
Come on, let's play fair.

459
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,285
What? Play fair?

460
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:41,039
You play fair yourself.

461
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,961
Gosh, what is he mad about?
He was winning.

462
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,045
It hurts.

463
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:50,006
-Here's your food.
-Thank you.

464
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,591
-Of course, enjoy.
-Excuse me,

465
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,176
I still haven't gotten the cheese gimbap.

466
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,553
Coming right up. Just a moment, please.

467
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:58,890
Welcome.

468
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:04,980
What kind of gimbap costs
3,500 and 4,000 won?

469
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,523
It's so expensive!

470
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:09,734
That's how the prices are these days.
The cost of ingredients has gone up.

471
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,152
That doesn't matter.

472
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,280
Gimbap is still gimbap.

473
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,739
Goodness, it's so expensive!

474
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,868
-Hurry and clear this table for me.
-Right.

475
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,537
-Thank you for the food.
-Goodbye.

476
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,971
Did you just think
that woman is a rude customer?

477
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,059
-What?
-What did she say?

478
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:47,647
Excuse me. Did you just say
I'm a rude customer?

479
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,192
Answer me. Then I'll guess if it's true--

480
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,486
I said the gimbap
is expensive because it is!

481
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,612
How dare you call me a rude customer!

482
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,239
You ruined my morning.

483
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,616
Gosh, I'm sorry.

484
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,618
Who is she? Is she your daughter?

485
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,121
Did you just use your daughter
to talk bad about a customer?

486
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,956
Gosh.

487
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,875
She's not my daughter.

488
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,756
You should leave now, Ma'am.

489
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,550
Okay?

490
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,761
What?

491
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,730
Yes, sir.

492
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,108
Goodbye.

493
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,910
There used to be someone on my team
who was a former detective.

494
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,453
And he would always say,

495
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:48,666
"The most honest part of the human body
are the legs and then the hands."

496
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,960
The legs and then

497
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,254
-the hands?
-Yes.

498
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,923
Apparently, the further
things are from the head,

499
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,633
the more difficult it is
to control completely.

500
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,885
You can fake a facial expression,

501
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:02,472
but it's hard to control
shaky legs or sweaty palms.

502
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,391
And what else?

503
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:07,727
If someone is sitting down like they're
ready to bolt out of the room

504
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:12,732
or has their arms stuck to their body
like this as if they're tied to the chair.

505
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:17,237
Or if they keep stroking
their thighs with their hands.

506
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,115
He said those things
could be signs of lying.

507
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:24,160
Geu-ra-mi told me
to look between the eyebrows.

508
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:28,289
The former detective said the legs
and hands are the most important.

509
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,917
Ultimately, do I have to look
at the entire body?

510
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,502
This is quite difficult.

511
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,629
Why don't you just have
a casual conversation?

512
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:36,131
Trust your instincts.

513
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,883
My instincts suck.

514
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:43,888
People with autism
are easily fooled and are not able to lie.

515
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:47,350
If there was a competition to be fooled,

516
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,977
a person with autism would win.

517
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:50,562
Why is that?

518
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:54,190
Is it because people
with autism are innocent?

519
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:55,775
Well…

520
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,403
It's more like

521
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:02,574
people live in a world
that is made up of me and you

522
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:07,036
but people with autism are more used
to living in a world made up of only me.

523
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:11,207
People can think differently from me

524
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:15,462
or have different intentions and trick me.

525
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:18,715
I understand this with my head,
but I keep forgetting.

526
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:23,136
I have to make a conscious effort
at all times to not be fooled by lies.

527
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,479
These stories help.

528
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,107
They do?

529
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,066
Yes.

530
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,820
They help me understand you.

531
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,669
We're here to meet
Director Hwang Du-yong of the Sales Team.

532
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,379
Yes. Go this way.

533
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,006
-Thank you.
-Sure.

534
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,602
Attorney Woo.

535
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:13,937
Should we practice?

536
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:17,023
From now on, I'm Director Hwang Du-yong.

537
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,944
If you ask me a question, I'll answer.

538
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:23,196
Then you guess if it's true or not.

539
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:33,706
Okay, I'll try.
In the spirit of Cham Cham Cham.

540
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,667
Cham Cham Cham?

541
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:43,883
Lee Jun-ho

542
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,135
likes Woo Young-woo.

543
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:47,720
Is this true?

544
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,446
That…

545
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:16,207
is too hard of a question

546
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,710
for Director Hwang Du-yong to answer.

547
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,087
Right.

548
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:22,964
Yes.

549
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,633
It was a practice question.

550
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,312
Excuse me.

551
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:41,107
-Are you from Leaders?
-Yes.

552
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,567
Thank you for coming.

553
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,652
I'm Kwon Min-woo,
the person who called you.

554
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,863
-Nice to meet you.
-Please have a seat.

555
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,699
How did you get my number?

556
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:53,703
I asked around and was finally able
to get a hold of your number.

557
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:54,662
Right.

558
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,707
It was very difficult
to get a hold of any numbers.

559
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,668
Could you tell me
why you wanted to see me?

560
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,421
Yes. You know what a cassette
security device is, right?

561
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,549
Yes. I do.

562
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,260
That must be Ihwa's?

563
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:13,056
Yes. And I'm aware that Leaders
had made a similar cassette.

564
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:18,561
More like the same.

565
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,104
It's the same cassette.

566
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,231
Was that made
with the open-source technology

567
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,816
from the 2019 Chicago exhibition?

568
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,734
Yes.

569
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:30,782
We really worked hard back then
to be number one in the industry.

570
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,534
The Chicago exhibition was held in April,

571
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:37,163
and we were already trying to manufacture
the product in October of that year.

572
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:39,499
We shouldn't have overdone it like that.

573
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:40,667
I regret it.

574
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:42,418
Why is that?

575
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,045
We pushed ourselves too hard.

576
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,673
We stayed up every night
to keep the factory running,

577
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,133
but we made a mistake
on an important part.

578
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,970
There was an error
with the bill recognition.

579
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,429
Because of that,

580
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:57,767
the new product that we worked so hard to
prepare was all refunded, and eventually,

581
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,061
the company went under.

582
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:04,565
So are there no Leaders products
left in the market at all?

583
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,985
Well, they were all disposed of.

584
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,488
Now, they don't exist in the world.

585
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,534
For some reason, that makes me sad.

586
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,370
We really worked hard to make it.

587
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,047
Director Hwang's office is this way.

588
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,632
Right. Thank you.

589
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,467
Between the eyebrows, legs, and hands.

590
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,803
Between the eyebrows, legs, and hands.

591
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,264
Between the eyebrows, legs, and hands.

592
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:45,148
-Your guests are here.
-Right.

593
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:56,993
Between the eyebrows,

594
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:58,703
leg,

595
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,204
and hand…

596
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:01,998
They're injured.

597
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,458
I was in a car accident.

598
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,586
It seems like you're injured quite badly.

599
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,129
Are you sure
you should be working like this?

600
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:09,881
Yes, I'm fine.

601
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:13,968
Attorney Woo and an employee
from Hanbada came all this way.

602
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,928
How could I stay in bed at the hospital?

603
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,973
Between the eyebrows, leg, and hand…

604
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,601
Things must be hard for you
because you got hurt.

605
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:22,935
Yes, well.

606
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:26,189
You said you had questions
about product development?

607
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:27,815
As you can see, I'm injured,

608
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,859
and since I'm on the sales team,
I don't really know much.

609
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:32,070
Let me take you
to meet the person in charge.

610
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,238
Follow me.

611
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,369
Manager Bae.

612
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,875
This is Manager Bae Seong-cheol
of our Research and Development lab.

613
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,628
He was the driving force
behind the new product.

614
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,838
I wouldn't say the driving force.

615
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:54,133
This is an attorney
and an employee from Hanbada.

616
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:55,760
Hello.

617
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,763
They're here to hear
about the development of the new product.

618
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,682
-Please have a seat.
-Okay.

619
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:19,242
When did you come up
with the cassette security device?

620
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:20,284
What?

621
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,370
When?

622
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,998
End of 2019?

623
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,084
Early 2020? Around then.

624
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:31,045
-Please tell us exactly when it was.
-End of 2019.

625
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,548
It was the end of 2019.

626
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,885
Was there an incident
that made you come up with this?

627
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,264
Incident?

628
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,892
Obviously, we are aware

629
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,687
Ihwa ATM didn't just take
the American team's technology,

630
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,230
but that you developed it yourselves.

631
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,232
But there are others who are suspicious.

632
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:56,028
If the occasion or its process
is more specific, it has more credibility.

633
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,947
Which is why the attorney must've asked.

634
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,031
Right.

635
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,160
An incident?

636
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,369
Incident…

637
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:05,913
Seong-cheol.

638
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:09,041
What is it? Are you shy?

639
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:13,504
Speak properly. Why do you keep mumbling?

640
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:14,672
Incident?

641
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,968
He's not usually like this.

642
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:22,263
Do you know what he used to do
before he started working here?

643
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,432
Theater.

644
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,892
He was an actor.

645
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,810
-A theater actor?
-Yes!

646
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,021
That's amazing.

647
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,773
It was just for a short time in the past.

648
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:33,983
Just minor roles.

649
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,943
Mr. Bae Seong-cheol.

650
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:41,324
Did you attend the Chicago International
Engineering Fair back in 2019?

651
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,049
Gosh, you're acting like a prosecutor.

652
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,843
Since you're asking like
you're interrogating us,

653
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,429
it feels like we've become the suspects.

654
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:06,182
You're on our side, right?

655
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,940
It's Attorney Kwon.

656
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,150
I'll take it here
since it's probably about the case.

657
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,236
ATTORNEY KWON MIN-WOO

658
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,820
Hi, salute.

659
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,072
Communication secured!

660
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:24,617
Hello, Director. I just met with the man
whose number you gave me.

661
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,619
The one who worked at Leaders ATM.

662
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:27,995
You did?

663
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,541
Yes, and he confirmed that their products
were all refunded and disposed of.

664
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,419
It can't be found in the market.

665
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,797
So I don't think
you have to worry about it.

666
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,174
No matter how much
Geumgang wants to nitpick,

667
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,969
there's nothing
they can bring as evidence.

668
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:46,097
Gosh, Attorney Kwon.

669
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,807
You're the best.

670
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,934
I will contact you again later.

671
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:53,271
-Sure. Goodbye.
-Yes, Director. Goodbye. Salute.

672
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,605
Salute.

673
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,900
That's good news.

674
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,860
Yes, it's good.

675
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,655
So should we end this interrogation?

676
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:05,950
Attorney Kwon said not to worry.

677
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:10,246
It's good that Geumgang ATM
won't have any evidence to submit.

678
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:14,208
However, we still have to
substantiate that our claim is the truth.

679
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:18,212
If Mr. Bae gives a testimony
on the development process himself,

680
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,464
I'm sure it will have a positive effect.

681
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,382
What?

682
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:24,844
Me? You want me to be a witness?

683
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:29,640
But was this idea approved by
all the other attorneys as well?

684
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,477
I should call Attorney Kwon, and…

685
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:37,606
This case is an injunction hearing,
so the jargon is a little different.

686
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,525
Obligee, instead of the plaintiff.

687
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,235
Obligor, instead of the defendant.

688
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,404
Reference witness, instead of the witness.

689
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,822
And the reference witness…

690
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,370
doesn't swear in.

691
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,749
In other words,
even if you commit perjury,

692
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,792
you won't be punished for it.

693
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:06,260
It'll look like you're lying
if you stroke your thighs.

694
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,847
Studies have shown
that the jury doesn't like it

695
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,308
when the witness' hands
are hidden under the stand.

696
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,560
There isn't a jury in an injunction case,

697
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:17,229
but the judge wouldn't trust
a reference witness

698
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,814
who hides their hands either.

699
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,281
Most importantly,
don't rub the tip of your nose.

700
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:31,410
You'll look like Pinocchio
whose catecholamine was released.

701
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,537
Goodness, Attorney Woo,

702
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,915
you're really coaching him.

703
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:38,793
Manager Bae, write this down or something.

704
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,838
Since you were a theater actor,

705
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,092
I'll expect…

706
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,552
you to be good at this.

707
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,595
Right.

708
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:51,597
Yes.

709
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:05,736
We request the questioning of the
reference witness, Mr. Bae Seong-cheol,

710
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,823
the manager of the Research
and Development Team at Ihwa ATM.

711
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,075
Yes, I'll allow it.

712
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,494
Reference witness, step forward.

713
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:36,267
Obligee's counselor,
you may ask questions first.

714
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,655
Sir.

715
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,699
Please introduce yourself.

716
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,202
My name is Bae Seong-cheol.

717
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,038
I'm the manager at Ihwa ATM's
Research and Development Team.

718
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,922
The key technology of the 2022 model

719
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,133
of automatic teller machines
that Ihwa ATM made

720
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,510
is the cassette with the security device.

721
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:12,470
Correct?

722
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,596
Yes.

723
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:17,683
I developed it with my own two hands.

724
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,727
When did you first develop it?

725
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,854
It was the winter of 2019.

726
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:24,940
It was an extremely cold day in November.

727
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:29,236
Was there a particular incident
that motivated you to develop it?

728
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,407
That winter, there were many cases
of ATMs being rigged for embezzlement.

729
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,493
So then, we got orders
from the higher-ups.

730
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,286
"Create a new cassette."

731
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:43,501
"Create an honest cassette
on which lies and tricks won't work."

732
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,587
Could you explain the development process?

733
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:57,723
The blood and tears of the people
in Ihwa's Research and Development Team.

734
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,978
Is there an explanation
more accurate than this?

735
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,732
Until the day we applied
for model utility rights

736
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:09,860
for the cassette security device
in October of 2020,

737
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:13,239
we continued challenging
ourselves, tirelessly.

738
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,034
Are you putting on some kind of play?

739
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:19,036
We obviously know
that you took someone else's technology.

740
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:23,624
Obligor, you will have
enough opportunity to speak.

741
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,125
Do not interrupt during the questioning.

742
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:29,838
I'm going to be
straightforward and ask you.

743
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:32,007
Did you attend
the Chicago International Engineering Fair

744
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,677
that was held
in the United States in 2019?

745
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,061
Sir?

746
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,012
Your Honor.

747
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:19,597
Sir?

748
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:28,439
Ihwa ATM

749
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,442
is a very small company.

750
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:36,363
There are only five people
in the Research and Development Team.

751
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,032
Those five people

752
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:42,411
put their heads and hearts together
and researched and developed for days.

753
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,539
It's such a waste of our efforts

754
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:49,627
for us to be framed
for taking someone else's technology.

755
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,379
People all think similarly,

756
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,840
so similar products
may be released around similar times.

757
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:55,758
However,

758
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:01,388
to lie about copying another's technology?

759
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:06,727
We're not the kind of company to lie about
having developed something ourselves.

760
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,939
Neither Director Hwang,
who is sitting over there, nor I

761
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:14,068
would ever do such a thing.

762
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,202
Your Honor.

763
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:27,748
It still takes days and nights of working
to take and use someone else's technology.

764
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,333
It's always like that!

765
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,043
As I said before,

766
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:33,462
we're in the middle of questioning
the reference witness, so…

767
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:36,090
This is a show, not a questioning!

768
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:40,552
I'm going through
every junk shop in the country

769
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:43,472
to find evidence
that will reveal their outrageous lie.

770
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:47,518
If only I can find
one of the cassettes made by Leaders…

771
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:49,687
So did you find it?

772
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,318
Did you find the evidence?

773
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:02,157
-I'm looking all over the country--
-Then talk after you find it.

774
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:03,450
For now, sit down.

775
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:05,285
Sit down.

776
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,332
Obligee's counselor.

777
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,459
Do you have any more questions?

778
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,466
No.

779
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,467
That is all.

780
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:30,102
Obligor's counselor,
you may now begin cross-examination.

781
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,982
Nice work. It's looking good for us.

782
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:36,525
Thank you.

783
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:39,403
I prepared a lot for the reference
witness's interrogation,

784
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:41,029
so I'm glad it worked.

785
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:43,657
Obligor's counselor,
begin your questioning.

786
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,701
Yes, Your Honor.

787
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,839
Did you hear
that an injunction was decided?

788
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,508
Oh, yes.

789
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:04,845
The people at Geumgang must not have
a clue as to how to deal with this

790
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:07,806
since production
and sales have all been banned.

791
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,349
Anyway, this is all

792
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,227
thanks to the attorneys at Hanbada.

793
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:14,354
Thank you!

794
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:18,400
This is a gift from Ihwa ATM. Take a look.

795
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,865
A painting that brings in wealth!

796
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,783
In other words, a sunflower.

797
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:30,746
Make more and more money, the same way
a sunflower grows taller and taller!

798
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:34,124
Yes, thank you.

799
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,252
Where should we hang this up?

800
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,671
Right here is perfect.

801
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,341
You don't need this here.
You have it memorized, right?

802
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:43,884
ATTORNEY'S CODE OF ETHICS

803
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,968
All right.

804
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,096
Here.

805
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:54,937
That's nice!

806
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:56,355
Right?

807
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:59,816
Take in all this energy

808
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:01,610
and get rich!

809
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:03,820
Okay.

810
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,408
I'll get going then.

811
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,206
I've brought your mail.

812
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:15,207
Okay.

813
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:24,383
FROM CEO OF GEUMGANG ATM OH JIN-JONG

814
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:50,617
ATTORNEY JUNG MYEONG-SEOK

815
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,379
Come in.

816
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:09,344
Attorney Kwon, did you get the letter?

817
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,430
What letter?

818
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:14,725
FROM CEO OF GEUMGANG ATM OH JIN-JONG

819
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,315
"Please read this, Attorney Woo."

820
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:25,611
This is a misunderstanding. You don't
need to be concerned about it. Once we…

821
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,112
Please read this, Attorney Woo.

822
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:28,530
No, that will never happen.

823
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,574
As I repeatedly said before,

824
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:32,993
that technology was developed
by an American company

825
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,995
and was made public at the exhibition.

826
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:39,333
Both Geumgang and Ihwa
took it to make products.

827
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:42,753
Sir.

828
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:45,922
News of the sales ban injunction
spread too quickly.

829
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:49,259
So it seems like some of the investors
are about to barge in here.

830
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,845
Why don't you lay low for a while?

831
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:55,641
Then Ihwa ATM submitted
for model utility rights

832
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:59,019
because they wanted to monopolize it.
Why are you disregarding the truth?

833
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:03,690
If the ban on production and sales
is prolonged with this injunction,

834
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:07,361
Geumgang, which is smaller than Ihwa,
will be out of business soon.

835
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:11,239
Sir!

836
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:13,033
Sir, you should go now.

837
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,202
-Open the door!
-Get out here right now!

838
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,703
Don't hide! Get out here!

839
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:19,748
Sir.

840
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:20,957
-Open up!
-Come out!

841
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,959
-Come out of there!
-Let's talk!

842
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:24,544
-Come out!
-Get out here!

843
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:25,754
Sir!

844
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:30,133
Do you want to be a competent
attorney who only wins in court?

845
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:34,680
Or do you want to be an honorable
attorney who reveals the truth?

846
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,474
Right.

847
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,936
Why didn't he send one to me?

848
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,230
Did I have no presence?

849
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,775
If this letter is true,

850
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,111
shouldn't we do something about it?

851
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:50,320
Like what?

852
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,699
We pleaded the client's position well

853
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:56,660
and got them the injunction they wanted.
What more should we do?

854
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:58,829
If this letter is true--

855
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:00,414
Attorney Woo.

856
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:03,417
When are you going to stop talking
about whether something is true or false?

857
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,837
Didn't you visit Ihwa's headquarters
yourself to figure that out?

858
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,841
What if we show this letter to the people
at Ihwa ATM and persuade them

859
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:13,427
to apply for revocation of the injunction?

860
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:14,553
What?

861
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:16,763
For what reason?

862
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:19,933
Because the contents
of this letter might be true.

863
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:21,560
Do you have any evidence that it is?

864
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,272
I mean,

865
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:30,736
if you can't trust the client,
you shouldn't have taken on the case.

866
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:34,865
Are you saying we should turn things
around because of this letter?

867
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,324
Does this make sense to you?

868
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:39,536
You really are Wild Card Woo Young-woo.

869
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:41,413
Why do you always
think of ways to mess things up?

870
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:45,041
Don't call me Wild Card Woo Young-woo!

871
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,502
Do you like it if I call you
Tactician Kwon Min-woo?

872
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,213
I think the tactician

873
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:52,466
is you, Attorney Woo.

874
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,050
What?

875
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,052
You coached the reference witness
for the questioning, right?

876
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,515
I thought I was watching
an American TV show.

877
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:03,268
He came really prepared.

878
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:06,438
The questions, the responses,

879
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:09,065
and it seemed like
there was also a script.

880
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:13,361
Be honest, Attorney Woo.

881
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,822
Did you think the reference witness
was speaking the truth?

882
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:19,242
You didn't, right?

883
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:21,536
Didn't you help him sound
like he was speaking the truth

884
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,371
because you thought he wasn't?

885
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:25,749
That's exactly what using tactics is.

886
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:29,169
Whether you thought it was true or not,

887
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,963
if you decided to trust him, stick to it.

888
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:35,634
You owe that to the client

889
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,427
as an attorney.

890
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,196
Can I have the paperwork
I asked for earlier?

891
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,697
-Okay.
-Thank you.

892
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:58,907
Hey, Attorney Woo.

893
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:03,161
I saw that you called me earlier.
What was it about?

894
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:04,871
Right.

895
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:12,546
I had something
I wanted to ask you earlier.

896
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:14,506
You did?

897
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:17,801
Now, I don't.

898
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,262
What? All right then.

899
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:29,831
This is unexpected.
Woo Young-woo eating in the cafeteria?

900
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:32,334
Today's dinner menu is gimbap.

901
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:36,379
I should tell you whenever
they serving gimbap from now on then.

902
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:42,677
It seemed like you told Attorney Kwon.

903
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:45,597
-What?
-Tactician Kwon Min-woo.

904
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:47,557
Right.

905
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:50,435
That's because he kept calling me
Wild Card Woo Young-woo.

906
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:53,939
You're on a nickname basis now
after working on one case together?

907
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:56,441
Wild Card Woo Young-woo
is not my nickname.

908
00:53:57,233 --> 00:53:58,735
Make me one.

909
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,865
How about "Babyface Choi Su-yeon"?

910
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:06,785
Or…

911
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,537
"Most Beautiful Choi Su-yeon"?

912
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:10,622
No.

913
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,500
-No?
-No.

914
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:14,834
Those aren't you.

915
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,002
Then what am I?

916
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:18,880
You're…

917
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:20,632
I'm?

918
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:23,760
like the spring sunshine.

919
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,554
What?

920
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:29,641
I've thought so ever since
we were in law school.

921
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:32,769
You told me where the lecture hall was,
when class was canceled,

922
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:34,479
and when the test material changed.

923
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:38,733
You tried to stop the other students
from making fun of me or bullying me.

924
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:42,112
Even now, you open my water bottles for me

925
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:45,907
and tell me that you'll let me know
when they serve gimbap again.

926
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:51,955
You're a bright, warm,
kind, and sweet person.

927
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:55,667
You're Spring Sunshine Su-yeon.

928
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:13,643
Attorney Woo.

929
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:17,981
You know how Geumgang ATM
filed an appeal for the injunction?

930
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:19,566
Yes.

931
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,818
And now they're saying that
there should be an on-site verification.

932
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:25,071
The CEO of Geumgang was going on
about going through junk shops

933
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,157
all over the country to find evidence.

934
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,367
It seems as though
he finally found something.

935
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:31,828
On-site verification?

936
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:35,081
Yes. They want us at a bank
in Mangu-dong, Jungnang-gu.

937
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:36,833
Enjoy your meal.

938
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:38,543
Thanks.

939
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:54,017
We will now start the on-site verification
of Case Number 2022, Injunction Case 1547,

940
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:58,146
based on the procedures of the appeal
filed for the preliminary injunction

941
00:55:58,229 --> 00:55:59,939
against infringement
of intellectual property rights.

942
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:02,442
Obligor's counselor.

943
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:04,819
You applied for on-site verification.

944
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:07,280
Could you show us
the object of verification?

945
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:08,406
Yes, Your Honor.

946
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:12,702
This is the automatic teller machine
made by Leaders ATM.

947
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,788
Most of the same models
have been disposed of,

948
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:17,957
but this one machine was left here
in the Mangu-dong branch.

949
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,794
Could you open it
and show us the cassette?

950
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:30,595
This is the cassette.

951
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:38,812
This is the cassette that Ihwa ATM
claims to have developed on their own.

952
00:56:39,395 --> 00:56:41,397
Please compare the two cassettes.

953
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:44,651
The difference between
these cassettes and typical cassettes

954
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,611
is the number plate on the front

955
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:49,781
and the weight measuring sensor
for the bills at the bottom on the inside.

956
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:59,082
The two cassettes are not
only similar on the outside.

957
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:03,461
Please look at the cassette
designs of the two companies.

958
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,214
The interior layout is also similar.

959
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:13,471
Ihwa ATM applied for model utility rights
in October of 2020.

960
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:16,558
So when did Leaders ATM make this product?

961
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:20,812
Could you please check the delivery date
that is marked on the inside?

962
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:29,863
The delivery date is October 23rd, 2019.

963
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:32,073
Yes.

964
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:36,202
This product was manufactured
a year before Ihwa ATM.

965
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:40,331
Novelty is the most important factor for
the application of model utility rights.

966
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:42,584
It can't be the same as prior technology.

967
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:46,921
This is a matter stated
in Article 29 of the Patent Act.

968
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:48,506
Therefore, Ihwa ATM

969
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:51,593
is not qualified to acquire
model utility rights for this technology.

970
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:54,179
Thus, we request the revocation
of the injunction prohibiting

971
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:56,598
production and sales
that have been issued to Geumgang ATM.

972
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:16,618
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

973
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:19,496
Take care.

974
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,169
Good work.

975
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:37,680
The injunction is likely to be revoked.

976
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,016
It seems so.

977
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:42,227
And the possibility
of the model utility rights

978
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:45,188
not passing the evaluation
seems high as well.

979
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:47,607
I guess so.

980
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:51,569
Are you all right?

981
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:52,820
Yes, I'm fine.

982
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,405
While the injunction was issued,

983
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:56,991
I completed most of the supply contracts
with the banks.

984
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:59,118
Even if it's revoked,
it won't affect us much.

985
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:00,870
I see.

986
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:03,998
Was this your plan the whole time?

987
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:08,461
What you said about developing
the technology on your own…

988
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:11,047
I'm glad you're fine.

989
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,966
We're just a little
worried because technically,

990
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,425
Geumgang won the trial.

991
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:17,595
Winning this battle doesn't matter.
They lost the war.

992
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:22,642
The CEO of Geumgang probably already knows
that we won all the contracts.

993
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:25,144
He's just mad, so he's
dragging it out until the end.

994
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:28,606
This one should hurt quite a bit.

995
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:32,986
Gosh, I wonder if Geumgang will be
following down the path Leaders took?

996
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:38,199
Anyway, this is all thanks to you.
You all did such an amazing job.

997
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:40,243
We really appreciate it.

998
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:45,164
I'll get going then.

999
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:42,597
Attorney Woo?

1000
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:46,476
So, ultimately,

1001
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:51,022
I helped Ihwa ATM
take advantage of the law.

1002
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,316
Excuse me?

1003
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:56,277
Applying for model utility rights,
and filing for the injunction

1004
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:59,864
were all lies to monopolize the contracts.

1005
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:03,493
And instead of stopping them, I helped.

1006
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,374
And what's worse is…

1007
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:15,505
I think I already knew that.

1008
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,974
When we visited Ihwa ATM,

1009
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:31,688
did you think Director Hwang
and Manager Bae were speaking the truth?

1010
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:34,565
Well…

1011
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:37,193
-I…
-There's no way you did.

1012
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:41,572
Try to remember what Mr. Bae
was like at the time.

1013
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:45,451
Sitting down with his legs looking like
they're ready to bolt out of the room,

1014
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:48,162
his arms stuck to his body
as if he was tied to the chair,

1015
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:51,499
repeatedly stroking
his thighs with his hands,

1016
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:53,543
and even rubbing the tip of his nose.

1017
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:57,046
He was a lie in and of itself.

1018
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:00,842
Right.

1019
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:02,844
In the end,

1020
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:07,807
I fooled myself,
pretending not to know the truth

1021
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,602
when I did.

1022
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:15,231
Because I wanted to win.

1023
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:19,610
Right.

1024
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:27,952
I'm ashamed.

1025
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:10,745
ATTORNEY WOO YOUNG-WOO

1026
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:01,921
PLEASE READ THIS, ATTORNEY WOO

1027
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:06,425
WHY ARE YOU DISREGARDING THE TRUTH?

1028
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:13,057
DO YOU WANT TO BE A COMPETENT
ATTORNEY WHO ONLY WINS IN COURT?

1029
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:16,269
OR DO YOU WANT TO BE AN HONORABLE
ATTORNEY WHO REVEALS THE TRUTH?

1030
01:04:28,072 --> 01:04:30,157
TAESAN LAW FIRM ATTORNEY TAE SU-MI

1031
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:33,744
Come in.

1032
01:04:38,082 --> 01:04:39,083
Right.

1033
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:50,011
Candidate Tae Su-mi,
it's nice to finally meet you.

1034
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:52,388
I'm Administrator Kim Yeong-il

1035
01:04:52,471 --> 01:04:53,723
from the Office of the Secretary
at the Blue House.

1036
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:55,349
I'm Tae Su-mi.

1037
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:57,184
Have a seat.

1038
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:02,440
Congratulations on becoming a candidate
for the Minister of Justice.

1039
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:05,109
I'm just a candidate.

1040
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:08,404
I'm worried I have
such a high mountain climb.

1041
01:05:09,113 --> 01:05:12,158
You're here today
to retrieve the paperwork, right?

1042
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:17,955
PRELIMINARY QUESTIONNAIRE FOR
HIGH-RANKING PUBLIC OFFICIAL CANDIDATES

1043
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:21,334
I was writing
the self-verification statement,

1044
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:22,501
and I was nervous.

1045
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:27,340
I take pride in having lived
an incomparably decent life,

1046
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:30,676
but the idea of someone
verifying it made me nervous.

1047
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,763
We've never had the former CEO
of the country's greatest law firm

1048
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:36,265
as a candidate
for Minister of Justice before.

1049
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:38,851
Seeing as how this is
an unconventional selection,

1050
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,020
we are planning on doing
an extra thorough verification

1051
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:42,688
before writing up the report.

1052
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:44,315
In the end,

1053
01:05:44,982 --> 01:05:47,485
the goal is to safely make it
through the confirmation hearing.

1054
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,237
Of course.
I look forward to working with you.

1055
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:57,161
There's one thing I have to ask you.

1056
01:05:57,912 --> 01:05:58,913
Go ahead.

1057
01:05:58,996 --> 01:06:02,249
We can't ignore public opinion
during the candidate verification.

1058
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:03,668
Public opinion?

1059
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:06,003
Are you talking about my reputation?

1060
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:06,963
Yes.

1061
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:10,216
It seems as though there's a rumor

1062
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,344
among your university colleagues.

1063
01:06:14,428 --> 01:06:15,972
Is that so? What is it?

1064
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:18,015
That you, Candidate Tae,

1065
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:21,894
have a child out of wedlock.

1066
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,104
Are you aware of this?

1067
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,236
I thought it was going to be
something else.

1068
01:06:31,278 --> 01:06:33,823
Isn't that such petty gossip
to worry about?

1069
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:37,034
It is petty gossip.

1070
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:39,328
But you know as much as I do

1071
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:43,290
that it's always the little things
that ruin public officials.

1072
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:48,713
It really is preposterous.

1073
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:51,716
Why does that kind of
rumor keep circulating?

1074
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:53,384
Perhaps,

1075
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:57,680
there's someone who resembles me
out there somewhere.

1076
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:01,976
So I can trust that you don't have

1077
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:04,687
any illegitimate children?

1078
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:06,313
Of course.

1079
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:28,794
Cool down Attorney Choi so that
she doesn't treat this case emotionally.

1080
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:34,175
Did you run away so that you could
raise her until she reached an age

1081
01:07:34,258 --> 01:07:36,218
-where she could remember her mother?
-Yes.

1082
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:41,390
-Ms. Gye Hyang-sim must get probation!
-That was passionate.

1083
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:44,185
Are you going to trial
because you don't want to yield?

1084
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:45,394
They're such a good-looking match.

1085
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:47,938
Don't you think Jun-ho
likes Attorney Choi?

1086
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:51,108
If I were a whale, would my mom
not have abandoned me?

1087
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:56,822
