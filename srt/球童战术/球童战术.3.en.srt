Don't add too much text.

00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,510
Keep it simple.

8
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,300
I'll elaborate during the presentation.

9
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,840
Put this on the next page.

10
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,750
Wait, why do you still have your hood on?

11
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,500
You're at home.

12
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,210
My hair might be flattened.

13
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,330
Does it matter?

14
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,140
There is no one but me here.

15
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,120
-Take it off.
-What?

16
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,940
Oh.

17
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,950
Not flattened at all.

18
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,539
Is it because your head is round?

19
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,100
You look fine.

20
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,470
Ah, really?

21
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,990
By the way,

22
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,680
aren't you nervous about the presentation?

23
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,350
I play basketball in front
of a bigger audience.

24
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,540

25
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,430
Right.

26
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,860
Why?

27
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,030
Ah.

28
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,920
No, I mean you're good at everything.

29
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,680
I just envy you.

30
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,800
It's sort of fascinating
how different we are.

31
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,079
I'm just saying.

32
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:40,050
Are you indirectly calling me attractive?

33
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,550
Huh?

34
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,090
What? You?

35
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,460
No, you're not attractive.

36
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,950
No, I mean...

37
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,380
I was just saying.

38
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,770
I just want to be like you.

39
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,290
You're not attractive.

40
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,900
No, I mean...

41
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,640
I mean, I don't find you

42
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,870
sexually attractive.

43
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,090
What?

44
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,400
Han Jiwon.

45
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:12,000
How did your past relationships end?

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,480
All of a sudden?

47
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,240
Just curious.

48
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,690
Well...

49
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:23,070
I don't usually share
such stuff with others.

50
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,350
Really?

51
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,329
That's cool.

52
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,530
All serious relationships?

53
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,770
Yeah.

54
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:42,040
I always date with marriage in mind.

55
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,670
What am I saying?

56
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,550
Just shut up, you idiot!

57
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:54,570
I don't think you need
to change how you are.

58
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,220
There must be a reason
why everyone loves you.

59
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,830
Well,

60
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,770
I think I sort of get why.

61
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:09,580
Ah, you think?

62
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,060
But

63
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,670
why are you so interested in me?

64
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,570
Anyway,

65
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,430

Well, um...

70
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,190
If you're curious, don't search online.

71
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,750
Just ask me.

72
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,460
That would be way faster.

73
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,440
Oh, um, these aren't my searches.

74
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,000
Um, actually, my sister visited recently.

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,500
I-It must be her.

76
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,470
You're an only child.

Everyone knows it.

78
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,520
The whole country, actually.

79
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,590
No, I mean...

80
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,300
My cousin.

81
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,290
Like he'd believe this...

82
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,270
Sure.

83
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,140
Your cousin.

84
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,500
Dang it.

85
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,210
Am I

86
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,260
not sexually attractive?

87
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,740
What the hell.

88
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,320
What's wrong with him?

89
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,470
Hey, eat more protein
if you're losing muscle.

90
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,400
Have you not been working out?

91
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,710
No.

92
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,240
I don't think it's about muscles.

93
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,070
But someone said

94
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,840
I'm not sexually attractive.

95
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,850
So,

96
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,610
someone actually told you

97
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,260
you're not sexually attractive?

98
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,480
Yes.

99
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,560
Those are the exact words.

100
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,210
But what does that even mean,

101
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,070
sexual attraction?

102
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,010
It means they don't want to touch you.

103
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,210
And kissing you must disgust them.

104
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,380
Touching and kissing?

105
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,420
Yeah.

106
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,900
You just don't do it for them.

107
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,670
Another girl in your life already?

108
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,740
I'm so jealous.

109
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,200
What for?

110
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,150
He just got insulted.

111
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,570
Why don't you introduce her to me?

112
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,970
I'm in better shape than you.

113
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,680
Do you not own a mirror?

114
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,350
If she rejected Jeongwu,
would she fall for you?

115
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,220
Hey, I'm quite a catch too, okay?

116
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,850
Where'd you get the confidence?

117
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,140
They go crazy over my curly hair.

118
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,300
You're delusional.

119
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,950
This is the end of my presentation.

120
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,010
Thank you.

121
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,040
Well done!

122
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,690
How was I?

123
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,220
Great, as always.

124
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,940
You totally killed it.

125
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,700
Hey, we might even all get an A.

126
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,630
Right?

127
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,200
Let's celebrate after class.

128
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,080
Celebrate?

129
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,980
Yeah.

130
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,370
You don't want to?

131
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,090
Huh? No.

132
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,420
Count me in.

133
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,530
Okay.

134
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,490
Check your scores later.

135
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,210
Thank you all for your hard work.

136
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,320
That's all for today.

137
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,890
-Thank you.
Thank you!

138
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,570
Where should we go?

139
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:43,990
What should we eat today?

140
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,260
How about here?

141
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,190
I ate there yesterday.

142
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,510
Hey, Jiwon.

143
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,040
Do you have a minute?

144
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,960
Huh?

145
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,860
I have something to tell you.

146
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,130
Ah... really?

147
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,710
So pretty.

148
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,230
Then...

149
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,440
Let's talk outside.

150
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,320
Okay.

151
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,670
Yo!

152
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,180
She's going to confess, right?

153
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,180
I think so.

154
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,820
The first to get a girl out of us four?

155
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,440
Gosh, is there anything he's bad at?

156
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,799
Whatever.

157
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,970
Send me the location
and I'll meet you there.

158
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,570
I need to use the restroom.

159
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,409
Oh, okay.

160
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,900
Why is he upset again?

161
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,450
He's so sensitive.

162
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,410
What is it that you want to say?

163
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,580
Um... do you have a girlfriend?

164
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,340
A girlfriend?

165
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,400
No.

166
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,090
Is there any girl you like?

167
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,380
What?

168
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,600
Any...

169
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,600
girl?

170
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,680
No.

171
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,080
Then can I like you?

172
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:29,020
Ah... Um...

173
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:32,570
You can just be honest with me.

174
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:36,380
But to be honest,

175
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,350
I don't fall in love easily.

176
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,240
I'm not very interested in

177
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,040
networking either.

178
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,800
So...

179
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,920
do you know what I'm getting at?

180
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,350
Thank you

181
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,500
for being honest with me.

182
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,600
I'm sorry.

183
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,910
It's okay.

184
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,780
Even if I'd get rejected,

185
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,150
I just really wanted to confess to you.

186
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,510
I'll get going then.

187
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,710
Okay.

188
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,520
But still,

189
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,340
this is so different from
what we agreed on.

190
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,400
I did everything
you asked me to previously.

191
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,380
I know, I know.

192
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,670

00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,840
Oh?

383
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,900
Hello.

384
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,050
Aren't you Kwon Jeongwu,
the basketball player?

385
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:20,250
I've been following your games.

386
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,300
I'm a fan.

387
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,340
Jiwon.

388
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,920
The chancellor will be here soon.
Can't you leave later?

389
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,670
Are you that busy?

390
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,730
Huh?

391
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,760
Um, no.

392
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,240
My ankle hurts from the somersaults.

393
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,480
I'm taking a break.

394
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,680
Hey.

395
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,240
You're done performing anyway.

396
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,000
Just sit in the audience.

397
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,250
Many higher-ups are coming.

398
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,440
How can you be absent?

399
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,770
Do you get what I'm saying?

400
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:59,290
Oh... Yes.

401
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:03,310
Yes, that's the spirit.

402
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,930
You're the mainstay of our faculty.

403
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:07,240
How are you grumbling already?

404
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,020
It'd make me look bad.

405
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,450
What?

406
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,970
Didn't you say this is the last time?

407
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,780
Jiwon.

408
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:22,410
That was just a figure of speech.

409
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:25,730
So many people are here just to see you.

410
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,960
How can you just participate this year?

411
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,830
Do you have to be so selfish?

412
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,090
But you said...

413
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,980
The cover shoot?

414
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:39,100
Didn't I thank you for that already?

415
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,980
Also,

416
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,980
it's all because you're famous.

417
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,420
You should be thankful.

418
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,680
Others aren't as understanding as me.

419
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,040
Excuse me.

420
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,320
You said you were my fan.

421
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,670
Then you should know my temper.

422
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,610
Why do you keep provoking me?

423
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,510
What are you trying to say?

424
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:08,530
Know who you're dealing with.

425
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,170
Jiwon won't be staying
for the rest of the event.

426
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:16,250
And he doesn't have to
do as you say, you imbecile.

427
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,790
Get lost.

428
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,950
Are you freaking kidding me?

429
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,340
Han Jiwon.

430
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,630
Don't you think you should say something?

431
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,340
Don't just stand there.

432
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,290
Senior.

433
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,080
Like Jeongwu said,

434
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,620
I'm not staying for the event.

435
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,280
And I won't entertain any more
of your unreasonable demands.

436
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,620
Please don't do it again.

437
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,470
I only agreed to your demands
out of kindness.

438
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,330
Don't mistake my kindness

439
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,120
for weakness.

440
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,470
Han Jiwon.

441
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:04,640
You won't survive military service
with this attitude.

442
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,830
You think everyone's so forgiving like me?

443
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,050
What military service?

444
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,540
As a gold medalist, I'm exempted.

445
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,050
Hello?

446
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,520
Sorry, I shouldn't have meddled.

447
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,760
No.

448
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,600
I should thank you instead.

449
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,330
That felt good.

450
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,090
Han Jiwon.

451
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,640
In front of you...

452
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,140
do all guys end up

453
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:13,700
losing control?

454
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,970
Huh?

455
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,630
What do you mean?

456
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,710
I feel

457
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,970
entranced by you.

458
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,050
Has anyone ever told you that?

[In the next episode]

460
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:05,290
Can you leave?

461
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,200
I'm fine as long as you're not here.

462
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,570
Did I do something wrong?

463
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:12,090
Wow, Han Jiwon sure is popular.

464
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,220
Why don't you sleep over?

465
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,740
What? W-Why should I?

466
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,700
You're so sweet.

467
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,270
I'm only like this to you.

468
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,160
Don't let your guard down.
You might lose.

469
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,840
You think?

470
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,840
I just need to score one point.
