00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,690
We meet again.

2
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,050
Are you stalking me?

3
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,650
Stalking?

4
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,310
If you're going to keep hanging around me,

5
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,590
why don't you sign up as a ballboy?

6
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,780
Wouldn't that be

7
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,600
easier for both of us?

8
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,160
Yes.

9
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,680
I've been avoiding him well these days.

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,870
As long as I stay alert,

11
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,430
I won't get involved with him.

12
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,900
[Yeom Minhyeok as Han Jiwon]

13
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,860
[Choi Jaehyeok as Kwon Jeongwu]

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,060

[Ballboy Tactics]

17
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,920
Hey.

18
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,080
Is this our classroom?

19
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,830
Why is it so packed?

20
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,509
You're so loud.

21
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,520
Don't embarrass me.

22
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,180
Where should we sit?

23
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,880
Ask Jeongwu.

24
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,680
Let's sit separately.

25
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,860
Athlete Han Jiwon!

26
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,200
Do you take this elective too?

27
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:10,759
Excuse me.

28
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,260
Hi again.

29
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,420
Han Jiwon.

30
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,600
Remember me?

31
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,980
I'm Eunoh.

32
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,100
Yang Eunoh, your classmate
at Samjeon Elementary.

33
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,420
Ring a bell?

34
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,380
Eunoh?

35
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,280
Did you live in front of my house

36
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,180
back then?

37
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,079
There you go! That Eunoh.

38
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:36,760
See?

39
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,460
I told you we were classmates.

40
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,220
We were quite close as kids.

41
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,730
Right?

42
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,140
No way.

43
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,329
Who do you think you are?

44
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:48,240
Do you really know this fool?

45
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,230
You don't seem all that
happy to see him.

46
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,240
Ah... It's not that.

47
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,080
In my memory, Eunoh is short...

48
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,380
and looked kind.

49
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,530
Exactly!

50
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,040
Jeongwu!

51
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,000
Yang Eunoh thinks he is
your friend's bestie.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,070
Say something!

53
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,710
Friends? We're more like
master and servant.

54
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,650
Dang it.

55
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,010
Why didn't you tell me
you know the great Jiwon?

56
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,730
So much for friendship.

57
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,550
Well, I'm really your diehard fan.

58
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,360
When you were injured,

59
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,270
I was hospitalized too

60
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,870
for severe heartbreak.

61
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,050
He's the one who got hurt.
Why are you fussing?

62
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,329
I don't know! Let me be!

63
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:38,620
Anyway,

64
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,400
it's an honor to sit next to you,

65
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,050
Athlete Han Jiwon.

66
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,860
The professor is here.

67
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,010
Oh? The athletes are seated together.

68
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,520
You'd make a good group for this class.

69
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,880
Okay, I'll start the class.

70
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,780
It's harmonious with the environment.

71
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,530
Architecture has four main elements.

72
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,620
These are practical elements
for living and activities.

73
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,780
What does that mean?

74
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,440
For example,

75
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,310
going to the restroom in the park.

76
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,050
Strange...

77
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,130
No matter how outgoing someone is,

78
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,220
I never dreamed of becoming like them.

79
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,600
But...

80
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,030
Why is Kwon Jeongwu different?

81
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,460
Let's take a ten-minute break.

82
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,970
Okay.

83
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,790
I'll get going.

84
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,650
Should I inform the professor?

85
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,600
No, I'll do it on my way out.

86
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,050
What the...

87
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,840
You freaking drank half!

88
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,760
I'll buy one for you tomorrow.

89
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,940
Oh, okie.

90
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,120
By the way,

91
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,440
do you need to talk to Jeongwu?

92
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,860
You kept staring at the back of his head.

93
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,960
What is it?

94
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,740
Oh, um...

95
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,520
Well...

96
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,310
Nothing? Bye then.

97
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,740
[Second Round Beer]

98
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:00,980
Yummy food's here.

99
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,530
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

100
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,250
You know the coffee trucks

101
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,130
you receive every birthday?

102
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,690
I contributed to them too.

103
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,850
But don't ask how much I spent.

104
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:23,010
I don't want you to feel pressured,
my dear Jiwon.

105
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,500
Oh... Thank you.

106
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,530
Thanks to you, I enjoyed every birthday.

107
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,110
When is your birthday?

108
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,800
From now on,
I'll celebrate your birthday too.

109
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,530
It's right now.

110
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,830
Hey, from now on,

111
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,120
my birthday is on March 24,

112
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,990
at 9:03 p.m.

113
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,420
What? It's already nine?

114
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,310
Gosh, time flies.

115
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,710
When Jeongwu comes,

116
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,830
let's go to the internet cafe.

117
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,700
Okay.

118
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,690
Oh, you're here.

119
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:52,010
I'm sorry I'm late.

120
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,020
Jeongwu.

121
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,870
Internet cafe after this?

122
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,120
Jiwon, you too?

123
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,070
Ah... I have to go home early.

124
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,130
I don't think I can join you.

125
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,590
Sorry.

126
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,210
Go home early?

127
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,840
What for?

128
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,780
It's nothing, just that

129
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,650
I have a major class tomorrow morning.

130
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,440
You're still so diligent, Jiwon.

131
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,080
He's always been like this.

132
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,840
He was always so well prepared.

133
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,690
All the teachers adored him.

134
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,540
Was I?

135
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,690
I guess you need to be
this diligent to succeed.

136
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,160
Right, aren't you joining your major's

137
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,400
photography contest?

138
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,880
Planning to win that too?

139
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,770
You're joining a contest?

140
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,650
Yeah.

141
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,950
Freshmen can join if they want too.

142
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,950
Looks like it suits you.

143
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,360
We discussed all that in the group chat.

144
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,840
Can't you read your texts?

145
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,540
Stay updated!

146
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,270
It's only important to you.

147
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,440
Don't bother me unless
it's for the group project.

148
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,020
But you read all your girlfriend's texts!

149
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,640
Because she's my girlfriend.

150
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,030
What about us?

151
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,250
Here.

152
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:07,700
He's... still dating her.

153
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,950
Did you drive here?

154
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,340
Ah... Yes, I did.

155
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,210
But it's okay.

156
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,720
I can call a designated driver.

157
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,560
I drank too, so I can't drive.

158
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,750
O-Of course.

159
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,670
I'll get a professional driver this time.

160
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,420
I'll check their business card

161
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,010
-and check the info on my app too.
-Good.

162
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,240
Got it.

163
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,210
You can stop.

164
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,500
Sorry.

165
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,179
Why? Being polite doesn't hurt.

166
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,320
I shouldn't have assumed we were close.

167
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,580
But didn't we meet
for the group project?

168
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,040
When are we starting?

169
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,840
Oh, well, today

170
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,540
is like an orientation.

171
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,120
Western architectural culture?

172
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,390
We'll get it done in a day.

173
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,110
But we did gather for the project.

174
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,740
Like Jiwon said,
let's divide the work now.

175
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,480
Beats rushing last minute.

176
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,690
-I'll do the research.
-Me too! Research!

177
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,020
Organizing the material
and presentation left.

178
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,350
I need to go out for a bit.

179
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,550
She's here.

180
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,350
-What?
-What?

181
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,300
All of a sudden?

182
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,180
Is she angry?

183
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,330
I'll be right back.

184
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,560
Hey, decide who's presenting first.

185
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,410
It's between you two.

186
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,320
I'll do it.

187
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:47,080
Is it his girlfriend?

188
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,290
Yeah. She's an office worker.

189
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,450
At this hour, it can't be good news.

190
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:57,060
I bet she's going to
give him a hard time again.

191
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,620
A long-term relationship?

192
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,810
No.

193
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,570
Has it been half a year?

194
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,290
But he acts like it's been five years.

195
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,540
Totally.

196
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,370
Half a year's long too, I guess.

197
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,680
What about you? Dating anyone?

198
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,790
No.

199
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,490
I don't know much about dating.

200
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm not interested either.

201
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,980
Huh?

202
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,860
That means...
Don't tell me you've been single...

203
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,080
all your life?

204
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,200
Gosh.

205
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,400
Are his fans all shy
because they take after him?

206
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,770
No, I think

207
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,460
even if a girl made a move,
he wouldn't have noticed.

208
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,040
How could you have never dated?

209
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,800
I feel bad for him,

210
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,790
but why do I also feel relieved?

211
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,850
-What the hell is that?
-I don't know.

212
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,160
-Pour one for me.
-More?

213
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,520
I'm going to the restroom.

214
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,850
Okay.

215
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,700
The restroom is...

216
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,670
Turn right,

217
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,620
on the second floor.

218
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,040
It's normal

219
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,260
for a couple to kiss.

220
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,630
Jiwon.

221
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,290
Hey, Jiwon!

222
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,070
Huh?

223
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,660
Are you drunk?

224
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,180
You've been spacing out
since you came back.

225
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,720
Ah... I think I'm tired.

226
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,010
I have to go.

227
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,710
Suddenly?

228
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,800
Not going to the internet cafe?

229
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,650
Is your girlfriend still pissed off?

230
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,350
Why don't you just break up?

231
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,280
I'm leaving.

232
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,700
See you in the dorm.

233
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,580
-Fine. Cheers.
-Cheers.

234
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,290
Bye.

235
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:08,720
Is Jeongwu with his girlfriend?

236
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,560
What's wrong with me?

237
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,140
Not to mention boys,

238
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,190
I'm not even interested in girls.

239
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,060
So why?

240
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,080
Am I a pervert who gets excited

241
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,080
peeking at other couples?

242
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:58,620
[Elective Group]
[Is Jeongwu not coming back to the dorm?]

243
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,200
Not in the dorm?

244
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,730
You major in photography,

245
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,190
but I never see you with a camera.

246
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,690
Is that so?

247
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,450
I heard you can't learn photography.

248
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,640
Isn't it all about talent?

249
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,650
No, I'm not that good.

250
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,170
You must've worked hard.

251
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,860
It's not easy to quit what you were doing

252
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,650
and start on a new path.

253
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,970
It's just...

254
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,570
Once I make up my mind,

255
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,590
I'll go all out.

256
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,130
Han Jiwon.

257
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:11,730
Are you clingy when you're dating?

258
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,340
What?

259
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,960
I'm asking if you're clingy
when you're dating.

260
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,990
I...

261
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,370
I'm someone who lets go easily.

262
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:35,360
But not always.

263
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,550
What am I saying?
I've never dated anyone.

264
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,520
You must've been busy as an athlete.

265
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,990
Guess you're diligent in dating too.

266
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,470
Things just happened by chance.

267
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,340
I told Seungjin and Eunoh

268
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,710
I've never been in a relationship.

269
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,440
Will he find out?

270
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,780
Interesting.

271
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,420
Your eyes don't look that striking.

272
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,750
And what about that?

273
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,850
Your girlfriends must have
had a hard time too.

274
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,510
Wow, look at the time.

275
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,630
Um...

276
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,470
I'll get going.

277
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,520
Han Jiwon!

278
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,220
Goodbye.

279
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,840
Kwon Jeongwu's girlfriend.

280
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,420
[Kim Najeong]

281
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,030
I get it now.

282
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,740
Goodbye.

283
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,460
What I'm curious about

284
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,000
isn't Jeongwu's girlfriend.

285
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm curious about the Jeongwu

286
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,200
when it comes to his girlfriend.

287
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,510
Maybe I shouldn't have run away.

288
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,860
[Yang Eunoh]

289
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,490
Hello?

290
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,140
You answered so quickly.

291
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,520
What are you doing?

292
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,230
Oh, I—

293
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,400
Come downstairs in half an hour.

294
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,980
We'll pick you up.

295
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,030
What?

296
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,360
All of a sudden?

297
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,650
For our group project.

298
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,070
Eunoh.

299
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,320
It's 9 p.m.

300
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,820
What does that have to do
with the project?

301
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,440
Don't you care about

302
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,410
your grades?

303
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,740
Anyway, get ready.

304
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,540
Come downstairs in half an hour.

305
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,860
Han Jiwon!

306
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:34,990
Jeongwu is still in school.

307
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,840
He'll join us after
his basketball practice.

308
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,030
Oh, I see.

309
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,560
Are we going to school then?

310
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,190
No.

311
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,370
We know a nice place.

312
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,040
Did Jeongwu say yes?

313
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,290
He must be tired from practice.

314
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,360
He suggested to meet.

315
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,110
I heard he broke up.

316
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,170
That's why he's—

317
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,660
Don't bring up the breakup without him.

318
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,910
Okay?

319
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,010
Ah...

320
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,940
He broke up.

321
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,040
Get in.

322
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,170
Get in.

323
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,730
Jiwon, isn't the view nice?

324
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:23,590
Yeah.

325
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,760
I told you it's great here.

326
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,190
You fit in well.

327
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,390
Did you bring everything?

328
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,870
Come on, let's start with beer.

329
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,580
Let's drink to his breakup.

330
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,390
That's what friends should do.

331
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,340
Jiwon.

332
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,980
Drink to his breakup?

333
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,920
Aren't we here for the project?

334
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,760
Yes, the project too.

335
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,680
Bonding is key for group projects.

336
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,320
Yeah.

337
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,230
It can't be helped.

338
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,450
Right, you don't know since
you're still a freshman.

339
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:54,460
This is how group projects are done.

340
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,560
But the presentation is next week.

341
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,100
Won't we be swamped in our next meeting?

342
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,410
Hey, don't worry. Things always work out.

343
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,010
We just need one day of focus.

344
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,310
To stay up all night that day,

345
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,970
we need to bond as a team first.

346
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,110
Okay?

347
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,310
Okay.

348
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,980
Jiwon, this is pissing me off.

349
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,370
Open it for me.

350
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:20,350
You're pissing me off even more.

351
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,290
Okay.

352
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,690
You can't even open that?

353
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,110
Thanks for helping me.

354
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,050
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

355
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,930
Come on.

356
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:49,970
Loser buys the beer.

357
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:52,320
Rock, paper, scissors!

358
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,810
Okay, Jiwon is safe.

359
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:57,500
I guess you're good at every competition.

360
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,540
The loser will pick someone
to go with them.

361
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:02,540
Rock, paper, scissors! Okay!

362
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,540
Rock, paper, scissors!

363
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,680
As long as it's not me!

364
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,980
Go with me.

365
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,970
M-Me?

366
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,230
Yes.

367
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,490
You.

368
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,430
I won first.

369
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,550
Jiwon.

370
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,520
I really want to help you.

371
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,670
But athletes should go by the rules.

372
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,440
Jeongwu's seriously...

373
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,160
How is he so bad at rock, paper, scissors?

374
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,900
Get a pack of dried squid too.

375
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,040
By the time we get back,
make sure there are

376
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,810
piping hot instant noodles on the table.

377
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,110
Okay!

378
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,260
Let's go.

379
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,050
You're confusing.

380
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:56,040
You came out at 9 p.m. for the project,

381
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,490
so you must be serious about your grades.

382
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:05,020
But you're also fine
with just hanging out,

383
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,760
so maybe not?

384
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,790
Were you really tricked?

385
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,080
Or did you

386
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,440
come out despite knowing it's a trick?

387
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:20,220
Was I... tricked?

388
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:25,140
Well, since you brought your laptop,
it's clear I guess.

389
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,730
Just put it on.

390
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:40,060
What is this for?

391
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,350
You cut

392
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,880
your hand.

393
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,500
Ah...

394
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,620
You can't just leave the wound open.

395
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,170
Put it on.

396
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,090
Thank you.

397
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,670
Thank you.

398
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,460
Don't tell me...

399
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,350
you picked me for the errand
to buy this for me?

400
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,530
Sort of.

401
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,520
Girls must always get the wrong idea.

402
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,170
N-No.

403
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,150
What I mean is—

404
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,440
I'm not like that to girls.

405
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,400
I'm only like this with you.

406
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,540
Why?

407
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,820
You won't get the wrong idea.

408
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,850
Ah...

409
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,190
Right, how would I?

410
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,310
We're both men after all.

411
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,060
Right?

412
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,330
Give me the trash. I'll throw it away.

413
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,590
You've witnessed all my
embarrassing moments lately.

414
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:10,650
What?

415
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:14,030
Like the day I got slapped.

416
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,900
Ah... I'm sorry about that.

417
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,310
Why are you sorry?

418
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,910
I got slapped because
I broke up with her.

419
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,960
At that time,

420
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,810
why were you there?

421
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,460
I wanted to have coffee
at somewhere quiet.

422
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,790
I see.

423
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,210
It is a perfect place to be alone.

424
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:52,560
I hope my breakup was
great entertainment to you.

425
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,390
Hey.

426
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,180
I like photographing the sky.

427
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,710
Um, what I mean is

428
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,970
I like photographing nature
like the sky and dragonflies.

429
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,880
Sometimes,

430
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,490
I capture better moments by just waiting.

431
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,400
So?

432
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,570
Huh?

433
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:25,080
What are you trying to say?

434
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,820
You'll find a better girlfriend.

435
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,640
Don't be too sad.

436
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,790
I think you're mistaken.

437
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:50,000
I don't feel that way. Don't worry.

438
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,100
Didn't you ask us out
because you broke up?

439
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,250
Yeah.

440
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,180
I asked you guys out

441
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,140
to commemorate the breakup.

442
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,140
Did you get the wrong idea?

443
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,830
I'm not that romantic.

444
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,360
So,

445
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,700
you don't have to be so nice to me.

446
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,960
My heart keeps pounding uncontrollably.

447
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,120
Wanting to avoid him

448
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,990
only makes me more certain
about my feelings.

449
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,350

sexually attractive.

What?

454

Can I like you?

455
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,240
Want to go for more drinks?

456

Where?

459

460
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,980
I want to sleep with you.
