00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,180
Bye.

00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,650

[Answer] [Reject]

203
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,630
What's up?

204
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,300
Just wanted to hear your voice.

205
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,940
This is the first time
you texted me first.

206
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,490
Do you have class tomorrow?

207
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,500
When are you going to school?

208
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,280
Classes?

209
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,740
Hmm...

210
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,690
I have class in the first period

211
00:15:58,690 --> 00:15:59,980
at nine.

212
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,590
Then...

213
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,830
Meet me outside your place at 8:30.

214
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,330
Let's go together.

215
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,790
No, it's okay.

216
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,920
I can take the bus.

217
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,700
A direct bus.

218
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,680
I can drive you there directly too.

219
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,690
See you tomorrow morning.

220
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,780
Okay.

221
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,030
Morning.

222
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,360
Are you feeling better?

223
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,860
What do you think?

224
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,350
But...

225
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,300
you said you won't hide anymore.

226
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,110
Did I?

227
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,860
I mean your cap.

228
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,319
Do you always wear a cap?

229
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,430
Can't you not wear it?

230
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,640
Why?

231
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,040
I'm taller than you.

232
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,819
When I stand upright,

233
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:23,960
I can't see your face.

234
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,040
Ah...

235
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:32,810
People bother you a lot, don't they?

236
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:33,960
Yeah.

237
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,440
A bit.

238
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:41,490
If you run into someone like
that annoying senior again,

239
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,060
just tell me.

240
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,160
You're so sweet.

241
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,510
I'm only like this to you.

242
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,770
We'll be late. Let's go.

243
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,970
Thanks for driving me to school.

244
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,340
Um...

245
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,520
What are your plans after class?

246
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,590
Hmm...

247
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,220
For a photography project,

248
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,230
I need to research locations.

249
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,630
Locations?

250
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:38,190
Do you also go location scouting?

251
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,330
Don't you need someone driving you?

252
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,770
No, not really.

253
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,730
I just need a gymnasium.

254
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,840
So like a sports hall?

255
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,000
Yeah, but...

256
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,690
I can do it myself—

257
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,760
See you tomorrow.

258
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:32,160
Where did Jeongwu go again?

259
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,080
I'm sure he got a new girlfriend.

260
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,490
What?

261
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,690
You're assuming things again.

262
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,480
He hasn't been picking up his phone

263
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,300
and disappears right after practice.

264
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,870
Are you jealous of him?

265
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:47,950
What the hell?

266
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,520
-Hey!
-Hmm?

267
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,800
Don't move.

268
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,600
Thank you.

269
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,530
Hey.

270
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:06,090
You're so inexperienced.
What do you know?

271
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,240
What do you mean?

272
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,630
Don't act like you're so experienced.

273
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,610
Whatever.

274
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:13,320
Forget about Jeongwu.

275
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,160
You still have me, your bestie.

276
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,390
What bestie?

277
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,930
There's only cutthroat
competition between us!

278
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:23,000
Wow, that was so cringey.

279
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,900
If your idol Jiwon finds out
how childish you are,

280
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,350
he'll distance himself from you.

281
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,420
No.

282
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,730
Jiwon won't shun me for that.

283
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,340
He and I

284
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,680
have a special bond.

285
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,600
Really?

286
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,540
How about a game today?

287
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,880
I'll teach you a lesson
and crush your soul.

288
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,400
You're dead. Come on.

289
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,360
Curly Hair! Wait for me!

290
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,820
Don't call me that!

291
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,110
Seriously.

292
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,350
Hey.

293
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,120
Curly Hair?

294
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,640
It's a fact.

295
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,290
I mean the cap.

296
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,160
Can't you not wear it?

297
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,660
When I stand upright,

298
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,710
I can't see your face.

299
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,110
You're here.

300
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,140
No cap today.

301
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,460
Yeah. What are you doing?

302
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,050
The location fee.

303
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,820
What?

304
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:17,700
I rented the hall for today
by offering to clean it.

305
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:36,640
By the way,

306
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,480
can I ask you something?

307
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,420
What is it?

308
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,680
Your jersey number.

309
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,790
Why number 17?

310
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:47,130
Is there a special meaning?

311
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:49,420
No, not really.

312
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,480
Just the number of strokes in my name.

313
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:55,970
Wow, I didn't expect that.

314
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,630
Did you come up with it?

315
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,790
An ex came up with it for me.

316
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,630
Oh...

317
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,280
How many strokes are there in your name?

318
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,590
Eighteen.

319
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:32,800
Right after mine.

320
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,050
Yeah.

321
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,600
Actually,

322
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,640
I don't even remember who that ex is.

323
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,760
I'm saying,

324
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,110
she is insignificant to me.

325
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,780
Remembering everyone in my past

326
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,370
is just a waste of time.

327
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,330
Don't you think?

328
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,530
You're so cold.

329
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:01,420
I don't know how to do that.

330
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,390
If you break up, it's over.

331
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:06,130
It's upsetting to dwell on it.

332
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:07,980
I see.

333
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,260
Thanks to you, I'm all done already.

334
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,180
Shouldn't you take your photos?

335
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,730
The sun is setting soon.

336
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:28,230
I need to take a shower.

337
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,810
Take your time.

338
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,970
Okay.

339
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,450
Thank you.

340
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,130
Are you done?

341
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,610
Almost.

342
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,890
Yeah?

343
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,920
Why a gymnasium though?

344
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,710
Ah.

345
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:16,550
The theme is something that represents me.

346
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,990
Is this it?

347
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,350
What's with the basketball?

348
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:28,270
There's no one here.

349
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,680
So that's why.

350
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,390
So does the ball represent me?

351
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,170
Maybe.

352
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:49,670
You used to practice gymnastics every day.

353
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,800
Don't you feel restless?

354
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,340
A little.

355
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:57,680
That's why I jog every morning.

356
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,280
Let's play.

357
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,680
The loser buys dinner.

358
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,360
How can I beat a basketball player?

359
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:09,450
If you get one point
within the time limit,

360
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,230
you win.

361
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,060
Don't underestimate me.

362
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,100
Come on then.

363
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,790
Woah.

364
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:36,240
You've got some skills.

365
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,190
Don't let your guard down.
You might lose.

366
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,850
You think?

367
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:42,180
I just need to score one point.

368
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,510
Sure.

369
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,430
Good luck.

370
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,250
See?

371
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:24,100
I told you not to underestimate me.

372
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,320
It's your treat tonight.

373
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,640
I've never seen you smile like that.

374
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,150
You're truly a gold medalist.

375
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,760
So competitive.

376
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,920
Let's go.

377
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,670
Han Jiwon.

378
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,560
Still not interested in dating?

379
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,460
W-Wait...

380
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,040
Why did you suddenly...

381
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,860
It's not sudden.
