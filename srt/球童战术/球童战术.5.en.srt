1
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,400
Wait a second!

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,660
Why did you do that all of a sudden...?

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,200
It's not like I did this out of nowhere.

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,300
You probably know too...

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,100
I like you.

6
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,100
Jungwoo.

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,500
Can I...

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,900
Give me a little time?

9
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,300
Why? You don't like me in a similar way?

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,900
Oh, that's not what I meant.

11
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,900
The two of us...

12
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,700
We're both guys.

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,700
Even though I've already retired.

14
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,460
But you're still an active player.

15
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,400
We both have a certain
level of recognition.

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,460
If we get found out, it
could have a huge impact.

17
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,500
I don't want to be an
obstacle in your life, either.

18
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,300
I really don't want you to be labeled.

19
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,120
You just need some
time to think it over, right?

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Hmm...

21
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,900
How long do you need?

22
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,400
About... a month.

23
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,100
- A month?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,438
- Then three weeks.
- One week.

25
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,700
Two weeks.

26
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,300
Alright.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,281
If I want to score points,
I'll have to do what you said.

28
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,199
That's all we can do.

29
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,300
I'll do my best to win you over.

30
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,500
So you have to, too...

31
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,380
Think it through carefully.

32
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
Let's go.

33
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Two weeks.

34
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,500
Just these two weeks.

35
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,700
Yeah.

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
"Ball Boy Tactics"
(Episode 5)

37
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,800
I like you.

38
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,400
So this is what it feels like.

39
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,400
The feeling of a kiss.

40
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,200
Hey, "National Golden
Grandson," have you had lunch yet?

41
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,100
Don't call me that.

42
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,338
I haven't had lunch yet.

43
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,300
Then come meet us now.
There's the place with amazing beef bone soup.

44
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,686
Hurry over here.

45
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,840
Sure! Are all three of you going?

46
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,120
It'll probably just be Eun-Wu and me going.

47
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,476
Kwon Jungwoo has probably already
eaten. He probably won't come, right?

48
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,500
Ah... really? Got it.

49
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,200
- Hey! Jiwon.
- Coming!

50
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,008
Didn't you say you'd already eaten?

51
00:05:04,408 --> 00:05:05,648
Yeah, but that was a while ago.

52
00:05:06,116 --> 00:05:08,505
What are you talking about?
It's only been half an hour!

53
00:05:08,506 --> 00:05:10,666
Sigh, forget it. Maybe
he's still in his growth spurt.

54
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,180
That's wild! If you keep
growing taller like this...

55
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,000
That's just too enviable...

56
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,000
- Listen to me.
- Hurry up and eat.

57
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,000
Jiwon! The kimchi at this
place is seriously amazing.

58
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,540
Ah, that was such a satisfying meal!

59
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,436
- This place is seriously delicious.
- This is my secret spot.

60
00:05:36,668 --> 00:05:38,589
Congratulations on
becoming our good friend!

61
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:41,000
To remember this moment,
can I take a picture with you?

62
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,499
- We can take a photo anytime.
- Why not snap one right now?

63
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,500
Sure!

64
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,680
I want to take a photo too.

65
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,500
Kwon Jungwoo, aren't
you joining us for the photo?

66
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,712
Yeah, let's take one together.

67
00:05:51,736 --> 00:05:53,976
No worries, someone as popular as you
has probably taken tons of photos already.

68
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Hey!

69
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,300
Are we taking the photo together now?

70
00:05:56,301 --> 00:05:57,501
You should've said so earlier.

71
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,800
No, that's not what I meant.

72
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,959
Ah, let's talk about it later.
Get ready for the photo... 1, 2, 3.

73
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,960
I'm gay.

74
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,300
Or... maybe bisexual?

75
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Anyway.

76
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,300
I like guys.

77
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,800
OK

78
00:06:13,951 --> 00:06:14,814
I'm fine with it.

79
00:06:14,987 --> 00:06:17,600
But isn't it a bit risky to
talk about this in public?

80
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,753
What if it gets out?

81
00:06:20,553 --> 00:06:23,200
I don't mind holding a press
conference to let everyone know.

82
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,500
Who is the person you like?

83
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,049
If you find out, will you help me?

84
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,493
No, that's not it! So who is it, then?

85
00:06:29,494 --> 00:06:31,775
Even if I told you, you guys
probably wouldn't know them.

86
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,140
Right now, I'm the only one with a crush.

87
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,760
It depends on how I perform then
they'll decide whether or not to date me.

88
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,760
Looks like you really like him a lot.
Even after hearing all that, you're still not giving up.

89
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,700
-So you two are still in
the talking stage, huh?

90
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,560
Am I just immune to
falling in love or what?

91
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,200
I want to kiss someone too.

92
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,000
Uh...

93
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,044
Losing your composure in front of
someone who's been single since birth.

94
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,045
I'm really sorry.

95
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Ha... it's all good.

96
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,059
Even someone who's been single since
birth might have kissed someone before.

97
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,976
Hey! You went ahead and did it
without me? When did that happen?

98
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,500
You sly dog! Quietly racking up wins without
anyone noticing. I never saw it coming.

99
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,100
That was a long time ago...

100
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,776
No wonder you're an international superstar,
even your love life is straight out of Hollywood!

101
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,600
No, that's not it! It was just one person.
I've only kissed... once, that's all.

102
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,420
So that was your first kiss, huh?

103
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:30,806
Then why didn't you two start dating?

104
00:07:30,807 --> 00:07:33,099
Exactly... Even someone as
pure as Jiwon has already had

105
00:07:33,123 --> 00:07:35,667
their first kiss, but still
didn't end up in a relationship.

106
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:37,247
Was the other person really that bad?

107
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,100
No, that's not it.

108
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,600
The other person was really great.

109
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,800
So good it's making me melt all over!

110
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,000
Oh my god.

111
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,000
Melt...

112
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm honestly shocked to hear
those words coming from Han Jiwon.

113
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,300
Is there any soju left?

114
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,600
- What are you doing here?
- Looks like... we were destined to meet.

115
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,100
Then why didn't you contact me first?

116
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,300
Then I wouldn't get to see
that surprised look on your face.

117
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,480
I came because there's
something I want to tell you.

118
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,500
What do you want to say?

119
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,300
Do you want to... go see a movie tonight?

120
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,000
A movie?

121
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,800
Hmm... sure.

122
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,200
Sounds like you don't really want to go.

123
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,600
Ah, that's not what I meant.

124
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,300
But for something like this...
isn't it enough to just call and ask?

125
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,940
How could you just call someone
for something this important?

126
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,100
It's a deal.

127
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,780
Don't go back on your word.

128
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,700
Got it, I won't go back on my word.

129
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,700
Are you busy right now?

130
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Hmm...

131
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,900
Not busy! I don't have any more
classes after this. Plenty of free time.

132
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,500
Someone with so much free time.

133
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,360
Why do you still need
two weeks to think it over?

134
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,300
You know that's not how it is.

135
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
See you later.

136
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,700
- You're here.
- Jiwon!

137
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,159
Hurry up and get inside!
We're going to miss the start.

138
00:10:07,184 --> 00:10:10,600
Ugh! It's because we had to calm down Kwon
Jungwoo's temper. Time's getting even tighter.

139
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,888
Oh! I thought you meant the four of us
were going to watch the movie together.

140
00:10:15,912 --> 00:10:17,300
Was that my mistake?

141
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,600
Hey.

142
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:22,900
It's way more fun and exciting
when all four of us watch together!

143
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Let's go.

144
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,500
Hurry up and get inside,
the movie's about to start.

145
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,020
Because we're still just friends, does that
mean we can't go see a movie alone together?

146
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
Sorry...

147
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,000
They said they wanted to go see a movie.

148
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,900
I thought it was the movie
you said you wanted to see.

149
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,600
What guy would bring his friends
along when he's with someone he likes?

150
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,900
The movie just started.
Are they already getting scared?

151
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,920
Don't mind them, they're just scaredy-cats.

152
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,800
- What's wrong?
- Let's go outside.

153
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,000
Huh? What about them?

154
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Just ignore them.

155
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
That scared the life out of me!

156
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,260
Looks like it's not going to work.

157
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,200
It took a lot of effort to make time for this,
can't let them waste it.

158
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,300
It's honestly a little boring.

159
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,000
Then let's go. The movie's
just getting started anyway.

160
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,700
This is a pretty good spot, right?

161
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,900
Yeah.

162
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,800
No matter what we do
here, no one will find out.

163
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,600
What do you want to do?

164
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,140
You can see everything from the projection
room. What are you thinking about?

165
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,200
It's nothing.

166
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,800
Keep your voice down.

167
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,100
What's wrong?

168
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,000
Do you want to kiss too?

169
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,800
But wouldn't it be
weird for friends to kiss?

170
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,200
Haven't you made up your mind yet?

171
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,300
Sorry, I'm actually a bit
more old-fashioned than I look.

172
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,100
Senior.

173
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,759
Is Kwon Jungwoo not coming today?

174
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:25,959
What?

175
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Why do you ask?

176
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,600
He always comes to find
you whenever he drinks.

177
00:15:30,372 --> 00:15:32,892
It made him seem like he was in
the photography department too.

178
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,700
By the way, did you catch Kwon
Jungwoo's interview yesterday?

179
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,500
Interview?

180
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,425
Didn't you see it?

181
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:45,200
That interview from yesterday
totally blew up on social media.

182
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,399
Alright, let me ask you one last question.

183
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,560
Lately, your friendship with former national team
player Han Jiwon has been popular on social media.

184
00:15:57,004 --> 00:15:58,844
Do you two meet up
often in real life as well?

185
00:15:59,302 --> 00:16:02,499
Of course, we also have a
great relationship off the court.

186
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:02,800
Yes.

187
00:16:02,801 --> 00:16:05,688
The chemistry between you two
has become a hot topic among fans.

188
00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:08,300
What was the topic of your
most recent conversation?

189
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,440
I heard he's trying to quit drinking now.

190
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,919
Quitting drinking?

191
00:16:14,043 --> 00:16:18,925
So if you ever see Han Jiwon drinking,
please make sure to report it to me.

192
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:22,950
Just send me a photo or your
location, and I'll be there right away.

193
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,450
Ah... haha.

194
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,676
Looks like you two are really close.

195
00:16:27,976 --> 00:16:32,000
Then finally, please say
a few words to Han Jiwon.

196
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,320
Please say it to the camera.

197
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,800
Only two days left.

198
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,340
What? What do you mean
there are only two days left?

199
00:16:44,364 --> 00:16:46,924
-You're not about to make some
kind of love confession, are you?

200
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,400
Senior... That whole glass is just soju!

201
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,400
Oh, it's alright.

202
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,180
Feels like something's off.

203
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,400
-Don't tell me you two
are caught up in a rumor?

204
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,799
Yeah, is something up?

205
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,800
Did you have a drink?

206
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,000
Yeah, how did you know?

207
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,000
Can you smell the alcohol?

208
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,220
Looks like the interview
was completely useless.

209
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
Where are you right now?

210
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,600
- I'll come pick you up in a bit.
- Ah, no need, it's fine.

211
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,200
I'll just take a cab back with my
friends later, so you don't have to worry.

212
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,600
I'll be done with training in
an hour. I'll come find you then.

213
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,600
Hey, hey, did you know?

214
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,600
All my friends from my year really like you.
They think you're really handsome.

215
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,000
And you're really tall, too.

216
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,580
You can spot him from far away.
He really stands out.

217
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,300
They wish you could come
to the department every day.

218
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Really?

219
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,400
Didn't you brag to them about it?

220
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Show off?

221
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,439
That tall and handsome Kwon
Jungwoo really likes you a lot.

222
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,000
Always following right behind you, and
every time I take a shot, I think of you.

223
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Is that really true?

224
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,600
Don't say things like that so casually.

225
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,620
If you get distracted while
playing sports, you could get hurt.

226
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,700
Got it?

227
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,020
The places where you've been injured
before are more likely to get hurt again.

228
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,840
Training is almost over.
I'll come pick you up in a bit.

229
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,300
Stop drinking, wait for me, okay?

230
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,500
Okay.

231
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
(D-DAY)

232
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,000
Why are you so surprised?

233
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,300
Because you showed up out of nowhere.

234
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,800
Are you okay?

235
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,900
Hmm, but...

236
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,900
It's a bit chilly.

237
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,700
Put it on.

238
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,040
I just finished working out. My
whole body's heating up right now.

239
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,700
Let's go.

240
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,900
Want to go for a walk?

241
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,280
Didn't you say it was really cold outside?

242
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,940
Let's just stay in the
car with the heater on.

243
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:19,232
How about a drink? My treat.

244
00:20:19,233 --> 00:20:21,300
You're already plenty drunk right now.

245
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,900
Actually, Jungwoo.

246
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,400
I just want to be with you.

247
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,693
Oh, right.

248
00:20:31,694 --> 00:20:35,000
You still have to drive,
so you can't drink, right?

249
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,700
How about we just go to my place?

250
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,700
Does drinking make you this bold?

251
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,300
Don't tempt me.

252
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,700
I'm not trying to seduce you...

253
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,300
Let me be clear... I'm not going to take what
someone says when they're drunk seriously.

254
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,300
Even if...

255
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,200
That person is you.

256
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,400
What are you thinking about?

257
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,060
Did what I said make you uncomfortable?

258
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,000
No, it's just...

259
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,700
I didn't say it just because I was drunk.

260
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,600
I just simply want to be with you.

261
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,300
Sorry.

262
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,700
Looks like I was overthinking it, huh?

263
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,300
Have a drink.

264
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,500
Are you feeling better now?

265
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,100
Yeah, I'm feeling much better now.

266
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,700
Don't we still have
something to talk about today?

267
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,700
You didn't forget, did you?

268
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,500
How could I possibly forget?

269
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,360
I've also thought it through,

270
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,920
I've finished thinking it through, Jungwoo.

271
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,500
I know how much you love basketball.

272
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,140
So I don't want to cause you any trouble.

273
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,300
Because I know how hard you work.

274
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
But...

275
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,400
If this relationship gets found
out, it could really hurt you.

276
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,100
I don't know if I have the right to decide.

277
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,600
Jiwon.

278
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It's okay if I hear your reasons later.

279
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,260
Just give me your answer straight.

280
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,300
I like you, Jungwoo.

281
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,600
I want to be in a relationship with you.

282
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,700
Let's start dating.

283
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,900
I want that too.

284
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,600
A relationship where I'm led by you.

285
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,500
Jung-woo.

286
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,000
The couch is really uncomfortable.

287
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,400
Do you want to go to the room?

288
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,900
I like you.

289
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,400
Jiwon.

290
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,200
I like you too, Jung-woo.

291
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,760
(Next episode preview)
Are we already dating?

292
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,400
Actually, Han Jiwon and I...

293
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,000
Is the guy you like Jiwon?

294
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,341
No way, right?

295
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,000
No, Jeongwoo definitely doesn't like me.

296
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,700
Hey.

297
00:26:04,701 --> 00:26:06,501
When will your meat
finally be done grilling?

298
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:13,900
Sorry, Jungwoo.
I hope no one finds out we're dating.
