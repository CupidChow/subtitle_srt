1
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,100
Okay!

2
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,490
Go on.

3
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,320
Wow. It's Han Jiwon.

4
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,940
-The nation's grandson!
-Insane...

5
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,660
He really came to our school.

6
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,720
Should I talk to him? I was a huge fan.

7
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,090
Who wasn't a fan?

8
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,800
Everyone in Korea loved him.

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,630
I must brag to my mom!

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,030
Oh my god!

11
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:51,920
Quick! Pass!

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,440
Run! Run! Run!

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,980
Faster!

14
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,040
Hey, hey!

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,770
Time-out!

16
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,330
Wait, why?

17
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,340
Come here now.

18
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,540
Let's go.

19
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,480
What's wrong with you?

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,520
Stop making pointless passes!

21
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,170
Get the ball into the paint
to create open three-pointers.

22
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,260
Look at the score.

23
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,160
They're catching up.

24
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,900
It's not hard.

25
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,240
-Seungjin.
-Yes?

26
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,080
Set up an A offense.

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,480
Okay.

28
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,410
Make a fast break.

29
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,960
Look out for open shooters.

30
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,030
Focus, all of you.

31
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,340
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

32
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,230
Let's go.

33
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,250
One, two, three.

34
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,030
Let's go!

35
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,360
Come on, we can do it!

36
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,930
Focus, focus!

37
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,020
[Yeom Minhyeok as Han Jiwon]

38
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,979
[Choi Jaehyeok as Kwon Jeongwu]

39
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,180
[Choi Rakyeong as Byeon Seungjin]

40
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,620
[Kwak Geonhee as Yang Eunoh]

41
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,780
[Ballboy Tactics]

42
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,980
[Han Jiwon spotted on campus!]

43
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,780
[He was MIA for so long
I thought he died.]

44
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,260
[Ohbok Uni's now my dream university!]

45
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,420
[Why's a gymnast majoring in photography?]

46
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,360
[I bet he thinks it's an easy major.]

47
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,860
[Enough. If you knew his past,
you wouldn't say all this.]

48
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,060
[But I still don't get why he retired.
Wasn't he at his peak?]

49
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,850
When I announced my retirement,

50
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,130
the media ate me alive.

51
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:08,310
No one cared about the truth.

52
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,760
Compared to that sliver of truth,

53
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,120
countless speculative rumors

54
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,230
took root and spread like wildfire.

55
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,620
Jiwon.

56
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,450
When you recover,

57
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,660
you can resume as a pro gymnast.

58
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,750
Okay?

59
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,490
Hang in there a bit more.

60
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,760
No, Coach.

61
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,480
It's okay.

62
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,720
I'm set on retiring.

63
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,810
It might be a blessing in disguise.

64
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,410
I'm done...

65
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:19,010
I could have tried holding on to the end

66
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,250
if I weren't faced with
the stark reality of my limits.

67
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,920
If I can't be number one, it's...

68
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,880
pointless to

69
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,350
keep going.

70
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,659
While I was lost,
my greatest source of comfort

71
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:45,220
was none other than my camera.

72
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:51,020
Without the pressure to be perfect,

73
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,110
nor the fear of failure
that could crush me.

74
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,680
I just have to

75
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,990
capture everything as it is.

76
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,890
That's enough.

77
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,240
Hey.

78
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,720
Cheer up.

79
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,430
You're not the only one who screwed up.

80
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,320
You know Coach is extra strict on you.

81
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,580
Let's go for a drink.

82
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,600
Let it all out.

83
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,710
-Okay?
-Yeah!

84
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,320
It's our lucky day today!

85
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,630
No practice after the game.

86
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,810
But why isn't there practice?

87
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,600
Was Coach that pissed off by Jeongwu?

88
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,810
Oh, please. That's not it.

89
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,659
Coach has an appointment.

90
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:52,409
Hey. It's rare to get time off.

91
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:53,880
Let's go for a beer.

92
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,450
Yes, let's drink!

93
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,110
No better team bonding!

94
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,730
Or the internet cafe for some games?

95
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,100
You guys go ahead.

96
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,530
I'm not in the mood.

97
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,720
I bet he's going to practice alone again.

98
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,820
He really won't give himself a break.

99
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,150
So, what?

100
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,840
Internet cafe or drinking?

101
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,990
What's the point of us two guys drinking?

102
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,800
Let's go play games.

103
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,660
Hey, Yang Eunoh.

104
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,870
Don't you think you slack off too much?

105
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,330
Don't you think we might have
lost today's game because of you?

106
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,240
No, I don't!

107
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,470
Wait for me!

[Kwon Jeongwu]
[Basketball player of Ohbok Uni]

111
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:52,430
The basketball court is
always filled with your fans.

112
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,350
Do the popularity and
attention bother you?

113
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,400
That must mean

114
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,180
I'm that good.

115
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,760
You can feel free to like me.

116
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:41,030
Oh, I thought I was alone.

117
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,520
Sorry.

118
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,370
Han Jiwon... the gymnast?

119
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,070
Well, um... I didn't mean
to watch you secretly.

120
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,190
I'm sorry.

121
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,720
I hope I didn't interrupt your practice.

122
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,930
You look just like you do on TV.

123
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,440
Um...

124
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,990
Your face is too close...

125
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,690
I-I'll get going then.

126
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,380
Good luck with your practice.

127
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,790
Still as introverted as ever.

128
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,660
What's going on?

129
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,650
Why is Kwon Jeongwu here?

130
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:42,960
It's a 10-minute drive away from school.

131
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,310
You forgot this.

132
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,660
You seem to like to leave things behind.

133
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,000
Maybe label your stuff with your name.

134
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,610
Ah...

135
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:42,190
The whole nation knows you're quite shy,
so it's expected.

136
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,880
But not saying thank you...

137
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,000
Is that right?

138
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,750
Oh...

No... thank you.

What's up so early in the morning?

142
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,800
I'm at the gym in front of my place.
Get to the point.

Oh...

Hello.

I'm Han Jiwon.

Gosh, I can't hear you!

155
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:03,630
What did you say?

Who can hear you like that?

00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,420
You're so handsome!

-Woo!
-Hey, hey, hey.

00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,590
Silence, guys.

Athlete Han Jiwon.

161
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,050
Wait.

162
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,650
Is it inappropriate to
call you an athlete now?

163
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,040
We are now classmates.

164
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,300
We all know how he is.

165
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,960
Don't rush him.

166
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,700
Let's cheer him on quietly.

167
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,420
You can choose what you want to do.

168
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,000
You can perform something

169
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,080
or

170
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,070
finish this bowl of mixed alcohol
made by your classmates!

171
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,950
Somersault.

172
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:41,810
Somersault! Somersault! Somersault!

173
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:12,660
When will the designated driver come?

174
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,530
Me. It's me.

175
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,910
What?

176
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:51,900
The black car behind that car.

177
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,470
So?

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,900
asking me to drive you there?

182
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,650
I reek of alcohol, don't I?

183
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,530
Until we get there,

184
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:26,860
I'll keep my mouth shut.

185
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,350
Let's set off, please.

186
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,460
What the hell?

187
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,820
We're here, sir.

188
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,760
Hey.

189
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,110
Hey.

190
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,359
Did you take a shower?

191
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,010
Your body wash smells good.

192
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,730
I smell good?

193
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:20,930
Hello?

194
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:23,319
Kwon Jeongwu! Where are you?

195
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,980
We're waiting at the parking lot.

196
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,550
Why aren't you here?

197
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,760
Kwon Jeongwu?

198
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,750
Oh.

199
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,500
I suddenly became a designated driver.

200
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,680
What do you mean?

201
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,940
-Everyone's waiting. Hurry up!
-Why is Kwon Jeongwu here?

202
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,180
Did you sleep well,

203
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,190
sir?

204
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,480
No.

205
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,930
Since I drove you here,
should I call you "Master" instead?

206
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,250
Do you...

207
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,550
work as a designated driver too?

208
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,380
What do you think?

209
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,620
Han Jiwon.

210
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,920
Are you sorry?

211
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,630
How sorry are you?

212
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,860
I'm really,

213
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,940
really, really sorry...

214
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,470
Since you're so sorry,

215
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:32,350
I'll take your car today.

216
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,300
What?

217
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:38,090
My car's trembling in the cold wind
on campus because of you.

218
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,630
So...

219
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,380
Get out.

220
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,140
Wait!

221
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,770
Um...

222
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,080
You could have turned me down.

223
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,690
Why did you drive me all the way here?

224
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,610
Our team won today.

225
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:09,730
Come get your car key
at the basketball court tomorrow.

226
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:10,860
I'll get going.

227
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,690
-I'm done.
-I don't think this is it.

228
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,320
Excuse me, are you looking for someone?

229
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,240
Ah...

230
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,780
The basketball player, Kwon Jeongwu.

231
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,610
Huh? Who?

232
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,390
I'm here to see the basketball player,
Kwon Jeongwu.

233
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:06,330
Could you maybe help me call him?

234
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,370
He just left.

235
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,550
Wait here for a moment

236
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,560
and he should...

237
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,920
He should...

238
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,980
Oh my god!

239
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,680
Han Jiwon!

240
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,800
I... I'm a huge fan of yours!

241
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,880
You... You know,

242
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,620
I've downloaded

243
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,860
all your competition footage in HD!

244
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,870
I'm a true fan!

245
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,530
Can I take a photo with you?

246
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,290
Hey.

247
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,600
You're making him uncomfortable.

248
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,120
Hey.

249
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,960
You're friends with Han Jiwon?

250
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,920
Yeah.

251
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,180
He is my master.

252
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,440
Master?

253
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,210
Your landlord's the great Han Jiwon?

254
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,730
Get lost if you're done fanboying.

255
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,240
You're so heartless.

256
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,840
Don't ask me to leave
when Han Jiwon is here.

257
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,080
Can't I stay a little longer?

258
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,340
What are you doing?

259
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,750
Wait.

260
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,640
Fine, one more minute.

261
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,040
Hold on. I know.

262
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,070
Mr. Han!

263
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,180
I'll look for you again!

264
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,910
Please give me an autograph then!

265
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,180
On here!

266
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,600
Thank you for yesterday.

267
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,360
And just now too.

268
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,730
Well...

269
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:43,590
When can I get my car key back?

270
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,500
Which is the real you?

271
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,900
What do you mean?

272
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:58,060
The helpless one who can't say no?

273
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,110
Or...

274
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:05,630
the one who shoves his car key to anyone
and gets them to drive him home?

275
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,150
Um...

276
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,120
I think I'm more like the helpless one...

277
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,450
I'm being sarcastic.

278
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,420
But it's strange.

279
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,830
I always thought that if I met you,

280
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,380
I'd tell you to live more shamelessly.

281
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,770
I'm really sorry about yesterday.

282
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:46,640
It must've been frustrating
to see me so helpless.

283
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,360
That's because I'm
not as confident as you.

284
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,470
That's what I mean.

285
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:55,970
Huh?

286
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,870
At times like this, instead of sorry,

287
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:02,170
say, "Give me my car key and get lost."

288
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,950
Thank you for thinking about me.

289
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,760
Here you go.

290
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:14,290
-What happened yesterday...
-Keep it if it's another sorry.

291
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:17,950
You might as well add it to your resume:

292
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,660
"Apologizing too much."

293
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,210
Don't you think?

294
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:25,260
Isn't it weird to put that on a resume?

295
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,720
Right.

296
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,750
You have many other talents anyway.

297
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,740
Was it folding towels neatly?

298
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,980
I'm good at these stuff.

299
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,690
Good at doing the dishes,

300
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,890
folding towels neatly,

301
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:51,560
and blinking my eyes really fast.

302
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,290
Keep up the good work.

303
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,750
Ah.

304
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:06,070
I ate all the gum in your car.

305
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,290
It wasn't a lot anyway.

306
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:14,040
I'll take that as my pay
for driving you home.

307
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,600
So embarrassing.

308
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,090
-Class is over!
-Want to go to the restroom?

309
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,170
No.

310
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,660
Um, Jiwon.

311
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,850
This is for you.

312
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,910
Uh, no, thanks.

313
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,020
It's okay.

314
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,690
You can have it yourself.

315
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:42,030
I want to give it to you.

316
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,260
It's really cheap too.

317
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,320
I bought it at the store.

318
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,520
Can't you accept it?

319
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,800
Thank you.

320
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:58,140
And since we're classmates,
just speak casually.

321
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,840
Aren't you taking Architecture 101?

322
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,670
Me too.

323
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,600
We'll see each other often.

324
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,350
What?

325
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,930
Oh... Yes.

326
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:12,780
No! Yeah.

327
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,020
Enjoy the drink. See you next time.

328
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,640
Did I not thank her enough?

329
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,820
Oh no.

330
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,220
We meet again.

331
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,970
Are you stalking me?

332
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,290
What?

333
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,700
You're really interesting.

334
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,730
Not saying sorry this time?

335
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,250
What?

336
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:57,720
If you're going to keep
hanging around me...

337
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,360
why don't you sign up as a ballboy?

338
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:17,970
Ballboy?

339
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,930
Wouldn't that be

340
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,780
easier for both of us?

341
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,770
[In the next episode]

342
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:40,750
Yang Eunoh thinks he is
your friend's bestie.

343
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,090
Say something!

344
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:45,580
Friends? We're more like
master and servant.

345
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,000
Not to mention boys,

346
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,920
I'm not even interested in girls.

347
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,700
So why?

348
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,130
What's wrong with me?

349
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,040
Girls must always get the wrong idea.

350
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,080
No, what I mean is...

351
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,700
I'm not like that to girls.

352
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,220
What?

353
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,160
I'm only like this with you.
