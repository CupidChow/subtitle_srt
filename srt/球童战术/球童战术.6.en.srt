1
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,800
Are you awake?

2
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,500
Did we…?

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,800
I would never make a move
on someone who's drunk.

4
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,200
Sorry.

5
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,700
So, does that mean we...

6
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,500
Does this mean we're dating?

7
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,900
Friends wouldn't do
something like this, right?

8
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,700
Jung-woo.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I like you.

10
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,100
"Ball Boy Tactics"
(Episode 6)

11
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,880
I can't believe I'm
actually in a relationship.

12
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,100
And it's with Kwon Jungwoo.

13
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,800
(Byun Seung-jin requests a video call)

14
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,270
- Why do we need a video call?
- Hey! My best partner.

15
00:02:46,271 --> 00:02:47,571
Where are you?

16
00:02:47,773 --> 00:02:51,222
I'm just about to head over to you
guys, because I need to talk to Jungwoo.

17
00:02:51,322 --> 00:02:53,381
What a coincidence! Hurry
up and come over, then.

18
00:02:53,481 --> 00:02:55,401
- My sister's treating everyone to coffee.
- Why?

19
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,200
Seung-jin,

20
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,941
Is today your birthday?

21
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:03,074
No, no, no! My sister's treating everyone
because she just got hired as a broadcaster.

22
00:03:03,075 --> 00:03:05,900
Success, success, total success!

23
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,000
- Haha.
- Success?

24
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,000
Jiwon probably wants an iced Americano,
right? That's why I got it ready in advance.

25
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,500
Thanks, I'll enjoy it.

26
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:30,200
See, Kwon Jungwoo! No matter how hard you
try, you'll never beat me, the OG superfan.

27
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,200
What's wrong, Seung-jin?

28
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,430
- Are you jealous?
- What are you talking about?

29
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,646
Actually, Jiwon and I...

30
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,900
Your parents must be really happy.

31
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,909
Your sister is great at studying,
and you're really strong in sports.

32
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:58,669
Your parents probably
don't have anything to worry about.

33
00:03:58,693 --> 00:04:01,000
Such a great personality, must run in the family.

34
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,041
Yeah! Good looks and
brains both run in our family.

35
00:04:05,042 --> 00:04:09,900
Even though my sister has a bit
of a temper, she really is a beauty.

36
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That's how it is, right?

37
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,500
Ah... I see.

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,290
But where did Eun-oh run off to?

39
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,697
That guy downed three cups of iced Americano
and ended up running to the bathroom.

40
00:04:19,797 --> 00:04:23,900
This cheapskate if you're looking
for him, just head over to the restroom.

41
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,100
Oh right, Jiwon. Didn't you say you had
something to do at the department office?

42
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,000
- The department office? What for?
- He needs to pick something up.

43
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,700
Right?

44
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,100
If you're bored, do you
want to come with us?

45
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,900
What are you talking about, Jiwon!

46
00:04:45,904 --> 00:04:47,490
It's fine, I have to wait
for that guy.

47
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,908
He's definitely going to want to eat
something again when he gets here.

48
00:04:49,932 --> 00:04:52,416
He's an athlete, but he
never holds back on caffeine.

49
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,300
Well, that's fine. Let's get going.

50
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,300
Drank three cups...

51
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,860
This guy's got something going on.

52
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,760
You said you'd be at the
department office, so I came.

53
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,800
But why sneak in like this?

54
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,900
Hmm...

55
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Why is that?

56
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,400
I just want to be with you.

57
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,700
It's so quiet here.

58
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,320
And it's just the two of us here.

59
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,220
I just wanted to give you a quick kiss.
What are you doing?

60
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,500
Do you want to do something else?

61
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,200
- What?
- Do you want to do something else?

62
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,600
No way.

63
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,100
This is the department office,
people are coming and going, it's risky.

64
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,000
Are you taking me for a fool?

65
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,600
You're really adorable.

66
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,300
How can you be this cute?

67
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,500
Why do I like it so much?

68
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,560
I can barely hold it in anymore. I really
want to show off that we're together.

69
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
Me too.

70
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
But...

71
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,380
We should be a bit more careful.

72
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,040
How about embroidering
your name on my jersey?

73
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,800
If we use initials, it
won't be too obvious.

74
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,625
How about it?

75
00:07:22,725 --> 00:07:24,600
Aren't you heading off to training camp?

76
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,732
Can I skip it?

77
00:07:32,932 --> 00:07:36,100
- Is it okay if you don't go?
- Of course it's okay...

78
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,500
Too bad that's not the case.

79
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,600
I have to go.

80
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:47,000
- So you must be really busy today.
- Yeah... I am.

81
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,500
How about... we have
lunch together tomorrow?

82
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Sure!

83
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,300
But...

84
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,200
Class is about to start.

85
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,200
Oh! That's right...

86
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,900
I really have to go now.

87
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,400
I really wish this moment

88
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,400
could last forever.

89
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,299
You must be really hungry. Look!

90
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,700
Hurry up and eat.

91
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Jung-woo.

92
00:08:55,837 --> 00:08:58,533
There are a lot of
people watching us...

93
00:08:58,837 --> 00:09:00,900
It's not like we're about to
kiss, so what's the big deal?

94
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,820
It's pretty common for good friends
to feed each other rice rolls, right?

95
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,800
And there's something I forgot to tell you.

96
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,200
Actually, I...

97
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,600
Because I studied too hard for the exam.

98
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,920
Even moving a finger
feels exhausting right now.

99
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,600
So hurry up and feed me!

100
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,500
Smiling so freely and easily like this.

101
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,800
How long can this last?

102
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,600
Such a blissful moment.

103
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,640
Will it all disappear in an instant?

104
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
I'm so scared...

105
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,279
- Let's pull an all-nighter tonight.
- Let's go!

106
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:07,059
Then let's hit the internet café and play.

107
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,438
Even if we're heading to
the internet café, let's go all out!

108
00:10:09,462 --> 00:10:10,200
Let's go!

109
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,900
I wish you guys would
just disappear already.

110
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:18,071
What are you thinking about?

111
00:10:18,186 --> 00:10:19,334
What else is there to think
about?

112
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:23,066
Of course, he's thinking about the feeling
of an ice-cold beer sliding down his throat.

113
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,500
As a die-hard fan, I saw this coming a mile away.
Here, have a drink!

114
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,500
No, Seung-jin, I've already quit
drinking. Now I only drink cola.

115
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,910
Why did you suddenly quit drinking?

116
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,694
Did something happen?

117
00:10:35,695 --> 00:10:36,695
Did something happen?

118
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Hmm... I just thought I'd
take this chance to quit.

119
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,500
What a shame.

120
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,788
You look really
sexy when you drink.

121
00:10:47,812 --> 00:10:50,040
So, how about just not
quitting drinking after all?

122
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,566
Han Jiwon and the word
"sexy" just don't go together at all.

123
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,300
Hold on, why can't we
say Jiwon is sexy too?

124
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,800
But why would you say something like that?

125
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,000
Could it be that the
guy you like is... Jiwon?

126
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,799
Hey! No way.

127
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,700
You figured it out that quickly...

128
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:12,000
No! He definitely doesn't like me.

129
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,000
Right? The one you like
isn't someone else, is it?

130
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,293
Do you know who it is?

131
00:11:20,294 --> 00:11:22,254
He absolutely refuses
to tell us, no matter what.

132
00:11:23,127 --> 00:11:24,567
Is she pretty? No, wait...

133
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:27,345
Shouldn't you be asking
if he's good-looking?

134
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,200
No way!

135
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,940
Jungwoo is dating a girl.

136
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,100
Han Jiwon spilled all my secrets.

137
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,362
Oh my gosh! Kwon Jungwoo actually has a girlfriend.
Are you sure it's really a girl?

138
00:11:43,581 --> 00:11:45,100
Yeah! It's a girl.

139
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,400
Hey! When did you two start dating?

140
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,999
Why didn't you tell us?

141
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,301
Aren't we talking about it right now?

142
00:11:51,325 --> 00:11:53,297
No, that's not it. I was talking
about that guy from before.

143
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:55,676
The one who said they'd only consider
dating you after seeing how you perform.

144
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,700
That's right! Unrequited love just doesn't suit
you. Weren't you really into him back then?

145
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,400
I thought so too.

146
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,820
But it looks like that's not the case.

147
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,500
Because someone confessed to me in such a
cool way, I decided to be with that person.

148
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,900
Damn!

149
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,940
It's honestly unbelievable that
Kwon Jungwoo got dumped.

150
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,015
But to be honest, I already
figured out you had a girlfriend.

151
00:12:23,215 --> 00:12:26,185
Lately, you've been grinning
like you're totally smitten.

152
00:12:26,186 --> 00:12:29,310
- I was about thirty percent sure.
- Hey! Thirty percent? That's way too low!

153
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:30,386
At least I guessed right.

154
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,732
But hey, is your current girlfriend pretty?
Got any photos? Can I see them?

155
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:37,293
She must be really pretty, right? After all,
Kwon Jungwoo is pretty good-looking himself.

156
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,940
True, but maybe that's for the best.

157
00:12:40,283 --> 00:12:43,600
You're definitely better
off with girls than with guys.

158
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,301
Is she older than you this time, too?

159
00:12:46,325 --> 00:12:50,276
If we're just going to keep talking about boring
stuff, we might as well head to the internet café.

160
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,700
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

161
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,700
Jiwon.

162
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,710
So this time he's dating
someone older again, right?

163
00:13:01,711 --> 00:13:03,800
- Is she an office worker?
- No, she's the same age as me.

164
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,442
Wow! Same age! Is she from
our school? Which department?

165
00:13:06,443 --> 00:13:10,300
So what if you know? Forget about her, it's
not like you're going to like her anyway.

166
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,400
I'm not interested in
your girlfriend at all!

167
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,100
Wow! Kwon Jungwoo is actually
dating someone his own age!

168
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,560
So, what do you think? Isn't dating
someone your own age even cuter?

169
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,500
Cuter, yeah! But not
because we're the same age.

170
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,500
- It's because she's just naturally cute.
- Stop showing off already!

171
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,300
Come on! Cheers!

172
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Cheers!

173
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,300
Ah! But as long as she's
cute, that's all that matters.

174
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,260
His ex-girlfriend was super possessive. She
used to call him out every single night.

175
00:13:48,614 --> 00:13:51,494
If she's just cute, she probably
wouldn't do something like that, right?

176
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,506
Oh, Jiwon doesn't know about this!

177
00:13:54,806 --> 00:13:58,200
That girl Na-jung even treated
us to a few meals before.

178
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,200
Ah, but that older girl is really stunning.

179
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,748
Their skills are top-notch, and you
two make a great team, don't you think?

180
00:14:04,848 --> 00:14:07,400
That's enough, Byun Seung-jin.
It's not fun anymore.

181
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,040
Why even bring up someone
he's already broken up with?

182
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,600
Yeah... what's the point of bringing
up someone you broke up with...

183
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,100
So that's how it is...

184
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,540
You've had enough, haven't you?

185
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,599
It probably doesn't feel fun anymore.

186
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
Right?

187
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,500
- Alright! Let's raise a glass! Cheers!
- Cheers!

188
00:14:43,798 --> 00:14:46,124
Hey! How did you
do on this exam?

189
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:48,039
Whoa! Why are you
asking me that out of the blue?

190
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,239
Weren't we allowed to use our
notes for this test? Did you still fail?

191
00:14:51,263 --> 00:14:52,600
Stop talking about it...

192
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,200
Hey!

193
00:14:55,201 --> 00:14:57,121
When are you finally
going to do well on a test?

194
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,600
Why are you carrying your book with you?

195
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,300
Do you want some water?

196
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,200
How come you're the only one left?

197
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,900
Where is everyone else?

198
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,700
At the internet café.

199
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,500
Internet café.

200
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,300
This late?

201
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,800
Why, you don't like it?

202
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,800
Drink up.

203
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,400
Thank you.

204
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,860
I'll go up and clean up
a bit. I'll be back soon.

205
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Take a break for now.

206
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,400
Does seeing the trophy
make you think of the past?

207
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,400
Yeah, a little bit.

208
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,300
I'm not really someone who

209
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,500
reminisces the past that much.

210
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,800
I...

211
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,220
I'm not a very sentimental person.

212
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,900
You really can't tell at all.

213
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,000
Sorry about earlier.

214
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,840
I'll have to keep pretending I'm dating
someone else from now on too, right?

215
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,500
Han Jiwon.

216
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,500
I forgot how good you are at lying.

217
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,600
Sorry, it's all because of me.

218
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,700
I made you tell unnecessary lies.

219
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,020
Don't make it sound like being
with me is something you regret.

220
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,700
I just realized now.

221
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,600
I tend to get hurt easily.

222
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,200
Actually... I just thought you were
going to say you wanted to break up.

223
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
Me?

224
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,900
Why?

225
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,900
It seems like I've made you
upset with all the things I've said.

226
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,820
Just because of that reason?

227
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,700
To say that's the reason
feels like a bit of a stretch.

228
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
But it still made you
really upset, didn't it?

229
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,300
But still...

230
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,500
Why would you say something like that?

231
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,200
Isn't that a bit extreme?

232
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,100
- Really?
- Yeah! Absolutely.

233
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:53,100
Do you not want... them to
know about our relationship?

234
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,600
Should I tell Eun-Oh and Seung-jin?

235
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,540
Even though they might seem that way, they're
actually really good at keeping secrets.

236
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,840
If you don't want me
to, I won't say anything.

237
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,200
If you're uncomfortable with it,

238
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,300
I'll just say it when you're not around.

239
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,600
Sorry, Jungwoo.

240
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,500
The fact that we're dating.

241
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,100
I hope no one finds out.

242
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,400
The way we are now is just fine.

243
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,320
I hope that, in other people's
eyes, we just look like friends.

244
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,800
From now on, too...

245
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,400
Why did you have to
say it in such a scary way?

246
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,840
You could have said it a bit more gently. It's okay.

247
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Alright.

248
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,700
I totally get it.

249
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,300
Sorry.

250
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,300
I didn't expect you to be scared.

251
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
Jiwon.

252
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,899
If you go overseas for
training, what about us?

253
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,980
We probably won't see
each other for a while, right?

254
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,261
I said I wanted a relationship where you take the lead and
guide me. Is that why you're acting this way on purpose?

255
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,900
No way that would happen.

256
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
Sorry.

257
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,647
Since this is my first time
being in a relationship,

258
00:22:32,671 --> 00:22:35,040
there are still a lot of things
I don't really understand.

259
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,500
Look at me, Jung-woo.

260
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,840
I'm the one who owes you an apology.

261
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,700
I messed up.

262
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,100
Hey, why are you crying?

263
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,100
I don't know...

264
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
Jiwon.

265
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,100
I love you.

266
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,400
I love you too.

267
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,224
(Next episode preview) Traveled overseas
specifically to train for this season.

268
00:24:30,248 --> 00:24:32,688
And on the very first day, you
went and got yourself injured.

269
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,600
Will these malicious comments
end up hurting him again?

270
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,534
The article I showed you turned out to be
Jiwon's public statement clarifying everything.

271
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:45,567
I never expected to see this post
on Kim Hyo-seok's social media.

272
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:46,967
Might as well...

273
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,700
Maybe this is actually for the best.

274
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,799
Former national team
player Han Jiwon

275
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,699
and pro basketball star Kwon Jungwoo.
Are they secretly dating?

276
00:24:53,723 --> 00:24:55,476
I always feel like you might
suddenly disappear. Even if I'm

277
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,224
not by your side, it seems
like you'd still be just fine…

278
00:24:57,248 --> 00:24:59,000
I'm not going anywhere.

279
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,580
Let's… give each other some time to think.
