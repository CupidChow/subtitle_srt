You traitors.

189
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,690
Only I was kept from it.

190
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,240
You're the worst.

191
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,770
Tsk.

192
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,240
If you were me,

193
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,430
would you tell me?

194
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,440
True...

195
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,910
You're not hiding anything from me,
are you?

196
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,950
If you betray me, I'll kill you.

197
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,230
I wonder...

198
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,740
What? Are you dating someone?

199
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,670
Who is it?

200
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:14,790
Don't stab me in the back like them.
Tell me who it is!

201
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,630
Let go of me!

202
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,590
So what if I tell you I like someone?

203
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,180
What?

204
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,110
If I tell you I like someone,

205
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,470
what would you do?

206
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,750
I would be bored.

207
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,850
I would be in a bad mood.

208
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,710
Is it because the person I always
hang out with is no longer around?

209
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,710
Are you a kid?

210
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,870
You'll be sad because the person you
always hang out with is gone?

211
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:45,450
You must have trained me.

212
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,920
Whatever. I can't think rationally today.

213
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,870
So...

214
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,280
Are you really in a relationship?

215
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,200
If I were,

216
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,380
I wouldn't have time to hang out with you.

217
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,470
Right?

218
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:04,930
But I have someone I like.

219
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:05,990
Who is it?

220
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,050
It's a secret.

221
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:09,910
Secret?

222
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,940
Who is it?

223
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,900
Just someone.

224
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,800
A cutie who talks a lot.

225
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,560
Who? How old are they?

226
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,040
Same age as me.

227
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,810
Are they pretty?

228
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:19,690
They're cute.

229
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,570
Cute?

230
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,010
They're cute?

231
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,320
-Why?
-Cute?

232
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,210
Really?

233
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,450
How so?

234
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:39,630
The attention of others
is always burdensome.

235
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,540
However,

236
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,550
the way you look at me

237
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,410
is not a burden at times.

238
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,040
Are you done?

239
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,460
It could be warm.

240
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,120
That's what I understand now.

241
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,700
By the way,

242
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,150
I had a dream.

243
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,410
What dream?

244
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,480
A dream where I was kissing you.

245
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,600
What are you talking about?

246
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,450
Let's go over there.

247
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,780
No one's there.

248
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,730
Are you really going to do it here?

249
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,230
What are you going to do?

250
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,720
Jiwon.

251
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,020
I'm afraid we're going to come
to the library just to kiss now.

252

Hey!

253
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,330
Congratulations Jiwon on the award!

-Cheers!
-Cheers!

256
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,080
Jiwon.

257
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,470
Congratulations.

258
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,170
You're really something.

259

No matter what you do,
you're always first place.

260

Thanks to you,

261
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,610
I get to drink with the Famous Four
of the PE major. I'm so happy.

262
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,570
Hey, there are only three of us.
Why is it Famous Four?

263
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:04,870
Jiwon is in the basketball team too.

264
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:07,840
He doesn't hang out with us
but with the basketball team all day.

265
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,270
Well, friends.

266
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,340
It's fate that brought us together.

267
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,610
Let's take a picture together.

268
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:15,130
Hey, my arms are longer.

269
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,090
I'll take a picture of Jiwon with my phone.

270
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:17,870
Okay.

271
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,050
Take it with yours.

272
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,380
Here we go.

273
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,600
One, two, three.

274
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,050
Okay.

275

Drink moderately.

Are we...

278
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,830
staying here for too long?

279
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,900
So what?

280
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,270
They must think we've gone home.

281
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,870
Should we really go home?

282

Anywhere.

284
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:20,800
By the way, is it really
okay for us to just leave?

285
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,850
We're all here to celebrate my award.

286
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,400

In this situation,
that's what you're thinking about?

292
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,700
Yeah. What about it?

295
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:46,660
Yes.

296
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:51,650
When you fall in love, you become childish.

297
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,820
Who said that?

298
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,830
I did.

299
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,750
Let's go home.

Okay.

Yeah.

I won't run away.

If you want to drink like this,

311
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,760
you'd better quit drinking.

It tastes better when I drink
with you every day like this.

316
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,860
Stop drinking, idiot.

317
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,520
Why do you keep nagging me?

318
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,000
It's not nagging.
It's for your own good.

the same number as you make your pro debut.
