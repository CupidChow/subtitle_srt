1
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,210
You're smiling non-stop.

2
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,910
You like it don't you?

3
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,410
You like it so much?

4
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,550
He really likes taking a bath,
Isn't that right, Scale?

5
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,390
Ai'Tin.

6
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,460
Don't let me know that you take
him to your motorcycle win.

7
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,030
If I find out about it...

8
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,830
you will be sorry,

9
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,330
Who said that I take him on a win,

10
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,830
I just take him for outdoor activities,

11
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,130
He'll bored to death staying in the room,

12
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,840
What are you looking at, P'?

13
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,940
You should get ready for work.

14
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,850
Look at our little hand, see?

15
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,340
Who splashed the water?!

16
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,840
Don't you see that's someone down here?!

17
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,180
Where did you put your eyes?

18
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,640
If I find you...

19
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,110
you'll be sorry.

20
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,350
Shit! A lizard!

21
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,990
Where did it go?

22
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,100
There's even a lizard in it.

23
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,200
It's definitely going to be
bad luck for a whole day today.

24
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,050
I'm really bored here.

25
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,850
Me too.

26
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,090
They not even going to
ide with another rider?

27
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,330
Ready, friend?

28
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,240
I'm ready. I've been
waiting for a long time for this.

29
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,020
Hair too.

30
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,290
Just a sec, friend.

31
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,070
How was it?

32
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,130
Am I looking cool yet?

33
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,400
No need to say it. You're cool.

34
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,570
How do I look?

35
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,640
A very white face.

36
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,080
I think, we can't do this,

37
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,940
Come, come, come.

38
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,460
Ladies...

39
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,330
My back seat is still empty.

40
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,500
My back seat is also empty.

41
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,640
Please hop on and I'll give you a ride.

42
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:29,140
I'll drive you to your destination safely.

43
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,710
Yes.

44
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,620
I'm not going.

45
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,450
I think we should stop, it's not working.

46
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,920
Yeah, I think so too. Let's get outta here.

47
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,840
You guys.

48
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,600
I'm gonna ask you directly.

49
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,540
In what part is Gawin more handsome than me?

50
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,950
Do you want the truth, P'?

51
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,780
Are you sure that you can accept the truth?

52
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,620
You definitely won't
be sad if we tell you the truth?

53
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,120
Yes, hurry up and tell me.

54
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,290
Everything!

55
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,860
In terms of height...

56
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:19,830
looks...

57
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,190
and temperament.

58
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,260
There's nothing about
you that can compare to him!

59
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,250
Gawin!

60
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,660
It's my turn.

61
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,020
Where do you want to go?

62
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,570
P'Gawin, send me to
room 21 on the second floor.

63
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,700
The room with your picture on the door.

64
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:05,140
Knocked the door three
times and it'll open for sure.

65
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,870
l'll drive you to the lobby first.

66
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,480
If up to the room,
I have to rethink about it.

67
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,520
How can I stand this? Been waiting for long.

68
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,890
Let's go.

69
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,210
E'Ket, did you watch that TV show last night?

70
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,780
I told you, I never miss an episode.

71
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,010
It is so good.

72
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,150
True, I've been waiting for
the female lead to hit her sister.

73
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,880
If it were me, l'll hit her a
few more times to shut her up.

74
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,320
Hey, don't you think
you're over invested in it?

75
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,090
P'Vee, you have to watch it.
Trust me, it's great.

76
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,990
Also, I'm telling you...

77
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,660
the male lead six packs are very good.

78
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,430
True

79
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,070
I think it's like Waterwalk.

80
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,200
What is a Waterwalk.

81
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,340
It means flooding on the lower side.

82
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:15,140
E'Ket, you slut.

83
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,310
Let me tell you, that male lead is mine. If you
want, you can take the female lead's friend.

84
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,480
Can't I just have for a moment?

85
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:25,850
Sawasdee kha, P'Tos.

86
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,190
P'Tos, Sawasdee kha.

87
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,120
I really miss N'Scale, P'Tos.

88
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,860
If you need someone to
take care of Scale, let me know.

89
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,700
I'm willing to.

90
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,000
But if you want a mother, come to me.

91
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,070
l'll tell you, I'm ready.

92
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,640
Concentrate on your work.

93
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,870
I saw you were gossiping earlier.

94
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,660
P'Dao.

95
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,130
P'Dao...

96
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,660
What? What is it?

97
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:07,790
What's wrong?

98
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,300
I have a scary story to tell.

99
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,030
But, it's really scary,

100
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,040
Do you really wanna hear it?

101
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,370
It's like this. this morning....

102
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,270
I wanted to clean my
window because I just moved in.

103
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,440
So, I filled a basin with water and walked by.

104
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,740
And do you know what I saw?

105
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,680
Saw...

106
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,850
I saw a very large lizard on the window.

107
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,790
Hey, don't sign yet.
It hasn't been to the climax yet.

108
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,390
Continue.

109
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:37,390
I was shocked and just
splashed the water to that lizard.

110
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,690
But, the water got
splashed to a guy who's passing by.

111
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,100
And he threatened to kill me.

112
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,970
I'm going to die, for sure. I'm so scare.

113
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,400
Nonsense.

114
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,830
You're imaging things.

115
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,740
This is serious.

116
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,200
P'Dao...

117
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,870
He was just angry when he
got water splashed on his head.

118
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,310
He won't kill you.

119
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,450
But he really threatened to kill me.

120
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,550
Sawasdee krub, ladies.

121
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,690
The husband is here.
I miss you so much.

122
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,760
Go back to work, you deluded.

123
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,520
You say that to me because you
want to rob Gawin from mė, aren't you?

124
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,130
Yes, because he's a handsome guy.

125
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,900
Don't fight, don't fight.
Everyone has their shares.

126
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,400
Anyway, what were talking about?

127
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,000
Well, P'Dao...

128
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,740
told us a story.

129
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,240
But it's not scary at all.

130
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,710
Speaking of which...

131
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,380
I also have a story to tell.

132
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,750
Just talk about it makes me mad!

133
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,610
What'is it about?

134
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,720
Well, this morning...

135
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,180
I was heading downstairs, right?

136
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,350
Suddenly, someone, I don't know who,
splashed some water on my head.

137
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,160
And that's not all.

138
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:50,830
There's even a large lizard
in it and it got to my arm.

139
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,400
Just talking about it makes me mad!

140
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,340
If I catch that motherfucker...

141
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,370
I'm hold that person's head
under a flowing water tap.

142
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,310
After that...

143
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,110
I'm gonna locked that
person in a room full of lizards.

144
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,440
Let that person scream for their life.

145
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,980
It's all clear now.

146
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,520
Clear like..

147
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,580
no need to figure out.

148
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,220
a.What's clear?

149
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,390
Clear the...

150
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:14,650
Clear the goods.

151
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,360
Just remember that the
goods still hasn't clear yet.

152
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,090
Clear the goods.

153
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,330
There's a lot of it.

154
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,700
Friend.

155
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,460
Don't you think that
what you're going to do...

156
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,970
is too cruel?

157
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,470
That's right

158
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,170
I think it's too cruel.

159
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,740
I don't think so.

160
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,540
This is kind enough for that person.

161
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,110
Talking about this makes me hungry.

162
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,650
Ai'Vee. make me a bowl of instant noodles.

163
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,010
And a bottle of ice-free drink.

164
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,990
P'Dao, did I scared you?

165
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,990
Scared? No, I'm not.

166
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,890
I just want to make
an instant noodles for you.

167
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,390
You also want a bottle
of ice-free drink, right?

168
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,890
Just a moment. l'll get it for you.

169
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,830
Also, it's my treat.

170
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,240
What are you smiling about?

171
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,870
I'll be honest.

172
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,570
I think that motherfucker...

173
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,140
will be here, for sure.

174
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:16,720
(Praying)

175
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,750
I'm the one that did it. Please do
anything to me. I'm scared now.

176
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,090
P'Dao, I'm not gonna do anything to you.

177
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,090
I'm just saying that because I'm angry.

178
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:25,830
Really?

179
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,090
Yes.

180
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,140
Hey, Ai'Vee!

181
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,300
Stop praying already.

182
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,370
You pray every time
you shocked about something.

183
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,370
Here you go. My treat.

184
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,640
Eat until you're full so
you won't be angry anymore.

185
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,470
Krub, Thank you.

186
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,450
So boring

187
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,650
Hey, where did Gawin went to?

188
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,320
He really calls for a scolding from me.

189
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,130
Damn!

190
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,830
He went to have fun with a customer alone.

191
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,160
I saw him earlier,
he said that he's going to the 7-11.

192
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,300
Heard he's been complaining that he's hungry
and probably went to find something to eat.

193
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,470
I think.

194
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,320
Then, I can go see Veeraporn.

195
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:18,910
Then I better go.

196
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:19,810
Stop right there.

197
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,650
You can't go.

198
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,520
You can even pull a customer,
now you want to hit on a girl?

199
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,600
Are you my mother or my younger sister?

200
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,130
Dare to talk back at me, Hia?

201
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:39,900
Krub.

202
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,340
I won't go.

203
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,770
Mother..

204
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,540
Sister!

205
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,160
Go away from here. Get away.

206
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,920
You even yell at people.

207
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,260
But, Ai'Tin...

208
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,900
you're bringing his child
to the motorcycle win like this...

209
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,160
if he finds out, won't you be dead?

210
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,800
I told him that I
take his kid out for playing.

211
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,940
He wouldn't know.

212
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,040
You better be careful.
If you get caught...

213
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,640
you'll be in dipshit.

214
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,110
That's right, he will pull your rent out.

215
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,180
He only let me rent there for a month, P'.

216
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,650
While waiting for his wife to come home.

217
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,780
He wouldn't catch me bringing
his son to motorcycle win.

218
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,590
You're so awesome. That's your problem.

219
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,960
Vee....

220
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:04,230
Everything here is the same as before.

221
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,240
I miss this place.

222
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,990
My new colleagues...

223
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,660
how will it go, I wonder.

224
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,330
Can I mix well with them?

225
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,160
Hold on.

226
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,500
Am I going crazy, talking to myself?

227
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,390
You're here, new guy.

228
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,820
Sawasdee krub.

229
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,360
Sawasdee krub.

230
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:16,510
Do we used to know each other?

231
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,640
No, we aren't.

232
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,550
We do.

233
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,000
Are you really P'Vee?

234
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,470
Yes.

235
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,940
You've changed a lot.

236
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,570
Is it?

237
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,670
I don't see it.

238
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,340
It's obvious, P'.

239
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:03,520
If you done greeted each other,
let me introduce you to the newcomer today.

240
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,690
Come, come: Introduction is in order.

241
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,090

242
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,730
OK, so this three are...

00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,160

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,400
N'Tem.

245
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,270
Ket.

246
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,300
N'Ket.

247
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,530
These three.

248
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,700
No need to introduce her
since you already know her, right?

249
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:22,940
Come, so...

250
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,340
the rest get back to work.The ?

251
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,680
Cho, come with me.

252
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:27,580
Cho...

253
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,910
We have a lot to talk about.

254
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,680
We haven't talked ever since you moved.

255
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,750
OK,P', We'll talk later.

256
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,840
Why are you here again?

257
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,740
Not full yet after eating the instant noodles?
I can buy you another one.

258
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,440
No, it's just...

259
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,680
I'm here to buy drinks
for the guys at the win station.

260
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:05,380
They like to complaint about me, saying that
I'm the only who one always receive customers.

261
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,450
I'm tired of of hearing it.

262
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,890
They are telling the truth.

263
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,060
You are the handsome motorcycle win rider.

264
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:16,090
It's normal for girls
to want to ride with you.

265
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,060
So, do you want me to
give you a ride sometimes?

266
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,630
Who wanted to?

267
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,600
Crazy.

268
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,840
But I want to.

269
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:30,310
I'm kidding.

270
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,330
Then, I better get those drinks.

271
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,400
Gawin, just a minute.

272
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,600
Why? Change your mind about the ride?

273
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,370
It's not that.

274
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,170
Do you remember Cho?

275
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,900
Cho...

276
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,610
Cho, your best friend when you were a kid.

277
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,470
He's working here right now.

278
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,580
Is that true? Where is he now?

279
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,580
Right now,
he's talking with P'Tos at the back.

280
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,580
There he is.

281
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,850
Cho.

282
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,390
It's really you.

283
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,430
I'm sorry.

284
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,500
Do we know each other?

285
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,330
How can you not?

286
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,700
This is Gawin.

287
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,400
Your friend when you were a kid.

288
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,700
I don't remember!

289
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,110
Are you angry at me...

290
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,340
to a point of not recognize me anymore?

291
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,380
If it is, then what?

292
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,280
Come here!

293
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,820
We have to talk right now.

294
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,620
Let me go.

295
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:32,220
Come here!

296
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,090
Let me go.

297
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,690
Oh my!

298
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,120
What is going to happen, girl?

299
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,360
If we want to know,
we have to follow them to find out.

300
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,160
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

301
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,130
Where are you rushing to?

302
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,570
Go..

303
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,670
Go to work.

304
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,170
Let's go Ket, to work, Let's go.

305
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,840
I'm gonna get back to work.

306
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,790
Vee, please check the water for me.

307
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,620
If there's any deficit, let me know.

308
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:08,420
OK.

309
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,530
And Dao, check the perfume
section. If there's a deficit...

310
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,430
let me know. I'll check the our stock.

311
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,090
Sure.

312
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,430
OK.

313
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,770
Let go! I said, let me go!

314
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,380
You're angry and hate me.

315
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,080
You can punch me then.

316
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,220
But don't pretend to not know me, please?

317
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,200
Why?

318
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,140
Do you care?

319
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,080
Of course I care.

320
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,580
You're pretending
not to recognize me like this...

321
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,620
it's hurting me.

322
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,750
I'm sorry.

323
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,820
I'm really sorry.

324
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,590
For saying that the job
you're after is a shit job

325
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,800
I'm really sorry.

326
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,130
Enough.

327
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,500
I forgive you.

328
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:21,110
Do you think that I'm actually
going to forgive you?

329
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,120
Do you think after
one or two apologies..

330
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,990
my already broken feeling...

331
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,390
is going to get better?

332
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,390
Do you know?

333
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,660
Ever since that day...

334
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,900
I've been hearing
that shit word every time.

335
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,030
A word that...

336
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,470
comes out from
a person very dear to me.

337
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,210
It makes me...

338
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:52,070
feel inferior about myself.

339
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,710
Just because...

340
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:58,210
a job at the convenience store that I want...

341
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,720
has no value in your eyes.

342
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,890
Then, what is this?

343
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:05,220
Are you wearing that
motorcycle win outfit for cosplay?

344
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,820
I don't think so.

345
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,530
You must be a motocycle rider.

346
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,800
I want you to feel my despair too.

347
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,030
Because this motocycle
job that you're doing...

348
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,360
are such a shit job.

349
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,730
I should get back to work.

350
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,910
One other thing...

351
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,670
if we see each other again.

352
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,940
Do me a favor of
pretending not to know me.

353
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,350
If you can't do that...

354
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,150
we should stop seeing each other.

355
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,520
it's almost a month.

356
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,160
Your wife isn't come home yet?

357
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,330
My wife, she...

358
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,730
she isn't coming back.

359
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,040
l'm sorry, P'.

360
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,500
I shouldn't ask.

361
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,140
Cho already went home?

362
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,870
Is something going on between you two?

363
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,380
No.

364
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,580
Nothing going on.

365
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,350
You're lying

366
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,750
She's right.

367
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,090
You can stop following me now.

368
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,220
Who? Who's following you?

369
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,860
I'm just walking.

370
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,360
If you think that by doing
this will make me forgive you....

371
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,000
you're wrong.

372
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,360
Because no matter what...

373
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,130
I will never forgive you.

374
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,400
You sleep here tonight, OK?

375
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,070
Sleep here?

376
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,510
Tin!

377
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,240
I'm gonna enter the bathroom now!
