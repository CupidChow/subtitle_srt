1
00:00:00,433 --> 00:00:01,867
P', it's been almost a month now.

2
00:00:01,901 --> 00:00:03,535
Your wife isn't coming home yet?

3
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:11,076
My wife won't be coming home anymore.

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,681
Hey, snake. Snake!

5
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:19,184
It is gone yet?

6
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,421
It's gone now.

7
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:25,591
Hold on.

8
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,326
There wasn't really any snake, isn't it?

9
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:28,761
Of course there is.

10
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:30,763
It's big too.

11
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:33,599
But it's around your waist now,

12
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,804
Let me go now.

13
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:39,905
No.

14
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,274
I said let me go

15
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:43,142
I'm not going to.

16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,077
You're not gonna let me go, is it?

17
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:47,379
Yes, I'm not going to.

18
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:48,447
Then you lean your ear over. .

19
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:52,818
That hurts.

20
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,655
People like you deserve this.

21
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:03,062
We're even now.

22
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,266
Where are you going?!
Come back here now!

23
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:10,969
You sleep here for tonight, OK?

24
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,172
Sleep here?

25
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:16,875
Yes, sleep here.

26
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:20,112
Go and take shower,
then we can have dinner together.

27
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:26,652
Hey!

28
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,520
Stop following me.

29
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,055
It's annoying

30
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,161
If you think that I'll forgive you for keep doing this...

31
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,896
you're wrong.

32
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:39,565
Because no matter what...

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,101
I will never ever forgive you!

34
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:52,444
Just because of the word "sucks".

35
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,684
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:26,879
How boring.

37
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,916
This is so fun.

38
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,355
Are you walking home again?

39
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,492
Whether I walk home or not...

40
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,461
what's it got to do with you?

41
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,396
I've told you, right?

42
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:45,864
Whenever we meet each other...

43
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,766
pretend that we don't know each other.

44
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,768
I beg you.

45
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,039
Wait,

46
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:56,809
What now?

47
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:04,116
I understand what you said now .

48
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,820
From now on...

49
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,690
we will become strangers to each other.

50
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:17,029
I'm just here to say goodbye.

51
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,800
After this...

52
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,271
I will be a stranger to you as you wish.

53
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,640
l'll Mugo now.

54
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,080
4...

55
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,690
Sawasdee krub.

56
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,520
I'm Gawin Chaitawat.

57
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,220
I'm 21 years old.

58
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,860
I'm a motorcycle taxi driver.

59
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,900
I'm currently single.

60
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,170
I wrote this note 11 years ago.

61
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,070
I meant to give it to
someone whom I hurt his feeling.

62
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,970
And I hope that...

63
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,540
he would forgive me.

64
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,010
So that we can be friend again.

65
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,410
But I was too late.

66
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,320
He already moved out.

67
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,150
But, right now...

68
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,660
I have a chance to meet him again.

69
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,460
But. he still wouldn't accept my apology.

70
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,160
lejust hope that...

71
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,270
he would accept my apology.

72
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,000
If you have some time today...

73
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,740
I would like to beg for
your forgiveness once more.

74
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,580
It doesn't matter what the answer is...

75
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,150
I will accept it.

76
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,180
Chotika...

77
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,460
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,230
If you're being silent like this...

79
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,530
I assume you've forgive me.

80
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,010
Nice to get to know you once again.

81
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,520
Let me go now.

82
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,590
I need to answer my phone.

83
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,400
Sawasdee krub.

84
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,470
This is the apartment owner.

85
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,910
Yes, Auntie. What's going on?

86
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,940
Thing is...

87
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,680
something happen.

88
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,810
The tenants who live
next to your room had a fight...

89
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,120
and broke into your room.

90
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,350
Then...

91
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,490
a shooting happened
in the room and kill someone.

92
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,490
Huh?!

93
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,760
Someone was shot dead in my room?

94
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,830
Yes.

95
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,960
Don't be shock, let me finish.

96
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,160
The police already arrived.

97
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,170
But they won't let me in to clean up.

98
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,940
Do you have any friend that you
can stay with for a one or two days?

99
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,310
Once I finish cleaning up, I'll contact you again.

100
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,680
I also wanted to you that...

101
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,580
I already found a room near my workplace.

102
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,580
I meant to call to inform you too.

103
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,780
Is that so?

104
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,290
But if that place is not good...

105
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,320
This room is still waiting for you.

106
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,192
Krub.

107
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,900
Shit.

108
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,610
Someone was shot dead in my room.

109
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,320
Who's brave enough to live there.

110
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,360
If you don't hate me...

111
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,830
you stay in my apartment.

112
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,890
Why do you have two mattresses?

113
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,620
This is my dad's old mattress.

114
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,430
Can you sleep on it?

115
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,560
Sure.

116
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
Not a problem.

117
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,060
By the way...

118
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,870
Where is your father?

119
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:37,870
Or do you live separately?

120
00:07:41,488 --> 00:07:42,340
Yes.

121
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:43,810
We live separately.

122
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,040
We see each other once in a while.

123
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,180
What about your mother.

124
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,980
Is she still live abroad?

125
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,020
But we don't see each other anymore.

126
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,980
You still keep this?

127
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,250
At that time...

128
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,150
You were very small at that time.

129
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,550
You're very naughty too.

130
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,050
You're grown a lot now.

131
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,260
Of course.

132
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:36,330
I drink 2 bags of milk every day.

133
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,900
Now that you're grown up like this...

134
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,360
you're kinda cute.

135
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,540
Please stay away from me tonight.

136
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,410
What?

137
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,640
Are you afraid that I'll do something to you?

138
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,780
Do I look like like a horny guy?

139
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,350
I'm talking to you anymore.

140
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,990
I better get to bed.

141
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,730
Неу.

142
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,560
Stop staring at me.

143
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,800
What are you staring at?

144
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,030
I just'want to see you clearly.

145
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,900
And I'm happy...

146
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,940
that you're here.

147
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,810
I'm happy..

148
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,610
that we get to meet again.

149
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,820
Here.

150
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,220
Stare at me then.

151
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,390
Is this clear enough?

152
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,740
What are you doing?

153
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,040
I'm not doing anything.

154
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,710
It's you,

155
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,280
who fell on me by yourself.

156
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,710
I'm talking to you anymore.

157
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,110
Better go to sleep now.

158
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,700
I'm home.

159
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,280
What are smiling at, Uncle?

160
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,550
It's Tot, not Uncle.

161
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,560
Krub, Uncle Tot.
Good now that you're home.

162
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,360
I can go back to my room now.

163
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,430
Yeah...

164
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,490
you.

165
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,400
Do you want to continue taking care of my child?

166
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,600
Continue taking care of your child?

167
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,070
That's interesting.

168
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,040
If you're interested in
continuing to care for my child...

169
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,240
you don't have to
come back and forth anymore.

170
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,350
Because I was thinking
of letting you to continue live here.

171
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,780
Is that a good idea?

172
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,920
Of course.

173
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,950
Deal then.

174
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,280
Deal, right?

175
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,190
If it's a deal, then go and pack your things,

176
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,350
ОК.

177
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,130
Is this right, or wrong?

178
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,550
Scale, this is clear soup.

179
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:19,920
When you grow up,
don't forget to cook for your dad.

180
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,860
Your Papa wakes up late, isn't he?

181
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,230
And he complains a lot too.

182
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,330
When you're older,
don't make your Papa upset. Understand?

183
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,500
You'll get lecture for sure.

184
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,740
You already slept.

185
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,470
Hey!

186
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,680
Are you gossiping about me behind
my back since early in the morning?

187
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,210
No, I'm not.

188
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,710
Just talking to him.

189
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,020
You should hurry and take a bath. Uncle.

190
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,620
Or you'll be late for work.

191
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,850
Неу.

192
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:58,290
You said that I'm a complainer,
you are no different too. Don't you know?

193
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,390
I better get going, right son?

194
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,490
Sleep, sleep. I'm leaving, Bye.

195
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,020
P'Art,

196
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,120
Ai Tin and P'Gawin is not here yet?

197
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,490
He's not here.

198
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:36,390
That's good.

199
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,300
Then we can get a lot
of customers today.

200
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,600
As for Ai'Tin, probably with that child of his.

201
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,870
You are so heartless.

202
00:13:52,512 --> 00:13:53,472
P'Ang.

203
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,780
Not finished yet watching that Chinese series?

204
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:57,780
Not yet.

205
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:01,050
This WeTV has a lot of series to watch.

206
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,750
Is there any porn?.

207
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,260
No!

208
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,790
There's Chinese series...

209
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,960
Thai series and Korean series.

210
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,330
That's a lot.

211
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,500
So, there is no porn?

212
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,210
You really wanna watch it so badly, do you?

213
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,440
No. l'm not.

214
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,910
You really wanna watch it, right?

215
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:33,120
The brother is a Thai series fanatic.

216
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,290
The sister is a Chinese series fanatic.

217
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,290
How boring.

218
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,830
I haven't touch up my face yet.

219
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,400
Let me apply some powder.

220
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,180
Ai'Tin!

221
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,520
You're here.
Whose clothes are you wearing?

222
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,290
This is Scale's father's clothes.

223
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,350
Last night, he lets me sleep at his place.

224
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,420
What about his wife?

225
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,830
She didn't even come back even once?

226
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:21,160
You said that you only takes care
of the child until his wife return.

227
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,030
His wife is not coming home, P'.

228
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,800
As of now, I may have to
take care of Scale for a long time

229
00:15:28,464 --> 00:15:28,976
Huh?!

230
00:15:29,472 --> 00:15:32,640
That means that his wife left him?

231
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,550
I feel sorry for the baby.

232
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,150
Hey.

233
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,480
Can I hold him?

234
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,720
Sure, P'.

235
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,980
You are always nice to everyone like this.

236
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,800
I have tried to change myself...

237
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,970
into this...

238
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,180
like you said.

239
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,430
Cho, how are you here with Gawin?

240
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,290
The other day,
you were still fighting with each other.

241
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,260
I told you that there's nothing going on.

242
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,530
I happened to stay with Gawin for now.

243
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
because there's some
problem with the room that I rent.

244
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,270
l'll move out once I found a new room.

245
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,670
Why do you have to move out?

246
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,410
Juat stay with Gawin.

247
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,140
So that you can share the room rental.

248
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,110
Yes. It's better to stay together.

249
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,080
My heart is calling.

250
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,820
I need to come...

251
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,420
Want to tell you that...

252
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,720
The person.

253
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,760
standing right here

254
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,030
is my children's mother.

255
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,230
Weeraporn, ja.

256
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,500
Please wait for Art.

257
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,840
His name is Art, He's been
hitting on Wee for quite a while now.

258
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,340
Well, well, well.

259
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,880
She's hot for
both men and women.

260
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,330
It's so tiring today.

261
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,190
But it's worth it.

262
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,500
By the way...

263
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,630
when will the
auntie call you about the room?

264
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,940
So I can help you move your stuff.

265
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,810
She said it'll be ready in a few days.

266
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,610
Go and take a shower.

267
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,210
You're stink like hell.

268
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,190
Clothes are every where.

269
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,770
Didn't he just wear
this shirt yesterday?

270
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,610
What about this one?

271
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,530
Why did you lied?

272
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,700
I'm sorry.

273
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,470
Is this the reason...

274
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,910
that you quit your study?

275
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,680
And became a motorbike taxi driver?

276
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,620
What about your dream
of becoming an engineer?

277
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,120
Don't you want to be one anymore?

278
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,160
I never wanted to be an
engineer in the first place.

279
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
It's just something that my dad...

280
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,170
wanted me to be.

281
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,140
Dad loves to say that...

282
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,970
he wants me to study hard...

283
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,110
have a good job.

284
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,580
Be a doctor...

285
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,520
or an engineer.

286
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,720
But. dad never ask me...

287
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,460
do I want to be that.

288
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,090
But I love my father so much.

289
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,200
There's just the two of us.

290
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,400
About my mother's working abroad...

291
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,510
I lied too.

292
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,470
The truth is,,,

293
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,910
My mom left me for
someone richer than my father.

294
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,210
Since then...

295
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,690
Dad doesn't want me to end up like him.

296
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,160
Dad forced himself to work so hard.

297
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,330
He forced me take extra classes.

298
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,800
Even though I didn't want to.

299
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,940
But I still give in for my father.

300
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,770
I stopped him.

301
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,910
But. Dad didn't listen.

302
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,080
In the end...

303
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:51,090
Dad left me when I was
going to take entrance exam to university.

304
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:57,090
Left me to live alone.

305
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,230
I was so lonely.

306
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,900
to live alone.

307
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,170
I felt lost.

308
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,850
In the end...

309
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,420
I work as a motorbike
taxi driver like you're seeing now.

310
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,770
All these time...

311
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,730
you have been through a lot.

312
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,100
From now on...

313
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,540
you have me.

314
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,840
l'll stay close to you.

315
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,810
From now on...

316
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,580
If there's something that upset you...

317
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,850
you don't have to lie...

318
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,690
and keep it to yourself.

319
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,060
You can tell me.

320
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,190
You're awake?

321
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,190
Um, I am.

322
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,060
You should hurry and get up...

323
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,860
or you'll be late for work.

324
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,030
Let me lie down for awhile.

325
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,860
You go ahead and shower first.

326
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,770
Wake me up after you're done.

327
00:24:16,592 --> 00:24:17,520
Um.

328
00:24:36,896 --> 00:24:38,790
Are you kissing my cheeks?

329
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,040
Are you crazy?

330
00:24:41,328 --> 00:24:42,080
What do you mean kiss?

331
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,408
It's stink as hell.

332
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,100
Well. just now.

333
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,420
That's because you pull my blanket.

334
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,750
When did you pull my blanket?

335
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,020
I don't know..

336
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,260
It was cold last night

337
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,860
So I just pulled up a blanket.

338
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:03,300
And I had no idea that it's your blanket.

339
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,070
Then tonight, sleep far away from me.

340
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:08,570
Khun...

341
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,070
in a room this small...

342
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,240
do you still want us to sleep separately?

343
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,280
I'm not talking to you anymore.
I better take a shower.

344
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,880
Don't you ever pull my blanket again.

345
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,330
I suspect P'Gawin is hitting on P'Cho.

346
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:42,370
But P'Cho said that there's nothing going on.

347
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,440
So, now.

348
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,110
they're maybe already dating.

349
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,210
Two good looking
guys are eating each other!

350
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,710
Pouched eggs.

351
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,010
For what?

352
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,310
Well, yesterday you were sweating too much.

353
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,080
So the eggs is for your supplement.

354
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,480
That's nuts!

355
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,820
How can you say
that in front of the baby?

356
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,260
I'm skinny?

357
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,490
You're the one who's a lot skinnier than me.

358
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,130
Really?

359
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,300
That's a brave say
that you're fatter than me.

360
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,930
Even though I'm skinny...

361
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,040
But I'm handsome that make girls scream.

362
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,640
Where?

363
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,000
Where is the handsome?

364
00:26:21,424 --> 00:26:22,464
This.

365
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,140
The handsome is here.

366
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,560
Hey!

367
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,400
You crazy kid! Why did you come in?
