1
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:57,743
Don't let me know that you
take him to your motorcycle win.

2
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:00,846
If I find out
about it you will be sorry,

3
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,916
Who said that I take him on a win I
just take him for outdoor activities.

4
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:07,219
Everything here is the same as before.

5
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,688
Do we used to know each other?

6
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,958
No, we don't

7
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,163
Are you really P'Vee?

8
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,666
Cho, your best friend when you were a kid.

9
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,700
He's working here right now.

10
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,300
It's really you, Cho.

11
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,800
Do we know each other?

12
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,670
I'm sorry.

13
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,940
Do you think that I'm
actually going to forgive you?

14
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,840
One other thing...

15
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,580
if we see each other again..

16
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,280
Do me a favor
of pretending not to know me.

17
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,040
Hey, how are you feeling?

18
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,280
Try tell me about it.

19
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,080
I'm feeling dizzy and starving, P'.

20
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,690
Tell me.

21
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,360
why did you fainted at the mini mart?

22
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,770
Lately...

23
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,540
I've been having trouble sleeping...

24
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,110
so, I passed out.

25
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,070
It's fortunate...

26
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,240
that I happened it to be at the mini mart.

27
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,780
If not...

28
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,510
you would've been dead.

29
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,950
Thank you, P'Art.

30
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,720
Don't mention it.

31
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,190
Don't?force yourself too much.

32
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,360
It'll cause a problem! having
to carry you home again,

33
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,930
My apologize, P'.

34
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,230
I should go and help my mom.

35
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,740
OK, thanks again P'.

36
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,700
I'll go now.

37
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:11,610
Krub.

38
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,770
Sawasdee krub, P'.

39
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,200
We're here, we're here.

40
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,340
Sit and play the ball.

41
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,810
Tin, come in

42
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,580
Come in, come in.

43
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,590
P', it's been almost a month now.

44
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,260
Your still hasn't come home yet?

45
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,390
My wife, she...

46
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,860
won't be back anymore.

47
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm sorry, P'.

48
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,500
I shouldn't ask.

49
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,340
It's alright.

50
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,310
By the way, your life is like mine.

51
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,180
Everyone left me.

52
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,250
But, never mind.

53
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,820
We have to continue with our lives.

54
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,650
Let me cook for you.

55
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,160
Come, it's alright.

56
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,560
I'll do it myself.

57
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,560
You can make the baby's milk.

58
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,490
Sure.

59
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,960
E'Tem, what's wrong with you?

60
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,160
Stand there and twisting like that?

61
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,370
Check, please. I miss you.

62
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,440
You're crazy, I don't know
what are you talking about.

63
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,610
What's going on here?

64
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,110
Here it is again.

65
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,880
I'm really sick of this.

66
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,220
Come now, they like each other.

67
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,920
Just let her be.

68
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,590
My man is here!

69
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,800
Ai'Vee...

70
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,270
Is Cho already went home?

71
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,220
He just left awhile ago.

72
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,950
Is there something going on between you two?

73
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,630
No.

74
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,990
It's nothing.

75
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,500
You're lying.

76
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:06,760
That's right.

77
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,170
'It really is' nothing.

78
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,500
I'm gonna leave now.

79
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,170
He just come and go. That was fast.

80
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,840
There's definitely
something going between those two.

81
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,350
I don't know about those two.

82
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,920
But these two definitely is.

83
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:30,390
Already gave the money
and have the change back.

84
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,920
When is this going to finished?

85
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,020
Don't you think you
should continue this at home?

86
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,190
I'm sick of your jealousy.

87
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,330
That's enough.

88
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,700
Time to go back to work.

89
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:42,970
Hurry.

90
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,570
Why are you sitting here?

91
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,740
Do you want a ride home?

92
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,870
I give you a ride home.

93
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,980
You're probably a mute.

94
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,050
You maybe a mute...

95
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,820
but not deaf.

96
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,110
Hey!

97
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,740
Can you stop following me?

98
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,010
Who? Who's following you?

99
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,580
I'm just strolling here,

100
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,780
Don't you think that this
is not the right time for strolling?

101
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:19,390
No one is stopping me from
strolling here at this hour.

102
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,560
You're pissing me off.

103
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,930
Hey, snake!

104
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,230
It is gone yet?!

105
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,400
It's gone now.

106
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,610
Hold on.

107
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,340
There wasn't really any snake, isn't it?

108
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,740
Of course there is.

109
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,840
It's big too.

110
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,780
But it's around your waist now.

111
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,990
Let me go now.

112
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,820
No.

113
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,460
I said let me go

114
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,360
I'm not going to.

115
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,290
You're not gonna let me go, is it?

116
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,590
Yes, I'm not going to.

117
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,660
Then you lean your ear over.

118
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,070
That hurts.

119
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,840
People like you deserve this,

120
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,310
We're even now,

121
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,950
Where are you going?!

122
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,180
Get back here!

123
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,640
What are you smiling at, P'?

124
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,680
I'm smiling because
you can play well with my son.

125
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,810
Looking at you...

126
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,050
you don't seem like someone
who can play with children.

127
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,820
I do look like a gentle person as it is.

128
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,760
Hey.

129
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,490
You sleep here for tonight, OK?

130
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,460
Sleep here?

131
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,470
Yes, sleep here.

132
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,500
Go and take shower,
then we can have dinner together.

133
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,340
OK?

134
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,670
Can I eat first before bath?

135
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,740
You can't.

136
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,650
It's just a shower,
why are you being so lazy?

137
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,980
p'...

138
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,480
you sound like my father.

139
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,850
Oh. hey!

140
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,020
But, it's fine if you
don't want to be my father.

141
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,020
Then...

142
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,890
you can be my uncle instead.

143
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,460
l'm not a father nor an uncle.

144
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,730
Someone's mad.

145
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,000
Whose father is that?

146
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:49,010
Oh wait, it's my uncle.

147
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,210
You're not going yet.

148
00:13:55,744 --> 00:13:57,248
You're going to shower yet.

149
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,120
Hey!

150
00:13:59,568 --> 00:14:01,392
Go, Go and take a shower.

151
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,704
Then we can have dinner.

152
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,590
Go.

153
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,540
Go and take a shower. Quick.

154
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,210
Then I can give my son a bath.

155
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,640
Come, come and play with me.

156
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,210
How are you, dear?

157
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,160
Come and play.

158
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,580
Tin!

159
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,750
Are you alright?!

160
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,120
Tin!

161
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,950
I'm gonna enter the bathroom, OK?!

162
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,910
Too late for that, I'm afraid.

163
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,910
I've already seen everything
of that small worm of yours.

164
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,080
What an insult.

165
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,180
It's asleep.

166
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,650
If it's awaken, it'll be like anaconda.

167
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,450
Really?

168
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,350
Why did you enter? Are you a pervert?

169
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,650
I'm not.

170
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,090
You were in the bathroom too long,
I wonder if there's something wrong.

171
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,290
So, I came to check on you.

172
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,090
Get out.

173
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,860
Fine, fine, fine.

174
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,430
Your clothes are on the sofa.

175
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,860
l'll go out now.

176
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,890
Girl, girl.

177
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,490
Aside from P'Tos...

178
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,660
P'Cho is the one who make me
want to come to work every day.

179
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,190
What is he? He's so cute!

180
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,630
Right.

181
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,130
I want to be a good mother for N'Scale.

182
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,770
Also I want to be a good
girlfriend to P'Cho too.

183
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,410
E'Fat!

184
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,340
What about your boyfriend?

185
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,870
You're being mean to him.

186
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,040
No, no, no Khun Mom,

187
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,750
Don't say that I'm mean.

188
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:02,880
It's better to call me the
beauty to the eyes of everyone.

189
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,620
Ja...

190
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,350
Ja...

191
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,690
You are deadly beautiful indeed.

192
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,790
Was that a compliment?

193
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,030
What does he mean by that?

194
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,660
I'd take it as a compliment.

195
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,500
Oh, Gawin

196
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,400
You here early. You don't
have any motorcycle win?

197
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:24,900
I do.

198
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,110
But I want come to 7-11 first.

199
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:30,940
I think it's weird because
normally you'd come around 10 AM.

200
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,910
It's not weird, P', I'm hungry,
so I come here for something to eat.

201
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,630
Gawin, I count the bill for you.

202
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,200
It's fine, I want this counter.

203
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,770
What is it with you?

204
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,240
Vee, come and help me out for a bit.

205
00:18:01,264 --> 00:18:02,144
Sure thing.

206
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,490
Bill, please.

207
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,700
It's 20 baht.

208
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,150
Change is 80 baht.

209
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,720
I'll have this too.

210
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,520
This too.

211
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,060
And..

212
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,090
this too.

213
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,190
And this.

214
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,470
49mm?

215
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,670
It's the smallest one.

216
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:04,900
Hey!

217
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,540
Mine is actually way bigger than this.

218
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,880
Really?

219
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,680
Absolutely. You wanna see it?

220
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,780
Let me see! Where is it?

221
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,050
Yes, P'Gawin. Open it for me.

222
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,150
I think...

223
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,950
I better get going.

224
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,190
What's the rush? Show it.

225
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,890
Open it first...

226
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,930
P'Cho.

227
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,430
Honestly speaking...

228
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,470
I think P'Gawin is secretly flirting with you, right?

229
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,540
What flirting? No.

230
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,210
If not, then is there
something wrong with the two of you?

231
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,680
I think you should get back to work.

232
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,180
Back to work?

233
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,080
Are you saying I
shouldn't pry into your business?

234
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,380
Work?

235
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,280
Fine.

236
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,190
Work?

237
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,130
Cho.

238
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,500
Yes?

239
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,200
Is there something wrong
between you and Gawin?

240
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,340
Yeah, I wanna know too.

241
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,810
It's nothing, P'.

242
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,310
Really?

243
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:18,610
If there's nothing wrong, why are you
acting like you don't know each other.

244
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,620
It's nothing.
I was just messing with him.

245
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,860
Fine, I believe you.

246
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,630
But you have any problem,
you can ask me for advise.

247
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,960
Me too. You can consult me as well.

248
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,130
Thank you.

249
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,640
Welcome to 7-11.

250
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,040
Girl, girl.

251
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,340
Isn't that Scale, P'Tos's child?

252
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,510
Yes, why does he come
with that cute motorbike taxi guy?

253
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,180
Scale, do you like to come to 7-11 with me?

254
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,650
He's here.

255
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,160
Oh, you!

256
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,330
Uncle,

257
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,230
I told you to call me Tos.

258
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,700
Not uncle or whatever.

259
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,730
Why do you take my
kid out from the apartment?

260
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,070
Why didn't you stay at the apartment?

261
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,970
Oh, Uncle.

262
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,910
I told you to stop calling me that.

263
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,710
It's boring staying at the apartment.

264
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,110
So I take him out for sightseeing.

265
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,350
Wait.

266
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,080
Isn't my shirt and pants?

267
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,020
Yes, because I don't
have anything to wear.

268
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,620
I washed it last night.

269
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,190
Live together and
share each other clothes.

270
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:40,460
Where is P'Toss' wife?

271
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,430
Unless...

272
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,530
they both already did it!

273
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,200
You're delusional.

274
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,070
No.

275
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,670
Is it?

276
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,240
Do you know that you roll around
in your sleep a lot last night?

277
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,040
That's not true.

278
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,680
It's you, who spread your leg on me.

279
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,750
I'm sure of it, I'm sure of it.

280
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,880
For certain.

281
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,780
Handsome guys eat each other...

282
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:09,790
Then, my dream to become
Scale's mother is shattered.

283
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,230
You said that I was delusional earlier.

284
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,230
And you?

285
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,600
Exactly.

286
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,500
It's this clear...

287
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:22,270
and we even heard it ourselves,
how can it be other way?

288
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,200
But, I feel sorry for Toss' wife.

289
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,410
How is she going to hold up?

290
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,940
What are you doing?!

291
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,680
We're working, we're working.

292
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:32,310
Exactly, we're not eavesdropping or anything,

293
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,310
Hold it, they will know we
eavesdrop because you said that.

294
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,220
We're going to'the coụnter.

295
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,590
P'Vee, stop praying already.

296
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,520
Get to work. Check the stock.

297
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:43,790
Ja.

298
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,990
I was kinda shocked earlier.

299
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,390
By the way...

300
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,530
after you finish shopping, hurry back.

301
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,970
Don't let me find out that you secretly
taking my kid out again, understand?

302
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,270
OK, then I better hurry home.

303
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,700
Good,

304
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,360
Hey!

305
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,460
Stop following me.

306
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,730
It's annoying.

307
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,300
Who's following you?

308
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,730
I'm just walking with my motorbike.

309
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,000
What kind of crazy
man would walk with a motorbike.

310
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,470
Then, what kind of crazy
man wouldn't accept a ride home...

311
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,810
instead choose to walk home.

312
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,340
That's because I
want to go home by walking.

313
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,410
I also just want to walk with my motorbike.

314
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,920
You're getting on my nerves.

315
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,090
Who's getting on your nerves? I'm not.

316
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,060
I'm just walking with my motorbike.

317
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,820
You can just keep walking,

318
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,300
If you think that I'll
forgive you for keep doing this...

319
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,970
you're wrong

320
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,470
Because no matter what...

321
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,340
I will never ever forgive you!

322
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,360
I'll try to make you forgive me.

323
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:34,250
Just because of the word "sucks".

324
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,530
I'm sorry.

325
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,680
Shit!

326
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,680
Someone died.

327
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,050
Who dare to live there.

328
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,290
If you don't hate me...

329
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,690
you can stay at my apartment.

330
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,530
I can go home.

331
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:22,740
Do you.

332
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,470
want to continue taking care of my child?

333
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:30,980
Because I was thinking of
letting you to continue live here.

334
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,380
Is that a good idea?

335
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,580
Absolutely.

336
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,810
Deal.

337
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,880
If it's a deal, go and pack your things.

338
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,950
OK.

339
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,390
What about his wife?

340
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,690
She hasn't come back yet?

341
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,330
His wife won't be coming home anymore, P'.

342
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:49,130
As of now, I may have to take
care of Scale for a long time

343
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,830
That means, his wife left him?

344
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,700
I feel so sorry for this child.

345
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,410
From now on...

346
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,910
you'll have me...

347
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,210
by your side.
