1
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,560
You crazy kid. Why did you come in?

2
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,970
Pouched eggs.

3
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,070
So, are you finished yet?

4
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,950
Pouched eggs.

5
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,080
For what?

6
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,950
Well, yesterday you were sweating too much.
So the eggs is for your supplement.

7
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,560
That's crazy!

8
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,030
How can you say that in front of the kid?!

9
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,300
This time me and P'Art
will never help you again.

10
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,460
Why is she furious at you?

11
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,900
I only went to the toilet for
a short while. What happened?

12
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,170
Ai'Wai here is gambling again.

13
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,140
Then, continue scolding him,

14
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,470
Even though I'm skinny....

15
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,580
but I'm handsome
and desirable by women.

16
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,310
Where? Where is the handsome?

17
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,250
Here, of course.

18
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,650
The handsome is here.

19
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,270
What's that suppose to mean?

20
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,570
Well, I wanted to eat garlic pork.

21
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,710
Cook for me today.

22
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,210
You're getting attached with my cooking.

23
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,900
Hey.

24
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,830
Where have you been drinking?
Why are you this drunk?

25
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,370
Who's drunk?

26
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,240
I'm not drunk.

27
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,910
With your current condition
and still telling yourself not drunk?

28
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,510
Who?

29
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,140
Who's drunk? No.

30
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,620
Why am I wearing this shirt?

31
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,990
My pants are also different from yesterday?

32
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,360
Or...

33
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,290
I was drunk last night
and don't remember anything?

34
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,760
And went shower.

35
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,000
What's the matter?

36
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,570
You look perplexed.

37
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,440
Don't tell me that you...

38
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,310
You...

39
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,380
Yes.

40
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,950
I'm the one who changed your clothes.

41
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,850
You were drunk last night...

42
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,780
and puked too.

43
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,420
I woke you up but you didn't awake.

44
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,360
I was the one who clean you up with towel.

45
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,130
Cleaned me with towel?

46
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,590
Yes.

47
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,000
I took off your shirt...

48
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,230
your pants...

49
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,770
and I've check every corner.

50
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,870
Every corner?

51
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,570
Don't tell me that you've seen...

52
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,540
Yes, I've seen it.

53
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,750
I'm not just let you alone to seen mine.

54
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:05,720
Let me go!

55
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,690
I'm not going to

56
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,190
What are you doing?!

57
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,590
I'm going to see yours as payback.

58
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,890
Let me go! I said let me go!

59
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,760
I'm not letting you go.

60
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:12,730
Let me go!

61
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,830
No, I'm gonna let you go no matter what.

62
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,160
Let me go! I said let me go!

63
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,500
No! I'm not letting you go.

64
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,380
Are you mad at me?

65
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,220
Stop being angry already.

66
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,750
You've seen mine.

67
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,020
So I have to see yours in return.

68
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,460
That way it will be even.

69
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,560
Why do you have to be angry at me?

70
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,100
Because when I saw yours...

71
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,030
you were asleep.

72
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,730
But when you saw mine, I was awake.

73
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,500
It's embarrassing.

74
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,210
What are you laughing at?

75
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,440
What are you laughing at?

76
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,010
OK, OK, I give up.

77
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,110
I give up.

78
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,080
But, please kick me softly.

79
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,850
Ок.

80
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,550
I'm ready to be kick.

81
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,150
What is this?

82
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,880
My rent payment.

83
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,180
I wasn't planning to stay here with you for free.

84
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,590
Hey, this is not necessary.

85
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,420
Take it. We'll share
water and electricity bills too.

86
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:22,790
Hey, it's alright...

87
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,120
If you don't accept it, I'll be mad.

88
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,890
Fine, OK.

89
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,900
Come, let's go to work.

90
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,430
Let's go.

91
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,410
Let's go.

92
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,060
Uncle.

93
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,200
You were hit by a car last night.

94
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,540
It's fortunate that I was aware as to why
you went to shopping so late at night.

95
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,840
I was so scared when I saw you lying in blood.

96
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,910
Are you...

97
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,880
worried about me?

98
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,550
No.

99
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,960
Here.

100
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,060
Did you make this yourself?

101
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,300
No, I bought it from across the alley.

102
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,430
Get up slowly, Uncle.

103
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,310
Uncle?

104
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,910
What are you doing?

105
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,950
Are you hurt?

106
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,020
Here.

107
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,620
Stop playing around. Uncle.

108
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,520
I'm not, I'm being serious.

109
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,120
Here, it really hurts here.

110
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,990
My lips hurt, it got cut.
I don't whether know it's bleeding or not.

111
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,230
Stop talking.

112
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:09,660
Here.

113
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,400
Can you feed me?

114
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,770
You didn't break your arm.
eat by yourself.

115
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,410
My arm hurts.

116
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,640
I can't move my arm,
you see it yourself. My arm hurt so bad.

117
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,080
I can't even scoop the food.

118
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,110
Fine, fine, I'll feed you.

119
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,030
What are you smiling at, Uncle?

120
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,160
Nothing.

121
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,900
I was just smiling normally.
Just the usual.

122
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,460
Nothing in particular.

123
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,010
There, you're smiling again.

124
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,210
You're imagining things.

125
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,380
It's nothing.

126
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,780
Just feed me, I'm hungry.

127
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,010
Give me a big bite.

128
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,000
Sweets can flirt a steamed bun...

129
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,630
so why can't I flirt with you?

130
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,900
I said can't means can't.

131
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,340
Don't you understand?

132
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,080
Go back to your motorbike taxi.

133
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,010
How can I...

134
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,550
when my heart is here?

135
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,120
P'Art!

136
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,850
You're not here for breakfast, aren't you?

137
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,390
You're here to fli

138
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,920
Come here, let's go to work,

139
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,660
I'm your elder brother....

140
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,090
can't you have some respect for me?

141
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,160
Let's go to work.

142
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,500
I'm going.

143
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,240
Ready?

144
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,840
Thank you.

145
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,150
Come here, come here now.

146
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,520
You can let me go now.

147
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,550
Are you my mother or my sister?

148
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,490
You don't want to work anymore?

149
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:16,260
There, look the customers are waiting.

150
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,960
Don't you want to make money?

151
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,260
Go, Get to work.

152
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,830
Yes, Mother.

153
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,300
Go now.

154
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,240
Hey, hey, hey.

155
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,080
There is not other motorbike
runner around here, is it?

156
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,340
Stop looking at Gawin.

157
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,810
He's tired. He's not gonna
do any running. He's resting.

158
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,380
He's testing.

159
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,550
Why are being so weirdly scary today?

160
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,390
Did you eat something wrong?

161
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,420
I'm not.

162
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,260
My Demon Grandmaster just fall of a cliff.

163
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:58,060
I don't what's up with him.
I'm so pissed at him.

164
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,330
Don't tell me that the
reason you're upset all day...

165
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,340
is just because of this?

166
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,340
Absolutely, why?

167
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,640
Nothing.

168
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,780
But...

169
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,410
I need your advise on something.

170
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,680
If my guess is right...

171
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,480
It's definitely an emotional issue.

172
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,990
How did you know?

173
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,190
Who is this?

174
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,460
This Ang, the love expert.

175
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,960
But never has a boyfriend.

176
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:30,200
Ai'Gawin, are you
looking for a beef with me?

177
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
What's it about?

178
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,700
Who do you have a crush on?

179
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,940
Are you a psychiatrist?

180
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,270
If my guess is correct...

181
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,710
you have a crush on your friend, right?

182
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,940
That's not it.

183
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,180
You got that wrong.

184
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,050
It's...

185
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,110
I'm planning on telling
that person that I like them.

186
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,420
But...

187
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,290
when I'm about to tell it...

188
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,650
my heart feels strange.

189
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,060
I fear that the
person will not feel the same way.

190
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,590
You...

191
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,460
what it is that you're feeling.
you should let them know.

192
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,700
At least if you say it,
you won't regret it later.

193
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,240
Whatever that makes you happy,
you should do it.

194
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,270
Then, what's your definition of hapiness?

195
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,310
I don't know...

196
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,920
what happiness means.

197
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,750
But for me...

198
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,790
Just get to watchathatidrama after news.

199
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,560
The heroine wears a mustache
and talks with deeper voice...

200
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,460
disguised herself as the
gardener for some khun chai...

201
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,830
for him to accept her to work for him.

202
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,300
Don't tell me...

203
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,200
that just by having beard and wearing wig...

204
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,640
and speak with deeper voice...

205
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,440
is all it takes for
you to not recognize her?

206
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,440
Yes, that's my happiness.

207
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,180
And as for my happiness...

208
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:53,880
it's got to be love with regrets, I suppose.

209
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,090
Right now, I'm addicted
to a Chinese series, right?

210
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,420
The protagonists is a Demon Grandmaster.

211
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,160
Tall, white, kind-hearted...

212
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,560
and good with spell.

213
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,200
But they had to kill their
teachers who is the enemy together.

214
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,860
They then get punished.

215
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,330
But both of them are happy.

216
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:20,240
Are you saying that you're falling in love
with the demon grand-master in the series?

217
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,710
Exactly.

218
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,980
Even though I'm disappointed...

219
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,880
I'm happy as long as they are happy.

220
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,350
Look at me, I went to flirt with Vee.

221
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,660
Although she refused...

222
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,390
But I was happy to berable to flirt her.

223
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,360
For that.

224
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,100
if you want to tell them...

225
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,330
Just tell them.

226
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,430
That's right. I agree.

227
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,640
But, P'Art...

228
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,570
I told you to do the motorbike
running. Why did you go yet?

229
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,380
Go!

230
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,580
Yes; Mother.

231
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,110
Hurry up.

232
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,380
Yes yes, yes.

233
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,890
Come, come, come.

234
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,590
He's often fast when it comes to woman.

235
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:21,800
<i>Happy Birthday to you.</i>

236
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,440
<i>Happy Birthday to you.</i>

237
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:32,050
<i>Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday.</i>

238
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:39,490
<i>Happy Birthday to you.</i>

239
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,660
You even remember my birthday?

240
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,260
Of course.

241
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,460
I never forget.

242
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,930
Make a wish.

243
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,620
I'm sorry for only able to buy this small cake.

244
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,550
It's alright.

245
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,620
Just you remember my birthday.

246
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,360
is enough to make me happy.

247
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,430
I don't have any gifts for you.

248
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,260
But I have something that I want to tell you.

249
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:25,930
What's that?

250
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,630
Well...

251
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,700
I don't know if I say it...

252
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,640
how will it change our relationship.

253
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,650
But I thought about it for a long time...

254
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,920
and thought about it carefully...

255
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,050
to tell you this..

256
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,660
Cho, listen...

257
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,330
The feelings that I have for you...

258
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,300
has been more than just
a friend for a long time now.

259
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,670
At first...

260
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,800
I thought it was just a good friendship.

261
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,980
But I've been only thinking
about you these past years...

262
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,910
it's not because that I felt guilty...

263
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,780
for that harsh word I said to you.

264
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,080
No matter how many times I ask myself...

265
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,620
The answers I got are...

266
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,690
I... like...

267
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,060
I... like... you,

268
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,800
I like when you smile.

269
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,770
I like when you're laughing.

270
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,970
I like when we're together.

271
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,140
I like when you're sulking with me.

272
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,480
I like everything about you.

273
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,190
I've told you all of my feelings.

274
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,660
But I don't know how you feel about me.

275
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,360
But if you have the same feelings as mine...

276
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,730
then let's be boyfriends?

277
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,480
I am a very slow person.

278
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,850
If you have any feelings for me...

279
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,480
please be honest with me.

280
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,600
Well, I...

281
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,770
Gawin, Cho, What are you doing?

282
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,340
Today is your birthday, Cho?

283
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,480
You never told me,

284
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,780
And you remember Cho's birthday.

285
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,550
Of course, I never forget.

286
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:00,490
Well...

287
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,860
You guys are very close
seeing that you remember it.

288
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,230
Anyway, what brings you here?

289
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,630
I forgot something,
so I came back to get it.

290
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,770
P'Tos got hit by a car, will you go visit him?

291
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,270
Everyone already visited him.

292
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,270
I will.

293
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,310
Then I better get my things first..

294
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,920
What the heck?

295
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,790
We don't know his answer.

296
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:34,690
Exactly.

297
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,180
Open your mouth, Uncle.

298
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,980
You feed me too fast...

299
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,320
I didn't get a chance to swallow.

300
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,090
Such a nagging,

301
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,920
You even feed him.

302
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,930
He hurt his hand,
so he can't eat by himself.

303
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,830
I want some fruit.

304
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,840
Eat them yourself,
I don't want to feed you anymore.

305
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,140
What the heck?

306
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,110
Just feed him. What are you shy about?

307
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,180
I'm not shy, P'.

308
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,410
Don't tell me...

309
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,820
that P'Tos and Tin are..

310
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,590
No, there's nothing.

311
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:41,620
Ai'Tin.

312
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,790
We need to talk about this.

313
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,860
P'Gawin, there is nothing.

314
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,960
I don't buy it.

315
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,030
Ai'Cho and I gonna leave now.

316
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,470
We've been here for too long now.

317
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,330
P'Tos can rest now.

318
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,370
We're gonna head home now.

319
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,010
Speed recovery, P'.

320
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,950
Uncle.

321
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,950
Why didn't you say anything?

322
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,050
What am I suppose to say?

323
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,690
Deny them, of course.

324
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,330
Deny them of what?

325
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,430
P'Gawin and P'Cho...

326
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,530
they both think that we're boyfriends,

327
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,040
And you don't think so?

328
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,270
Think of what?

329
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,510
That's crazy.

330
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,350
I'm gonna go for shower.

331
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,510
The think that you asked me today...

332
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,980
I'm not rushing for your answer.

333
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,080
Think about it carefully before you answer.

334
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,720
I know that you...

335
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,820
like P'Tin very much.

336
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,090
I myself like him too.

337
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,160
Do you want another father?

338
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,600
Uncle likes me?

339
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,000
He wants to hit on me?

340
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,340
What should I do?4

341
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:25,410
Who were you talking to? A fling of yours?

342
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,040
Nonsense. I was talking to my mother.

343
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,950
Dude.

344
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,320
If let say that one
day a guy is hitting on you...

345
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,990
what would you do?

346
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,520
Wait.

347
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,990
Don't tell me that a guy is hitting on you?

348
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,090
Well...

349
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,260
me and my childhood friend...

350
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,630
we...

351
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,730
agreed to be boyfriends.

352
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,340
Help!

353
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,600
Help!

354
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,070
What's that noise?
I heard it even from outside.

355
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,980
Help!

356
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:00,510
Vee, what are you doing?
