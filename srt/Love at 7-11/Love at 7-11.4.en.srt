1
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,150
His taking too long showering.

2
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,740
He's taking a bath but no sound.

3
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,250
Then, I'll be coming in.

4
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,170
You crazy kid, Why did you come in?

5
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,640
You're taking your time masturbating.

6
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,540
So, are you finished yet?

7
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,050
Get out.

8
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,020
Why do you come in? Get out!

9
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,850
Hurry up, will you? I'm hungry.

10
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,520
Do you want some this?

11
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,050
Let me do it.

12
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,720
Stay still.

13
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,650
I'll take it off for you.

14
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,960
Girl, did you see that?

15
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,730
Of course I see it.

16
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,470
Very clearly, I'm not blind.

17
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,670
Thank you.

18
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,210
Don't mention it.

19
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,780
What are you smiling at?

20
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,080
Hurry up and go for your motorcycle run.

21
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,450
Are you chasing me
away immediately after I finished?

22
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,050
I told you that I
can come here by myself.

23
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,890
No way, I want to give you a ride.

24
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,360
Come, let's go to work.

25
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,130
Get inside then.

26
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,200
I'm going now.

27
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,780
Girl...

28
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,150
This corfirm my suspicious all these while.

29
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,050
What are you suspicious about? Where?

30
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,490
I suspect that P'Gawin is hitting on P'Cho.

31
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,520
But, P'Cho said it was nothing.

32
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,630
And now...

33
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,360
they're probably dating.

34
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,500
Two good looking guys are eating each other!

35
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,170
You're thinking too much.

36
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,540
Thing is, they were close
friend since they were a kid.

37
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,570
One of the just give
the other a ride to work.

38
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,110
There's nothing strange about it.

39
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,740
Are good friends be so ambiguous?

40
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,710
Something fishy's going on..

41
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,250
Here comes another couple! Hide!

42
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,910
Hide, quick, Hide, hide.

43
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,630
What's that?

44
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,100
Pouched eggs.

45
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,030
For what?

46
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,570
Well, yesterday you were sweating too much.

47
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,340
So the eggs is for your supplement.

48
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,740
D. That's crazy!

49
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,980
How can you say that in front of the kid?!

50
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,410
Don't tell me that you will take
my son out to motorcycle run today?

51
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,020
No, I never done that.

52
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,650
I just bring Scale to play with the
people at the motorcycle run station.

53
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,150
I don't even take him to a motorcycle run.

54
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,760
Are you certain?

55
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,290
Yes...

56
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,330
Don't let me caught you otherwise.

57
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,990
I'll be going now.

58
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,000
Strongskid. Be a good boy.

59
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,130
Bye-bye.

60
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,980
Did you hear that?

61
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,710
What did P'Tos do last night
that he needs a pouched eggs for?

62
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,180
I know, he's doing an exercise.

63
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,620
He'll definitely sweat a lot when exercising,

64
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,260
Do really think he's doing an exercise?

65
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,390
If he's not doing exercise...

66
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,160
how can he be sweating a lot?

67
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,300
Do you really think that
he actually doing exercise?

68
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,270
P'Tos is not just sweating...

69
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:40,240
but also excreting another liquid.

70
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,140
Don't tell me that P'Tos...

71
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,240
and that motorcycle run guy is having an "action"?

72
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,080
Just imagine...

73
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,880
it's like a Y-series.

74
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,020
A mature mini mart guy
with a handsome motorcycle guy.

75
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,590
So cute!

76
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,590
So fin!

77
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,730
OK, P'.

78
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,460
Sure thing.

79
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,530
I will transfer the money to you this evening.

80
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,700
Are you gambling again?

81
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,410
No, P'.

82
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,840
I just...

83
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,280
Are you going to lie to me again?

84
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:55,850
Yes.

85
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,520
I can't myself, sorry.

86
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,880
I have a debt.

87
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,390
It's an old debt, isn't it? And you almost
get killed by those debt collector.

88
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,820
This time me and P'Art will never

89
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,860
Why is she furious at you?

90
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,190
I only went to the toilet for a short while.

91
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:11,830
What happened?

92
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,660
Ai'Wai here is gambling again.

93
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,630
Then, continue scolding him,

94
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,270
Oh, P'Gawin.

95
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,770
You deserve it for getting into debt.

96
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,210
I just can't help it.

97
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,610
Then, should I smack your head once?

98
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,950
Ang, we have a customer,

99
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,850
Let Ai'Wai have this one.
You needed money, didn't you?

100
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,220
Why are you still standing there?

101
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,790
Are you going to settle your debt or get
smacking the head? You're still not going?

102
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,230
Her Chinese series is coming now.

103
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,860
Ai'Wai, hurry and go.

104
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,960
Before Ang cut off your leg with a sword.

105
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,760
Wanna go now?

106
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,960
I'll go, I'll go.

107
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,250
Is P'Tos still hiring you?

108
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,290
The thing is, P'.

109
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,260
He asked me to moved over with him now.

110
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,730
I don't need to pay the rent, it's a good thing.

111
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,030
How can he trusted you that much?

112
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,630
Oh, P'.

113
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,670
I've been taking good care of his child.

114
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,800
So, where is his wife?

115
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,800
Why is he hiring you this long?

116
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,370
His wife is not coming back anymore.

117
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,280
abandon her child like that?

118
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,150
She even doesn't think about her child?

119
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,280
Exactly.

120
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,650
I pity Scale.

121
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,720
But it's all right, Scale.

122
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,750
P'Tin is always here with you.

123
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,260
I just remembered...

124
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,230
P'Art is definitely went off flirting
some girls. He hasn't come to work yet.

125
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,660
You'll be sorry when I see him,

126
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,880
Here's your change, 960. Please check them,

127
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,790
I'm sorry.

128
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,750
The change is not enough.

129
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,260
I don't think so.

130
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,060
How can that be?

131
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:26,000
I gave you 1000, so you should
give me back 960. But, here is only 460.

132
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,700
It's 500 short.

133
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,470
I already gave you all the change amount.

134
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,040
Did you dropped them, Auntie?

135
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,540
Are saying that I'm a liar?

136
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,410
What's wrong, P'Dao?

137
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,710
She said that I didn't
return enough change to her.

138
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,410
But, I'm certain that I did.

139
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,020
How is it enough?

140
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,850
It's 500 short.

141
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,950
Did you took the money for yourself?.

142
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,390
No.

143
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,520
Calm down, Auntie,

144
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:57,060
Did you recheck them properly?

145
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,200
Are you ganging up
on me telling me that I'm lying?

146
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,110
Excuse me, Auntie.

147
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,040
You are?

148
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,480
I'm the manager here.

149
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,180
Perfect timing.

150
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,350
Your employee didn't
give enough change to me.

151
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,720
It's 500 short.

152
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,820
P'Tos, I already gave the
enough amount. It's all done.

153
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,960
Are you sure?

154
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,960
Here! Take a look.

155
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,700
It's 460.

156
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,600
How can it be 460?

157
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,600
Give me the other 500.

158
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,040
Dao...

159
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,480
are you sure you're already
gave enough change to her?

160
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,650
It's all done, right?

161
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,350
l'm sure.

162
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,420
Then, here's what we're gonna do.

163
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,620
I'm going to check on the security camera.

164
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,660
Our store has a lot of built-in cameras.

165
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,860
I assure, if my employee made a mistake...

166
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,660
it will definitely see it.

167
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,360
Is that good for you?

168
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,570
Alright, Auntie. l'll check the camera.

169
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,770
Oh my, oh my.

170
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,710
I found it.

171
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,080
It's here in my bag.

172
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,550
I'm sorry.

173
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,010
It's here.

174
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,980
You found it?

175
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,480
Yes, I did.

176
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:31,390
That's how old people are, our eyes and
brain are not as good as they used to.

177
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,390
I'll be going now.

178
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,030
Wait, wait.

179
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,030
She doesn't want her rice?

180
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,160
Let me go after her.

181
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,010
You guys, be careful.

182
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,280
There are all kinds of scam these days.

183
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,350
Next time, when you're giving changes...

184
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,050
make sure to count them in front
of the customer, Slowly and accurately.

185
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,620
Understood?

186
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,790
Thank you so much, P'Tos,

187
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,250
Otherwise, we would definitely have lost 500.

188
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,560
That's alright. Get back to work.

189
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,580
Hurry

190
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,920
Why didn't you eat first?

191
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,490
We're living together,
so we have to eat together.

192
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,530
Why is it-too much?

193
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,430
You have to eat a lot.

194
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,830
You're too skinny.

195
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,570
Skinny?

196
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,070
I've gained too much-weight. You're the one who's skinny.

197
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,880
Me, skinny?

198
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,250
It's you who are a lot skinnier than me.

199
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,750
Really?

200
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,050
You dare sayithat you're fatter than me?

201
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,520
Even though I'm skinny...

202
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,590
but I'm handsome and desirable by women.

203
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,220
Where?

204
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,230
Where is the-handsome?

205
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,200
Here, of course.

206
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,530
The handsome is here.

207
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,050
How's that?

208
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,280
Did you see my handsomeness now?

209
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,180
Fine, fine,

210
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,490
If it's handsome then it is.

211
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,650
Hurry and eat.

212
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,590
Неу.

213
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,630
Eat a lot so that you'll shut up.

214
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,570
You're giving me vegetables, That's cute.

215
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,350
Delicious.

216
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,980
Eat quick, Then we can brush our teeth and go to bed,

217
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,850
Uncle, what are you going to do?

218
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,290
We're already this far.

219
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,560
What do you I'm going to do?

220
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,280
Uncle, what's wrong?

221
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,780
Is Scale waking up?

222
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,450
It's nothing.

223
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,290
Go ahead and sleep.

224
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,500
What am I drea

225
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,460
This is crazy.

226
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,770
Uncle, you're not going to take a ahower?

227
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,380
You've been staring at me.

228
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:21,950
You've been staring at me.

229
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,750
Who's staring at you?

230
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,920
That's ridiculous.

231
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,340
You can just:send me here.

232
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,700
Then, I'm gonna head home.

233
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,710
You're heading back or are you going
to take my son somewhere else?

234
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,710
You always know everything.

235
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,910
I'm just gonna take him to the motorcycle
run station, see my seniors and friends..

236
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,350
Sure.

237
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,480
But don't take too long.

238
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,720
Krub, Uncle.

239
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:05,860
Scale...

240
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,420
Be nice with the brother, don't be naughty.

241
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,830
I'll be home soon.

242
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,130
Where?

243
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,860
Scale, wave bye-bye to Papa.

244
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,070
Bye-bye.

245
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,240
Неу.

246
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,880
Garlic pork.

247
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,310
What's that suppose to mean?

248
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,650
Well, I wanted to eat garlic pork.

249
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,720
Cook for me today.

250
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,090
You're getting attached with my cooking.

251
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,920
Very well.

252
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,590
I'll cook it for you.

253
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,790
Hurry back then.

254
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,700
Absolutely.

255
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,050
Girl.

256
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,220
He said he's going to "strike" him.

257
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,290
I wish it were me.

258
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,360
Fatty, keep it down,
Don't say it out just keep it to your heart.

259
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,520
Am I too loud?

260
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,230
I'm sure now.

261
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,160
I'm sure, very sure,

262
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,730
Yes, those two are dating.

263
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,930
Girl, even though it's unfortunate...

264
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,300
but it is cute.

265
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,940
Two guys dating...

266
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,970
There's a even a baby.

267
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,610
So cute!

268
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,110
This is so sweet!

269
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,280
But...

270
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:35,950
Why?

271
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,150
what about P'Tot's wife?

272
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,510
Are they divorced?

273
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,090
I used to saw her send P'Tos to work before.

274
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,490
But where did she went to lately?

275
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,090
Whether they're divorced or not...

276
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,330
why don't we forget about that?

277
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,030
Why?

278
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,030
To work. We're screwed. Let's go.

279
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,960
Oh yeah!

280
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,440
Ņever learn.

281
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,210
Never learn at all.

282
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,510
You've been rejected for many times now.

283
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,210
Shut up!

284
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,320
Have you never heard that they say...

285
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,020
"Those with overbearing will dominates the world",

286
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,750
I'm still hoping..

287
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,330
But hoping for Vee,
you have to face with this reality.

288
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,730
I think Ai'Vee likes girls..

289
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,560
That's not true.

290
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,830
I still have hope that Vee likes guy.

291
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:31,670
Guy!

292
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,740
Gawin, Gawin,

293
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,650
A customer's here. You're up.

294
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,550
Hold it, P'. It's my turn.

295
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,190
Ai'Tin, don't tell me...

296
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,790
that you're going to that his son
with you on motorcycle run?

297
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,820
Correct.

298
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,630
Hold on.

299
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,130
Does he knows that you're
taking his kid for motorcycle run?

300
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,060
If he knows, I'll be dead already.

301
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,230
Then that means you're doing it in secret?

302
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,130
Come on, P'.

303
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,140
People always have a side job.

304
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,010
That way,
I can make money on both side.

305
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,910
Be careful not to get caught by him.

306
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,910
I have my own "auto" method.

307
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:24,320
You have to bring your
baby as well? That's pity.

308
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,090
We'reifinished with him,right?

309
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,620
I'm gonna continue crying,

310
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:30,430
What the heck?

311
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,460
I better continue watching my series.

312
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,670
The battery's drained.

313
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,670
I better go charge it.

314
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,360
Can we some norround here?

315
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,830
This is another one.

316
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,340
What is he sitting meditate for?

317
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,320
Yes,

318
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,250
I took off your shirt...

319
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,890
your pants...

320
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:33,020
and I've check every corner.

321
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,320
Every corner?

322
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,230
Don't tell me that you saw...

323
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,230
Yes, I've seen it.

324
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,300
I'm not gonna let
you alone seen mine.

325
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,310
Why did you went
shopping for so long?

326
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,680
I was so scared when
I saw you lying in blood.

327
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,650
Why?

328
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,490
Are you worried about me?

329
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,260
No.

330
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,460
I need your advise on something

331
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,660
It's definitely an emotional issue.

332
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,400
How do you know?

333
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,170
I don't know how you feel about me.

334
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,770
But if you have the
same feelings as mine...

335
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,110
then let's be boyfriends?
