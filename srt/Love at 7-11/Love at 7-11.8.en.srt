1
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:47,566
Are you alright, Cho?

2
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,667
I'm fine.

3
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,536
What are you doing?

4
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:53,539
P'Gawin, please help me...

5
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,642
What are you doing?

6
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,845
Let me hug you for a moment.

7
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,251
Hey, P'Art!

8
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:09,722
Yes, it's me.

9
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,757
How and why are you here?

10
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:16,295
I want you to give me a chance.

11
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,002
| If you said that...

12
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,271
give me time to think, OK?

13
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,241
When that time comes...

14
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:34,847
I'll let you know whether you're my first choice or not.

15
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,050
Auntie.

16
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,450
Surprise.

17
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,590
Auntie, please come in.

18
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,760
Ja.

19
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,760
Let's go.

20
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,960
I think if Cho...

21
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,360
stay with me...

22
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,100
won't that be better?

23
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,230
No.

24
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,630
Why not?

25
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,500
My room is more spacious.

26
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,170
It's be more comfortable.

27
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,980
Cho has been staying with me for a long time,
how can he suddenly move out?

28
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,580
What are you doing?

29
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,450
Pau?

30
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,260
Why are you here?

31
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,690
Hey, you.

32
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,130
Take your stuff back.

33
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,730
And from now on, don't come
near my husband and son again,

34
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,800
Tos.

35
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,800
I will not accept you having
someone else more important than me.

36
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,880
Tin is not just someone else.

37
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,550
But he is someone I love.

38
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,220
What you said, was it true?

39
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,050
Everything that I said, it's the truth.

40
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,560
Please hurry and agree.

41
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,190
So that I won't talk nonsense.

42
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,430
You said you'd give me time to think.

43
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,360
It's not even one day, Uncle.

44
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,810
Dinner's here, Tos.

45
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,950
How are you here?

46
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,050
Is the food ready, Papi?

47
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,790
Hold on, Uncle, What did you call me just now?

48
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,160
I called you Papi.

49
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,790
It's a practice just in case that one day...

50
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,860
you'll accept me as your boyfriend.

51
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,100
So, I'll have Scale call you Papi and call me Papa.

52
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,170
He'll be having 2 fathers.

53
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,610
What are you talking about?

54
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,010
You're being ridiculous.

55
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,680
Hurry up and accept me then.

56
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,450
That way, I won't talk nonsense.

57
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,680
You said, you'll give me time to think.

58
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,550
It's not even one day, Uncle.

59
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,460
For you...

60
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,660
it felt hurry.

61
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,730
But for me...

62
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,260
it's too long

63
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,160
You're exaggerating, Uncle.

64
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,140
Dinner is here, Toss.

65
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,740
How are you here, Pau?

66
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,480
Did you forget?

67
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,050
I used to stay here and
 I have the key to this room.

68
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,850
Come, let's have dinner.

69
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,020
No.

70
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,990
Tin is already cooking.

71
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,460
But the meal that I bought...

72
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,490
is definitely more delicious than what he's making.

73
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:40,530
Come.

74
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,260
No, let me go.

75
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,270
I'm gonna wait for Tin to finish his cooking.
You can go ahead and eat first.

76
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,540
If you want to eat, you can eat it yourself.

77
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,170
After you finish. give the key back.

78
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,510
What is this, Tos?

79
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,880
I'm not giving it back.

80
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,340
And tonight, I'll sleep here.

81
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,010
Then...

82
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,950
I think, I...

83
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,550
No Tin.

84
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,620
I already told you how I think and feel about you.

85
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,690
Then, I'll prepare the food and we can eat together.

86
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,570
It doesn't seem appetizing at all.

87
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,940
But I like it.

88
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,880
Sorry, I wasn't careful.

89
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,280
Can't eat it now.

90
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,420
Then, we should eat the meal that I've bought..

91
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,590
Tin.

92
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,400
Let's go have dinner outside. We can have a change of atmosphere too.

93
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,030
Come.

94
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,770
Tos.

95
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,530
Do you hate me that much?

96
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,340
I don't hate you.

97
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,740
But I hate what you're doing now.

98
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,950
Can you leave? I beg you.

99
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,150
I won't.

100
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,720
And I will sleep here tonight.

101
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,320
Fine.

102
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,150
If you want to stay here, then go ahead.

103
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,060
Me and Tin will sleep elsewhere.

104
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,560
Don't follow me.

105
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,230
Tos, Tos!

106
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,060
Where are you going, Toss?

107
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,630
You can't do this to me.

108
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,540
Is it hot? Let me help.

109
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,610
It's fine, P'.

110
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,540
It' the final two dishes.

111
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,180
We can eat these now.

112
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,680
Auntie...

113
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,080
There's too many.

114
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,150
I'll definitely go fat.

115
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,680
Don't be afraid to get fat. Eat them all.

116
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:45,632
Krub.

117
00:08:46,464 --> 00:08:48,448
I haven't had dinner with you for a long time now.

118
00:08:48,576 --> 00:08:49,760
I miss this so much.

119
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,810
Before, I used to come for dinner at Auntie's house.

120
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,880
I'm addicted to, Auntie's cooking.

121
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,650
When Cho was still working there,
he often took me home for dinner.

122
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,720
Hurry and eat.

123
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,760
If not, it'll get cold.

124
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,300
...Here, cho.

125
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,210
Cho, eat a lot.

126
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,480
Wait, wait.

127
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,650
My plate is full already.

128
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,050
My mother.

129
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,650
Today is your birthday, Mom.

130
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,290
You should please her.

131
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,320
Here you go, Auntie,

132
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,830
Here you go, Auntie.

133
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,430
I think you two are being weird.

134
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,830
Why are you trying to please my son?

135
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,300
It's nothing.

136
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,980
Gawin...

137
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,410
Ask Cho to come home often, I miss him.

138
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,150
He likes to leave me alone at home.

139
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,450
Back when he's there...

140
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,350
he never stay at home.

141
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,950
There...

142
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,720
he always sleep at P'San's house.

143
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,690
Never sleep at his own house!

144
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,400
Sleep at P'San's house?

145
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,300
Yes,Yes.

146
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,830
He went often too.

147
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,830
But sometimes..

148
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,740
I stayed overnight at his house.

149
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,070
Because I always have
to go back late at night.

150
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,280
Also, my house is quite far.

151
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,350
P'San's house happens to
be very near to the mini mart.

152
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,610
So, I went to stay at his house.

153
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,450
Besides...

154
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,190
I hate riding motorcycle
late at night, it's sleepy.

155
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,220
I told you to do day shift.

156
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,690
But you said that you want
to do part-time job in the morning.

157
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,360
Cho is a hardworking person. I like it.

158
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,330
I mean...

159
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,500
I like his hardworking behavior.

160
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,140
Auntie...

161
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,710
Gho is...

162
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
a restless sleeper.

163
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,540
He often grab me thinking me as a pillow.

164
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,180
That's right

165
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,850
When he was sleeping with me...

166
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,480
he probably think of me as his bolster.

167
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,620
He hugs me to a point that I can't breathe.

168
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,730
Let's eat cake.

169
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,700
Let me get the cake.

170
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,710
<i>Happy Birthday to you.</i>

171
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:41,750
<i>Happy Birthday to you.</i>

172
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:47,720
<i>Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday.</i>

173
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:56,160
<i>Happy Birthday to you.</i>

174
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,200
I have a present for you.

175
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,270
Hope you'll be in good health, and...

176
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,410
please stay with me for a long time.

177
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,410
Thank you so much, Cho.

178
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:10,580
Thank you so much, Gawin,
Thank you so much, Cho.

179
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,610
Thank you so much, Gawin,

180
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,840
Here, may you have everlasting happiness,

181
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,880
Thank you so much, San.

182
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,810
Krub.

183
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,260
Then, I'm gonna excuse myself.

184
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,060
Thank you so much for coming, San.

185
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,700
My pleasure.

186
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,360
Sawasdee krub.

187
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,130
OK, let me send you off.

188
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,170
Ок.

189
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
I'm leaving now, Gawin.

190
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,800
Krub.

191
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,670
Let's go.

192
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,450
What's wrong, Gawin?

193
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,620
Nothing.

194
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,520
Auntie, let me do the dishes first.

195
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:01,960
Ок.

196
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:20,040
Where have you been last night?
Why didn't you come home?

197
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,550
Because you're here.

198
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,810
So I took Tin and my
son to sleep somewhere else.

199
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,890
You think I won't give
up when you're doing this?

200
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,120
That's enough, Praw.

201
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,890
I'm sick of saying this.

202
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,890
I won't get back to you no matter what.

203
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,700
The reason you don't want to get back to me...

204
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,030
Don't tell me that you're dating this kid.

205
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,840
Yes.

206
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,010
The two of us are dating.

207
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,310
I'm gonna ask you for real.

208
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,450
Do you think dating this kid will last long?

209
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,520
How are you going to tell your son?

210
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,620
Aren't you embarrass
of how others will look at you?

211
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,890
Whether it'll last long or not,
that's our problem.

212
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,260
Besides, I'm not
embarrassed with other people.

213
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
Love is not something
to be embarrassed about.

214
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,170
Don't worry about how l'll tell my son.

215
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,670
Let's just say...

216
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,810
I have my own way.

217
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,380
I'm not gonna let you date this kid...

218
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,410
and I'm not going anywhere either.

219
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,680
Fine.

220
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,380
Stay here if you want.

221
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,450
I can move out.

222
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:37,420
If you follow me there, I'll move out again.

223
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,590
The two of us are not
gonna be together anymore.

224
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,730
That means, you won't come
back to me no matter what I do?

225
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,160
Yes.

226
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,630
Your chance...

227
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,070
is gone from the day
you abandon me and my son.

228
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,470
Do you understand?

229
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:01,580
I don't believe that the
love you have for him is real.

230
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,110
One day...

231
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,380
you will come back to me.

232
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,720
You'll see.

233
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:20,400
But, I believe that my love for you...

234
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,730
But, I believe that my love for you... is real.

235
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,830
What about you?

236
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,100
Do you belive it?

237
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,070
Uncle, what are you doing?

238
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,640
Not in front of Scale.

239
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,180
Come, Scale.

240
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,750
Let me give you a hug.

241
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,220
You're gonna be sorry, Uncle.

242
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,750
Who's gonna be "sorry" I wonder.

243
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,760
We should get something eat, OK, Scale?

244
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,810
Cho, where's Auntie?

245
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,280
Mom went to the market.

246
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,020
What are you doing?

247
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,720
Hugging you, of course.

248
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,690
Let me now or my mom will see us,

249
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,930
Auntie hasn't come back from the market yet.

250
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,940
What are you two doing?

251
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,710
Drying my hair, Mom,

252
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,720
What are you buying so many, Auntie?

253
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,160
You two are boyfriends, right?

254
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,470
Mom.

255
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,070
Don't lie to me!

256
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,840
Do you think I don't know?!

257
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:12,810
Ever since last night,
then there's that photo you sent me.

258
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,810
Which friends hugging from the
back and take a photo like that.

259
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,990
Yes, Auntie.

260
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,320
The two of us are dating.

261
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,490
But please don't tell us to break up.

262
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,900
You can hate all you want.

263
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,370
But please...

264
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
don't hate Cho.

265
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,840
Do you think this will last?

266
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,870
Are you not embarrassed?

267
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,340
Not care about what others thinks?

268
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,210
We don't know...

269
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,380
whether we'll last long or not.

270
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,750
But we will try our every day...

271
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,350
to make it the best out of it.

272
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,920
As for the people around us...

273
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,230
how they would perceive and look at us...

274
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,190
we don't care.

275
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,500
We just care about you.

276
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,700
What do you feel about this.

277
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,170
Yes.

278
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,940
We only care about how you'd feel.

279
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,170
What do you think I'd feel about this?

280
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,380
You may not be able accept...

281
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,250
that your only son...

282
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,980
have a boyfriend.

283
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,550
You knew, then why
are you still dating him.

284
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:34,090
Because we love each other, Auntie.

285
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,660
I'm sorry.

286
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,070
Why are you apologizing?

287
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,070
Are you doing anything wrong?

288
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,210
Well...

289
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,740
I never said anything...

290
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,980
about prohibiting you two dating.

291
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,350
I'm instead glad...

292
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,650
that it's Gawin.

293
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,080
If it were someone else...

294
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,720
it would be difficult for me to accept.

295
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,720
You're not mad, aren't you?

296
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,520
Why must I be mad?

297
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,890
You guys love each other,
so I must be happy.

298
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,660
You can tell?

299
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,200
How my son is
and what you like, why can't I tell?

300
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,170
Thank you, Auntie.

301
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,980
Thank you.

302
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,120
Thank you.

303
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,020
You still have one thing to clear up.

304
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,990
You have to clear this up with P'San.

305
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,760
Because I can tell that San...

306
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,600
likes you, Cho,

307
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,850
What's the matter?

308
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,430
What's wrong, Tin?

309
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,570
Tin, tell me what's wrong. Answer me.

310
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,580
Don't you get it yet?

311
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,350
Get what?

312
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,850
I agreed.

313
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,390
Agreed for what?

314
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,730
Agreed to be your boyfriend.

315
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,220
Now that we're boyfriends...

316
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,330
you can stop calling me "Uncle".

317
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,300
It's kinda attached now.

318
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,176
Don't,

319
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,740
How about next time...

320
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,610
jus call me Tos.

321
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,320
Wait, what are you doing?

322
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,890
Doing what boyfriends would do,

323
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
Stop, you'll wake Scale.

324
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,960
P'San.

325
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:31,490
I need to tell you something.

326
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,200
What is it?

327
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,600
Me and Gawin...

328
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,330
the two of us are...

329
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,740
No need say anything.

330
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,370
This morning, I heard everything.

331
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,740
I heard everything.

332
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,540
But I need to say something to Gawin.

333
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,980
Even though Cho is your boyfriend...

334
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,450
I will not stop loving Cho.

335
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,420
If;when you make Cho sad...

336
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,290
I will always be ready to take care of Cho.

337
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,264
I would never do that.

338
00:23:04,432 --> 00:23:05,936
I hope you can keep your word!

339
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,208
Cho...

340
00:23:09,408 --> 00:23:10,400
It seems that I...

341
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,480
fail to reach your heart.

342
00:23:14,096 --> 00:23:15,488
But don't you worry.

343
00:23:16,176 --> 00:23:17,760
I'll be minding my own business.

344
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,144
I wont bother you.

345
00:23:23,104 --> 00:23:24,416
I'm gonna go now.

346
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,200
I'm so happy

347
00:23:40,608 --> 00:23:42,170
What are you happy about?

348
00:23:42,816 --> 00:23:45,900
I'm happy that you mom understands us.

349
00:23:48,448 --> 00:23:50,510
I love my mom so much.

350
00:23:51,504 --> 00:23:53,310
Mom will never stop me...

351
00:23:54,672 --> 00:23:56,210
if I didn't do anything wrong.

352
00:23:57,104 --> 00:23:58,224
At first...

353
00:23:58,752 --> 00:24:00,050
I was afraid that...

354
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,490
Mom would think that our love...

355
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,290
is wrong.

356
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,460
But now...

357
00:24:08,224 --> 00:24:09,552
I understand...

358
00:24:10,064 --> 00:24:11,232
that love...

359
00:24:12,336 --> 00:24:14,128
has nothing to do with gender.

360
00:24:16,256 --> 00:24:19,248
Your mom is so cool, you know?

361
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,352
What are you doing?

362
00:24:24,512 --> 00:24:25,744
Someone will see us.

363
00:24:27,872 --> 00:24:29,136
No one will see us.

364
00:24:29,584 --> 00:24:31,072
They all went to bed.

365
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,650
What are you doing?

366
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,020
What a night.

367
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:15,660
I thought of following to ask you
to go to bed but it's not necessary now.

368
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,110
l saw that.

369
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,430
Scale.

370
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,500
Stay with Papa for awhile.

371
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,300
I need to go to class.

372
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,710
Don't be naughty.

373
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,710
Papa has a lot of work.

374
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:08,840
Come.

375
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,920
You...

376
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,090
You must pay attention in class.

377
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:18,620
Be a good example.

378
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,590
Understand?

379
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,390
Don't waste your time pick up and send off girls.

380
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:23,630
Understand?

381
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,330
Don't think that I don't know.

382
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,270
I've already took care
of all the girls that LINE you.

383
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,440
They are just friends.

384
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,870
Being all possessive like that...

385
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:39,380
don't you have any sympathy
with those who are single?

386
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,880
That's right, I'm so envious,

387
00:26:42,448 --> 00:26:44,980
Tin is so good that he's
flirting around while having a boyfriend.

388
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,016
Here's what I'm gonna do.

389
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,420
Gawin.

390
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,990
l'll leave him under your care.

391
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,220
If you catch he's giving a ride to some girls...

392
00:26:54,464 --> 00:26:55,296
let me know.

393
00:26:56,816 --> 00:26:57,690
Krub.

394
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
P'Tos, you may asking the wrong person..

395
00:27:00,112 --> 00:27:01,530
Ai'Gawin is an adult.

396
00:27:01,648 --> 00:27:03,130
It might be him who's giving those girls a ride.

397
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,770
That's not true, P'Tos,

398
00:27:05,168 --> 00:27:07,940
How can I have time to give a ride to some
girls, my boyfriend is in the same class,

399
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,810
That's enough of this.

400
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,540
It's getting too sweet now around here.

401
00:27:14,128 --> 00:27:16,980
Hurry and go to class now. If not, ants
gonna swarm in front of the mini mart.

402
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,176
True.

403
00:27:22,256 --> 00:27:24,290
Tin, come here.

404
00:27:28,304 --> 00:27:30,260
Uncle! What are you doing?!

405
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,272
It's embarrassing.

406
00:27:34,096 --> 00:27:37,230
What to shy about?
It's all our people only here.

407
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:40,700
That couple is so sweet.

408
00:27:40,912 --> 00:27:42,510
How can our couple admit defeat like this?

409
00:27:44,112 --> 00:27:45,632
Don't. It's prohibited.

410
00:27:47,696 --> 00:27:52,210
Go ahead and "eat" each other. No need to
leave some for the ladies like us. Right, E'Khet?

411
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,504
Hold on. everyone.

412
00:27:53,712 --> 00:27:58,050
So, P'Toss and N'Tin, Also, Gawin
and N'Cho. They're both boyfriends?

413
00:28:20,592 --> 00:28:22,384
He's going now.

414
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,296
Say bye-bye.

415
00:28:23,456 --> 00:28:26,240
Bye-bye.

416
00:28:28,224 --> 00:28:29,696
Scale.

417
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,180
They're gone now.

418
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,940
Now here's another couple.

419
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,670
It looks like the two of us should be dating now.

420
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,380
Don't, E'Ket. I'm gonna grind the sky to
bring down the thunder and strikes you.

421
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,380
If the two of us get married...

422
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,420
I'd feel sorry for our child's appearance.

423
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,020
Pity for the child.

424
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,490
Let's go.

425
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,320
I don't what's going on with the door
lately. I have to open it myself now.

426
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,390
Did I miss something?

427
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,630
Are they really are dating?

428
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,400
Everyone.

429
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,610
Prepare yourself,
we are celebrating couples day today.

430
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,070
And couple whose
still trying to win each others.

431
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:46,310
hat 7-11 and motorbike runner team...

432
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,580
will definitely not lose to each other.

433
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,920
Why it that, Tem?

434
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:54,150
Because so that 7-11
will win a son-in-law.

435
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,360
And motorcycle runner
can also win a son-in law.

436
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,990
Then that means, each will get one.

437
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:03,660
As for that one couple, we'll wait and see...

438
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,430
what will happen next.

439
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,170
Whether the 7-11 girl will give her
heart to the motorcycle runner or not.

440
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,840
So, now let's go!

441
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,610
Go!

442
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,940
Let's go!

443
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,540
Why are you not going yet?

444
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,180
The motorbike won't start.
Get down and push.

445
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,950
What the heck?

446
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,270
Go.

447
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,070
Ready?

448
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:25,730
Go.

449
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,740
Go now.

450
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,310
Ready, Uncle?

451
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,310
Ready.

452
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,540
Ready?

453
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:45,960
Hold on to me tightly.

454
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:47,320
I'm gonna ride fast.

455
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,630
No need, just take it easy.

456
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,560
Why?

457
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,090
You want to hug me so badly?

458
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,700
I'm getting too bored hugging you.

459
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,130
I'm thinking about...

460
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,770
sleeping separately from you.

461
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,170
Never

462
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,500
If you sleep separately, you'll be sorry.
