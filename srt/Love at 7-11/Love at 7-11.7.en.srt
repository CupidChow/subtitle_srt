1
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,990
I have the same feeling as you..

2
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,100
I agree to be your boyfriend.

3
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,900
Really?! Are you being serious?

4
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,600
You can't take back your word.

5
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,010
Smiling like that, meaning you're agreed?

6
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,370
Then that means...

7
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,350
you're giving permission for me to flirt P'Tin, right?

8
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,250
Uncle likes me?

9
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,650
He wants to hit on me?

10
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,850
What should I do?

11
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,860
Yeah, yeah.

12
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,720
Mom ask to take a photo for her.

13
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,330
Is that a good idea?

14
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:22,730
Of course.

15
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,830
Why?

16
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,300
Nothing, nothing.

17
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,970
Make sure it shows the whole body.

18
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,710
Yeah, dude.

19
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,310
If let's say one day
a guy come hit on you...

20
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,840
what would you do?

21
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,950
I don't know, I never had a guy flirt me.

22
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,310
How should i know?

23
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,180
Exactly

24
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,020
But I think...

25
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,490
whoever we like and love...

26
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,260
that's for us to decide.

27
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,660
You don't have
to ask around like this, buddy.

28
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,260
Bastard. The hell with like.

29
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,760
Might get a punch from me.

30
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,270
Well...

31
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,340
me and my childhood friend....

32
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,710
we...

33
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,940
agreed to be lovers.

34
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,810
Which friend? Do we know them?

35
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,310
Let me meet them.

36
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,620
P'San?!

37
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,150
Oh, N' cho.

38
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,720
I miss you.

39
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,450
Why are you here?

40
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,020
Well, I...

41
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,690
I have a lover now!

42
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,730
It's the person you asked my advise for, right?

43
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,760
Yeah, that's right.

44
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,870
Yes, it's...

45
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,570
He agreed.

46
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,570
| A heart shape too.

47
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,570
I'm giving you my heart. Do you want it?

48
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,480
Do joke around like this too often.

49
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,240
I would think you mean it..

50
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,750
I would've think that you're serious.

51
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,990
Walk carefully and be careful.

52
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:02,600
I won't slip because my stability is...

53
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,940
Are you alright, Cho?

54
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,170
l'm fine.

55
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,070
Be more careful.

56
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,640
I'm not always there to catch you.

57
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,210
What are you doing?

58
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,180
P'Gawin, please help me...

59
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,380
What are you doing?

60
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,890
P'San caught me.

61
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,050
It's nothing.

62
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,530
I think a war is about to break out for sure.

63
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,360
Why?

64
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,200
Can't I help Cho?

65
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,440
I don't mind at all.

66
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,800
Thank you...

67
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,970
for helping my "close friend".

68
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,240
Don't mention it.

69
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,410
Because N'Cho here is...

70
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,010
my close junior of mine too.

71
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,850
But me and Cho...

72
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,990
are close since we were kids.

73
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,650
Is that so?

74
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:06,130
Because back when Cho
was working in the previous branch.

75
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,490
Cho was closest to me.

76
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,100
He even spend nights at my house.

77
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,170
Hey.

78
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,640
If you don't stop bickering...

79
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,140
I'm not gonna close with anyone then.

80
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,780
Who's bickering?

81
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,850
Right, right. We aren't bickering,

82
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,180
So you are a close friend of Cho?

83
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,120
So you are a close senior of Cho?

84
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,690
Nice to meet you.

85
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,390
Yes, nice to meet you too.

86
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,230
Wonderful. It's so wonderful.

87
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,930
True. Why there's no man
who's willing to fight over me?

88
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,060
You look at our face.

89
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,000
Sorry, I thought that I
have some form of importance.

90
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,340
Can you help me stand?

91
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,600
You fatty.

92
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,780
Cho looks happy today.

93
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,910
As expected from someone in love.

94
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,610
P'Dau...

95
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,850
you really cares and
worried about everyone.

96
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,790
Aren't you tired?

97
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,020
No, why?

98
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:10,960
Nothing.

99
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,600
My hair grows covering my eyes again.

100
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,010
If I don't swipe it up...

101
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,170
I can't see anything.

102
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,280
But you just cut it last week.

103
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,440
Probably you need to
cut it even shorter next time.

104
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,880
What are smiling at?

105
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,920
Nothing, I was
thinking of something nonsense.

106
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,220
If you don't cut your hair too often...

107
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,790
let it grow long...

108
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,630
and apply some makeup.

109
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,560
You would be very beautiful.

110
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,130
So why didn't
keep your hair long like before?

111
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,940
Long hair.

112
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,510
is too difficult to handle.

113
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,810
Before I decided to cut them short...

114
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,280
I wanted to change myself.

115
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,310
I want people to recognize me.

116
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,020
I don't want to appear weak.

117
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,650
Don't want to shed tears needlessly.

118
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:23,100
I concealed it within this "mask" every time.

119
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,900
When I wake up. it didn't solve anything.

120
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,010
I've decided now.

121
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,510
I want to keep my hair long.

122
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:40,980
Really?

123
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:50,760
Vee, I'll be back, Wait for me for a moment,

124
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,230
Don't forget, this is the best chance.

125
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,770
No problem.

126
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,860
P'Dau...

127
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,160
let me hug you.

128
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,630
Let me hug you for a moment.

129
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,400
Hey, P'Art!

130
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,570
Yes it's me.

131
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,670
How and why are you here?

132
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,180
I want you to give me a chance.

133
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,310
I don't know...

134
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,320
who you have in you heart.

135
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,260
But l really like you.

136
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,460
You may like someone...

137
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,000
who is better than me.

138
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,970
But I am ready...

139
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,300
to prove to you...

140
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,640
that I can take care of you.

141
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,880
I know...

142
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,910
that you have feelings for me.

143
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,850
But, right now...

144
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,090
I'm not ready to have someone.

145
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,820
Then when...

146
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,200
Will you be ready?

147
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,820
I don't know.

148
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,100
I know...

149
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,000
I think...

150
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,410
I can wait.

151
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,570
No worries.

152
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,450
If you said that...

153
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,550
give me time to think, OK?

154
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,620
When that time comes...

155
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,430
I'll let you know whether
you're my first choice or not.

156
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,790
Oh, Mom.

157
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,250
Surprise!

158
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,360
Sawasdee krub, Auntie.

159
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,590
Sawasdee ja.

160
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,160
Gawin, you look more handsome in real life
compare to the picture that Cho sent to me,

161
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,500
You didn't call first before coming.

162
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
I was about to go and visit you.

163
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,540
You don't have to.

164
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,300
I'm here now.

165
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,640
P'San, even you didn't
tell me that Mom is here.

166
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,010
Because she won't let me to.

167
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,440
Auntie, please come inside.

168
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,480
Ja.

169
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,410
Come, come, Mom.

170
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,010
Let's go.

171
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,450
I miss so much.

172
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,530
The room looks tidy and clean.

173
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,730
I thought it would be more chaotic
for two big boys to live together.

174
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,300
It can't get dirty, Auntie.

175
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,140
Cho will scold me.

176
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,370
He even scold me if I
didn't put things in order.

177
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,740
But I think...

178
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,510
this room is too small.

179
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,150
I think if Cho...

180
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,580
stay with me...

181
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,320
won't that be better?

182
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,390
No.

183
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:40,950
Why not?

184
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,690
My room is more spacious.

185
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,290
It's be more comfortable.

186
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,330
Cho has been staying with me for a long
time, how can he suddenly move out?

187
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,730
I think you should stop fighting.

188
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,740
Ask Cho where he wants to stay.

189
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:59,970
You choose then, Cho,

190
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,070
Stay with me is better.

191
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,580
It's more comfortable.

192
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,680
I think...

193
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,420
it's better I stay here, it's chill.

194
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,390
Here.

195
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,990
You forgot about this photo.

196
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,460
San's photo. You left it at home.

197
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,030
Oh, krub.

198
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,340
I'm sad.

199
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,270
You forgot about my photo.

200
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,610
Because it's not important.

201
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,140
Gawin!

202
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,010
Hold this for me,
I need to go to the bathroom.

203
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,280
Sure.

204
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:57,100
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

205
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,870
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

206
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:05,140
<i>Happy birthday, happy birthday,</i>

207
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:09,980
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

208
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,510
Blow the cake!

209
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,050
All done.

210
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,390
Blow the candle.

211
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,330
I have a present for you, Scale.

212
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,230
Do you like it?

213
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,530
Do you like it, Scale?

214
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,530
Неу.

215
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,570
Where did you get this?

216
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,900
Did you earn enough salary to buy this?

217
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,970
It's the money you gave me.

218
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,810
Scale is a handsome motorbike taxi rider.

219
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,510
So he has to wear the rider uniform.

220
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,250
You're so thoughtful.

221
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:47,550
Right?

222
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,750
I saw it on Facebook, it looks cute.

223
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,350
I want Scale to wear it.

224
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,320
Do you like it, Scale? Do you like it?

225
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,990
Smiling like this, that means you like it.

226
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,420
You like it, right? Then...

227
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,290
Let's eat cake!

228
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,730
Too slow, Uncle!

229
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:08,870
Scale.

230
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,210
Wait for me a moment,
I need to take care of this, OK?

231
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,240
Let me take care of this.

232
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,280
Uncle, what are you gonna do?

233
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,210
I'm gonna slam cake to your face!

234
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,620
Uncle, what are you doing?!

235
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,550
I'm gonna slam cake to your face!

236
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,040
What are you doing?

237
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,070
Pau?

238
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,680
Why are you here?

239
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,010
I'm here to see you.

240
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,610
What were you doing just now?

241
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,080
Who is this kid?

242
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,690
Why are you back?

243
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,420
I'm here for you and my son, of course.

244
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,620
So...

245
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,630
It's your birthday today, right?

246
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,860
l'll excuse myself then.

247
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,400
Ja.

248
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,400
That way I can have private conversation with Tos.

249
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,340
Don't, Tin,

250
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,410
I don't have anything to say to her.

251
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,210
Tos, but I really want to talk to you.

252
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,120
Talk with her first.

253
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,520
I'll wait outside.

254
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,250
I'm gonna go to the market...

255
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,650
to buy dinner.

256
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,790
Of course, l'll take you there.

257
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,090
Yes.

258
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,920
It will be my treat, Auntie.

259
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,360
That's alright.

260
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,930
San already said that he'll take me there.

261
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,630
Let's go, Auntie.

262
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,570
Ja, let's go.

263
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,870
By the way...

264
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,870
you two wait in the room, OK?

265
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,510
Thank you,

266
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,330
You said you didn't have feelings for him.

267
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,760
Then what is this?

268
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,200
Keeping his photo in front of me.

269
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,200
Calm down.

270
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,370
It doesn't mean anything.

271
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,710
Doesn't mean anything?

272
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,810
Why do you keep his photo?

273
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,450
Because he gave it to me.

274
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,080
I really don't have any feelings for him.

275
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,950
How do you expect me to believe you?

276
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,370
It really is nothing.

277
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,200
I don't have feelings for P'San.

278
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,970
He gave it to me...

279
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,180
because I got transfer to a new work place.

280
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,050
Don't be mad at me.

281
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,120
Cho.

282
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,390
Yes, Mom?

283
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,320
Are you going to bed already?

284
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,760
Just a little tired, Auntie.

285
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,960
Gawin is very tired, Mom.

286
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,270
Is there anything you want?

287
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,440
I forgot my purse.

288
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,170
Just hand me my hand bag.

289
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,580
Grab it for me.

290
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,510
I'll go now.

291
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,410
Ок.

292
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,880
ОК.

293
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,220
Continue sleep then.

294
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,920
I'm not sleepy anymore.

295
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,230
The door, the door.

296
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,200
Does it hurt bad?

297
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,210
Of course it is.

298
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,340
Where?

299
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,110
My nose, look at it.

300
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,680
I'm sorry.

301
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,420
Cho!

302
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,960
You said you're not sleepy anymore.

303
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,290
Just lying down, Auntie.

304
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,360
Is there anything you want?

305
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,100
I want to ask if you want to eat
anything in particular, l'll buy it for you.

306
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,400
Anything will do, Mom.

307
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,910
But I think...

308
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,870
let us all go together.

309
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,310
That way, we can choose ourselves.

310
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,810
OK, come, come.

311
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,320
What's wrong with him, P'?

312
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,260
Heartbroken for sure.

313
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,800
Hey, you.

314
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,270
Take your stuff back.

315
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,840
And from now on. don't come
near my husband and son again.

316
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,270
I'm gonna emphasize it again.

317
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,310
Don't come near my husband and son again.

318
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,640
Hey, madam!

319
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,350
He never approach your husband and child.

320
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,450
It's your husband who
hired him to look after his son.

321
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,820
And you, what kind of a mother are you?

322
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,450
Abandon your husband and son.

323
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,020
So why are you here now?

324
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,560
Why are you causing ruckus now?

325
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,130
Hey, you,

326
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,430
- Who are you to talk like that to me?!
- Talk nicely, Praw.

327
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,770
You have no right to chase away my nong.

328
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,070
I think we cleared that up.

329
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,640
Tos.

330
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:21,570
I told you that I will take
care of you and our child.

331
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,010
I rather not.

332
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:27,950
Tos.

333
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,250
Don't you remember?

334
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,620
I used to hold our child...

335
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,790
kneel and begged you to come back to us.

336
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,060
What did you do?

337
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,190
You chased us away like pigs and dogs.

338
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,430
Tos...

339
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,330
I wasn't in my right mind then.

340
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:51,070
But now, I get it. I know was wrong.

341
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:53,910
Know you're wrong?

342
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,410
You know you're wrong...

343
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,110
or you don't have anywhere else to go?

344
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,050
The same person who chased us away...

345
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,820
now came here to find me and our son!

346
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,920
Let me tell you that a person like me...

347
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,860
is the type that hurts and never forget.

348
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,200
Tin.

349
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,360
Let's go home.

350
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,230
Come.

351
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,130
Tos.

352
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,010
I will not accept you having
someone else more important than me.

353
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,340
Tin is not just someone else.

354
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,910
But he is someone I love.

355
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,420
So manly.

356
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,560
Very.

357
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,530
You said that this
kid is someone you love...

358
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,700
then you definitely are crazy.

359
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,640
Yes.

360
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,540
I am crazy.

361
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,110
In that case...

362
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,010
you can stop associate yourself
with a crazy person like me.

363
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,750
Go home.

364
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,260
Tin, let's go home.

365
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,920
Go on then.

366
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:20,930
Yeah, he's calling you.

367
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,230
That's right. fucking manly he is.

368
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,130
Tos!

369
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,370
You are making a mistake.

370
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,540
If I were you, I'd open
my eyes and see this through.

371
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,670
Hey, sis.

372
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,770
Stop talking

373
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,910
It's you who should open your eyes.

374
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,380
Is Scale asleep?

375
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,210
Yes.

376
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,320
Good.

377
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,890
What's wrong?

378
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,870
What you said, was it true?

379
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,310
Everything that I said, it's the truth.

380
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,480
How can you love me?

381
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,480
We only know each other for about a month.

382
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:49,010
You never had a boyfriend before.

383
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,120
You still have a wife and a child.

384
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,990
Let me tell you something.

385
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:06,270
Life is as important as love.

386
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,040
One day, one of them might disappear.

387
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,370
So, whatever I feel...

388
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,280
I have to say it out and I have to do it.

389
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,210
Hopefully one day...

390
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,920
I would not regret it.

391
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,550
Are you certain that what you said...

392
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,760
is not just to bombard your ex...

393
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,790
but come out of your true feeling?

394
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,400
I am certain.

395
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,170
Every word that I said...

396
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,340
I've thought carefully about it already.

397
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,310
What about you?

398
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,010
Do you have the same feeling as me?

399
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:53,710
I don't know.

400
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,080
I feel confused and perplexed.

401
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,920
I never had a guy
said he love me before.

402
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,660
Don't stress out about it.

403
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,960
Decide carefully.

404
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,360
Follow your heart.

405
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,230
Do what you feel is right.

406
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:21,970
I don't know.

407
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,980
Give some time.

408
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,310
Sure thing, Tin.

409
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,150
I understand if you refuse me.

410
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,350
Do you know that Scale...

411
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,660
wants another father.

412
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,730
You teasing me now.

413
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,230
I'm saying the truth.

414
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,630
Scale really wants another father.

415
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,040
No, don't do that.

416
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,350
Is the food ready, Papi?

417
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,280
Wait, Uncle.

418
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,050
What did you called me just now?

419
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,260
Papi, of course.

420
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,960
It's a practice just in case that one day...

421
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,990
you agree to be my boyfriend.

422
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,900
l'll let Scale call you Papi...

423
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,330
and I'm Papa.

424
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,130
He's gonna have two fathers.

425
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,740
What are you talking about?

426
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:24,070
You're being ridiculous.

427
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,680
Please hurry and agree.

428
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:31,510
So that I won't talk nonsense.

429
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,780
You said you'd give me time to think.

430
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,510
It's not even one day, Uncle.

431
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,520
For you...

432
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,550
it's a moment.

433
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,590
But for me...

434
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,360
it's a very long time.

435
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,190
You're exaggerating, Uncle.

436
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,440
Dinner's here, Tos.

437
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:07,880
Sorry.

438
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,380
I wasn't careful.

439
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,620
Can't eat it now.

440
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,450
It's been a while since
I had dinner with you, Auntie.

441
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:14,990
I miss this.

442
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,260
Well, before,.,

443
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,690
I used to come for dinner at Auntie's house.

444
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,690
I got addicted with her cooking.

445
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,530
When Cho was still working there,
he often took me home for dinner,

446
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,440
Back when he's there...

447
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,340
he never stay at home.

448
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,010
There...

449
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,810
he always sleep at P'San's house.

450
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:37,580
Never sleep at his own house!

451
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,280
Sleep at P'San's house?

452
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,280
Yes.

453
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:43,750
Very often too.

454
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,580
But sometimes...

455
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,550
I stayed overnight at his house.

456
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,390
You two are boyfriends, right?

457
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,760
Mom, no...

458
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,270
Don't lie to me!

459
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,070
Do you think I don't know?!

460
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,100
Yes, Auntie.

461
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,410
We are dating.

462
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,550
But please don't ask us to break up,

463
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,980
Have you thought this through?

464
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,180
Are you not embarrass?

465
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,650
Not care about what others thinks?

466
00:29:24,192 --> 00:29:26,130
Let ask you for real, Tos,

467
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:29,090
Do you think dating this kid will last long?

468
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,260
How are you going to tell your son?

469
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,330
Don't you embarrass in the eyes of others?

470
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,870
I won't let you be together with this kid.

471
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,840
And I'm not going anywhere.
