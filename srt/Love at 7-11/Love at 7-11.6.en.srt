1
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,147
Cleaned me with towel?

2
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:17,750
Yes.

3
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,418
your pants...

4
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,820
and I've check every corner.

5
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:24,056
Every corner?

6
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:26,458
Why do you have to be angry at me?

7
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,929
Because when I saw yours....

8
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:32,898
| you were asleep.

9
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:35,701
But when you saw mine, I was awake.

10
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:37,369
| It's embarrassing.

11
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:38,971
I give up.

12
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:42,007
But, please kick me softly.

13
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:53,819
I was so scared when I saw you lying in blood.

14
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:56,889
Are you...

15
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,924
worried about me?

16
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:09,001
Are you hurt?

17
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,037
Here.

18
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,940
But I was happy to be able to flirt her.

19
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:17,710
For that...

20
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,545
if you want to tell them...

21
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,779
ijust tell them.

22
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:23,849
Yes, I agree.

23
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:27,720
But I don't know how you feel about me.

24
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,490
But if you have the same feelings as mine...

25
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,761
then let's be boyfriends?

26
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,864
Kavin, Cho, What are you doing?

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,201
Today is your birthday, Cho?

28
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,104
P'Kavin and P'Cho...

29
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:48,073
they both think that we're boyfriends.

30
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:53,679
And you don't think so?

31
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:55,881
Think of what?

32
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,016
That's crazy.

33
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,119
I'm gonna go for shower.

34
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,505
You haven't eat the cake, haven't you?

35
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:22,908
About what you asked me today...

36
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,745
I'm not rushing to get the answer from you.

37
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,748
Think about it carefully before you answer.

38
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,451
Because your answer...

39
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:35,054
will change the relationship between us.

40
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:38,590
I want you to think about it carefully first.

41
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,059
Here.

42
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,427
Eat the cake.

43
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,130
You said you're a slow person.

44
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,166
Do you even react slow?

45
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,134
I think...

46
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:52,371
you should consider this carefully.

47
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,974
I've already thought carefully about it.

48
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,743
I've thought about for a very long time too.

49
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,245
I don't need more time to consider it anymore.

50
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,415
You've thought about it for a long time now?

51
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,786
Yes?

52
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:10,255
I have the same feelings as you are.

53
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,493
Don't you get it yet?

54
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,662
I agreed to be your boyfriend.

55
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,696
Seriously?

56
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,565
Are you being serious?

57
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:25,104
You can't take back what you said.

58
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,539
Let me tell you in advance that...

59
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:29,608
I'm very possessive.

60
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,678
I'm more possessive.

61
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,847
If you dare to fling with others...

62
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,482
You will get into trouble.

63
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,684
Let me go now.

64
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:40,586
Don't you want to shower.

65
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,321
You stink.

66
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:43,956
I do...

67
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,058
but...

68
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,329
Why are you making that face?

69
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,531
We're boyfriends now.

70
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,566
So we can shower together.

71
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,637
Don't even think about it, go shower by yourself.

72
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,373
What are you shy for?

73
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:04,143
We already seen each others "everything".

74
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,313
Come, let's shower.

75
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:09,815
No.

76
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,817
Let's go shower.

77
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,210
No.

78
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,220
Let's go shower.

79
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,320
Let me go, Gawin!

80
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,350
What are you doing?

81
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,390
Let me go, I said let me go!

82
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,560
No.

83
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,460
I'm taking your shirt off.

84
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,160
One, two...

85
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,000
three!

86
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,600
Scale...

87
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,510
do you think that P'Tin takes good care of you?

88
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,640
I think...

89
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,010
P'Tin takes very good care of us.

90
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,080
Do you like P'Tin?

91
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,450
I know that you...

92
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,390
like P'Tin very much,

93
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,660
I do too,

94
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,500
Do you want another father?

95
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,840
Smiling like that, that means you're agree,

96
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,510
That means you're giving
permission for me to flirt P'Tin, right?

97
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,580
Right?

98
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,080
Uncle likes me.

99
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,650
He wants to hit on me.

100
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,850
What should I do?

101
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,450
l'll ask him, OK?

102
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,420
Did you finish showering yet, Tin?!

103
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:30,920
Tin!

104
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,970
I have.

105
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,440
Tin.

106
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,570
Yes.

107
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,370
Tin.

108
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,410
Tin.

109
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,310
What's up?

110
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,850
Nothing, I was just worried,

111
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,150
Worried for what?

112
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,190
I was worried that you
disappeared too long in the bathroom.

113
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,660
I was afraid that you'd just flee and don't
want to take care of me and my son.

114
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,030
Run away?

115
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,100
If you went home...

116
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,670
what should Scale and I do?
Who's gonna takes care of us?

117
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,900
Come, Scale. Let's play.

118
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,020
Are you forgetting about me?

119
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,360
That's not true, Mom.

120
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,160
I miss you soooo much,

121
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,730
Miss but never call or contact me.

122
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,070
I was kinda busy lately, Mom.

123
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,170
But I never forget about you.

124
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,170
By the way...

125
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,840
how's your homestay doing?

126
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,100
Do you get a lot of customer?

127
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:56,980
There always are because
the owner is beautiful and kind.

128
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Praising yourself now?

129
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,620
Because my son didn't praise me.

130
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,050
Fine, fine,

131
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,120
My mother is veryyyy beautiful.

132
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,590
And veryyyy kind.

133
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,000
Such a sweet mouth now, aren't you.

134
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,370
But, where is Gawin?

135
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,140
I never see Gawin when I call you.

136
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,640
You said that you moved in with Gawin.

137
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,680
Gawin is in the bathroom.

138
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,480
I told you to take a photo of Gawin for me?

139
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,910
Did you forget?

140
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,050
I did forgot.

141
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,020
I'll take one later.

142
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,150
I need to prepare meals for the guest now.

143
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,690
OK, I love you. Bye-bye.

144
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,460
I love you too. son.

145
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,320
Who were you talking to? A fling?

146
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,890
Nonsense, I was talking to my mom.

147
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,290
Oh yeah

148
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,060
Mom asked me to take a photo of you.

149
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,190
Is that so?

150
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,860
Go ahead.

151
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,360
I think we should do it like this.

152
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:12,640
Is this a good idea?

153
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,040
Of course.

154
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,010
Why?

155
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,610
Nothing, nothing.

156
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,180
Make sure it shows the whole body.

157
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,480
But I don't have a selfie stick.

158
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,390
Here, I got an idea.

159
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,420
Put it on your feet, straighten your legs.

160
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,330
That's it.

161
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,190
Like this?

162
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,160
Yes.

163
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,970
Hey, I can't focus.

164
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,170
Yes, yes.

165
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,610
How many seconds is the timer?

166
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,640
5 seconds.

167
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,240
ОК.

168
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,350
Is it good?

169
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,550
Let me see.

170
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:09,860
Is it OK?

171
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,660
A pair of handsome guys.

172
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,500
I'm more handsome.

173
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,010
P'Art!

174
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,280
Where are you going?

175
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,510
Nowhere.

176
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,310
Who's going anywhere?

177
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,150
Why are you being sneaky?

178
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,020
I was just doingłaslight exercise.

179
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,830
Like...

180
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,090
those Warrior Hero.

181
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,230
Really? Really?

182
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,870
Stop pretending

183
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,330
You're going to flirt with P'Vee, right?

184
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,910
I'm gonna be late for work.

185
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,340
I'm sorry. We're going now.

186
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,110
Action!

187
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,640
P'Art, if I come back and don't see you...

188
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,850
you'll dead.

189
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,160
Is she my mother?

190
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:13,990
I'm her older brother.

191
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,190
Why do I have to be afraid of her?

192
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,500
if I have a wife....

193
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,370
would I be afraid of her?

194
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,310
What are you talking to yourself about?

195
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,440
It's nothing.

196
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,080
enjoying yourself,
giving girl customers a ride?

197
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,950
It's rare for them to ride with me.

198
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,020
Normally they only rides with P'Gawin.

199
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,110
Sawasdee, P'Art.

200
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,640
Hey, what's up.

201
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,950
What's up?

202
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,010
Are you here for motorcycle taxi?

203
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,190
Why didn't you bring your working attire?

204
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,250
No.

205
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:17,850
I just came to see you.

206
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,920
Yeah, yeah.

207
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,160
I'm gonņa drop off a guest for awhile.

208
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,590
I'll be back.

209
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,060
ОК, ОК... .. .

210
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,130
Hey, friend.

211
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,830
How can you be here today?

212
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,130
You don't need to look after his child today?

213
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,170
l do.

214
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,300
But l miss you and the seniors.

215
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,610
I told him that I'm out for shopping.

216
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,110
You're missing us?

217
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,480
I think you seem odd.

218
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,310
What do you mean odd?

219
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,350
Dude.

220
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,930
If supposedly one day a guy come and hit on you...

221
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,390
what would you do?

222
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,000
Hold on.

223
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,470
Don't tell me that
you have a guy hitting on you?

224
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:03,830
No.

225
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,940
I see many guys
dating each others these days.

226
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,570
I'm just curious.

227
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:12,040
I don't know, I never had an me,

228
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,310
How am I suppose to know?

229
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,150
Exactly.

230
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,250
Bütl think it's not that weird,

231
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,550
I've seen guys dating a katoey...

232
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,590
and they are very beautiful.

233
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,560
But this is a very manly guy.
A big straight guy.

234
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,530
Wait.

235
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,470
Do you have someone hitting on you for real?

236
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:38,840
No!

237
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,670
But I think...

238
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,140
it's not that weird if a
manly guys date each other.

239
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,580
I've seen many of those.

240
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,120
There's a lot of girls dating each other too.

241
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,050
They even get married.

242
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,480
Haven't you watch the news?

243
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,920
Here. a handsome guy like me...

244
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,120
just want to remain single for now.

245
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,930
Don't you hate them?

246
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,060
Why should I?

247
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,350
They like and love each other.

248
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,820
It's got nothing to do with me.

249
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,150
Can you stop love?

250
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,120
Talking like that means...

251
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,730
that if a guy likes you...

252
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,130
will you like him back?

253
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,570
What are you asking?

254
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,640
I can't answer that.

255
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,710
I wouldn't say no either.

256
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,640
That if supposedly...

257
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,110
a guy come hitting on me and he likes me...

258
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,750
and I feel great with him...

259
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,320
I think only time will tell.

260
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,520
What's with all these questions?

261
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,990
Asking this and that.

262
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,160
Are you asking to decide who you're going to like?

263
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,030
You're being ridiculous.

264
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,500
I'm heading home now.

265
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,700
It's late.

266
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,600
I haven't cook for Uncle yet.

267
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,300
He'll complain and it's disturbing for sure.

268
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,340
Οκ, οκ, οκ.

269
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,240
Whoever you love and like...

270
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,940
that's up to you.

271
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,240
No need to come here just to ask me that.

272
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,780
Bastard.

273
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,250
What like?

274
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,480
You might get a punch from me.

275
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,990
See you.

276
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,760
Thank you.

277
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,700
Smiling non-stop.

278
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,810
Is there something good happened?

279
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,170
Or...

280
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,270
you have someone you love.

281
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,780
You can tell?

282
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,210
Because you expression is so obvious.

283
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,550
There, its true you have someone you love.

284
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,050
What love are you on about here?

285
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,390
Cho here: He has someone he love.

286
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,560
What do you mean by this love of yours?

287
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,760
Tell us now.

288
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,100

289
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,640

290
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,900

291
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,910
Childhood?

292
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,010
Yes.

293
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,750
Which friend? Do we know them?

294
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,080
I want to meet this person.

295
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,520
You'll meet him soon enough.

296
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,090
When we're ready to open up our relationship,

297
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,420

Why are you here?

302
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,880
Before I answer you...

303
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,210
let me ask you first.

304
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,550
Why didn't you read and reply my LINE text?

305
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,580
I've been busy lately, P'.

306
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,280

00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,110
I was just shocked.

345
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,880
I apologize on Vee's behalf,

346
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,450
I've no idea what she's playing at.

347
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,250
Are you sure you're all right?

348
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,750
I'm fine, really

349
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,190
Vee

350
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,660
What game are you playing?

351
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,590
He's in a shock now.

352
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,860
Do I have to apologize?

353
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,570
I was just kidding,

354
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,100
I'm fine, really

355
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,210
See?

356
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,510
He said it himself.

357
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,180
He's fine.

358
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,210
Vee...

359
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,780
why are you doing this?

360
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,310
P'Vee.

361
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,880
P'Vee.

362
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,580
P'Vee!

363
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,420
What are you smiling at?

364
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,760
I just thought about stuff...

365
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,220
and want to order.

366
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,260
Then. l'll take this stuff outside.

367
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,660
If you need my help with anything, let me know,

368
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,330
Thank you so much.

369
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,330
Krub.

370
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,950
In the end, I Didn't get him.

371
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,050
Do I really need to get over you, Gawin?

372
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,420
Ai'Gawin!

373
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,250
Have you gone crazy?

374
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,090
What are you smiling about?

375
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,500

377
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,670

378
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,200
No, no, no.

00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,570
Look over there.

380
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,670
What is he smiling about?

381
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,710
I see him smiling ever since this morning.

382
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,040
Hey, Gawin!

383
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,750
What are you smiling about?

384
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,980
Is there something wrong?

385
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,250
Well, I...

386
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,450

387
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,960
You have a lover?

388
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,090

00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,190

394
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,740
Not beautiful but...

395
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,080
very cute.

396
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,410
I want meet.

397
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,980
No way.

398
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,750
I'm outta here:

399
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,720
What the heck?

400
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,560
Oh yeah, P',

401
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,690
Who is P'Gawin's lover?

402
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,400
That person is near.

403
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,700
The person is near?

404
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,100
Do we know them?

405
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,100
We do.

406
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,640
Wait.

407
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,140
Don't tell me that P'Gawin's lover is...

408
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,340
Ai'Tin?

409
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,280
Why him?

410
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:54,850
Because this morning...

411
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,420
he asked me that if a guy hit on him...

412
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,290
what should he do? Something like that.

413
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,920
Not Ai'Tin.

414
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,330
If it's Ai'Tin...

415
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,300
it would had to be with that child's father.

416
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,870
Good.

417
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,730
Let them all be together,

418
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,770
That way, more girls are mine for the taking.

419
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,410
Will girls look at you?

420
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,780
Daydreaming

421
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,150
You're delusional, Talking nonsense,

422
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,820
It's true.

423
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,230
Tin, where have you been for long?

424
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,640
Miss you.

425
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,270
I said miss you.

426
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,170
I mean Scale miss you.

427
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:57,210
Right, son?! You miss P'Tin, right?!

428
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,780
You're too much, Uncle.

429
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,280
What should I do?

430
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:03,820
Do what?

431
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,450
Do....

432
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,390
do the meal. I was
thinking what should I make.

433
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,420
How about this?

434
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,890
We'll make something simple.
We'll cook omelet fried rice.

435
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,730
Good?

436
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,760
Good, that's easy.

437
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,800
Wait just a moment.

438
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,630
Sure, sure.

439
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,480
Tin.

440
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,090
What, Uncle?

441
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:41,820
Here.

442
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,390
Come here.

443
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,630
Be still.

444
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,160
Stand still.

445
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,160
Let me tell you this.

446
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:54,630
When we're cooking, the apron...

447
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,970
must be fasten properly, understand?

448
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:58,640
ОК?

449
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,310
Krub.

450
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,440
Fasten it properly.

451
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,440
Krub.

452
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:07,880
You're too much, Uncle.

453
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,920
I'm at a loss now.

454
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,220
No way.

455
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,450
I can't just let have your way.

456
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,190
Watch, if I fight back, what will you do?

457
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,990
What are you babbling about?

458
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,460
Nothing.

459
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,810
Here, Uncle.

460
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,990
A heart-shaped ketchup too.

461
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,150
I'm giving you my heart, do you want it?

462
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:52,190
I'm kidding, it was intentional.

463
00:23:52,768 --> 00:23:53,168
Hey.

464
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:55,160
Don't joke around like this often next time.

465
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,760
I tell you if you do it often...

466
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,460
I would think you mean it.

467
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,470
I'm gonna check on Scale.

468
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,870
Maybe he's awake.

469
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,540
Hey, Tin.

470
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,340
Take off the apron, OK?

471
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,330
What's the matter, Cho?

472
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,770
What are you doing?

473
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,330
What are you doing?

474
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,700
Umm...

475
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,010
P Dao...

476
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,480
let me hug you, please.

477
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,020
Let me lean on you for a bit.

478
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,820
Hey, P'Art

479
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,920
It's me.

480
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,760
What are you guys doing?

481
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,160
Why are you here?

482
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,500
I'm here to see how you're doing.

483
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:09,140
What were you doing earlier?

484
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,440
And who is this kid?

485
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,240
Mom?

486
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,680
Surprised.

487
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,720
Sawasdee krub, Auntie.

488
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,020
Swasdee ja.

489
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,620
Hey. you.

490
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:31,220
Take your stuff away.

491
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:34,730
From now on, don't ever
come near me and my husband again.
