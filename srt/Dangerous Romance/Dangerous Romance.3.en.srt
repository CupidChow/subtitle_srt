Characters, actions, locations, occupations and events in this series

00:00:06,621 --> 00:00:09,771
are fictional and created for entertainment purposes only.

3
00:00:09,771 --> 00:00:15,040
They are not intended to urge or promote any behaviour in the series.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,617
Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:18,274 --> 00:00:19,454
The mainboard is probably broken.

6
00:00:19,592 --> 00:00:21,183
It costs around 3,000-4,000 baht to replace it.

7
00:00:21,183 --> 00:00:24,270
Damn. Our debt is due tomorrow.

8
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:27,880
Are you interested in tutoring Kanghan?

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,709
It’s pretty simple actually.

10
00:00:28,709 --> 00:00:31,260
Tomorrow, we have a physics test. Make me a cheat sheet.

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,230
What the hell is this?

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,386
I wanna make you see that money cannot buy everything.

13
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:37,320
I want to get my revenge.

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,758
Should I go to his place and beat him up?

15
00:00:38,758 --> 00:00:40,429
You have no money?

16
00:00:41,027 --> 00:00:42,344
Hey. Are you okay?

17
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:45,430
Kang!

18
00:00:59,144 --> 00:01:01,612
Seriously. Did you do that a lot?

19
00:01:03,215 --> 00:01:03,953
What are you talking about?

20
00:01:04,614 --> 00:01:06,000
Carrying a gun around and pointing it at people

21
00:01:07,548 --> 00:01:09,135
No! I'd never done that before.

22
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,452
And there are no bullets in the gun even.

23
00:01:12,716 --> 00:01:14,716
Why did you bring a gun to my house at this time, anyway?

24
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,875
At first, I wanted to scare you.

25
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:23,880
I was mad because you punched me.

26
00:01:25,364 --> 00:01:28,438
But when I found you in that situation, I had no choice but to play along.

27
00:01:29,817 --> 00:01:31,321
You truly are a jerk.

28
00:01:32,724 --> 00:01:35,247
Fine. Let’s call it even since you did save me.

29
00:01:35,884 --> 00:01:37,884
Okay. Over.

30
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,339
Wait.

31
00:01:40,028 --> 00:01:41,051
What about tutoring?

32
00:01:41,743 --> 00:01:42,593
So?

33
00:01:43,046 --> 00:01:45,463
You told my brother that I was your tutor.

34
00:01:47,029 --> 00:01:49,277
Just that I didn't bother to explain to him.

35
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:54,223
But I didn’t lie about the payment though.

36
00:01:55,542 --> 00:01:56,328
Keep it.

37
00:01:56,328 --> 00:01:57,542
For what?

38
00:01:57,542 --> 00:01:58,653
I have yet to tutor you in anything.

39
00:01:59,834 --> 00:02:03,184
Take it as compensation for causing you to lose your job.

40
00:02:03,522 --> 00:02:06,120
We owe nothing to each other from now on.

41
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:07,802
No. I don’t want it. Take it back.

42
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:09,093
Keep it.

43
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,634
I don't accept anyone's money for free.

44
00:02:11,634 --> 00:02:13,840
If you want me to take this, I'll have to tutor you.

45
00:02:14,892 --> 00:02:16,267
You don’t need to. I don’t want to do it. Keep the money.

46
00:02:16,892 --> 00:02:21,511
Alright. Then tomorrow at 4:30, meet me at the library.

47
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:22,676
See you then.

48
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,488
Hey. No tutoring.

49
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:25,935
See you.

50
00:02:26,568 --> 00:02:27,643
No.

51
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:29,800
Are you listening to me? Hey!

52
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,379
No, Sailom. I won’t go there.

53
00:02:35,434 --> 00:02:36,308
Seriously?

54
00:02:37,988 --> 00:02:39,114
No tutoring.

55
00:02:39,114 --> 00:02:40,126
Sailom!

56
00:04:59,796 --> 00:05:00,804
Nice shot.

57
00:05:03,531 --> 00:05:04,248
It’s damn hot.

58
00:05:11,392 --> 00:05:13,585
Hey. Want to grab a bite together?

59
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,120
I can’t. I have tutoring at home today.

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,311
Exam tutoring?

61
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:20,662
Love tutoring!

62
00:05:21,658 --> 00:05:23,300
My tutor is so damn cute.

63
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,501
I can’t wait for it. I wish I could have tutoring every day.

64
00:05:26,096 --> 00:05:27,048
Sorry, guys.

65
00:05:28,343 --> 00:05:29,253
Later then.

66
00:05:29,253 --> 00:05:31,560
Later.

67
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,512
Bye.

68
00:05:43,642 --> 00:05:45,477
You have no money?

69
00:05:46,484 --> 00:05:47,491
Huh?

70
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,804
Hey. Are you okay?

71
00:05:53,362 --> 00:05:54,317
Kang!

72
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:58,668
Do you have to go through this every month if you can’t pay them?

73
00:06:29,275 --> 00:06:31,578
Sorry. I was occupied with something else.

74
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,659
I didn't expect you to still be waiting.

75
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:36,127
I didn’t wait for you.

76
00:06:36,704 --> 00:06:38,047
I’m working on my Biology assignment.

77
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:39,035
It’s almost done.

78
00:06:42,483 --> 00:06:43,973
So, what are you going to tutor me?
Go ahead.

79
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,309
Here.

80
00:07:01,044 --> 00:07:02,214
A pre-test.

81
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,737
Let’s begin with math.

82
00:07:05,197 --> 00:07:06,000
All of them?

83
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,643
Um.

84
00:07:11,336 --> 00:07:12,592
It doesn’t look that hard.

85
00:07:14,821 --> 00:07:16,188
Try first.

86
00:07:16,188 --> 00:07:17,115
Brag later. 

87
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,182
67/100

88
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:44,428
And you haven’t tutored me yet.

89
00:07:44,428 --> 00:07:45,616
I'm incredible, right?

90
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:47,524
You are…

91
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:51,377
incredibly stupid.

92
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,649
This is junior high-level math.

93
00:07:54,472 --> 00:07:56,224
And you could get only 67.

94
00:07:56,224 --> 00:07:58,000
I can't even imagine how you would perform in advanced math.

95
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:04,943
The library is about to close.

96
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:08,590
Take these.

97
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,141
Read them all at home.

98
00:08:11,554 --> 00:08:12,606
We'll continue tutoring tomorrow.

99
00:08:15,156 --> 00:08:16,412
You gotta be kidding me.

100
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,642
Isn't this a bit much?

101
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,189
I’m not gonna do it.

102
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:21,918
Hey.

103
00:08:22,712 --> 00:08:24,326
How can I possibly read them all?

104
00:08:24,934 --> 00:08:25,462
I’m leaving.

105
00:08:25,462 --> 00:08:26,714
Kang, come on.

106
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,901
Kang!

107
00:08:35,505 --> 00:08:39,350
Why was he here if he had no intention of studying?

108
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:48,381
He asked me to go through a stack of textbooks.

109
00:08:48,381 --> 00:08:50,629
It was like getting me ready for the International Science Olympiads.

110
00:08:50,945 --> 00:08:52,057
So I left him and came home.

111
00:08:52,945 --> 00:08:53,833
Hell yeah.

112
00:08:55,846 --> 00:08:57,207
Hey, Max. How about coming over here?

113
00:08:57,207 --> 00:08:58,342
I just got a new FIFA game.

114
00:09:00,186 --> 00:09:01,121
You're coming, aren't you?

115
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,095
Great. See you then.

116
00:09:12,597 --> 00:09:13,964
You're incredibly quick to get here.

117
00:09:16,057 --> 00:09:16,932
Take a look at the graphics...

118
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:20,646
Dad.

119
00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:26,211
Grandma said you’d be coming home late.

120
00:09:26,937 --> 00:09:28,469
The meeting ended sooner than expected.

121
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,454
Didn’t you have tutoring this evening? 

122
00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:35,573
How come you are here playing video games?

123
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:39,474
Well..

124
00:09:47,762 --> 00:09:49,101
No need to frown.

125
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:51,786
I get how teenagers are. 

126
00:09:52,252 --> 00:09:54,225
Too much studying can stress you out.

127
00:10:03,363 --> 00:10:04,674
So, you are into FIFA too?

128
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,269
You know this game?

129
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:11,250
I saw many young people playing it during my election campaign.

130
00:10:11,836 --> 00:10:13,285
Seems like a fun game.

131
00:10:14,496 --> 00:10:15,383
I see.

132
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:18,000
Kang.

133
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:22,869
Do you want me to tell your grandma that you don’t need a tutor?

134
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:25,801
Nobody likes being forced to do things they don't like.

135
00:10:26,076 --> 00:10:27,200
I understand.

136
00:10:29,065 --> 00:10:30,459
As far as I'm concerned, 

137
00:10:31,106 --> 00:10:34,428
as long as you don’t repeat your class, I’m already happy.

138
00:10:36,914 --> 00:10:39,685
At your age, don’t stress yourself out unnecessarily. 

139
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:42,549
Just have fun at school and hang out with friends.

140
00:10:43,318 --> 00:10:45,318
Then come home to enjoy a good meal of food.

141
00:10:45,318 --> 00:10:46,877
Have a good night's sleep.

142
00:10:47,808 --> 00:10:49,808
These kinds of things suit you better. Trust me.

143
00:10:55,165 --> 00:10:57,440
Then I will do my best to pass all my exams this semester.

144
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,603
Hm?

145
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:06,549
If I pass all my midterms, can you get me a big bike, Dad?

146
00:11:10,465 --> 00:11:11,500
You want that?

147
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:13,705
I want to give it a try.

148
00:11:17,003 --> 00:11:17,853
Why not?

149
00:11:18,156 --> 00:11:19,306
You’ve got a deal.

150
00:11:30,543 --> 00:11:33,287
Let's place a wager. I'm pretty sure Kang won't show up.

151
00:11:33,287 --> 00:11:35,243
- Yeah, I agree.
- Let's just go grab some food.

152
00:11:40,774 --> 00:11:41,537
Auto.

153
00:11:42,193 --> 00:11:43,200
Is that really him?

154
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,129
Woah. He actually showed up.

155
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:45,891
I think it’s him.

156
00:11:46,011 --> 00:11:46,572
Yeah.

157
00:11:49,326 --> 00:11:50,600
But I have a bad feeling about this.

158
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,732
He probably has something up his sleeves.

159
00:11:52,732 --> 00:11:53,598
Yeah.

160
00:11:53,729 --> 00:11:54,920
Be cautious, Sailom.

161
00:11:56,628 --> 00:11:57,437
isten to me.

162
00:11:58,346 --> 00:11:59,823
If he bothers you again,

163
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:02,762
just give him another counterattack kiss.

164
00:12:02,762 --> 00:12:04,816
I guarantee it’ll work.

165
00:12:04,816 --> 00:12:05,958
100% 

166
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,589
- Agreed.
- Trust me.

167
00:12:08,931 --> 00:12:10,931
Seriously, what the heck is wrong with you two?

168
00:12:11,623 --> 00:12:14,119
I’m tutoring him now. Catch you later.

169
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:15,632
Aren’t you joining us for a meal?

170
00:12:15,632 --> 00:12:16,350
I’ll eat later.

171
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,882
Come on. Eat with us first.

172
00:12:19,153 --> 00:12:20,385
What's the solution for this (x)?

173
00:12:21,927 --> 00:12:22,695
(x)?

174
00:12:22,695 --> 00:12:23,615
What's the value of (x)?

175
00:12:25,295 --> 00:12:26,769
It's substituted with 3.

176
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:32,628
Is it 5?

177
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:33,404
What?

178
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:35,840
Wrong answer?

179
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,554
It’s correct!

180
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,462
Wow. Looks like you're getting the hang of this now.

181
00:12:40,462 --> 00:12:43,913
Damn, I never thought I'd be able to solve this.

182
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,462
Once you grasp the pattern of this, 

183
00:12:46,462 --> 00:12:47,853
you can tackle any questions. 

184
00:12:48,677 --> 00:12:50,952
So, are you starting to enjoy this subject yet?

185
00:12:52,665 --> 00:12:53,511
Um.

186
00:12:53,704 --> 00:12:55,409
I used to despise it.

187
00:12:57,657 --> 00:12:58,598
But I think…

188
00:12:59,865 --> 00:13:01,199
I'm starting to like it now.

189
00:13:24,201 --> 00:13:25,386
Unlike me.

190
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:27,606
I used to like it a lot.

191
00:13:28,369 --> 00:13:29,807
Now I'm starting to dislike it.

192
00:13:30,606 --> 00:13:31,425
Why’s that?

193
00:13:35,834 --> 00:13:37,586
Because I have to tutor a pain in the ass like you.

194
00:13:37,586 --> 00:13:38,625
Damn it, you jackass.

195
00:13:39,437 --> 00:13:40,666
I feel like teaching an elementary kid.

196
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,164
You’re asking for trouble.

197
00:13:47,072 --> 00:13:49,072
Shit. It’s 10 p.m. already.

198
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:50,366
For real?

199
00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:54,920
I'm sorry for keeping you so late with this tutoring.

200
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,220
That’s totally fine.

201
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:57,464
Should we leave?

202
00:13:57,657 --> 00:13:58,957
Sure. Let's get these packed up.

203
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:05,234
Everyone else has left.

204
00:14:08,126 --> 00:14:09,589
Just the two of us remaining.

205
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,201
I rode my bike to school today. Need a lift?

206
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,368
No, I’m good. I can find my way home.

207
00:14:20,321 --> 00:14:22,431
You won’t find a bus at this hour.

208
00:14:22,744 --> 00:14:24,000
Come on. I better give you a lift.

209
00:14:32,729 --> 00:14:33,903
Well, if you insist.

210
00:14:33,903 --> 00:14:34,512
Good.

211
00:14:35,586 --> 00:14:36,977
Come with me.

212
00:14:42,753 --> 00:14:43,747
Here.

213
00:14:51,322 --> 00:14:52,493
Make a wise decision.

214
00:14:53,538 --> 00:14:55,097
Do you want to end everything here?

215
00:14:56,444 --> 00:14:58,141
Or do you want me to keep picking on you until we finish this school?

216
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:01,185
I wanna make you see

217
00:15:01,816 --> 00:15:03,017
that money can buy everything.

218
00:15:03,785 --> 00:15:05,785
You should have accepted my offer from the beginning.

219
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:18,343
Why the hell are you just standing there?

220
00:15:18,343 --> 00:15:19,099
Hop on.

221
00:15:56,926 --> 00:15:59,229
Hey, Kang. What’s the rush?

222
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:00,266
Say that again?

223
00:16:00,431 --> 00:16:03,151
I asked why the need for speed.

224
00:16:03,151 --> 00:16:04,161
I can’t hear you.

225
00:16:04,471 --> 00:16:07,022
What’s the rush?

226
00:16:08,185 --> 00:16:09,937
I’ve got to go somewhere first.

227
00:16:09,937 --> 00:16:11,421
Damn it, Kang!

228
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:12,874

What made you change your mind?

243
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:14,275
I just want my grandma to be proud of me. I guess.
