4
00:00:18,365 --> 00:00:22,094
Grandma said if I don’t pass all my midterms, she won’t hire you anymore.

5
00:00:22,365 --> 00:00:23,513
You passed all of them.

6
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:25,784
You moron. What on earth did you see?

7
00:00:25,784 --> 00:00:27,548
Kanghan got an F in chemistry.

8
00:00:29,061 --> 00:00:31,960
What's with the long face? You must be heartbroken.

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,238
Heartbroken, my ass. I just lost my job.

10
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:36,671
I won’t be getting money from tutoring Kanghan anymore.

11
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:40,160
Sailom, are you interested in tutoring me?

12
00:00:41,324 --> 00:00:43,789
Can you hire Sailom to be my tutor again?

13
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:46,884
Without wind, how can a windmill spin?

14
00:00:59,804 --> 00:01:02,449
Why does Sailom have to stay with us here, Grandma?

15
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:04,555
Answer me this. 

16
00:01:06,052 --> 00:01:09,188
What's the reason I hired a tutor for you?

17
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:12,933
To improve my grades?

18
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:14,537
No.

19
00:01:15,704 --> 00:01:20,776
So that you can successfully get into a good university.

20
00:01:23,102 --> 00:01:23,983
Why?

21
00:01:27,029 --> 00:01:29,206
You told me you felt neglected by your father

22
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:32,677
because he didn't have expectations for you. 

23
00:01:33,775 --> 00:01:37,117
This is an opportunity to prove to him that 

24
00:01:37,492 --> 00:01:43,002
you can achieve anything you set your heart on. 

25
00:01:43,477 --> 00:01:46,535
I want Sailom to stay over 

26
00:01:47,249 --> 00:01:53,276
to ensure he has enough time to tutor you effectively.

27
00:01:57,213 --> 00:01:57,997
Okay.

28
00:01:58,823 --> 00:02:00,039
I see your point now.

29
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,000
Sailom must be a friend you truly love.

30
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:07,575
You're putting in a lot of effort to have him tutor you.

31
00:02:07,756 --> 00:02:10,309
No, Grandma. I don’t love him.

32
00:02:10,687 --> 00:02:11,767
I despise him.

33
00:02:15,432 --> 00:02:16,352
I don’t love him.

34
00:02:16,352 --> 00:02:17,105
Really?

35
00:02:21,987 --> 00:02:22,877
Hey!

36
00:02:23,032 --> 00:02:24,142
What the heck are you playing?

37
00:02:24,142 --> 00:02:26,067
Spacing out, huh?

38
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,968
Wow.

39
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:34,148
The bed is incredibly soft.

40
00:02:38,073 --> 00:02:39,815
Try jumping and landing on your back.

41
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:41,489
Jumping?

42
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:42,102
Um.

43
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,938
Woah.

44
00:02:47,898 --> 00:02:48,637
How does it feel?

45
00:02:48,637 --> 00:02:49,562
It bounces.

46
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:52,528
So good.

47
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:54,424
Bounce!

48
00:03:08,082 --> 00:03:08,750
Uh…

49
00:03:16,442 --> 00:03:17,180
You know what?

50
00:03:17,593 --> 00:03:18,093
Hm?

51
00:03:18,093 --> 00:03:19,281
Today is like my dream.

52
00:03:20,654 --> 00:03:23,067
A comfy bed and a chilly AC.

53
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:34,418
If you learn about this room’s secret,

54
00:03:35,426 --> 00:03:36,884
you might change your mind.

55
00:03:37,798 --> 00:03:38,644
What secret?

56
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:46,793
Woah.

57
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:51,213
Wait.

58
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:54,305
There’s another door.

59
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:56,840
Don’t tell me…

60
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,672
Yes.

61
00:03:58,068 --> 00:03:59,086
That leads to my room.

62
00:04:01,254 --> 00:04:03,372
Are you concerned I might intrude on your private time?

63
00:04:03,634 --> 00:04:04,547
No.

64
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,847
I’m just concerned that you may not be okay with it.

65
00:04:07,722 --> 00:04:09,103
This is my bathroom.

66
00:04:09,104 --> 00:04:12,280
I can use it anytime I want.

67
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:13,177
Huh?

68
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,488
Deal with it.

69
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,539
Hey, jackass Kang.

70
00:04:27,927 --> 00:04:29,514
How could I possibly take a shower?

71
00:06:10,535 --> 00:06:11,521
Thank you.

72
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:15,440
I don’t want to eat fish. Who requested this dish?

73
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,816
I did.

74
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:23,043
This is a special meal to welcome Sailom.

75
00:06:23,403 --> 00:06:24,784
Go ahead. Enjoy it.

76
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:25,943
Thank you so much.

77
00:06:25,943 --> 00:06:26,584
You’re welcome.

78
00:06:27,982 --> 00:06:29,363
Well, Sailom.

79
00:06:29,363 --> 00:06:30,024
Yes?

80
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:34,264
How’s the bag I fixed for you? Is it still working well?

81
00:06:34,264 --> 00:06:36,519
Very well, Grandma Ging.

82
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,007
I can fit so many sheets in here now.

83
00:06:38,007 --> 00:06:40,040
It holds them perfectly. Thank you very much.

84
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,198
You’re welcome.

85
00:06:48,202 --> 00:06:49,634
That dog looks familiar somehow.

86
00:06:50,228 --> 00:06:53,673
Sure is. It was your T-shirt.

87
00:06:54,087 --> 00:06:55,261
What, Grandma?

88
00:06:55,825 --> 00:06:58,341
You should have told me if you took my clothes.

89
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:02,492
Come on, you little. 

90
00:07:02,492 --> 00:07:05,238
You have hundreds of them folded in your wardrobe. 

91
00:07:05,998 --> 00:07:08,400
I used just one.

92
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,000
But I like that design.

93
00:07:18,065 --> 00:07:19,342
Good evening, sir.

94
00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:24,526
Are you Kanghan’s tutor?

95
00:07:25,808 --> 00:07:26,582
Yes.

96
00:07:27,124 --> 00:07:27,860
Yes.

97
00:07:30,796 --> 00:07:33,596
My mother said you would stay over here for extended tutoring.

98
00:07:34,684 --> 00:07:36,013
Don’t overdo it, okay?

99
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,080
Just Monday to Friday.

100
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,868
I'm giving them a break on weekends. 

101
00:07:45,025 --> 00:07:46,664
It's not too much.

102
00:07:48,285 --> 00:07:49,459
Good.

103
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,208
Too much studying can be stressful.

104
00:07:53,787 --> 00:07:54,845
Right, Kang?

105
00:07:58,765 --> 00:08:02,800
But recently Kang has been really committed to his studies, you know? 

106
00:08:03,227 --> 00:08:07,111
He's aiming for admission to a public university.

107
00:08:07,369 --> 00:08:12,182
He even asked me to have Sailom return to tutor him.

108
00:08:12,182 --> 00:08:14,121
That’s not it, Grandma.

109
00:08:15,198 --> 00:08:17,663
I couldn't find any other tutors, so I asked for him.

110
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,436
Really?

111
00:08:19,194 --> 00:08:19,960
Really?

112
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:20,885
Really?

113
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:25,000
Let’s finish our meal.

114
00:08:25,654 --> 00:08:26,724
This dish is quite good.

115
00:08:26,724 --> 00:08:28,222
Alright, alright.

116
00:08:35,942 --> 00:08:39,207
(Besides the food, what else is cool over there?)

117
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:43,071
You know what’s really surprising?

118
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:46,579
I don’t have to do the dishes here!

119
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:48,112
This is like a dream.

120
00:08:48,324 --> 00:08:51,434
(Glad to hear you’re doing well there. I don’t have to worry much.)

121
00:08:51,975 --> 00:08:55,000
(By the way, is there a room with a safe in it?)

122
00:08:55,549 --> 00:08:58,375
(Go check it out. You might find something worth stealing.)

123
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,329
Stealing, my ass!

124
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,990
I’ve got to go now. I’ll talk to you later.

125
00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:14,468
Hey. What the hell are you doing in here?

126
00:09:14,778 --> 00:09:15,520
Shush!

127
00:09:18,443 --> 00:09:20,185
I’m brushing my teeth. Can’t you see?

128
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,896
Be quiet, will you?

129
00:09:22,473 --> 00:09:24,473
It’s a sin to interrupt a man taking a leak.

130
00:09:29,274 --> 00:09:30,448
I told you, didn’t I?

131
00:09:30,448 --> 00:09:32,165
I can use my bathroom whenever I want.

132
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:33,591
Why?

133
00:09:34,288 --> 00:09:35,319
Did I make you blush?

134
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:38,301
Hell no. I didn’t want to see anything.

135
00:09:44,781 --> 00:09:45,878
Not blushing, huh?

136
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:47,780
Then take a good look.

137
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:51,287
What the? No way.

138
00:09:53,513 --> 00:09:54,714
Not blushing, right?

139
00:09:54,714 --> 00:09:56,287
Then take a good look.

140
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,486
Fine, I’m out of here. I’m out of here.

141
00:10:00,486 --> 00:10:01,204
I’m leaving.

142
00:10:01,503 --> 00:10:02,367
Wait.

143
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:03,590
What?

144
00:10:03,796 --> 00:10:04,755
Why close your eyes?

145
00:10:04,877 --> 00:10:05,896
I don’t want to see.

146
00:10:06,568 --> 00:10:08,697
You’re totally blushing.

147
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,575
Are you leaving or not?

148
00:10:13,575 --> 00:10:14,218
No.

149
00:10:15,312 --> 00:10:16,080
Eh?

150
00:10:17,793 --> 00:10:19,793
I’m taking a shower now. Want to stick around?

151
00:10:19,793 --> 00:10:20,446
I’m taking these off then.

152
00:10:20,446 --> 00:10:21,485
Fine. I’m out of here, you jerk.

153
00:10:21,485 --> 00:10:22,530
You are such an ass, Kang.

154
00:12:01,493 --> 00:12:02,570
See you at school.

155
00:12:03,241 --> 00:12:04,164
Where are you going?

156
00:12:07,099 --> 00:12:08,331
Catching a bus to school.

157
00:12:09,099 --> 00:12:09,867
For what?

158
00:12:10,914 --> 00:12:12,785
Grandma wants you to come to school with me from now on.

159
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:17,179
Come on.

160
00:12:23,831 --> 00:12:24,644
Oh.

161
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,469
Can I borrow your phone? I'm getting tired of my playlist. 

162
00:12:52,634 --> 00:12:53,989
No, I’m not giving it up. 

163
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:55,767
Why don't you try a different streaming app? 

164
00:12:55,806 --> 00:12:59,160
Don’t you know that every person's phone has a unique playlist? 

165
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,640
The playlists are different.

166
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,393
Come on, let me have a listen to yours.

167
00:13:01,393 --> 00:13:02,433
No, I don’t give it.

168
00:13:03,702 --> 00:13:05,702
- Give it.
- No, Kang!

169
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:06,202
Let go of it.

170
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:06,883
Damn it, Kang.

171
00:13:07,582 --> 00:13:08,488
You’re not giving it to me?

172
00:13:08,694 --> 00:13:09,788
No.

173
00:13:11,695 --> 00:13:12,393
You asshole.

174
00:13:12,393 --> 00:13:13,798
You should have given it to me from the start.

175
00:13:15,868 --> 00:13:16,908
You listen to this song too?

176
00:13:17,373 --> 00:13:18,680
It’s my absolute favorite, you know?

177
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:21,200
Don’t claim it. That’s my jam.

178
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,373
I’ve been into it for ages.

179
00:13:22,373 --> 00:13:24,314
Bullshit. I’ve listened to it way before you.

180
00:13:24,314 --> 00:13:25,587
No, I’ve listened to it before you. I can sing every word. No kidding.

181
00:13:25,587 --> 00:13:26,536
No way. You’re bluffing.

182
00:13:26,536 --> 00:13:28,888
Let me see how many words you can sing.

183
00:13:28,888 --> 00:13:30,286
Alright. Watch me. I’ll keep my eye on you.

184
00:13:30,286 --> 00:13:31,609
I’m literally keeping my eye here. Look.

185
00:13:31,609 --> 00:13:32,420
I’m keeping it.

00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,541

I lost my tutor, and now I have to see him being all sweet with his student.

196
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:23,046
It really hurts.

197
00:14:23,691 --> 00:14:25,719
No teasing, please. Wanna grab something to eat?

198
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,324
Do you want to join us, Tutor?

199
00:14:29,324 --> 00:14:30,001
Hm? 

200
00:14:30,491 --> 00:14:31,224
Me?

201
00:14:32,393 --> 00:14:33,493
Hey, Kang.

202
00:14:34,267 --> 00:14:35,606
Let’s go eat.

203
00:14:37,406 --> 00:14:39,096
Nah, I’m good. You can go without me.

204
00:14:40,911 --> 00:14:41,702
Um.

205
00:14:43,147 --> 00:14:43,917
Let’s go.

206
00:14:46,634 --> 00:14:49,253
Hey! What are you doing here all by yourself?

207
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,389
Just standing…around.

208
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:54,810
Come on. Let’s grab a meal.

209
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:55,942
Yeah, my stomach is growling.

210
00:15:01,573 --> 00:15:03,263
This open house looks interesting.

211
00:15:03,263 --> 00:15:04,356
Let’s check it out. What do you say?

212
00:15:04,356 --> 00:15:06,356
Both of you are interested in going to the open house too?

213
00:15:06,356 --> 00:15:07,611
I'm planning to attend this Saturday.

214
00:15:07,611 --> 00:15:09,737
Are you going to the open house or on a date exactly?

215
00:15:09,737 --> 00:15:11,276
Why are you putting so much effort into picking what to wear?
