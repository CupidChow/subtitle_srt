4
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:21,001
About our kiss, what do you think about it?

5
00:00:21,507 --> 00:00:22,704
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

6
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:27,958
If you really want to win us over, just talk to us and hang out with us.

7
00:00:28,334 --> 00:00:30,334
Don’t just always rely on your wallet to do the talking.

8
00:00:30,334 --> 00:00:32,181
If this is too much, you can wait for us here, Young Master.

9
00:00:32,645 --> 00:00:33,494
I’m okay.

10
00:00:33,815 --> 00:00:36,304
You’re sweating like crazy. You won’t pass out on us, right?

11
00:00:36,915 --> 00:00:38,407
Do you think I don’t know about you and him?

12
00:00:38,448 --> 00:00:40,368
It was so obvious, even from Mars.

13
00:00:40,368 --> 00:00:41,598
I wanted to test him too.

14
00:00:41,952 --> 00:00:44,400
So we can go official now?

15
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,600
Woah!

16
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,613
Your room is seriously luxurious, way more luxurious than mine.

17
00:01:02,613 --> 00:01:03,494
Don’t change the subject.

18
00:01:04,117 --> 00:01:05,400
Tell me straight up, 

19
00:01:06,111 --> 00:01:08,967
how did you trick Grandma Ging into giving you a job here?

20
00:01:09,715 --> 00:01:10,992
I didn’t trick her.

21
00:01:10,992 --> 00:01:12,895
I was already working at that hospital, right?

22
00:01:12,895 --> 00:01:14,938
I ran into her and ended up taking care of her.

23
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:17,371
She happened to like me, so she decided to hire me.

24
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:18,087
That’s all there is to it.

25
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:21,733
Really?

26
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:24,800
Yes, really.

27
00:01:26,235 --> 00:01:27,834
No need to worry.

28
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:29,170
I know she's someone you owe a debt of gratitude to.

29
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,288
I wouldn't dare deceive her.

30
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:34,651
Alright, I believe you then.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,945
That’s my dear little bro.

32
00:01:37,945 --> 00:01:38,982
Stop it.

33
00:01:43,922 --> 00:01:48,545
Is that soundbar new? Is it expensive?

34
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:52,703
Let me take a look.

35
00:01:52,703 --> 00:01:55,374
Hold it right there. Get the hell out.

36
00:01:55,374 --> 00:01:56,361
Get out of here.

37
00:01:56,361 --> 00:01:57,461
Go the hell away.

38
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:00,388
You little jerk.

39
00:02:00,602 --> 00:02:01,829
I should be the one cursing you.

40
00:02:02,978 --> 00:02:03,864
You big jerk.

41
00:02:04,506 --> 00:02:07,065
Wow, 65 out of 100.

42
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:10,433
Shit, this is awesome. 

43
00:02:10,433 --> 00:02:11,538
You’re really getting better now.

44
00:02:11,676 --> 00:02:13,080
Because I’ve got a great tutor.

45
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,286
You've shown improvement.

46
00:02:16,286 --> 00:02:18,012
I don't have to worry about your exam tomorrow, I guess.

47
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,035
Um.

48
00:02:20,387 --> 00:02:21,200
Very good.

49
00:02:21,334 --> 00:02:23,672
Let's pack these up and head to bed then.

50
00:02:23,784 --> 00:02:25,597
I'll take a shower and then hit the sack as well.

51
00:02:25,597 --> 00:02:26,302
No, 

52
00:02:26,937 --> 00:02:28,130
I'll wait and go to bed at the same time as you.

53
00:02:28,746 --> 00:02:29,345
What?

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,100
Why on earth would you do that?

55
00:02:31,368 --> 00:02:32,539
We have our own bedrooms.

56
00:02:38,132 --> 00:02:38,959
Well,

57
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,443
I didn’t say we would sleep in our own beds.

58
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:43,106
Huh?

59
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:45,418
Can I sleep in your room?

60
00:02:45,525 --> 00:02:46,750
Please, boyfie. 

61
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:50,631
I promise I won't do anything inappropriate.

62
00:02:51,117 --> 00:02:52,090
Can I?

63
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,813
- No. 
- Please.

64
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,758
- No.
- I beg you.

65
00:02:55,963 --> 00:02:56,743
No.

66
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:57,336
Come on.

67
00:02:57,523 --> 00:02:58,540
Please let me.

68
00:02:59,754 --> 00:03:00,463
Can I?

69
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:01,594
Let me think about it.

70
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:04,120
If you let me sleep beside you, 

71
00:03:04,932 --> 00:03:06,825
I promise I'll do exceptionally well on my exam. 

72
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:08,445
I'll definitely score a perfect 100. 

73
00:03:08,964 --> 00:03:11,633
Just look at how well I did on this practice test. 

74
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:14,203
Can you really be that unkind to me?

75
00:03:15,675 --> 00:03:16,475
Huh?

76
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:18,467
Are you that cruel?

77
00:03:19,002 --> 00:03:20,041
Isn’t that a bit too heartless?

78
00:03:21,463 --> 00:03:22,821
Think it over carefully.

79
00:05:12,453 --> 00:05:14,453
I’m letting you sleep here just for tonight.

80
00:05:14,453 --> 00:05:15,191
Um.

81
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:32,800
Why the hell are you staring like that?

82
00:05:33,246 --> 00:05:34,213
Aren’t you going to sleep?

83
00:05:34,855 --> 00:05:36,209
You are staring at me like some sort of psycho.

84
00:05:37,352 --> 00:05:38,596
What’s so wrong with looking at you?

85
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,386
Or do you want me to kiss you?

86
00:05:43,104 --> 00:05:44,649
Go kiss my bloody feet first.

87
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,355
Hey,

88
00:05:48,355 --> 00:05:49,628
can I ask you something?

89
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,153
If you already had feelings for me since then,

90
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:55,271
how did you feel when you kissed me at the old gym?

91
00:05:59,104 --> 00:06:00,462
Well, to be honest…

92
00:06:02,498 --> 00:06:03,909
it was a mix of love and hate.

93
00:06:04,546 --> 00:06:08,045
At the time, it was more like making you feel defeated.

94
00:06:08,781 --> 00:06:10,647
You successfully did that.

95
00:06:11,825 --> 00:06:12,706
When?

96
00:06:17,224 --> 00:06:17,920
Every single time.

97
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:23,533
You’ve already won my heart.

98
00:06:26,193 --> 00:06:27,685
What’s so funny?

99
00:06:27,685 --> 00:06:28,470
You make me want to puke.

100
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,502
How dare you, jackass.

101
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,244
Enough. Can we go to sleep now?

102
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,456
Fine, I’ll go in a minute.

103
00:06:34,456 --> 00:06:35,640
Go to sleep already.

104
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:38,360
Okay, just one more question before I sleep.

105
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,477
A serious one.

106
00:06:39,477 --> 00:06:40,197
Alright, go ahead.

107
00:06:40,197 --> 00:06:41,050
I’m being serious.

108
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:41,953
I get it, be serious.

109
00:06:46,525 --> 00:06:47,445
Can I hug you?

110
00:06:49,051 --> 00:06:49,917
Huh?

111
00:06:49,917 --> 00:06:50,798
Can I hug you?

112
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,731
Please, come on. Let me hug you.

113
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,555
You said you’d just sleep and wouldn’t do anything inappropriate.

114
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,964
How is a hug inappropriate?

115
00:06:58,628 --> 00:07:00,120
Will you simply let me hug you?

116
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,650
Or do you want me to keep asking for this until we graduate?

117
00:07:05,267 --> 00:07:06,946
That sounds familiar somehow.

118
00:07:08,106 --> 00:07:08,797
Alright,

119
00:07:09,413 --> 00:07:10,454
you can hug me if you want.

120
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:12,143
You’re really letting me hug you?

121
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,334
Um.

122
00:07:13,762 --> 00:07:16,457
- Are you going to do it or not? One…two…
- Alright.

123
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:21,644
I really love this.

124
00:07:22,715 --> 00:07:23,517
Thank you

125
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,087
for making me pay so much attention to my studies,

126
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,844
and for helping me get better grades.

127
00:07:29,498 --> 00:07:30,243
Thank you.

128
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:32,703
Alright.

129
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:34,633
Thank you too.

130
00:07:34,874 --> 00:07:35,394
What was that?

131
00:07:35,394 --> 00:07:36,525
I thank you too.

132
00:07:36,525 --> 00:07:37,352
My pleasure.

133
00:07:38,642 --> 00:07:39,919
Go to sleep already.

134
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,919
Don’t be so loud. Saifah might hear you.

135
00:07:42,107 --> 00:07:42,965
No one can hear it.

136
00:07:42,965 --> 00:07:44,560
No! Go to sleep already.

137
00:07:46,214 --> 00:07:48,134
Let’s not sleep and come study with me then.

138
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:03,510
My dear bro, I’ve made you breakfast. Get up and eat.

139
00:08:08,448 --> 00:08:09,210
Hey!

140
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:10,849
- Are you not out of your bed yet?
- Saifah.

141
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:12,542
-You have exams today, don’t you?
- Saifah.

142
00:08:13,518 --> 00:08:15,518
I’m already up.

143
00:08:25,052 --> 00:08:26,945
What’s the matter with you? Why so loud?

144
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:28,913
Gotcha.

145
00:08:29,496 --> 00:08:33,316
That caught-off-guard look tells me you're definitely hiding something.

146
00:08:34,302 --> 00:08:35,289
What do you mean?

147
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,623
Hiding what?

148
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:38,638
I literally just woke up.

149
00:08:39,707 --> 00:08:41,225
I’m still half asleep.

150
00:08:41,385 --> 00:08:42,974
Look at you. You're acting all suspicious.

151
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,432
Hey.

152
00:08:44,726 --> 00:08:47,827
This reminds me of when you tried to hide porn during junior high.

153
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:49,493
You looked just as suspicious.

154
00:08:49,493 --> 00:08:52,815
Tell this brother of yours what you are hiding this time?

155
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:53,542
What is it?

156
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:54,970
I’m not hiding anything. No!

157
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,864
I already told you I’m not hiding anything.

158
00:08:57,864 --> 00:08:58,924
You just imagined things.

159
00:09:00,423 --> 00:09:02,901
But I've got this feeling that something's off.

160
00:09:07,124 --> 00:09:08,088
There’s nothing.

161
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:10,034
You sure about that?

162
00:09:10,034 --> 00:09:11,120
What are you trying to find here?

163
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:13,271
Could it be–

164
00:09:23,783 --> 00:09:26,077
Are you secretly petting a cat in this room?

165
00:09:27,926 --> 00:09:29,203
What the hell are you talking about?

166
00:09:29,813 --> 00:09:30,960
You might be mistaking it for the sound of the wind.

167
00:09:32,249 --> 00:09:33,015
The sound of the wind.

168
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,132
Wind, my foot!

169
00:09:37,634 --> 00:09:38,764
Hey.

170
00:09:38,951 --> 00:09:39,821
“Hey” what?

171
00:09:45,158 --> 00:09:46,730
Meow.

172
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:51,932
(Where is he?)

173
00:09:53,705 --> 00:09:55,892
See? I told you there was nothing to see.

174
00:09:56,342 --> 00:09:57,753
What was that sound I heard?

175
00:09:58,249 --> 00:10:00,142
I told you it’s the sound of the wind.

176
00:10:03,944 --> 00:10:05,944
Just get out of here. I’ll hit the shower and be right there.

177
00:10:07,281 --> 00:10:08,639
Is there a ghost in this house?

178
00:10:09,823 --> 00:10:10,652
A ghost?

179
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,171
It’s you.

180
00:10:13,862 --> 00:10:14,829
Or something else?

181
00:10:16,301 --> 00:10:17,067
A ghost?

182
00:10:17,756 --> 00:10:18,659
What was that sound then?

183
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,354
Seriously, get the hell out already.

184
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:21,804
I’ll take a shower and be right there.

185
00:10:23,849 --> 00:10:25,769
Is there a ghost here? There’s probably not.

186
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,763
Gosh.

187
00:10:33,753 --> 00:10:34,897
Where are Kang and Sailom?

188
00:10:36,081 --> 00:10:39,232
They just grabbed some sandwiches and went off to tutor.

189
00:10:39,653 --> 00:10:42,000
Man, they're so committed as if they’re entering an Academic Olympics.

190
00:10:43,467 --> 00:10:44,423
It's kinda funny, isn't it?

191
00:10:44,423 --> 00:10:47,560
I never imagined I'd see these two gangs sitting at the same table like this.

192
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:51,043
Kang asked us to.

193
00:10:51,412 --> 00:10:52,796
He wanted us to get along with these guys.

194
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:54,416
So it's just a nice gesture, really.

195
00:10:54,812 --> 00:10:56,812
If Sailom hadn't asked us to, we wouldn't be here either.

196
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,718
So, I guess I won't get to witness your epic showdown.

197
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:07,640
Weren't you challenging each other to have a fight after Sports Day?

198
00:11:08,154 --> 00:11:11,278
I even placed a bet on your side.

199
00:11:11,601 --> 00:11:14,109
I never said we wouldn't fight.

200
00:11:14,854 --> 00:11:16,479
We just haven't set a date yet, that's all.

201
00:11:19,352 --> 00:11:20,112
What do you say?

202
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:21,807
How about this evening?

203
00:11:22,004 --> 00:11:23,160
I have football practice.

204
00:11:23,597 --> 00:11:24,554
How about this Friday?

205
00:11:24,554 --> 00:11:25,918
I've got plans with my dad.

206
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:28,120
Then the next Friday after our exams, okay?

207
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,910
Deal.

208
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,736
Hold on, you guys.

209
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:33,005
Why are you taking this so seriously?

210
00:11:33,268 --> 00:11:34,437
I brought it up just for fun.

211
00:11:34,437 --> 00:11:36,865
Yeah, aren't you two already best buds?

212
00:11:36,865 --> 00:11:37,800
Who’s his best bud?

213
00:11:38,328 --> 00:11:39,085
What?

214
00:11:40,048 --> 00:11:41,291
But you share the same minds?

215
00:11:44,845 --> 00:11:46,310
Want this crispy pork?

216
00:11:46,697 --> 00:11:49,360
Next Friday, you might not be able to chew properly.

217
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:51,680
How about this fried chicken?

218
00:11:51,937 --> 00:11:54,740
Next Friday, you might end up eating soft-boiled rice in the hospital, you dipshit.

219
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:11,435
Tomorrow is a day off.

220
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,774
Can I play football?

221
00:12:13,898 --> 00:12:14,874
I don’t think that’s a good idea.

222
00:12:15,157 --> 00:12:16,729
You’ve got four more exams the day after.

223
00:12:16,729 --> 00:12:17,609
Will you have enough time to cover everything?

224
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:18,454
Right.

225
00:12:19,616 --> 00:12:20,867
I should head back and hit the book.

226
00:12:37,238 --> 00:12:38,275
Alright.

227
00:12:39,206 --> 00:12:41,206
Since you’ve shown dedication for the past few days.

228
00:12:42,001 --> 00:12:42,864
I’ll let you play football today.

229
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,240
But…

230
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:47,479
you have to be home no later than 8 p.m.

231
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,131
for tutoring.

232
00:12:50,014 --> 00:12:51,053
You sure about that?

233
00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:52,228
Take it or leave it.

234
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,225
Why is my boyfriend this lovely?

235
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,367
Thank you.

236
00:12:59,795 --> 00:13:00,419
Thanks a bunch.

237
00:13:01,795 --> 00:13:03,560
I may change my mind because of that.

238
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:05,541
See you at 8. Muah Muah!

239
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:06,272
8 p.m. okay?

240
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,191
Seriously.

241
00:13:10,871 --> 00:13:13,594
If he's half as dedicated to studying as he is to football, that'd be nice.

242
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:35,584
(Sorry, the number you’ve dialed cannot be connected at this time.)

243
00:13:35,584 --> 00:13:37,032
Why isn't he answering my call?

244
00:13:39,436 --> 00:13:40,687
He must have turned his phone off.

245
00:13:41,538 --> 00:13:43,832
And I doubt he's planning to come back for tutoring tonight. Trust me.

246
00:13:43,832 --> 00:13:46,643
(Sorry, the number you’ve dialed cannot be connected at this time.)

247
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:50,981
Don't make baseless assumptions.

248
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:52,614
I don’t.

249
00:13:52,936 --> 00:13:55,043
I've met plenty of spoiled rich kids at my patients’ places.

250
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,704
All they want to do is laze around and enjoy themselves day in day out.

251
00:13:57,842 --> 00:13:59,200
They always look for chances to skip out.

252
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,010
Who wants to be bothered with studying? Seriously?

253
00:14:17,469 --> 00:14:18,346
Sailom,

254
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:20,673
are you going to watch this, or should I turn it off?

255
00:14:22,676 --> 00:14:23,759
I'm not watching it.

256
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:29,360
I'm heading to bed then.

257
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:53,419
(Sorry, the number you’ve dialed cannot be…)

258
00:15:16,073 --> 00:15:16,983
I'm sorry I...

259
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,287
What time did you promise me you'd be here?

260
00:15:20,195 --> 00:15:20,898
Can you please calm down first?

261
00:15:20,898 --> 00:15:23,801
If you don't want to study, just be honest with me.

262
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,014
It's not what you're thinking. Please calm down.

263
00:15:26,014 --> 00:15:27,963
I actually thought you had changed.

264
00:15:28,796 --> 00:15:32,321
Turns out, you're still the same spoiled rich kid.

265
00:15:33,901 --> 00:15:34,851
I was wrong.

266
00:15:36,216 --> 00:15:37,748
I guess I put too much trust in you.

267
00:15:42,161 --> 00:15:44,589
So, I've always been a jerk in your eyes, right?

268
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,468
That's a positive sign. 

269
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:17,076
I can feel that Kang is changing and becoming a better person.

270
00:16:17,772 --> 00:16:18,697
How so?
