4
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:21,742
I was thinking since I’m already in Korat. Should I go to the training camp?

5
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:23,133
Where are you headed?

6
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:24,273
Korat.

7
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:29,151
I talked to him. What he told me is not what you think at all.

8
00:00:29,453 --> 00:00:33,231
It’s a promise I made with my wife before she passed away.

9
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,000
What happened?

10
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,983
He just confessed that he shot Mr. Kongkiat.

11
00:00:42,165 --> 00:00:45,943
You should go pack your things and get out of my house.

12
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,910
M.5 SEMESTER 2 STARTS

13
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:06,467
Take it easy, man.

14
00:01:07,521 --> 00:01:08,568
Come on. Get in there.

15
00:01:09,753 --> 00:01:12,243
Look at your knee. You shouldn’t have come to school.

16
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:14,086
Why not wait until it's fully healed?

17
00:01:15,114 --> 00:01:16,599
I’m kinda worried about Sailom.

18
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:17,921
He hasn’t answered my calls.

19
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,344
Let’s go check on him this evening.

20
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:20,975
Yeah. Let’s do that.

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,798
Can you put these away for me?

22
00:01:24,654 --> 00:01:26,912
Hey. Speaking of the devil.

23
00:01:27,627 --> 00:01:28,591
Where the hell have you been?

24
00:01:29,627 --> 00:01:32,724
Sorry, guys. I’ve been busy lately.

25
00:01:44,148 --> 00:01:45,993
Hey! What are you guys gossiping about?

26
00:01:48,303 --> 00:01:49,324
Well, sit down.

27
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:22,313
Thanks a lot, Kang.

28
00:02:25,557 --> 00:02:27,299
That would be the last time I helped you. 

29
00:02:28,364 --> 00:02:29,746
Whatever you do from now on is no longer my concern.

30
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:50,341
Sailom. Hey!

31
00:02:51,063 --> 00:02:52,427
- You still with us?
- Huh?

32
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,262
What did you say?

33
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:56,762
Come queue up with me.

34
00:02:56,762 --> 00:02:57,583
Are you alright? 

35
00:02:58,162 --> 00:02:59,270
Is there anything we can do to help you?

36
00:03:00,326 --> 00:03:01,218
Well…

37
00:03:01,857 --> 00:03:03,290
I want to let you guys know that…

38
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:04,809
that…

39
00:03:07,641 --> 00:03:08,504
that…

40
00:03:10,308 --> 00:03:11,548
I need to take a shit.

41
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:14,137
I’ll catch up with you guys after a quick visit to the restroom.

42
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:17,525
You got me so worried that I almost pooped my pants too.

43
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,965
Hurry up, okay?

44
00:03:20,581 --> 00:03:22,890
And you, lend me a hand. My legs are killing me.

45
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:23,892
I’m starving.

46
00:03:24,452 --> 00:03:26,658
Careful. You might trip and bang your head on the floor.

47
00:03:26,658 --> 00:03:28,096
I’m walking with one leg here.

48
00:03:40,695 --> 00:03:41,767
You may come in.

49
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,962
Well…

50
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:54,604
There's something I need to talk to you about.

51
00:05:50,547 --> 00:05:51,469
Sailom.

52
00:05:52,242 --> 00:05:53,707
Sailom. Sailom.

53
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:56,560
Sailom.

54
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,905
Wait up, Sailom.

55
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,167
The director told me you are quitting school.

56
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,278
Yes.

57
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,737
With everything that's going on, I shouldn't continue studying here with the scholarship from Kang's father.

58
00:06:08,485 --> 00:06:10,485
You can still apply for other scholarships.

59
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:11,843
I’ll help you.

60
00:06:12,285 --> 00:06:14,027
Don’t give up on your future like this.

61
00:06:15,545 --> 00:06:17,184
I don’t have the luxury to think about my future right now.

62
00:06:17,568 --> 00:06:20,238
Just trying to get through each day is already a challenge for me.

63
00:06:21,187 --> 00:06:24,243
Anyway, I’m grateful to you for teaching me throughout the first semester.

64
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:29,332
Are you really sure about this?

65
00:06:31,445 --> 00:06:32,163
Um.

66
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:34,161
I’ve thought it through.

67
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:37,989
If you don’t want to use the scholarship from Kang’s father,

68
00:06:38,196 --> 00:06:41,433
I can ask my father to sponsor a new scholarship for you.

69
00:06:42,934 --> 00:06:44,223
It’s okay, Pimfah.

70
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:45,372
Don’t make it even more complicated.

71
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:49,863
I don’t think Kang is comfortable seeing me around.

72
00:06:50,188 --> 00:06:51,067
But…

73
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:51,776
Cut it.

74
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:54,726
Sailom has made his decision. He won’t change it.

75
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,105
If you ever need my help, just tell me, okay?

76
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,323
Well, I’m sorry about this.

77
00:07:09,425 --> 00:07:10,000
Sorry.

78
00:07:31,404 --> 00:07:33,765
Hey, Sailom. You’re short of money again this month?

79
00:07:33,765 --> 00:07:37,133
Hello, Mom. Sailom eats only an omelet with rice again.

80
00:07:37,804 --> 00:07:39,856
Can I have two more drumsticks?

81
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:44,842
Sailom, I’m sorry to drag you into this mess.

82
00:07:46,722 --> 00:07:48,000
I’ll help you finish it.

83
00:07:49,441 --> 00:07:50,616
Here. Eat this.

84
00:07:53,597 --> 00:07:54,875
Take my apologies.

85
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,834
Don’t make him do this.

86
00:07:57,152 --> 00:07:58,520
I can prostrate at your feet instead of him. Please, leave him alone.

87
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,504
No, Auto.

88
00:08:00,504 --> 00:08:01,246
I can take off my shirt too.

89
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:02,347
No. Get up.

90
00:08:02,347 --> 00:08:04,476
You can go out with him. I’m cool with it.

91
00:08:46,338 --> 00:08:47,093
Hold on, Kang.

92
00:08:52,942 --> 00:08:53,929
Thank you…

93
00:08:56,449 --> 00:08:57,779
for the care you’ve given me all this time.

94
00:09:33,752 --> 00:09:35,340
This pin is no longer yours.

95
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:25,000
Ouch, Doc. It really hurts.

96
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,160
Please hang in there a bit. We’ve almost finished all three sets.

97
00:10:28,414 --> 00:10:31,320
Ouch. I can’t do this anymore. Can you stop?

98
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,417
I understand this is painful for you,

99
00:10:33,645 --> 00:10:35,000
but you must try to endure it.

100
00:10:35,192 --> 00:10:37,295
If you can’t bend your knee within one week,

101
00:10:37,295 --> 00:10:39,560
you may not regain your previous mobility.

102
00:10:41,488 --> 00:10:42,406
I know.

103
00:10:43,588 --> 00:10:46,773
How about a 10-minute break, and then we resume?

104
00:10:47,984 --> 00:10:48,549
Alright.

105
00:11:22,032 --> 00:11:25,000
Are you doing alright?

106
00:11:27,989 --> 00:11:28,842
I…

107
00:11:34,062 --> 00:11:35,186
I’ve quit school.

108
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:51,153
Why the hell did you quit? You were so close to graduating!

109
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:55,950
Why?!!

110
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,024
Then tell me the truth!

111
00:12:03,536 --> 00:12:05,000
You told me to live my life.

112
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,214
So I’m gonna live it the way I choose.

113
00:12:11,462 --> 00:12:15,000
I’ll do whatever it takes to get you out.

114
00:12:20,648 --> 00:12:21,772
That’s all I’m here to say.

115
00:12:25,148 --> 00:12:26,080
Sailom!

116
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,521
You don’t need to worry.

117
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:02,449
I’ll help look out for your brother as best as I can.

118
00:13:34,488 --> 00:13:35,148
Here. 

119
00:13:35,661 --> 00:13:39,413
I’ll give you extra today for having worked since the morning shift.

120
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,260
Thank you so much, boss.

121
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:43,199
Alright, see you.

122
00:13:50,749 --> 00:13:51,593
Wow.

123
00:14:06,517 --> 00:14:07,357
The f**k?

124
00:14:07,357 --> 00:14:08,844
Shit.

125
00:14:19,182 --> 00:14:20,615
Oh, shit.

126
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:31,470
Hey!

127
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,823
I’ve never done anything to you.

128
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,338
Did you get the wrong guy?

129
00:14:42,513 --> 00:14:43,431
Get on!

130
00:14:48,281 --> 00:14:49,147
Go!

131
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:55,797
I think this is the best place to be for now. 

132
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:57,894
If those guys come after you, you can head to the police station and file a report.

133
00:14:58,407 --> 00:14:59,171
Thanks.

134
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:03,200
So, you’ve been following me?

135
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,000
Why were you there at the time?
