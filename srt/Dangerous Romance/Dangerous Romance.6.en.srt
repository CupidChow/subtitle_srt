4
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:20,641
This open house looks interesting.

5
00:00:20,783 --> 00:00:23,956
 Both of you are interested in going to the open house too?

6
00:00:23,956 --> 00:00:26,185
 Are you going to the open house or on a date exactly?

7
00:00:26,185 --> 00:00:27,694
 Why are you putting so much effort into picking what to wear?

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,000
 You look absolutely stunning today. 

9
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:33,839
 May I ask what they are doing with those locks?

10
00:00:33,839 --> 00:00:36,864
 If you hang a lock on the fence, you will get admitted here. 

11
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:40,550
 It's even better if you do it with someone you like, then both of you could get in together. 

12
00:00:41,302 --> 00:00:42,416
 Since when?

13
00:00:58,008 --> 00:01:01,598
For this one, you can substitute (x) with 5,

14
00:01:02,138 --> 00:01:04,268
and substitute (y) with…

15
00:01:09,038 --> 00:01:11,325
Oops. I got busted. 

16
00:01:11,601 --> 00:01:13,601
I even pretended to go home already.

17
00:01:15,147 --> 00:01:16,208
Since when?

18
00:01:21,306 --> 00:01:22,214
I’m not really sure.

19
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,652
I didn’t have feelings for him right from the start.

20
00:01:27,055 --> 00:01:30,680
But after I found out about the hardships he has to go through 

21
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,421
and that he has to work to support himself.

22
00:01:35,726 --> 00:01:40,000
I was really impressed by what a great guy he is.

23
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,300
Before I knew it,

24
00:01:43,134 --> 00:01:44,882
I found myself watching him all the time.

25
00:01:46,577 --> 00:01:48,248
When I look at him,

26
00:01:49,812 --> 00:01:53,818
I feel like I can gather the courage to do many things.

27
00:01:54,896 --> 00:01:57,018
So, I want to study at the same university as him.

28
00:01:59,242 --> 00:02:00,199
What about you?

29
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:01,894
What are you doing here?

30
00:02:03,435 --> 00:02:05,435
Well, I…

31
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:10,045
I’m looking for some souvenirs.

32
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,466
And I found this lock on the ground.

33
00:02:13,584 --> 00:02:14,195
Kang.

34
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,829
Kang!

35
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:18,356
What’s up?

36
00:02:18,773 --> 00:02:20,920
Are you alright?

37
00:02:21,496 --> 00:02:22,636
Did you catch what I just said?

38
00:02:23,934 --> 00:02:25,308
Sorry, I was thinking about something else.

39
00:02:28,197 --> 00:02:31,553
Alright then, let's call it a day. 

40
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:33,281
You don't seem able to focus right now.

41
00:02:52,562 --> 00:02:54,249
How’s your back pain?

42
00:02:54,505 --> 00:02:56,157
It still bothers me from time to time.

43
00:02:56,157 --> 00:02:57,600
It’s common for people my age.

44
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:02,705
Hey, Kang. It’s good that you are here.

45
00:03:03,091 --> 00:03:04,726
Can you keep Pimfah company?

46
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:06,558
Well, I have to..

47
00:03:06,558 --> 00:03:09,555
Come on. Stay and keep her company.

48
00:03:09,808 --> 00:03:11,808
I’ll go inside and peel some fruits for you.

49
00:03:12,684 --> 00:03:13,719
Wait a moment, dear.

50
00:03:23,461 --> 00:03:26,440
Your father is here for another business talk with my father?

51
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:28,784
Yes.

52
00:03:29,514 --> 00:03:30,828
Aren’t you supposed to have tutoring tonight?

53
00:03:31,705 --> 00:03:34,305
Or are you slacking off?

54
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:38,185
I’m actually considering this.

55
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:40,142
I think I will quit tutoring with Sailom.

56
00:03:40,877 --> 00:03:42,616
What? Why?

57
00:03:44,513 --> 00:03:45,835
Do you want him back as your tutor?

58
00:03:48,463 --> 00:03:49,760
Are you serious or just joking?

59
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:51,558
I’m serious.

60
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,495
I feel really awkward having to study with him right now.

61
00:03:57,172 --> 00:03:57,741
Do you want him back?

62
00:03:57,741 --> 00:04:00,000
Come on, Kang. He is a person.

63
00:04:00,201 --> 00:04:03,009
He is not something you can just toss around.

64
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,926
Stop behaving this way already

65
00:04:05,999 --> 00:04:07,869
Seems like whatever shit I do is always wrong.

66
00:04:07,869 --> 00:04:09,001
Calm down, please.

67
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:10,872
I didn’t mean it that way.

68
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:12,542
Give me an honest answer.

69
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,814
Have I ever seemed good in your eyes?

70
00:04:17,901 --> 00:04:19,354
You’re a good guy, Kang.

71
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,601
You’re sincere to the people you love.

72
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:24,301
You look out for those you care about.

73
00:04:25,235 --> 00:04:28,799
That’s why I see you as one of my best friends.

74
00:06:38,935 --> 00:06:41,456
Sorry to interrupt your time here. It won’t take long.

75
00:06:41,582 --> 00:06:42,852
Well, right now, 

76
00:06:42,852 --> 00:06:45,225
all the teams are recruiting cheerleaders and preparing for practice.

77
00:06:45,225 --> 00:06:49,742
I'm wondering if anyone is interested in becoming a cheerleader or would like to nominate someone?

78
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,090
Nava, do you want to be a cheerleader?

79
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,889
No. I believe you are the perfect choice for this.

80
00:06:56,595 --> 00:06:58,413
What? Me?

81
00:06:59,061 --> 00:06:59,764
Yeah.

82
00:07:00,364 --> 00:07:01,974
You are pretty, smart,

83
00:07:02,306 --> 00:07:04,775
and have leadership qualities, all in one person. 

84
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,074
You are undoubtedly our representative.

85
00:07:07,356 --> 00:07:08,423
Right, everyone?

86
00:07:08,605 --> 00:07:10,000
Yes.

87
00:07:11,071 --> 00:07:14,557
If we’ve got Pimfah, who else should we nominate, folks?

88
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:17,440
It’s Kang right here.

89
00:07:17,913 --> 00:07:21,686
Who agrees that we should send Kang to be our male cheerleader? 

90
00:07:21,686 --> 00:07:23,685
Clap your hands if you do.

91
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,332
Nah. I’m gonna pass.

92
00:07:29,706 --> 00:07:30,843
I have tutoring schedules.

93
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,901
You do?

94
00:07:32,205 --> 00:07:35,170
About that, I can shuffle the schedules for you.

95
00:07:35,868 --> 00:07:38,415
When an opportunity knocks, you should grab it.

96
00:07:41,114 --> 00:07:43,505
Now that tutoring is not in the way,

97
00:07:43,888 --> 00:07:48,704
we can totally nominate our ship couple–Pimfah and Kang–to be cheerleaders.

98
00:07:48,704 --> 00:07:51,292
Let’s hear it for them, folks.

99
00:08:03,106 --> 00:08:04,689
Why did you team up with them on this?

100
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,622
I was trying to avoid it.

101
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:10,000
At the open house, you said you were interested in Mass Com, right?

102
00:08:10,377 --> 00:08:14,124
Being a cheerleader is a great addition to your profile, you know?

103
00:08:15,205 --> 00:08:17,023
You’ve got this. Just do your best.

104
00:08:42,116 --> 00:08:45,264
I used to be a cheerleader in this school,

105
00:08:45,265 --> 00:08:47,030
so I know a thing or two about it.

106
00:08:47,311 --> 00:08:50,380
That’s why this year, I’ll be your cheerleading trainer.

107
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,659
Let’s give it our best together.

108
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:59,840
I’ve prepared a video clip of the choreography.

109
00:09:00,012 --> 00:09:01,465
I’ll show it to you all.

110
00:09:01,851 --> 00:09:04,868
[Here we go. “Si Leung” is Yellow.]

111
00:09:04,868 --> 00:09:06,589
Wait. Hold on.

112
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:07,321
Not this clip.

113
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,137
Where did I keep it? Oi.

114
00:09:10,443 --> 00:09:11,747
Take it easy, Teacher.

115
00:09:11,956 --> 00:09:14,347
I’ll help search for some on the internet. It should be quick.

116
00:09:14,647 --> 00:09:17,720
How about we assign the positions in our formation first?

117
00:09:18,062 --> 00:09:21,600
Ah, yes that. I’ve already planned it out

118
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,283
I’ll divide you into pairs, one male and one female,

119
00:09:25,283 --> 00:09:28,480
with a main pair in the center.

120
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,049
Who do you think should be our main pair?

121
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,292
That must be our ship couple right here,

122
00:09:33,665 --> 00:09:35,769
Kanghan and Pimfah.

123
00:09:41,518 --> 00:09:43,648
Excuse me, I’m not feeling well right now.

124
00:09:44,061 --> 00:09:45,618
May I go to the nurse’s office?

125
00:09:46,212 --> 00:09:47,065
Sure.

126
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,900
Hey, Kang. Aren’t you supposed to be at cheerleading practice?

127
00:10:23,931 --> 00:10:26,452
Screw it. Seriously, you should’ve not nominated me.

128
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:27,880
My bad, sorry.

129
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,000
I thought you wanted to be with Pimfah.

130
00:10:30,644 --> 00:10:34,521
Well, I’m playing football with the seniors. Wanna join us?

131
00:10:35,206 --> 00:10:36,033
Yeah, sure. Why not?

132
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:37,175
Great. Let’s go.

133
00:10:38,254 --> 00:10:40,254
Can we start over? We have one more player here.

134
00:10:43,696 --> 00:10:44,584
Yes!

135
00:10:51,544 --> 00:10:52,369
Yes!

136
00:10:53,557 --> 00:10:54,514
Woohoo!

137
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,827
Well play, man.

138
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:04,641
This is seriously tiring.

139
00:11:04,641 --> 00:11:05,304
Tell me about it.

140
00:11:08,344 --> 00:11:09,191
Hey.

141
00:11:09,191 --> 00:11:11,320
With the skills you just showed, I think you should be in a better place.

142
00:11:12,321 --> 00:11:13,202
It’s you.

143
00:11:13,202 --> 00:11:14,112
Me?

144
00:11:14,655 --> 00:11:17,724
Wait, those lines sound familiar.

145
00:11:17,724 --> 00:11:19,792
Are you inviting him to be a chef?

146
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:20,770
No, to join my football team.

147
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
My friend, Boss, is so lame at the forward position.

148
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,498
I’d like to have a talented striker like your friend on my team.

149
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:26,144
Are you interested in joining us for Sports Day?

150
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:31,880
But he's already been recruited to be a cheerleader. 

151
00:11:32,404 --> 00:11:33,382
That's a shame, right?

152
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,359
How about this?

153
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:36,964
Do you want me instead?

154
00:11:37,377 --> 00:11:39,440
I'm also a skilled striker, you know?

155
00:11:40,162 --> 00:11:44,143
Don't you have any dreams like becoming a singer or an actor?

156
00:11:45,285 --> 00:11:50,335
No. Those big dreams are more for rich kids like you, I think.

157
00:11:52,068 --> 00:11:53,153
That’s not true.

158
00:11:54,068 --> 00:11:55,609
I don’t really have a dream.

159
00:11:55,987 --> 00:11:57,149
Well then…

160
00:11:57,253 --> 00:11:58,091
I’m in.

161
00:11:58,938 --> 00:12:00,130
I’ll quit cheerleading tomorrow.

162
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,965
I knew you were special. Welcome on board.

163
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,545
Seriously? 

164
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,157
The spotlight was about to be on me, and then you pulled the plug.

165
00:12:25,172 --> 00:12:30,326
Here you are, guys. Your drinks and snacks.

166
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:31,575
Here you go.

167
00:12:31,575 --> 00:12:32,731
Hey, guys.

168
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:34,588
We’ve got your drinks and snacks right here.

169
00:12:35,001 --> 00:12:35,825
Auto.

170
00:12:35,825 --> 00:12:36,349
Yes?

171
00:12:36,349 --> 00:12:37,716
Pass on my thanks to your mother.

172
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:39,750
That’ll be 500 baht, Teacher.

173
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,656
Huh?

174
00:12:41,032 --> 00:12:41,909
Kidding.

175
00:12:41,909 --> 00:12:43,032
It’s free.

176
00:12:43,677 --> 00:12:44,694
You totally caught me off guard there.

177
00:12:44,694 --> 00:12:45,468
Just kidding.

178
00:12:45,468 --> 00:12:46,062
Okay.

179
00:12:49,498 --> 00:12:50,158
Pimfah,

180
00:12:50,992 --> 00:12:52,150
where’s Kanghan?

181
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:56,280
He said he was not feeling well and went to the nurse’s office.

182
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,538
I don’t know how he’s doing now either.

183
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:03,627
Place your hands like this.

184
00:13:03,914 --> 00:13:04,536
Um.

185
00:13:04,713 --> 00:13:05,817
Then put them at the back.

186
00:13:07,068 --> 00:13:07,782
Alright.

187
00:13:08,229 --> 00:13:08,923
Chest up.

188
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,255
Chest up?

189
00:13:11,546 --> 00:13:12,410
One

190
00:13:12,976 --> 00:13:13,721
One

191
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:14,894
two,

192
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,912
three.

193
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,177
That’s not hard.

194
00:13:18,307 --> 00:13:20,302
I think I can do it now. Thanks a bunch, Pimfah.

195
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:23,281
That’s pretty much what we learned today.

196
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:25,195
Please help teach Kanghan this routine.

197
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:26,427
I need to use the bathroom for a moment.

198
00:13:26,427 --> 00:13:27,149
Sure, no problem.

199
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:30,596
Two, three.

200
00:13:34,358 --> 00:13:35,183
Three.

201
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,810
Hey, Kang.

202
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,631
How are you doing?

203
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,851
Feeling any better?

204
00:13:43,851 --> 00:13:45,103
I’ve already practiced the routine for you.

205
00:13:45,426 --> 00:13:47,348
I can help teach it to you tonight.

206
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:49,247
Or, if you're up for it, we can go through it right now.

207
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,319
Can you just stay out of my business?

208
00:13:52,992 --> 00:13:55,000
Hey. I’m trying to help you here.

209
00:13:56,239 --> 00:13:58,369
This is your chance to be with Pimfah.

210
00:13:58,651 --> 00:14:00,000
Don’t blow it on the very first day.

211
00:14:00,717 --> 00:14:04,464
So that's why you pushed me into cheerleading?

212
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:06,946
Hell yeah.

213
00:14:07,128 --> 00:14:08,586
Not only does it beef up your portfolio,

214
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:09,992
but you also get to be close to the person you like. 

215
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,340
That's why I encouraged you to join the cheerleading squad. 

216
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,998
You can even use this chance to confess your feelings to her. 

217
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,291
I believe that Pimfah has feelings for you too.

218
00:14:20,146 --> 00:14:21,833
Are you interested in tutoring me?

219
00:14:23,836 --> 00:14:26,775
Auto said you are still looking for a part-time job.

220
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,544
Since when?

221
00:14:30,883 --> 00:14:31,692
I’m not really sure.

222
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:33,888
Before I knew it,

223
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,560
I found myself watching him all the time.

224
00:14:37,508 --> 00:14:38,565
Do me a favor.

225
00:14:38,982 --> 00:14:40,603
Leave me the hell alone.

226
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,060
Hey, what's going on with you? 

227
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:46,084
You and Pimfah seem like a perfect match.

228
00:14:46,934 --> 00:14:48,143
Have you confessed to her?

229
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,393
Listen to me.

230
00:14:51,285 --> 00:14:53,050
Pimfah doesn’t like me.

231
00:14:53,645 --> 00:14:54,637
She likes you.

232
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:57,027
Are you satisfied now?

233
00:15:19,827 --> 00:15:23,280
He didn't come to practice today. Is everything alright?

234
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:24,892
I don't think Kang is ever coming to cheerleading practice.

235
00:15:25,001 --> 00:15:29,295
Well then, would you like to be my partner in cheerleading instead of Kang?
