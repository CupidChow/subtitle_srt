4
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,000
Do you think all people are equal?

5
00:00:38,925 --> 00:00:39,845
Obviously,

6
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:41,676
people aren't the same

7
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:45,622
from their races, 

8
00:00:45,947 --> 00:00:47,115
appearance and skin colors, 

9
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:49,572
or the societies they belong to.

10
00:00:52,269 --> 00:00:56,120
I just wish that kids like us had equal social opportunities.

11
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:00,241
But it's unlikely.

12
00:01:01,377 --> 00:01:05,040
The poorer your family, the fewer opportunities you have in life.

13
00:01:07,878 --> 00:01:09,791
Whereas kids born with spoon silvers in their mouths,

14
00:01:09,952 --> 00:01:13,956
can just follow the rules of society to be successful.

15
00:01:20,752 --> 00:01:22,484
Because of this disparity, 

16
00:01:23,048 --> 00:01:24,941
I strive to lift myself up.

17
00:01:31,628 --> 00:01:33,494
But as I reach a certain point,

18
00:01:33,788 --> 00:01:36,000
fate pulls me back to where I started again.

19
00:01:46,046 --> 00:01:49,039
Do you think all people are equal?

20
00:01:59,598 --> 00:02:03,637
3 DAYS AGO

21
00:02:06,425 --> 00:02:07,760
It’s done, sir.

22
00:02:10,436 --> 00:02:12,000
The service is 150 baht.

23
00:02:14,194 --> 00:02:15,440
Why does it cost so much?

24
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,194
Other places charge me only 80 baht.

25
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:19,571
That’s the price at other places.

26
00:02:19,571 --> 00:02:21,841
It’s stated on the board there that we charge 150 baht.

27
00:02:25,676 --> 00:02:27,166
I’m not gonna pay.

28
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,675
How could a stupid bike cleaning cost 150 baht?

29
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:32,920
I’ll bring this to the media.

30
00:02:33,855 --> 00:02:35,399
How could you say that?	

31
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:37,573
We don’t use cheap stuff here, you know?

32
00:02:37,573 --> 00:02:38,686
Let me break it down for you.

33
00:02:38,686 --> 00:02:40,930
The high-pressure washer is 120,000 baht.

34
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,814
The foam gun is 57,000 baht.

35
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:44,833
The vacuum is 23,000 baht.

36
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,428
The average monthly bills for electricity, water, and rent are 35,000 baht.

37
00:02:47,428 --> 00:02:52,605
Not including cleaning supplies that cost around 5,000 baht each month.

38
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,922
Plus, the wages for all the workers here are around 3,500 baht per day.

39
00:02:56,067 --> 00:02:59,838
Do you think that 150 baht is a fair price now?

40
00:03:02,142 --> 00:03:03,579
You’ve lost me, kid.

41
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:05,160
Fine, I’ll pay.

42
00:03:08,593 --> 00:03:09,895
Thank you very much, sir.

43
00:03:12,307 --> 00:03:14,307
Thank you for using our service.

44
00:03:14,307 --> 00:03:16,208
We hope to see you again.

45
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:21,492
Sailom.

46
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:22,246
Oh, sir.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,251
Thank you for today.

48
00:03:25,251 --> 00:03:26,000
Thank you.

49
00:03:26,924 --> 00:03:28,040
Use it well.

50
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,924
I will.

51
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:45,503
[MONTHLY EXPENSES - 18 August 2023 / INCOME - Car wash wages 500 baht / EXPENSES - Transportation ฿20, Food ฿45, Photocopying ฿8]

52
00:03:52,957 --> 00:03:55,199
Hey there, my dear brother. Why are you back home so late?

53
00:03:55,615 --> 00:03:56,599
I had to wait for a bus.

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,572
Hey. You got a new pair of sneakers?

55
00:04:02,765 --> 00:04:03,452
Yeah.

56
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:05,034
Why?

57
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,544
These ain’t out of reach for someone like me.

58
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:09,536
What do you think? Pretty, eh?

59
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:15,926
You must trick some old patients into buying them for you, right?

60
00:04:16,262 --> 00:04:20,086
If their families find out, they might stop hiring you.

61
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:23,829
Can you stop nagging, Sailom?

62
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,600
If you only make money by the book,

63
00:04:26,936 --> 00:04:28,641
how is it possible to pay off all the debts?

64
00:04:29,116 --> 00:04:31,116
We were so close to not being able to pay our debt on time last month.

65
00:04:31,116 --> 00:04:32,425
We almost got beaten up.

66
00:04:33,127 --> 00:04:36,790
That’s why I’m picking up part-time jobs.

67
00:04:40,434 --> 00:04:42,112
I’m starving. What do we have here?

68
00:04:42,622 --> 00:04:43,950
Rice porridge with an omelet.

69
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,520
I just got rice from my patient's house, you know?

70
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,595
You even took rice from your patient?

71
00:04:49,595 --> 00:04:51,165
I didn’t steal it. They wanted me to have it.

72
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:53,162
I thought you stole even rice.

73
00:04:53,162 --> 00:04:54,001
Well, I might have stolen one…

74
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:56,499
Come on. I’m gonna dig in.

75
00:04:57,234 --> 00:05:00,790
Listen to me. You don’t need to do part-time jobs.

76
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,030
Put all your attention on your studies to keep the scholarship.

77
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:07,450
After graduation, get a good job so you can make a lot of money.

78
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,110
Do you know what my dream is?

79
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,828
What is it?

80
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:12,159
It’s to live off you.

81
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:14,226
That’s your dream?

82
00:05:15,702 --> 00:05:18,920
I’d rather work my ass off until I die.

83
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:21,595
Then the omelet is not for you.

84
00:05:23,571 --> 00:05:25,008
You are much quicker now.

85
00:05:25,008 --> 00:05:26,273
You already made it for me.

86
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:27,959
What if I accidentally drop it?

87
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:31,207
Come on. We don't have much to eat.

88
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,579
Hey, Sailom.

89
00:06:06,705 --> 00:06:07,659
Hi, Auto.

90
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:08,845
I got it.

91
00:06:08,845 --> 00:06:09,479
You got what?

92
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:10,472
Look.

93
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,878
You got a ticket to your favorite girl group?

94
00:06:13,878 --> 00:06:14,855
Hell yeah.

95
00:06:14,855 --> 00:06:16,762
Look, it’s not a regular one.

96
00:06:16,762 --> 00:06:19,328
It’s VIP.

97
00:06:19,328 --> 00:06:20,339
VIP too?

98
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,093
I’ll get to have a photo with the members.

99
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,384
Wait.

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,101
VIP tickets cost almost 10,000 baht.

101
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,397
Who did you rob to get money for this?

102
00:06:28,397 --> 00:06:30,341
I didn’t rob anyone, damn you. I used my savings.

103
00:06:30,582 --> 00:06:33,120
My bias, Nonnie, is about to graduate from the group.

104
00:06:33,232 --> 00:06:35,769
So I think I should go bid her farewell.

105
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:38,401
If your mom finds out that you spent nearly 10,000 on a concert ticket,

106
00:06:38,401 --> 00:06:40,423
she’ll rant with me again.

107
00:06:40,423 --> 00:06:41,475
Don’t tell her, then.

108
00:06:42,912 --> 00:06:44,912
Come on. I’ll buy you a meal.

109
00:06:44,912 --> 00:06:45,729
Deal?

110
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,858
Are you bribing me?

111
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:50,355
You begin to develop the rich's habits.

112
00:06:50,355 --> 00:06:52,617
Because I have some to spare.

113
00:06:52,617 --> 00:06:53,999
You fake rich boy!

114
00:06:54,262 --> 00:06:55,860
Come on. I’ll treat you to a meal.

115
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,065
I hope you weren’t waiting for too long.

116
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:04,066
I actually was!

117
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,000
My ass is rotten from sitting for too long.

118
00:07:08,476 --> 00:07:10,074
Your body seems to be rotten too.

119
00:07:10,314 --> 00:07:11,492
Shouldn’t you go get a shower first?

120
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,621
I want a smoothie before I shower.

121
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,425
I’m so damn drained. I have been practicing since 5 a.m. in the morning.

122
00:07:17,425 --> 00:07:18,432
Will you take me to the smoothie shop?

123
00:07:18,851 --> 00:07:20,280
Fine. Let’s go.

124
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,405
Why is the line so long?

125
00:07:22,405 --> 00:07:23,490
I’m tired.

126
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,022
I’m thirsty.

127
00:07:25,022 --> 00:07:26,249
Hang in there. We’ll get it soon.

128
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:27,303
I’m thirsty.

129
00:07:27,303 --> 00:07:28,286
See? The line’s moving.

130
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:35,266
What the?

131
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,058
Sala Lemon Drink, please.

132
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:40,278
Blue Hawaii, please.

133
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:45,606
I want Pipo Yakult Nutella in Bubble Milk Tea with a ripe banana and raw egg.

134
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,764
Get a drinkable one, you jackass.

135
00:07:47,764 --> 00:07:49,079
They cut in line again.

136
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:51,192
Are they so powerful that no one dares to teach them manners?

137
00:07:53,002 --> 00:07:55,619
Powerful or not, his dad is running for an MP.

138
00:07:55,619 --> 00:07:56,879
Do you dare to teach him?

139
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,419
Do you think I’m not?

140
00:07:58,848 --> 00:07:59,748
Cool it.

141
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:02,755
His dad is close to the school director.

142
00:08:03,978 --> 00:08:06,380
If you mess with him and lose your scholarship, 

143
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,798
you might as well say goodbye to your bright future.

144
00:08:09,971 --> 00:08:10,877
Damn it.

145
00:08:38,558 --> 00:08:39,344
What do you want to drink?

146
00:08:40,739 --> 00:08:42,275
They've ruined my appetite. Damn it.

147
00:08:42,275 --> 00:08:43,452
I want this one. 

148
00:08:43,452 --> 00:08:43,952
No.

149
00:08:43,952 --> 00:08:44,627
It’s big. Can I have it?

150
00:08:44,627 --> 00:08:45,268
It’s my mom’s shop.

151
00:08:45,268 --> 00:08:47,357
And she doesn't mind if you share it with me.

152
00:08:47,357 --> 00:08:48,380
No.

153
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,917
You fight over food like children.

154
00:08:51,176 --> 00:08:52,135
He’s got it.

155
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:55,520
Of course. This one looks yummiest.

156
00:08:56,544 --> 00:08:58,007
You should start limiting your diet.

157
00:08:58,007 --> 00:08:58,508
What?

158
00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:07,106
Hey, Sailom. You’re short of money again this month?

159
00:09:08,002 --> 00:09:08,798
No.

160
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:12,440
It's almost time to pay off the debt. I want to save money.

161
00:09:12,728 --> 00:09:15,211
And this is enough to fill my stomach. Don’t worry.

162
00:09:15,316 --> 00:09:16,404
I can’t.

163
00:09:16,751 --> 00:09:17,327
Why?

164
00:09:17,488 --> 00:09:20,280
My mom asked me to watch over your diet.

165
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,957
So I can't just ignore it.

166
00:09:23,232 --> 00:09:23,956
What are you doing?

167
00:09:26,773 --> 00:09:28,040
Hello, Mom. 

168
00:09:28,496 --> 00:09:30,496
Sailom eats only an omelet with rice again.

169
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:35,080
Can I have two more drumsticks?

170
00:09:36,205 --> 00:09:38,500
Wait. Give me four.

171
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,753
I want some for myself too.

172
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:41,054
I don’t want to bother her on this.

173
00:09:42,506 --> 00:09:44,184
Thank you, Mom. See you.

174
00:09:45,115 --> 00:09:45,800
Problem solved.

175
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:55,069
Here you are.

176
00:09:55,069 --> 00:09:56,887
Hello.

177
00:09:56,887 --> 00:10:01,256
Sailom, here are special deep-fried drumsticks by Je Pao,

178
00:10:01,256 --> 00:10:04,613
plus a big bowl of Egg Tofu and Minced Pork in Clear Soup for you.

179
00:10:04,613 --> 00:10:06,385
Thank you so much. You shouldn’t have.

180
00:10:06,385 --> 00:10:07,218
It’s my pleasure.

181
00:10:07,218 --> 00:10:11,017
I want to return your favor for helping me with my big boy.

182
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,325
Help tutor him too.

183
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:15,040
I don't want his grades to drop and cause him to lose his scholarship.

184
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,800
Sometimes at 4 a.m. I still see him dancing to a song by his idol.

185
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,754
Mom. You may go now.

186
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:22,953
Please go now.

187
00:10:22,953 --> 00:10:23,718
I’m not done here.

188
00:10:23,718 --> 00:10:25,375
Look. Go back to your customers there.

189
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,995
I should go back to my shop.

190
00:10:26,995 --> 00:10:28,322
Alright.

191
00:10:28,455 --> 00:10:29,329
Take the plates back to my shop for me.

192
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,327
Sure, Mom.

193
00:10:30,327 --> 00:10:32,250
Now go back to your customers.

194
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,331
Thank you so much.

195
00:10:37,998 --> 00:10:39,080
What song do you dance to?

196
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,102
Show us sometimes.

197
00:10:41,743 --> 00:10:43,099
His moves must be real smooth.

198
00:10:51,358 --> 00:10:53,197
What’s wrong? You need my help there?

199
00:10:54,215 --> 00:10:56,027
Nothing. Mr. Wichai wants to see me.

200
00:10:58,977 --> 00:11:00,682
I should go see him now.

201
00:11:02,446 --> 00:11:03,288
Do you want me to go with you?

202
00:11:03,449 --> 00:11:05,278
It’s alright. Mr. Wichai needs me. It should be quick.

203
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:06,188
You done with this?

204
00:11:06,188 --> 00:11:07,419
I’ll come back and finish it later.

205
00:11:08,698 --> 00:11:09,388
That’s strange.

206
00:11:09,683 --> 00:11:10,510
Something is not right.

207
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,501
He doesn't usually leave his food in the middle like this.

208
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:13,349
I know, right? 

209
00:11:16,598 --> 00:11:18,000
He didn’t even finish the drumstick.

210
00:11:32,186 --> 00:11:33,015
Hey.

211
00:11:35,671 --> 00:11:36,654
Guess what.

212
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:40,241
What hurts more than being dumped and feeling lost?

213
00:11:43,004 --> 00:11:45,004
Seeing a zero on my paper, you piece of shit!

214
00:11:57,294 --> 00:11:59,187
Is there an issue with your paper?

215
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,610
Mr. Piroj said our group’s paper copied your group.

216
00:12:04,035 --> 00:12:05,284
So he gave us a zero.

217
00:12:05,703 --> 00:12:10,601
But I did make some changes to make them distinct.

218
00:12:10,601 --> 00:12:11,980
Make them distinct, my foot!

219
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:15,214
Easy there, pal.

220
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:17,478
Take it easy.

221
00:12:20,671 --> 00:12:24,000
Luckily, I could work this out with Mr. Piroj.

222
00:12:24,997 --> 00:12:27,319
So he allowed us to revise this paper.

223
00:12:31,342 --> 00:12:33,530
I’m sorry. I’ll…

224
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,782
It’s okay.

225
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:38,749
Thanks a lot for revising this for us.

226
00:12:39,864 --> 00:12:43,313
Since you walked quite far, I bought you a drink.

227
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,977
Refresh yourself with it.

228
00:12:50,197 --> 00:12:51,943
Come on. It’s a long walk here, isn’t it?

229
00:12:51,943 --> 00:12:52,756
Just a sip.

230
00:12:55,893 --> 00:12:56,921
Come on. Drink it.

231
00:12:56,921 --> 00:12:58,134
I want to return the favor.

232
00:13:00,972 --> 00:13:01,642
Those jerks!

233
00:13:02,554 --> 00:13:03,884
Woah.

234
00:13:04,378 --> 00:13:06,110
Are you going to let him be bullied like that?

235
00:13:06,406 --> 00:13:08,406
I'm not going to let them get away.

236
00:13:10,068 --> 00:13:11,451
Listen to me carefully, you fat ass.

237
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:14,379
Once you’ve taken my money,

238
00:13:14,907 --> 00:13:16,907
don’t ever do a crappy job for me!

239
00:13:18,152 --> 00:13:19,079
Understood?

240
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:26,200
Does it hurt, boy? Get up.

241
00:13:29,128 --> 00:13:30,189
Drink more.

242
00:13:31,153 --> 00:13:32,831
Come on. Drink some.

243
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:39,355
Come on. Drink it.

244
00:13:40,723 --> 00:13:41,650
Drink it.

245
00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:46,929
Drink more. Don’t let your throat dry.

246
00:13:55,329 --> 00:13:56,578
Damn you.

247
00:13:57,144 --> 00:13:58,822
What a poor bastard.

248
00:14:06,081 --> 00:14:09,959
Oh, a concert ticket?

249
00:14:12,305 --> 00:14:13,446
A pricey one too.

250
00:14:14,963 --> 00:14:18,331
I don’t think you deserve this frigging ticket anymore.

251
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,317
Don’t!

252
00:14:22,606 --> 00:14:23,399
Why?

253
00:14:23,721 --> 00:14:24,928
You love this group so much?

254
00:14:24,928 --> 00:14:25,839
Please, no!

255
00:14:27,884 --> 00:14:32,218
Fine. Since you love this group so much,

256
00:14:32,218 --> 00:14:34,711
keep this in your mouth.

257
00:14:36,734 --> 00:14:39,446
And I won’t rip it.

258
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:40,440
Okay?

259
00:14:40,877 --> 00:14:42,000
Keep holding it in your mouth.

260
00:14:49,907 --> 00:14:52,175
We may not rip it.

261
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:56,688
But we’ll burn it.

262
00:15:00,908 --> 00:15:03,445
If you let it go, we’ll rip it, you piece of shit!

263
00:15:21,481 --> 00:15:22,515
Please look at this, teacher.

264
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:28,792
Why do you want me to see this?

265
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:32,270
This is school bullying.

266
00:15:33,283 --> 00:15:36,000
Teenagers are always so rough and rash when they play.

267
00:15:36,432 --> 00:15:38,164
It's all about hormones, you know?

268
00:15:40,362 --> 00:15:42,362
So you’re gonna let them get away with this?

269
00:15:43,273 --> 00:15:44,361
Calm down.

270
00:15:44,974 --> 00:15:47,242
I’m your homeroom teacher.

271
00:15:47,617 --> 00:15:51,522
When I see a conflict among students, I must handle it no matter what.

272
00:16:00,355 --> 00:16:01,375
Are you here yet?

273
00:16:02,609 --> 00:16:04,367
Good. Come on in.

274
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,715
What’s the matter, teacher?

275
00:16:14,482 --> 00:16:17,609
Sailom, I’m sorry to drag you into this mess.

276
00:16:17,742 --> 00:16:19,000
Seriously.

277
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:20,437
Why did you rat on me?

278
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:21,880
Do you want to be a hero?

279
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,240
Care to be my heroin?
