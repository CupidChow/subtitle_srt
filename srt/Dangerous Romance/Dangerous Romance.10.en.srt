Let’s go, Korat!

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,933
Damn it. Dad has frozen my card.

6
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:24,185
฿100,000 is fine. I’ll take it.

7
00:00:24,185 --> 00:00:26,398
Do you think my dad will flip out if he finds out I sold the big bike?

8
00:00:26,398 --> 00:00:27,522
I’m thinking I should buy it back.

9
00:00:27,522 --> 00:00:30,337
If you want it back, pay me ฿150,000.

10
00:00:30,771 --> 00:00:32,360
Thanks for your ฿90,000.

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,362
Son of a bitch, you cheated.

12
00:00:34,362 --> 00:00:35,897
This big bike is yours?

13
00:00:36,426 --> 00:00:39,811
Please, I beg you. Let me have my bike back.

14
00:00:39,811 --> 00:00:41,002
Then beg at my feet.

15
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:43,617
I told you, right?

16
00:00:43,617 --> 00:00:47,058
What’s already yours, you must take good care of it.

17
00:01:26,273 --> 00:01:29,360
Special room service from the hotel, sir.

18
00:01:36,507 --> 00:01:38,299
Why is this hotel staff wearing my jersey?

19
00:01:39,191 --> 00:01:41,191
It’s also a special service, sir.

20
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,480
So you’ll get my scent on it.

21
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,476
You’re kinda addicted to it, aren’t you?

22
00:01:49,323 --> 00:01:52,362
Well, I do have your scent all over me after last night.

23
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,243
That was mind-blowing, wasn’t it?

24
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:57,027
Last night? Last night what?

25
00:01:58,024 --> 00:01:59,193
Think and say again.

26
00:02:01,158 --> 00:02:02,465
Nothing happened.

27
00:02:02,801 --> 00:02:05,528
We simply went to sleep right after wound dressings.

28
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:08,758
Then how did you get that mark there?

29
00:02:11,286 --> 00:02:12,169
This mark…

30
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:14,009
A mosquito bite, probably.

31
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:14,905
A mosquito bite?

32
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:16,624
What are you doing?

33
00:02:16,624 --> 00:02:18,510
Hey, Kang!

34
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,394
I’m gonna bite you.

35
00:02:19,394 --> 00:02:20,281
Nooo!.

36
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:21,454
Kang, it’s ticklish.

37
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:24,000
One more bite from me. I’m hungry.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,919
Kang, no!

39
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:25,745
Let me taste your blood.

40
00:02:28,237 --> 00:02:29,292
Here.

41
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,320
What's wrong?

42
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,758
Did you forget something?

43
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,388
No.

44
00:02:46,838 --> 00:02:49,357
I was thinking since I’m already in Korat.

45
00:02:50,111 --> 00:02:51,349
Should I go to the training camp?

46
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,549
That’s a good idea.

47
00:02:54,414 --> 00:02:57,661
But the coach isn’t going to chew you out, right?

48
00:02:58,481 --> 00:03:01,440
It's better to face the scolding here than at school. 

49
00:03:02,463 --> 00:03:04,463
Plus, my jersey has your scent on it.

50
00:03:04,463 --> 00:03:07,336
It gives me a 300% kicking power on the field.

51
00:03:10,173 --> 00:03:13,143
I pray for you not to get kicked by the coach before anything else.

52
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,827
Alright. Let's get going now.

53
00:05:08,881 --> 00:05:09,854
Yes, Dad.

54
00:05:09,993 --> 00:05:11,539
I’ll be back home after the match tomorrow.

55
00:05:12,001 --> 00:05:13,655
I’m not doing this match for you,

56
00:05:14,304 --> 00:05:15,750
but for myself.

57
00:05:27,488 --> 00:05:28,518
Coach,

58
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:33,089
thank you for giving me another chance.

59
00:05:34,296 --> 00:05:36,573
Don’t worry. I understand how teenagers are.

60
00:05:36,573 --> 00:05:38,521
I’ve been through it all. I understand.

61
00:05:50,106 --> 00:05:51,552
Took you long enough.

62
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:53,906
I thought you already took my friend out of the country with you.

63
00:05:54,923 --> 00:05:56,715
How is it? Your honeymoon getaway.

64
00:05:57,018 --> 00:05:58,256
Sweet to the core, I bet?

65
00:05:59,106 --> 00:06:00,080
Honeymoon?

66
00:06:00,648 --> 00:06:01,851
Honeymoon, my foot.

67
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:03,945
Go, the coach is calling all of you now.

68
00:06:03,945 --> 00:06:04,712
Go.

69
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:05,792
You go to.

70
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:07,077
You too. Head to your training.

71
00:06:07,077 --> 00:06:08,050
Give it your all.

72
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,261
You haven’t answered yet. Do spill.

73
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:10,880
Go!

74
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,380
Need a hand?

75
00:06:33,967 --> 00:06:35,170
Don't you have anything else to do?

76
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,933
Nah, Mrs. Ging is able to start walking on her own now.

77
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:40,428
She said I could go do something else.

78
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,261
Does this job pay you enough to afford a luxury watch?

79
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,598
It’s a long story.

80
00:06:57,244 --> 00:06:59,244
Mr. Kong gave it to me for free.

81
00:06:59,244 --> 00:07:01,928
He wants to apologize for a misunderstanding.

82
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,472
You know something?

83
00:07:03,877 --> 00:07:07,240
Mr. Kong has such an impressive watch collection.

84
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,178
Some of them are worth nearly 10 million baht.

85
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:12,774
How great is it to be rich?

86
00:07:14,878 --> 00:07:18,367
This friggin car is just a fraction of his money.

87
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:23,148
I wish I had a fraction of the money to get a car like this too.

88
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:25,077
I dream of traveling around the world, you know?

89
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,501
Me too.

90
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:27,230
I want to…

91
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,755
Go to America, right?

92
00:07:28,755 --> 00:07:31,770
I remember how you were so obsessed with The Fast and the Furious.

93
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,316
You wanted to be like Vin Diesel.

94
00:07:34,344 --> 00:07:35,444
Damn it! 

95
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:37,308
How could you remember that?

96
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:41,572
I remember everything about you.

97
00:07:43,093 --> 00:07:47,517
I just didn't expect to run into you under these circumstances.

98
00:07:49,632 --> 00:07:52,775
You must be disappointed to see me like this.

99
00:07:55,805 --> 00:08:00,000
I thought you had changed into a different person.

100
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:04,315
But the more I get to be with you,

101
00:08:04,843 --> 00:08:06,220
the more time we spend together,

102
00:08:06,814 --> 00:08:10,130
The more I see the old Name who wanted to be Vin Diesel.

103
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,188
That’s all it takes to make me happy.

104
00:08:20,692 --> 00:08:22,069
How about this? 

105
00:08:22,428 --> 00:08:25,259
If we ever become rich, let’s travel the world together.

106
00:08:28,062 --> 00:08:30,062
I'm not sure when that will happen, though.

107
00:08:30,651 --> 00:08:31,769
But, yeah, let’s do it.

108
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,918
Can I ask you something?

109
00:08:41,611 --> 00:08:45,448
Aren’t you upset that I asked you to work here?

110
00:08:48,751 --> 00:08:51,998
Well, I know you’re worried about me.

111
00:08:53,812 --> 00:08:56,366
I’m fine with this kind of job.

112
00:08:57,165 --> 00:08:58,680
However,

113
00:09:00,713 --> 00:09:03,059
I haven’t told my boss about this yet.

114
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:03,927
What?

115
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:07,331
So you…

116
00:09:07,573 --> 00:09:08,451
So…

117
00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:10,105
Wait a sec.

118
00:09:10,105 --> 00:09:14,152
You skipped work there to come here, and you are yet to tell your boss?

119
00:09:14,152 --> 00:09:15,901
Won’t that get you in trouble?

120
00:09:20,197 --> 00:09:21,366
Tonight, 

121
00:09:22,316 --> 00:09:24,000
I'll have a talk with him.

122
00:09:48,792 --> 00:09:49,857
Mr. Jeng,

123
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,541
I…

124
00:09:53,472 --> 00:09:54,779
It's good that you're here. 

125
00:09:55,983 --> 00:09:57,256
Help me put some pepper on.

126
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,474
Where the hell have you been these last few days?

127
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,052
I have some matters to take care of.

128
00:10:24,439 --> 00:10:25,850
You know me, right?

129
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,960
I hate liars.

130
00:10:30,802 --> 00:10:32,179
I’m sorry.

131
00:10:33,725 --> 00:10:37,387
I’ve been thinking about…. 

132
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:40,706
quitting this job.

133
00:10:43,244 --> 00:10:44,725
Why do you want to quit?

134
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,565
I don't want to kill people. 

135
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,612
I know I owe you a debt of gratitude, 

136
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,303
but I just can’t go down that path.

137
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,029
So you want to leave me

138
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,991
to be a chauffeur for that rich family?

139
00:11:15,338 --> 00:11:16,784
You knew?

140
00:11:26,047 --> 00:11:28,601
For the sake of being my favorite, 

141
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,284
I'll let you quit 

142
00:11:32,117 --> 00:11:35,675
after you finish this one job for me.

143
00:12:04,993 --> 00:12:07,340
Aren’t you going to Korat to cheer on Kang tomorrow?

144
00:12:09,755 --> 00:12:13,556
You know I have to attend the governor’s birthday party tomorrow.

145
00:12:15,463 --> 00:12:16,944
Yes, I know. 

146
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,217
I just double-checked in case you’ve changed your mind.

147
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:22,307
Like father, like son.

148
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:28,597
Do you remember when you were young?

149
00:12:28,989 --> 00:12:33,960
You were angry with me and stayed at your friend’s place for weeks.

150
00:12:34,548 --> 00:12:37,414
You only returned home after I reached out to reconcile with you.

151
00:12:39,197 --> 00:12:40,331
I remember. 

152
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,019
I was quite stubborn back then.

153
00:12:44,345 --> 00:12:46,345
Not all that different from how you are now.

154
00:12:46,561 --> 00:12:49,635
Finish up your work and get to bed. 

155
00:12:50,463 --> 00:12:52,255
I'm going to sleep as well. My head is heavy.

156
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:53,560
Good night, Mom.

157
00:12:56,881 --> 00:12:58,050
Hold on.

158
00:13:01,918 --> 00:13:04,680
Why did you decide to give in and reconcile with me? 

159
00:13:05,191 --> 00:13:09,477
I spoke quite harshly to you back then. 

160
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:16,200
Matured people know they can’t always be 100% right.

161
00:13:17,251 --> 00:13:20,117
It’s a matter of being able to accept when they’re wrong.

162
00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:23,636
Fortunately,

163
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:26,701
I learned to do that early on.

164
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:28,543
That’s all.

165
00:13:48,186 --> 00:13:54,377
[Sailom: I secretly recorded Kang practicing for you.]

166
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:26,357
We’re going to the restaurant where the governor’s party is, right?

167
00:14:26,703 --> 00:14:27,717
Um.

168
00:14:29,609 --> 00:14:32,302
Uh…Change of plans.

169
00:14:32,632 --> 00:14:34,978
Can you do me a favor and deliver this to the governor for me?

170
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,546
I’ll take another car.

171
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,832
Where are you headed?

172
00:14:41,845 --> 00:14:43,014
Korat.

173
00:15:01,056 --> 00:15:02,917
Kang, you’ve got this!

174
00:15:14,435 --> 00:15:16,435
Mr. Kong! Hi.

175
00:15:16,688 --> 00:15:18,000
What brings you here?

176
00:15:20,116 --> 00:15:22,116
I’m not busy, so I want to watch Kang play.

177
00:15:22,903 --> 00:15:26,808
But I just received a message from my party that I have a meeting this evening.

178
00:15:26,808 --> 00:15:28,606
I must leave soon.

179
00:15:30,123 --> 00:15:32,816
Do you also like playing football? 

180
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,723
I’m obsessed with it.

181
00:15:38,654 --> 00:15:41,832
I was a school athlete when I was young.

182
00:15:42,464 --> 00:15:44,949
Girls went crazy when I was on the field.

183
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:47,248
Seriously?

184
00:15:47,248 --> 00:15:49,702
Kang never told me about it.

185
00:15:51,635 --> 00:15:53,150
That’s because I never told him.

186
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,929
I was afraid it might put too much pressure on him if he knew.

187
00:15:56,361 --> 00:16:00,000
So I let him do whatever he likes to do. 

188
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:08,043
But doing that also made him feel neglected.

189
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,880
I’m sorry. I just…

190
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,335
It’s okay. I understand.

191
00:16:19,224 --> 00:16:20,185
Can I ask you?

192
00:16:21,387 --> 00:16:23,280
What has my son told you about me?

193
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:33,520
He’s upset because you don’t encourage him to try anything.

194
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:39,583
He feels worthless.

195
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,000
He feels like he’s good for nothing.

196
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:48,000
He even vented his anger by bullying other students at school.

197
00:16:49,204 --> 00:16:52,070
But I already taught him a lesson.

198
00:16:55,787 --> 00:16:58,099
I must be a really bad father.

199
00:17:00,872 --> 00:17:04,569
I’m sure you have your reasons.

200
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,098
Yes.

201
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,792
It’s a promise I made with my wife

202
00:17:14,962 --> 00:17:16,720
before she passed away. 

203
00:17:37,867 --> 00:17:40,075
How did it go?

204
00:17:41,264 --> 00:17:43,887
Not bad. I got to see the governor in person.

205
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:48,465
No, I’m talking about you quitting working for Mr. Jeng.

206
00:17:48,465 --> 00:17:49,526
How did it go?

207
00:17:51,298 --> 00:17:52,360
He allowed me to quit,

208
00:17:53,394 --> 00:17:55,533
but he asked me to do one last task for him.

209
00:17:58,337 --> 00:18:01,341
Don’t tell me that he asked you to kill someone.

210
00:18:05,595 --> 00:18:06,591
No.

211
00:18:08,938 --> 00:18:10,938
Then why the concerned look on your face?

212
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:15,042
I need your help with quite a few things.

213
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:36,000
Gosh.

214
00:18:41,057 --> 00:18:42,218
Medic!

215
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:45,342
Ouch.

216
00:18:53,951 --> 00:18:56,297
Argh. It hurts.

217
00:19:05,047 --> 00:19:07,047
We’re screwed.

218
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:07,998
Tell me about it.

219
00:19:40,997 --> 00:19:42,304
Yeah!

220
00:19:44,234 --> 00:19:47,792
Nice!

221
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:51,975
That was awesome.

222
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,515
Hey, you could even score from a free kick.

223
00:19:55,688 --> 00:19:56,536
No sweat.

224
00:19:56,536 --> 00:19:57,542
Wow. Awesome!

225
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:10,956
Your drink.

226
00:20:10,956 --> 00:20:12,165
Thanks.

227
00:20:13,933 --> 00:20:15,379
How’s Guy doing?

228
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:17,502
He’s still being examined by the doctor.

229
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,716
You were amazing on the field.

230
00:20:21,716 --> 00:20:23,607
You scored 5 goals by yourself.

231
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:27,187
My boyfriend is here. I must show off.

232
00:20:27,187 --> 00:20:29,651
What a whipped boy.

233
00:20:40,745 --> 00:20:42,000
Is everything alright?

234
00:20:44,018 --> 00:20:45,256
You know what?

235
00:20:46,425 --> 00:20:48,217
I got back into football 

236
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:55,092
to show my dad I can do everything without relying on his help.

237
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:58,877
What a shame.

238
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:01,284
He couldn’t witness it after all.

239
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:07,397
Actually, he was here.

240
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:13,164
But he had to leave early for an important meeting.

241
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,095
He was here?

242
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,574
Yes.

243
00:21:20,606 --> 00:21:21,706
Kang,

244
00:21:22,321 --> 00:21:23,836
you really mean a lot to him, you know?

245
00:21:26,979 --> 00:21:28,529
That's bullshit.

246
00:21:29,075 --> 00:21:31,491
Then why does everything seem like the opposite?

247
00:21:31,863 --> 00:21:33,724
You know what he has done to me.

248
00:21:35,101 --> 00:21:38,486
What if he had his reasons?

249
00:21:38,992 --> 00:21:40,299
What are his damn reasons?

250
00:21:40,908 --> 00:21:44,501
Is it because I’m so incapable that he can’t stand to watch?

251
00:21:46,601 --> 00:21:48,208
I talked to him.

252
00:21:48,454 --> 00:21:51,770
What he told me is not what you think at all.

253
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:57,119
It’s a promise I made with my wife

254
00:21:57,907 --> 00:21:59,491
before she passed away.

255
00:22:01,561 --> 00:22:02,972
A promise?

256
00:22:05,076 --> 00:22:07,388
Back then, I was very strict with Kang.

257
00:22:08,496 --> 00:22:11,674
Can you imagine the kind of father kids hate?

258
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,323
I disciplined him when his grades dropped.

259
00:22:14,969 --> 00:22:16,727
I scolded him when he played video games.

260
00:22:17,584 --> 00:22:20,554
My wife had to intervene every time.

261
00:22:23,316 --> 00:22:24,173
I see.

262
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:28,797
Then my wife fell seriously ill.

263
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
She gave me her last wish.

264
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:34,977
I still remember her words to this day.

265
00:22:37,534 --> 00:22:39,326
“Don’t be too harsh on Kang.”

266
00:22:42,624 --> 00:22:44,936
That’s why you…

267
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:46,509
Yes.

268
00:22:46,753 --> 00:22:48,649
It’s quite hard for me.

269
00:22:49,195 --> 00:22:52,476
If I’m strict and put pressure on Kang,

270
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,568
that means I’m being too harsh on him.

271
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:59,776
The only way I don’t have to be that

272
00:23:00,529 --> 00:23:01,932
is by letting him be.

273
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:06,000
Whatever Kang wants to do or to become,

274
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,640
I should let him.

275
00:23:08,556 --> 00:23:11,040
I keep telling myself every day, “Don’t have expectations.”

276
00:23:11,206 --> 00:23:13,033
“Don’t put any pressure on him.”

277
00:23:14,243 --> 00:23:17,005
But what happened that day made me realize

278
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:22,780
that what I’ve done might have always been wrong.

279
00:23:29,601 --> 00:23:30,908
The truth is…

280
00:23:30,908 --> 00:23:33,286
he actually wanted to have expectations of you.

281
00:23:33,922 --> 00:23:35,506
He just couldn’t do it

282
00:23:36,001 --> 00:23:38,001
because of that promise.

283
00:23:44,015 --> 00:23:46,223
Hey, want to join us for a feast. It’s on Coach.

284
00:23:46,664 --> 00:23:47,833
Nah, I think I’ll pass. 

285
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:48,973
I should head home.

286
00:23:50,072 --> 00:23:51,553
What’s waiting for you at home that’s got you in a rush?

287
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,406
My old man.

288
00:23:54,174 --> 00:23:55,274
Let’s get going.

289
00:23:55,274 --> 00:23:56,452
Sure.

290
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:59,437
Can I ask you to take my stuff with you?

291
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:00,244
No problem.

292
00:24:00,244 --> 00:24:04,233
See you.

293
00:25:16,376 --> 00:25:18,376
What happened?

294
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,664
What happened?

295
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,105
Grandma.

296
00:27:04,233 --> 00:27:05,852
How’s the patient?

297
00:27:05,852 --> 00:27:07,307
I’m sorry

298
00:27:07,307 --> 00:27:08,844
that my brother caused this trouble.

299
00:27:08,844 --> 00:27:10,405
I believe that your brother didn’t do it.

300
00:27:10,576 --> 00:27:12,520
No matter what happens, 

301
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,083
I will go through this together with you.
