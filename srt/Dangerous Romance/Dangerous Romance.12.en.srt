The f**k?

5
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:22,428
Did you send Piak and Pae to shoot Sailom?

6
00:00:22,428 --> 00:00:23,863
I’ll make it as quiet as possible.

7
00:00:23,863 --> 00:00:25,121
What happened that night,

8
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:28,940
if it was me there, would you believe that I shot your father?

9
00:00:29,164 --> 00:00:30,501
They’re trying to kill Mr. Kong!

10
00:00:30,501 --> 00:00:31,890
Kanghan, we must go to the hospital now! 

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,074
Your dad is in danger!

12
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:35,920
It was you, right? You shot Mr. Kong.

13
00:00:38,746 --> 00:00:39,918
Kang!

14
00:00:42,898 --> 00:00:43,504
Stop!

15
00:00:44,056 --> 00:00:45,119
Sit down.

16
00:00:45,938 --> 00:00:46,946
Drop the gun.

17
00:00:47,498 --> 00:00:48,490
Hands up.

18
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,106
Kang,

19
00:02:46,714 --> 00:02:47,671
I'm here.

20
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:50,009
I bought some apples for you. 

21
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:51,210
Grandma Ging told me you like them. 

22
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:55,966
Come on, wake up already.

23
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:57,039
You've been sleeping more than enough.

24
00:02:58,893 --> 00:02:59,574
Kang.

25
00:03:01,617 --> 00:03:02,289
Kang.

26
00:03:04,498 --> 00:03:05,366
Kang.

27
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:14,004
You totally fell for it, didn’t you?

28
00:03:14,446 --> 00:03:15,321
Jackass!

29
00:03:15,967 --> 00:03:18,160
You just got shot, and you're still in a playful mood?

30
00:03:18,397 --> 00:03:20,590
Being stuck here all day is boring as hell.

31
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:24,000
I want some apples. Can you peel them for me?

32
00:03:25,341 --> 00:03:26,238
Please.

33
00:03:26,348 --> 00:03:27,617
It looks like you have your energy back.

34
00:03:27,925 --> 00:03:28,903
Why don’t you get up and do it yourself?

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,859
Oi.

36
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,297
I can’t lift my arm.

37
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,266
I even took a bullet for my boyfriend, 

38
00:03:36,266 --> 00:03:38,209
but he won’t peel apples for me.

39
00:03:41,813 --> 00:03:42,879
What a pain in the neck.

40
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:44,586
Alright, I’ll do it.

41
00:03:46,657 --> 00:03:47,440
Ouch.

42
00:04:10,727 --> 00:04:11,601
Yay.

43
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:14,129
Get your ass up.

44
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:14,851
Ouch.

45
00:04:14,851 --> 00:04:15,834
Give me a hand.

46
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:22,563
Here.

47
00:04:23,032 --> 00:04:23,846
Feed me.

48
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:26,002
I can’t move my arms.

49
00:04:26,775 --> 00:04:27,864
What a baby.

50
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,536
Do you want it or not?

51
00:04:32,536 --> 00:04:33,372
Yes.

52
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,862
Oops.

53
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,000
Sorry, are we interrupting you two?

54
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:44,050
We can wait outside.

55
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,108
No, it’s okay.

56
00:04:47,057 --> 00:04:49,471
What’s going on? Why are you all here?

57
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:01,449
I’ve got an update for you.

58
00:05:02,363 --> 00:05:04,253
My dad called and told me

59
00:05:04,701 --> 00:05:06,701
that guy, Name, confessed.

60
00:05:06,814 --> 00:05:09,642
Turns out that night, Saifah wasn’t the one who shot Kang’s dad.

61
00:05:10,613 --> 00:05:11,259
What?

62
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:13,441
Robbing this house?

63
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:16,738
Have you lost your mind?

64
00:05:18,757 --> 00:05:19,874
That’s why I need your help.

65
00:05:23,132 --> 00:05:24,125
Don’t do it.

66
00:05:26,382 --> 00:05:27,464
Think again.

67
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,000
Jeng is going to give you a slice of the cake.

68
00:05:30,378 --> 00:05:32,074
You’ll be able to pay off your debts.

69
00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:34,050
It’s certainly worth the risk.

70
00:05:34,908 --> 00:05:36,436
If you stick with the job you’re doing–seriously,

71
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,399
how many more years until you’re out of debt?

72
00:05:43,353 --> 00:05:44,497
I'm sorry, 

73
00:05:45,604 --> 00:05:47,300
but this is something I really can’t help you with.

74
00:05:53,158 --> 00:05:54,302
Then do me this one favor. 

75
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:57,823
When we rob this place, 

76
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:00,709
could you happen to be outside? 

77
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:06,164
If the cops ask, you can act clueless.

78
00:06:07,305 --> 00:06:08,511
What if I refuse to do that?

79
00:06:09,726 --> 00:06:10,907
What will happen?

80
00:06:13,437 --> 00:06:14,463
You don’t want to know.

81
00:06:15,706 --> 00:06:16,680
Trust me.

82
00:06:25,684 --> 00:06:26,593
Hello, boss.

83
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,783
Mr. Kong isn’t home tonight.

84
00:06:29,783 --> 00:06:32,962
There’ll be only Mrs. Ging, so we should break in tonight.

85
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:38,150
Don’t worry about the CCTVs. I’ll handle them.

86
00:06:43,357 --> 00:06:45,960
If I use my cellphone, they’ll figure out it’s me.

87
00:06:58,973 --> 00:06:59,813
Mr. Kong!

88
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,875
Remove all valuable items you have on you

89
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,984
Don’t try any tricks.

90
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:09,450
Hurry!

91
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:35,348
So you saw my face? 

92
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,510
I can’t let you live now.

93
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,840
Hey! Don’t!

94
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,927
Don’t!

95
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:01,253
Mr. Kong.

96
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:10,753
You dirty rat! You called the cops?

97
00:08:11,321 --> 00:08:12,327
Go rot in hell.

98
00:08:12,327 --> 00:08:13,608
No! Don’t, boss. Stop.

99
00:08:13,898 --> 00:08:15,290
We can use him.

100
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:19,080
Use him for what? Didn’t you see this rat ruined our plan?

101
00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:20,418
We can use him as a scapegoat.

102
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,774
Make it seem like he's the one who robbed and got caught in the act 

103
00:08:24,413 --> 00:08:25,824
so he shot the owner.

104
00:08:26,321 --> 00:08:27,488
This way, we can make a clean escape.

105
00:08:28,631 --> 00:08:31,977
How can you be sure he’ll take the blame?

106
00:08:34,177 --> 00:08:35,597
Because he loves his brother so much.

107
00:08:36,677 --> 00:08:39,423
We can make his brother pay if anything goes wrong.

108
00:08:46,616 --> 00:08:49,141
If you breathe a word about what happened here,

109
00:08:49,865 --> 00:08:52,160
your brother won’t get to breathe anymore.

110
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:53,357
Understand?

111
00:08:53,357 --> 00:08:55,232
We must go now. The cops are here.

112
00:08:58,864 --> 00:08:59,759
Hurry!

113
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,176
Mr. Kong.

114
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:12,948
Hey, stop!

115
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:39,120
Name has confessed that he and his gang planned it all.

116
00:09:39,494 --> 00:09:41,218
Saifah has no part in it.

117
00:09:41,718 --> 00:09:44,160
That means your brother will be released.

118
00:09:45,206 --> 00:09:46,076
Really?

119
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,520
I’m happy for you.

120
00:09:52,777 --> 00:09:53,562
Kang,

121
00:09:55,716 --> 00:09:57,000
your father has awakened.

122
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:31,786
Dad.

123
00:10:34,906 --> 00:10:35,805
Kang.

124
00:10:39,258 --> 00:10:43,964
I thought I'd never have a chance to see you play football again.

125
00:10:47,715 --> 00:10:49,080
Don’t say that, Dad.

126
00:10:51,982 --> 00:10:53,485
I still owe you an apology.

127
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,570
I’m sorry for everything 

128
00:10:57,506 --> 00:10:59,257
I’ve done wrong to you.

129
00:12:23,638 --> 00:12:24,345
Hi, Dad.

130
00:12:24,345 --> 00:12:25,417
Hi, Grandma.

131
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,273
Hi, Mrs. Ging.

132
00:12:27,273 --> 00:12:28,256
Hi, Mr. Kong.

133
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:32,451
Hi, Mrs. Ging.

134
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,170
I’m…

135
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,389
I’m sorry, Mr. Kong.

136
00:12:58,452 --> 00:13:00,000
Thank you very much 

137
00:13:01,182 --> 00:13:02,519
for saving my life.

138
00:13:10,711 --> 00:13:11,962
I’m really sorry.

139
00:13:12,514 --> 00:13:13,815
I’m really sorry.

140
00:13:15,075 --> 00:13:20,058
I never wanted this kind of thing to happen.

141
00:13:47,064 --> 00:13:50,334
I never imagined I’d be back here once again.

142
00:13:52,654 --> 00:13:53,366
What?

143
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:02,046
Hey, Kang.

144
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:05,184
Why do people keep giving me weird looks?

145
00:14:06,415 --> 00:14:08,498
I came back here quietly, didn’t I?

146
00:14:13,577 --> 00:14:15,080
Goddamnit, Kang!

147
00:14:15,303 --> 00:14:16,502
Was it your idea?
[Welcome back, Sailom, Our top scholarship student!!!]

148
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,351
My boyfriend is back at school.

149
00:14:19,351 --> 00:14:21,777
I have to let the whole world know he’s back.

150
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,230
Isn't that a bit over the top?

151
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:24,962
No.

152
00:14:24,962 --> 00:14:25,577
Yes.

153
00:14:25,577 --> 00:14:26,229
A bit, maybe.

154
00:14:26,229 --> 00:14:26,818
Take it down.

155
00:14:26,818 --> 00:14:28,099
No can do. I just had it put up.

156
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:29,934
You go up there and remove it.

157
00:14:29,934 --> 00:14:30,902
No.

158
00:14:30,902 --> 00:14:31,766
Do it now.

159
00:14:31,766 --> 00:14:33,419
No. You’ll get only my bag.

160
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:34,310
You jackass, Kang!

161
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:57,947
What’s up?

162
00:15:00,543 --> 00:15:05,180
I’m here to thank you for keeping your promise

163
00:15:05,564 --> 00:15:07,012
and for saving my brother’s life.

164
00:15:07,594 --> 00:15:08,931
I’m truly grateful to you.

165
00:15:13,226 --> 00:15:14,977
But the promise I made

166
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,809
about not taking anyone’s life,

167
00:15:20,131 --> 00:15:21,433
I couldn’t keep that promise after all.

168
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:23,105
Sorry.

169
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:26,801
Um.

170
00:15:28,126 --> 00:15:30,329
But you had to do it to save another person’s life

171
00:15:31,252 --> 00:15:33,307
like a hero in a movie.

172
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:42,489
Live the rest of your life for me.

173
00:15:44,507 --> 00:15:49,959
I hope you can have that road trip around the world you’ve always wanted.

174
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,710
I can’t go with you now.

175
00:15:57,005 --> 00:15:57,928
Why?

176
00:15:58,397 --> 00:15:59,667
Why can’t you go?

177
00:16:00,364 --> 00:16:03,027
Am I talking with you on the street or something?

178
00:16:03,521 --> 00:16:05,079
The day you’re released,

179
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,123
I’ll be waiting for you.

180
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,031
We made a promise, didn’t we?

181
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:16,557
Why do we have so many promises?

182
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:20,525
Because we are best buds, right?

183
00:16:22,914 --> 00:16:24,500
I’ll wait until the day you’re released.

184
00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:26,632
One day,

185
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:29,078
we’ll meet up out there again.

186
00:16:33,304 --> 00:16:34,393
Fingers crossed.
