4
00:00:17,867 --> 00:00:20,320
All the teams are recruiting cheerleaders and preparing for practice.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,921
Anyone is interested in becoming a cheerleader or would like to nominate someone?

6
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:28,223
If we’ve got Pimfah, who else should we nominate, folks?	It’s Kang right here.

7
00:00:28,446 --> 00:00:30,629
Hey, Kang. I’ve already practiced the routine for you.

8
00:00:31,645 --> 00:00:33,216
Can you just stay out of my business?

9
00:00:33,565 --> 00:00:36,661
Pimfah doesn’t like me. She likes you.

10
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:38,973
Would you like to be my partner in cheerleading instead of Kang?

11
00:00:39,257 --> 00:00:40,709
Why did you reject Pimfah?

12
00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:42,164
I…

13
00:00:43,052 --> 00:00:44,102
like you.

14
00:00:58,998 --> 00:01:02,016
Abalone soup is here. Please enjoy it.

15
00:01:05,953 --> 00:01:06,695
Mom!

16
00:01:10,464 --> 00:01:11,644
Are you okay?

17
00:01:12,062 --> 00:01:13,445
Should I take you for a checkup?

18
00:01:13,955 --> 00:01:15,537
No need for that. I'm okay. 

19
00:01:15,692 --> 00:01:18,320
It's common for older folks with aging bones. 

20
00:01:18,491 --> 00:01:20,230
Come on, let's start eating. 

21
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:32,419
Kang, how was your football match today?

22
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,246
Uh...

23
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,246
It’s none of your damn business who I hang out with.

24
00:01:50,212 --> 00:01:51,203
What right do you have?

25
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:17,723
What the hell was that for?

26
00:02:23,063 --> 00:02:25,063
I told you I don’t like seeing you with Guy,

27
00:02:25,844 --> 00:02:27,713
or anyone else for that matter.

28
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:29,811
Do you get it?

29
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:33,548
Why?

30
00:02:36,964 --> 00:02:38,964
You scumbag, what are you doing to my friend?

31
00:02:38,964 --> 00:02:39,799
Calm down.

32
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:42,932
He didn’t do anything.

33
00:02:44,316 --> 00:02:45,709
He just needed to talk to me.

34
00:02:49,345 --> 00:02:51,345
I’m done here. Let’s go.

35
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:01,589
Come on.

36
00:03:11,184 --> 00:03:13,690
Why so quiet? Did you lose?

37
00:03:14,474 --> 00:03:15,534
We won.

38
00:03:15,907 --> 00:03:17,568
I even came close to scoring a goal myself, 

39
00:03:17,568 --> 00:03:18,970
too bad my teammate took the shot.

40
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:22,400
It’s just the first round.

41
00:03:23,782 --> 00:03:26,591
Don’t sweat it. You still have more matches to compete in.

42
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:27,953
Yeah,

43
00:03:29,102 --> 00:03:30,378
there are plenty more chances.

44
00:03:41,768 --> 00:03:43,585
Please excuse me. I need to use the bathroom.

45
00:03:43,585 --> 00:03:45,053
My stomach feels a bit strange.

46
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,503
Go ahead.

47
00:04:01,665 --> 00:04:02,597
Sailom,

48
00:04:03,665 --> 00:04:04,837
can we talk?

49
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:17,180
Have you already gone to bed?

50
00:04:43,137 --> 00:04:44,615
I knew you'd still be awake. 

51
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:47,221
Can you step out and talk to me?

52
00:04:51,612 --> 00:04:52,531
No.

53
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:54,511
If you’ve got something to say, say it here.

54
00:04:55,764 --> 00:04:56,556
Fine.

55
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,306
So what’s the deal between us?

56
00:05:05,364 --> 00:05:06,259
What are you talking about?

57
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:12,168
About our kiss, what do you think about it?

58
00:05:17,705 --> 00:05:18,690
Give it to me straight.

59
00:05:23,363 --> 00:05:24,639
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

60
00:05:33,678 --> 00:05:35,234
If you open your heart to me,

61
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:37,925
can you open the door for me?

Since when…

71
00:08:14,512 --> 00:08:15,932
that you have feelings for me?

72
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:22,826
To be honest,

73
00:08:23,752 --> 00:08:25,357
I hated your guts at first.

74
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,162
You were the only person who dared to stand up to me. 

75
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,275
So I tried to make you bow down to me.

76
00:08:34,094 --> 00:08:35,722
But as we tutored together,

77
00:08:36,842 --> 00:08:39,599
you made me realize that I could become a better version of myself.

78
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,510
Before I knew it,

79
00:08:45,476 --> 00:08:47,305

00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:07,535
[I’ll eat you then…]

102
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:09,760
[because I like you.]

103
00:10:28,842 --> 00:10:29,788
Hey Auto.

104
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:30,842
Huh?

105
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:34,197
I’m hungry. Can you tell your mother to get me something?

106
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,222
Asshole!

107
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,234
Do you think my mother is Doraemon?

108
00:10:38,234 --> 00:10:39,945
You can’t just keep asking her for stuff.

109
00:10:40,756 --> 00:10:41,619
What a greedy jerk.

110
00:10:42,011 --> 00:10:43,827
- Have these snacks, guys.
- Holy f*ck. Hey there!

111
00:10:45,669 --> 00:10:46,503
Knock yourselves out.

112
00:11:01,175 --> 00:11:02,341
Is he on the Catering team?

113
00:11:04,756 --> 00:11:05,757
He’s not.

114
00:11:07,506 --> 00:11:08,975
Or he’s trying to poison us?

115
00:11:09,614 --> 00:11:10,467
No clue.

116
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:15,165
Sailom.

117
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,651
Hey, Sailom.

118
00:11:19,609 --> 00:11:20,360
Sailom!

119
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:20,965
What?

120
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,013
What have you done to him?

121
00:11:24,005 --> 00:11:24,505
Huh?

122
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:26,773
No.

123
00:11:27,347 --> 00:11:28,177
Nothing.

124
00:11:28,177 --> 00:11:28,991
I haven’t done a thing.

125
00:11:33,064 --> 00:11:34,041
I got it now.

126
00:11:35,984 --> 00:11:36,989
So does this mean…

127
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:37,984
Don’t jump the gun just yet.

128
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:41,322
You know, right?

129
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,283
You used to do wrong to me and my friends.

130
00:11:49,717 --> 00:11:53,283
So I’ve got a condition for you.

131
00:11:57,219 --> 00:11:58,932
You’ll need to regain their trust first.

132
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:01,713
Only then will I consider going out with you.

133
00:12:10,351 --> 00:12:16,188
The pom-pom he's making is all twisted.

134
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,257
Slowly, ma’am.

135
00:12:26,372 --> 00:12:29,866
I told you not to lift heavy objects.

136
00:12:30,286 --> 00:12:33,878
Look, now you have to undergo surgery because of the fall.

137
00:12:34,627 --> 00:12:37,515
I thought it was just minor back pain.

138
00:12:37,576 --> 00:12:40,385
Who would have guessed it was actually my hip deteriorating?

139
00:12:49,976 --> 00:12:52,524
I hope your surgery goes well, Grandma Ging.

140
00:12:53,703 --> 00:12:55,000
Should I stay with you at the hospital?

141
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,077
No need, dear.

142
00:12:58,095 --> 00:12:59,323
I have Paew here.

143
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:02,106
Just a few days in the hospital and I’ll be back home before you know it.

144
00:13:02,106 --> 00:13:03,166
Don’t worry.

145
00:13:05,183 --> 00:13:08,462
What's even more concerning is your recovery after the surgery. 

146
00:13:12,247 --> 00:13:13,121
We should get going now.

147
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,000
It's almost time for your appointment with Dr. Mongkol.

148
00:13:35,306 --> 00:13:37,437
Kang's grandmother has to stay at the hospital for quite some time, 

149
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:39,616
so it's just Kang and me here.

150
00:13:41,207 --> 00:13:42,972
I used to care for a patient with a similar condition. 

151
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:46,328
It usually takes about three months of rest and physical therapy

152
00:13:46,537 --> 00:13:47,818
to regain the ability to walk. 

153
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:52,533
Ask her if she's interested in hiring me.

154
00:13:53,118 --> 00:13:54,027
Nah, I won't do that.

155
00:13:54,393 --> 00:13:56,172
You might manipulate her into buying you things as well.

156
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,903
Give me a break. I wouldn't do that.

157
00:13:59,086 --> 00:14:00,580
Who would dare?

158
00:14:00,782 --> 00:14:03,461
If I ever do that, I swear on my life and get struck by lightning.

159
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:06,916
See?

160
00:14:08,665 --> 00:14:11,635
That sounds like it would punish you quicker than my 5G.

161
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,109
Anyway, I have to go eat now.

162
00:14:15,109 --> 00:14:16,061
Alright. 

163
00:14:25,985 --> 00:14:27,202
How on earth can I continue this?

164
00:14:32,369 --> 00:14:33,170
Woah!

165
00:14:33,953 --> 00:14:35,465
Grilled Fish with Veggies.

166
00:14:35,465 --> 00:14:37,081
Who ordered this?

167
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,056
I ordered it for you.

168
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,121
I already pampered your friends.

169
00:14:41,724 --> 00:14:43,100
So now is the time to pamper you too.

170
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,614
Buying them snacks is already called pampering?

171
00:14:48,871 --> 00:14:49,563
Um.

172
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,855
They even thought you were trying to poison them.

173
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:56,440
Damn it. I spent a lot on those snacks, you know?

174
00:14:58,204 --> 00:14:59,577
Let me tell you something.

175
00:15:00,157 --> 00:15:02,888
You’ve got this habit of buying your way into people’s hearts.

176
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:06,531
And that doesn’t work with me and my friends.

177
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,208
If you really want to win us over,

178
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,722
just talk to us and hang out with us.

179
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:13,889
Don’t just always rely on your wallet to do the talking.

180
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:17,425
Let’s dig in.

181
00:15:22,232 --> 00:15:23,349
Hey, seriously.

182
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,676
Why the hell are you here?

183
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,704
Since I’m already close with Sailom,

184
00:15:26,704 --> 00:15:28,208
I want to get along with you two as well.

185
00:15:28,455 --> 00:15:29,385
 What do you say? 

186
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:32,119
 Let’s hang out tonight, my treat.
