4
00:00:18,306 --> 00:00:20,120
Then I’ll go try out for the school football team.

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,513
I’ll be a school football player who also makes it into a public university.

6
00:00:22,513 --> 00:00:23,432
Aren’t you being too ambitious?

7
00:00:23,432 --> 00:00:25,196
Because I have my wind, this windmill can spin.

8
00:00:25,196 --> 00:00:28,266
And I'm sure I have your full support. I see no reason why I can't achieve it.

9
00:00:28,976 --> 00:00:30,385
Kang, you’ve got this!

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,129
You’re one hella talented rich kid, the most talented one in my eyes.

11
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:41,372
So I got to be an athlete because you pulled some strings?

12
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:45,416
A kid like you, without my help, what do you think you can accomplish?

13
00:00:45,767 --> 00:00:47,125
Where are you going?

14
00:00:47,245 --> 00:00:48,600
Anywhere but here.

15
00:00:49,032 --> 00:00:52,060
I don’t know where you want to go, but I’m going with you.

16
00:01:06,146 --> 00:01:06,890
So?

17
00:01:08,146 --> 00:01:09,017
What’s the plan?

18
00:01:09,494 --> 00:01:10,390
Where do we go from here?

19
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,034
I’m not sure yet.

20
00:01:18,736 --> 00:01:20,402
But I won’t rely on my dad’s money anymore.

21
00:01:23,864 --> 00:01:25,607
So he’d stop claiming that, without him, 

22
00:01:26,395 --> 00:01:27,753
I couldn’t do anything on my own.

23
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,238
I might as well just snap this card in half.

24
00:01:32,238 --> 00:01:32,933
Wait. Hold on.

25
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:36,235
Do you really think that’s gonna impress him?

26
00:01:41,532 --> 00:01:42,376
You’ve got a point.

27
00:01:43,738 --> 00:01:45,408
Good. I think…

28
00:01:45,408 --> 00:01:46,964
If his money is still sitting untouched in there,

29
00:01:47,296 --> 00:01:48,499
it will make him too happy.

30
00:01:49,188 --> 00:01:50,982
He might think I’ve finally grown up the way he wanted.

31
00:01:53,081 --> 00:01:54,413
I’m gonna spend all his money.

32
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:56,436
What?

33
00:01:57,258 --> 00:01:59,206
Hold on. What crap did you just say?

34
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,440
I’m going to withdraw all the cash from this card.

35
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:05,194
I will splash it all out until my dad begs me to stop.

36
00:02:05,194 --> 00:02:06,210
I’m gonna wipe out his money.

37
00:02:11,517 --> 00:02:12,900
(What the hell?)

38
00:02:14,905 --> 00:02:16,680
[Please enter amount - 20,000 baht - Confirm] 

39
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,655
Woah.

40
00:02:20,655 --> 00:02:22,501
Why is there a ฿20,000 limit per withdrawal?

41
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:24,913
It’s so annoying. My cash advance limit is ฿100,000.

42
00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:27,210
Stop talking and stash the money. 

43
00:02:27,387 --> 00:02:28,513
Do you want to attract thieves?

44
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:31,804
Let’s go explore.

45
00:02:31,804 --> 00:02:33,028
And spend it all.

46
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,187
Where do you want to go?

47
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,701
Anywhere.

48
00:02:40,154 --> 00:02:41,897
Hey. Put the money in the bag already, Kang!

49
00:03:08,973 --> 00:03:09,894
Woah.

50
00:03:12,636 --> 00:03:14,225
Since we were already planning on coming here.

51
00:03:16,504 --> 00:03:17,939
Let’s go, Korat!

52
00:04:56,895 --> 00:04:58,638
I'm starting to feel hungry. Let's find something to eat.

53
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,068
Let's go.

54
00:05:00,196 --> 00:05:01,196
I've looked it up.

55
00:05:01,574 --> 00:05:04,371
There’s a must-try noodle place around here. I'll take you there.

56
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:05,359
Nah.

57
00:05:05,547 --> 00:05:07,573
We’re super rich now. 

58
00:05:08,396 --> 00:05:09,265
How about I treat you to a good meal?

59
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,131
Let this daddy pay.

60
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,260
Daddy?

61
00:05:13,748 --> 00:05:14,920
What’s the treat, Daddy?

62
00:05:16,368 --> 00:05:17,107
We’ll have this.

63
00:05:17,107 --> 00:05:18,753
This, this, this, and this.

64
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:03,769
What?

65
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:05,800
My brother is disappearing with Kang?

66
00:06:06,922 --> 00:06:09,591
Uh... Mr. Kanghan?

67
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:13,189
Yes, I can't get hold of either of them.

68
00:06:14,758 --> 00:06:17,786
Do you have any idea where they might be? 

69
00:06:17,786 --> 00:06:19,748
I can help search for them.

70
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:21,208
You don't need to.

71
00:06:22,005 --> 00:06:23,573
This isn't the first time Kang has behaved this way.

72
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:26,679
He'll be home in a few days. 

73
00:06:29,858 --> 00:06:31,036
I have to be in a meeting now.

74
00:06:49,489 --> 00:06:52,080
Damn. We’ve finally spent it all.

75
00:06:52,851 --> 00:06:54,594
It's surprisingly challenging to spend all that cash.

76
00:06:55,001 --> 00:06:56,487
Come on.

77
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,818
So this is the hardship of the rich.

78
00:07:00,155 --> 00:07:02,566
Now you have used up the money.	

79
00:07:03,018 --> 00:07:04,298
What are you going to use for the days to come?

80
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:07,253
I can cash out more tomorrow.

81
00:07:08,486 --> 00:07:11,385
A hundred grand for today, I’ll get another hundred grand tomorrow.

82
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:14,169
I have no idea what to spend it on.

83
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,789
How about I use it to pay off your debts?

84
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:22,695
What?

85
00:07:24,262 --> 00:07:26,210
No. Keep it for yourself.

86
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:35,814
Let me ask you this.

87
00:07:35,814 --> 00:07:39,459
If I were to wake up tomorrow with no money, 

88
00:07:40,108 --> 00:07:41,232
with absolutely nothing,

89
00:07:42,466 --> 00:07:43,618
would you still like me?

90
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,358
Read my lips carefully.

91
00:07:51,048 --> 00:07:51,772
I…

92
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:52,637
like…

93
00:07:52,637 --> 00:07:53,449
you.

94
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:02,793
I used to have this thought, though.

95
00:08:04,044 --> 00:08:08,254
If my life weren’t so tough, what would it be like?

96
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:12,798
Should I be your sugar baby? I don’t have to struggle this much.

97
00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:14,021
Why not?

98
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:15,656
I’m expensive.

99
00:08:15,826 --> 00:08:17,080
Doesn’t matter. I’m rich.

100
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,826
Really?

101
00:08:18,104 --> 00:08:19,049
But it’ll have to be tomorrow to become rich again.

102
00:08:19,049 --> 00:08:20,104
I’ve got no money left today.

103
00:08:21,193 --> 00:08:21,930
I have to wait until tomorrow?

104
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:22,679
Yes, tomorrow.

105
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:23,892
That’s too long.

106
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:26,912
I don’t believe you are completely out of cash.

107
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:28,435
Completely.

108
00:08:28,435 --> 00:08:29,215
Seriously?

109
00:08:29,215 --> 00:08:29,715
Seriously.

110
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,387
I still see some in your bag.

111
00:08:42,462 --> 00:08:43,297
Sorry.

112
00:08:43,785 --> 00:08:45,593
I don’t have much cash left, so the best I could do was just this.

113
00:08:47,436 --> 00:08:51,184
“Just this”? This is fancy as hell to me.

114
00:08:53,369 --> 00:08:54,503
Fancy, my foot.

115
00:08:54,888 --> 00:08:55,908
The furniture is outdated.

116
00:08:56,425 --> 00:08:58,785
I'm not even sure if this room has a water heater.

117
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,951
I doubt Kang will show up. 

118
00:09:53,951 --> 00:09:55,801
He's probably out and about with Sailom at the moment. 

119
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:57,301
If I had known, I wouldn't have come either.

120
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,403
See? You guys have this bad habit.

121
00:10:00,585 --> 00:10:02,840
Now my friend has become a bad boy too.

122
00:10:03,857 --> 00:10:06,602
Normally, Sailom never ghosts me or leaves my texts unanswered.

123
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:07,841
Who knows?

124
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:10,137
It could be your friend who has a negative influence on my friend.

125
00:10:10,747 --> 00:10:11,674
It’s your friend.

126
00:10:12,316 --> 00:10:22,100
It’s your friend.

127
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,144
Hey, hey, hey!

128
00:10:24,807 --> 00:10:26,139
Cut it out already.

129
00:10:26,465 --> 00:10:27,351
Go run.

130
00:10:27,762 --> 00:10:28,568
Got it, Coach.

131
00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:29,760
It’s your friend.

132
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,786
This side!

133
00:10:32,193 --> 00:10:35,507
- It’s your friend rubbing off on mine.
- Come on. This is no good.

134
00:10:35,661 --> 00:10:38,303
- No, it’s your friend.
- How can we beat anyone? Be stronger!

[Sorry. This card has been suspended. 
Transaction declined, please contact your bank.]

137
00:10:48,135 --> 00:10:51,266
Damn it. Dad has frozen my card.

138
00:10:51,574 --> 00:10:52,333
What?

139
00:11:03,325 --> 00:11:05,813
Damn. I should have maxed out that card.

140
00:11:05,813 --> 00:11:06,879
What a shame.

141
00:11:07,726 --> 00:11:08,520
Seriously.

142
00:11:09,342 --> 00:11:10,445
You should be ashamed of yourself.

143
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:19,409
Do you think I should get those kids a new ball?

144
00:11:21,293 --> 00:11:24,090
Come on. You should worry about your own ass first.

145
00:11:24,314 --> 00:11:25,774
Your once wealthy self is now broke.

146
00:11:25,774 --> 00:11:26,689
Do you have money to buy anything for them?

147
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:28,752
I do.

148
00:11:29,369 --> 00:11:30,550
I’m rich.

149
00:11:30,795 --> 00:11:32,050
I’ve got an asset I can turn into cash.

150
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,514
Come on. The resale price of this model is ฿200,000.

151
00:11:47,514 --> 00:11:50,558
I didn’t use it that often. The condition is near perfect.

152
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:53,049
The bike’s condition is good.

153
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:55,786
But look at you, you two look like thugs.

154
00:11:56,211 --> 00:11:58,468
You don’t even have a document to prove your ownership of this bike.

155
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,616
Give it to me straight. Did you steal it?

156
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,838
Look, here's a picture of me with this bike. 

157
00:12:05,838 --> 00:12:06,916
Do I look like the owner now?

158
00:12:10,504 --> 00:12:11,399
Alright.

159
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:14,303
I can give you ฿80,000 max.

160
00:12:15,588 --> 00:12:17,177
Come on. Just ฿80,000?

161
00:12:17,298 --> 00:12:18,501
Can you offer a little more?

162
00:12:19,316 --> 00:12:22,215
Do you plan to profit from this and achieve financial freedom?

163
00:12:22,215 --> 00:12:23,370
฿80,100 then?

164
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,968
Are you serious? Don’t be joking.

165
00:12:26,615 --> 00:12:27,732
Fine, ฿100,000!

166
00:12:27,732 --> 00:12:29,560
Take it or leave it.

167
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,888
Can we get ฿130,000?

168
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:36,864
No.

169
00:12:36,864 --> 00:12:37,789
฿100,000 is fine.

170
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:38,501
I’ll take it.

171
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:43,753
Hey!

172
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,389
Now we’re talking.

173
00:12:45,728 --> 00:12:47,070
Alright, deal!

174
00:12:47,455 --> 00:12:48,370
Damn it, Kang.

175
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:51,756
You idiot!

176
00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,751
Yeah, like that. Good.

177
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,122
How’s that?

178
00:13:07,585 --> 00:13:08,707
Now shoot!

179
00:13:08,707 --> 00:13:10,642
Yeah.

180
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:12,621
Very good.

181
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,149
How is it?

182
00:13:16,374 --> 00:13:17,640
Do you play better with these football shoes?

183
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,689
Yes.

184
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:19,469
Good, right?

185
00:13:19,848 --> 00:13:20,923
Very good.

186
00:13:24,488 --> 00:13:25,705
Let’s have a drink.

187
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:27,978
Come on, kids. Get your drinks.

188
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:31,754
Yo. Yo. Yo!

189
00:13:31,754 --> 00:13:32,859
Come on. Get your drinks.

190
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,730
This will make you refreshed.

191
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,011
Shit. I gave away all of them.

192
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:51,954
I don’t have one left for myself.

193
00:13:52,546 --> 00:13:55,000
Oh, oh. They’re all gone.

194
00:13:56,853 --> 00:14:00,292
Look. I’ve got an extra one

195
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,634
My boyfriend is so thoughtful.

196
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:10,000
But sorry, this can is reserved just for me.

197
00:14:10,488 --> 00:14:11,666
It’s all mine.

198
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:18,486
Super duper good.

199
00:14:18,486 --> 00:14:20,134
You sure you’re not sharing that with me?

200
00:14:20,737 --> 00:14:21,445
Um.

201
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:22,258
You sure?

202
00:14:22,386 --> 00:14:23,040
Um.

203
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,685
Sure?

204
00:14:23,685 --> 00:14:24,289
Hm.

205
00:14:24,289 --> 00:14:24,861
Sure, sure?

206
00:14:24,861 --> 00:14:25,457
Hmm.

207
00:14:25,457 --> 00:14:26,413
- Really sure?
- Hmm?

208
00:14:26,413 --> 00:14:28,728
Oi, Kang!

209
00:14:28,728 --> 00:14:29,567
Are you giving it to me?

210
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:30,441
Argh, Kang!

211
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,009
I feel so refreshed.

212
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:40,697
Don’t finish it all. Save some for me.

213
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:42,979
What?

214
00:14:43,313 --> 00:14:43,960
No.

215
00:14:44,313 --> 00:14:45,000
What the hell?

216
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,226
No, I don’t want it now.

217
00:14:46,226 --> 00:14:47,098
No, Kang. I don’t want it.

218
00:14:47,098 --> 00:14:48,147
I’m good now.

219
00:14:48,147 --> 00:14:49,000
I don’t want to drink it anymore.

220
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,152
No.

221
00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:52,610
What the hell is wrong with you?

222
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:59,036
Do you think my dad will flip out if he finds out I sold the big bike?

223
00:14:59,681 --> 00:15:03,560
Then what’s already yours, make sure to take good care of it.
