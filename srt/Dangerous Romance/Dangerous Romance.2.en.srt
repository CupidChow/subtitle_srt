4

Those jerks!

5
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:21,877
Are you going to let him be bullied like that?

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,302
I'm not going to let them get away.

7
00:00:26,274 --> 00:00:27,509
Why do you want me to see this?

8
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:29,351
This is school bullying.

9
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:31,890
Seriously. Why did you rat on me?

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,851
Keep in mind the scholarship you receive is the money that my father paid to this school.

11
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:37,240
I’ll give you one more chance.

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,911
I'm willing to put everything between us behind us

13
00:00:38,951 --> 00:00:40,529
if you prostrate yourself at my feet.

14
00:00:51,292 --> 00:01:01,629
Question 1 - If ‘x’ is equal to minus ½, a root of equation ax^2 + 3x-1…

15
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:03,637
Hey.

16
00:01:04,165 --> 00:01:06,884
What’s gotten into you? Do you dare to play games in class now?

17
00:01:07,007 --> 00:01:07,948
Damn me if I do.

18
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,693
I'm working my tail off to finish this assignment for Auto.

19
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:11,368
Didn’t you see how he was yesterday?

20
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,080
Shit. It froze on me again.

21
00:01:17,888 --> 00:01:19,070
For a million times already.

22
00:01:19,974 --> 00:01:21,216
Why don’t you buy a new one?

23
00:01:21,216 --> 00:01:23,080
Piss off. Do you think I’m loaded?

24
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:26,885
Auto, I need to use your laptop during lunch.

25
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:31,662
Auto.

26
00:01:33,377 --> 00:01:34,048
Auto.

27
00:01:35,656 --> 00:01:36,671
Hey, Auto!

28
00:01:37,656 --> 00:01:38,218
What?

29
00:01:38,423 --> 00:01:39,699
Are you daydreaming or something?

30
00:01:40,279 --> 00:01:43,034
You okay? Did you get a head bonk last night?

31
00:01:44,275 --> 00:01:45,111
No.

32
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:47,040
I just can’t stop thinking about yesterday.

33
00:01:47,346 --> 00:01:49,085
It was so damn satisfying how you got back at them.

34
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:54,442
Come on.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,753
Do you want my help in pushing his head towards you?

36
00:02:02,636 --> 00:02:04,509
Be obedient and do as I say.

37
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:05,982
Good boys.

38
00:02:15,897 --> 00:02:17,077
What the hell did you do?

39
00:02:18,423 --> 00:02:19,797
Hey. Leave my friends alone!

40
00:02:24,432 --> 00:02:28,358
Boss, sir. Looks like there’s a student fight going on here. Can you come over?

41
00:02:28,358 --> 00:02:30,043
Shit. Run!

42
00:02:30,043 --> 00:02:31,744
Delete all the videos instantly, you f*cking losers!

43
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:33,703
If you save it, you’re dead!

44
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:36,200
They must still be in shock.

45
00:02:36,463 --> 00:02:37,592
They even skipped class.

46
00:02:39,762 --> 00:02:41,287
Don't be too happy about it.

47
00:02:42,942 --> 00:02:45,153
I bet they are thinking of a way to get back at us.

48
00:02:49,756 --> 00:02:51,413
What's up with all the talking over there?!

49
00:02:51,986 --> 00:02:55,240
Have you all totally understood this lesson?

50
00:02:56,362 --> 00:02:57,475
Sailom.

51
00:02:58,161 --> 00:02:59,470
Solve these questions then.

52
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,880
The answer to question one is ⅕.

53
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,063
Question 2 is 10.

54
00:03:11,063 --> 00:03:13,137
And question 3 is 55.

55
00:03:19,293 --> 00:03:21,187
So you do pay attention in my class.

56
00:03:21,913 --> 00:03:24,625
Let’s move on to the next question.

57
00:03:26,435 --> 00:03:29,391
If we assign ‘a’ and ‘b’ to…

58
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:30,334
You’re incredible.

59
00:05:11,408 --> 00:05:12,380
Let me check.

60
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,039
What about yours?

61
00:05:15,346 --> 00:05:16,538
Alright, it's permanently deleted.

62
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,334
Why did you record it?

63
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,655
Why haven’t you deleted it from the junk folder?

64
00:05:25,655 --> 00:05:27,167
Huh, you dipshit?

65
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,260
Don’t you dare test me?

66
00:05:36,407 --> 00:05:37,800
I think all the videos got deleted.

67
00:05:38,235 --> 00:05:39,377
I double-checked them all.

68
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,359
You didn’t hear when I told you to delete it?

69
00:05:43,637 --> 00:05:45,000
Why the hell are you still here? Get lost.

70
00:05:51,866 --> 00:05:52,766
Check this out.

71
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:53,787
Hey.

72
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:56,993
What are y’all watching?

73
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:28,517
Grandma.

74
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:30,632
What are you watching?

75
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,596
How did you get it?

76
00:06:40,881 --> 00:06:43,277
Max’s mother sent it to me.

77
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,276
She found this on Max’s phone.

78
00:06:47,348 --> 00:06:51,036
The person who did this to you, who is he?

79
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:52,955
What exactly happened?

80
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,590
Well.

81
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:03,286
I didn't want to tell you.

82
00:07:04,846 --> 00:07:09,036
He's a scholarship student that our family supports.

83
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:12,757
Instead of being a good kid and studying, 

84
00:07:13,337 --> 00:07:15,416
he bullies other students at school.

85
00:07:16,754 --> 00:07:19,280
How come he did that to you?

86
00:07:22,328 --> 00:07:23,235
Well,

87
00:07:23,684 --> 00:07:25,516
his friend and I had a conflict.

88
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:28,439
So he was trying to make trouble for me.

89
00:07:28,686 --> 00:07:30,554
He tricked me to meet him at the storage room.

90
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,908
Then…

91
00:07:35,309 --> 00:07:36,731
as you saw in the clip.

92
00:07:37,975 --> 00:07:41,743
He purposely humiliated me in front of everyone at school.

93
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:47,296
This is not a small matter. You should have come to me.

94
00:07:49,242 --> 00:07:51,453
Many students are shamed in this way too, Grandma.

95
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:55,000
They are too afraid to say anything.

96
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,697
If you believe me, you must cancel his scholarship.

97
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,355
Before more students become his victims like me.

98
00:08:29,574 --> 00:08:31,125
Good morning, Mrs. Ging.

99
00:08:32,464 --> 00:08:35,229
Director Jeab even comes down to greet me.

100
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:38,215
You have been a big supporter of our school.

101
00:08:38,215 --> 00:08:40,011
I must personally come to greet you myself.

102
00:08:40,356 --> 00:08:41,696
This way, please.

103
00:08:48,754 --> 00:08:49,778
M.5/2

104
00:08:50,332 --> 00:08:51,308
Damn it.

105
00:08:52,301 --> 00:08:56,253
I was busy deleting other people’s clips and forgot to delete mine.

106
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:58,590
My mom stumbled upon it.

107
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:00,529
I’m sorry, man.

108
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:01,553
That’s alright. 

109
00:09:01,903 --> 00:09:03,903
Thanks to your clip, I could strike back.

110
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,009
Huh?

111
00:09:05,508 --> 00:09:06,410
What the hell was that?

112
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,689
Mr. Krittin Sukprasert and Mr. Sailom Homchan, 
please come to the director's office immediately.

113
00:09:17,805 --> 00:09:18,830
What?

114
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,385
What have you done?

115
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,875
You’ll know soon.

116
00:09:29,471 --> 00:09:30,596
Want me to go there with you?

117
00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:33,261
No, thanks.

118
00:09:34,395 --> 00:09:35,522
I’m sure I can handle it.

119
00:09:44,548 --> 00:09:45,388
What could it be?

120
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:46,785
I have no idea either.

121
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:55,582
It’s not too late to apologize to me now.

122
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,640
How about another kiss?

123
00:10:36,276 --> 00:10:39,279
If my friend gets anything, I’ll make sure you all scumbags pay!

124
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,942
What are you waiting for? I’m down for it now.

125
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:42,872
Hey.

126
00:10:50,647 --> 00:10:51,507
Not this time.

127
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:54,072
We should wait until Sailom's problem is cleared first.

128
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,993
Out of nowhere, he kissed me like what you saw in the clip.

129
00:11:03,314 --> 00:11:05,314
I didn’t provoke or do anything to him.

130
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:07,506
That’s not true.

131
00:11:07,664 --> 00:11:08,690
The truth is Kang…

132
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:09,857
Say no more.

133
00:11:10,884 --> 00:11:12,567
The clip clearly shows

134
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:15,536
that you intentionally embarrassed Kanghan.

135
00:11:16,241 --> 00:11:20,960
Didn’t you realize that your scholarship is sponsored by Kanghan’s family?

136
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,394
You should be grateful to him.

137
00:11:25,154 --> 00:11:28,447
I suggest you cancel his scholarship, Mrs. Ging.

138
00:11:39,505 --> 00:11:41,505
I may not cancel your scholarship

139
00:11:46,412 --> 00:11:48,016
if you apologize to Kanghan.

140
00:11:58,764 --> 00:12:00,000
I’m sorry

141
00:12:08,338 --> 00:12:10,655
that I cannot say sorry to Kanghan.

142
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,262
Why so?

143
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,835
Is your dignity greater than the scholarship?

144
00:12:23,961 --> 00:12:25,400
It’s not about dignity, ma’am.

145
00:12:25,673 --> 00:12:28,807
If I'm truly at fault, I will apologize and make amends for everything.

146
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:33,674
But if I have to lie just to keep the scholarship, I’d rather have it revoked.

147
00:12:35,051 --> 00:12:37,051
This kid needs to learn to shut up.

148
00:12:46,982 --> 00:12:49,193
If that’s the case, Kanghan.

149
00:12:50,631 --> 00:12:52,103
Apologize to Sailom, dear.

150
00:13:02,388 --> 00:13:03,527
What, Grandma?

151
00:13:04,388 --> 00:13:06,040
Because I knew from the beginning…

152
00:13:07,142 --> 00:13:08,799
about what you did.

153
00:13:10,217 --> 00:13:13,431
What actually happened in this clip?

154
00:13:15,871 --> 00:13:17,871
This is just a short clip.

155
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:19,816
I saw the full video.

156
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,125
Kang was pushing Sailom to the limits.

157
00:13:22,276 --> 00:13:25,648
He told Sailom to take off his clothes and kiss another student.

158
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:30,851
But Sailom reversed the situation by kissing Kang instead.

159
00:13:32,055 --> 00:13:34,055
The full videos were all deleted.

160
00:13:37,055 --> 00:13:38,818
Why are you telling me this now?

161
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:45,777
As a friend, I don't want Kang to go astray any further.

162
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,003
You don’t have to believe me.

163
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:51,459
I just wanted you to know what was really going on.

164
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,152
Who told you that?

165
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,415
It doesn’t matter who.

166
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:06,428
That means

167
00:14:08,354 --> 00:14:10,920
it was my grandson who bullied Sailom's friend.

168
00:14:11,442 --> 00:14:15,315
Sailom came to save his friend and was also bullied.

169
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,425
Correct?

170
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:20,988
It’s just harmless teasing among boys.

171
00:14:20,988 --> 00:14:22,675
I asked if it was correct?

172
00:14:30,835 --> 00:14:31,717
Yes.

173
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,361
But they're just kids. They might not mean any harm.

174
00:14:38,516 --> 00:14:40,701
You knew everything, yet you didn’t do anything? 

175
00:14:41,485 --> 00:14:43,221
Do you still call yourself a teacher?

176
00:14:48,296 --> 00:14:50,402
Can I ask you to look into this matter, Director Jeab?

177
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:57,499
How should you deal with a teacher who isn't doing his job properly?

178
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:05,743
Kanghan.

179
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:09,217
Apologize to Sailom now.

180
00:15:27,572 --> 00:15:28,701
Sorry…

181
00:15:30,284 --> 00:15:31,762
for being a jerk to you.

182
00:15:42,097 --> 00:15:42,988
