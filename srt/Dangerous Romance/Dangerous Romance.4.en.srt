4
00:00:18,827 --> 00:00:21,252
Then I will do my best to pass all my exams this semester.

5
00:00:22,007 --> 00:00:25,800
If I pass all my midterms, can you get me a big bike, Dad?

6
00:00:28,306 --> 00:00:29,261
Surprise.

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,351
And this damn big bike is another solid indication that he never expected any shit from me.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,505
I’m tired. I don’t know why in the world I should keep studying.

9
00:00:38,681 --> 00:00:39,947
What the hell are you doing?

10
00:00:40,213 --> 00:00:41,399
Listen to me.

11
00:00:43,265 --> 00:00:46,221
If you don’t know who you should study for, do it for me.

12
00:01:05,134 --> 00:01:06,178
Wow.

13
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:14,131
Hello. What’s up?

14
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:15,656
(Hello, Kanghan.)

15
00:01:15,656 --> 00:01:17,756
(The chemistry exercise I gave you, how’d it go?)

16
00:01:17,756 --> 00:01:18,685
(Any questions so far?)

17
00:01:18,685 --> 00:01:21,496
Nah, I'm actually working on it right now. Catch you later.

18
00:01:21,496 --> 00:01:22,557
Alright.

19
00:01:29,348 --> 00:01:30,365
Finally.

20
00:01:30,892 --> 00:01:32,467
Here I am, Beat Saber.

21
00:01:41,482 --> 00:01:42,418
What the?

22
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:44,359
Didn’t I just put it here?

23
00:01:48,787 --> 00:01:49,711
Great. Thanks.

24
00:01:52,686 --> 00:01:54,028
Since when were you here?

25
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:58,851
I think we need to talk.

26
00:01:59,548 --> 00:02:00,618
With me?

27
00:02:18,044 --> 00:02:19,274
Why are we having tutoring here?

28
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,040
No questions. Just come inside.

29
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:42,759
I’ve finished chemistry.

30
00:02:42,892 --> 00:02:43,622
What?

31
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,568
That was too fast.

32
00:02:46,464 --> 00:02:48,384
I went through the materials you gave me last night.

33
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:50,377
Give me the files for the other subjects.

34
00:02:53,432 --> 00:02:54,331
Come on.

35
00:03:11,605 --> 00:03:13,074
I pre-ordered this a while ago.

36
00:03:13,074 --> 00:03:14,489
It just arrived.

37
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:16,240
So I want to test it out.

38
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:23,012
Have you started the homework Sailom assigned to you?

39
00:03:25,355 --> 00:03:26,691
Not yet.

40
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:33,089
That means Sailom can’t control you.

41
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:36,252
It has nothing to do with Sailom.

42
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:38,788
Here’s the deal.

43
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,381
Make this old lady happy.

44
00:03:42,107 --> 00:03:47,109
These midterm exams, you must pass all subjects.

45
00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:52,618
Otherwise, I’ll need to find you a new tutor.

46
00:03:53,417 --> 00:03:54,406
What?

47
00:03:56,824 --> 00:03:58,340
Isn't it a little too hard to pull off, Grandma?

48
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:03,859
Can I ask you something?

49
00:04:07,186 --> 00:04:08,867
If you don't tutor me, 

50
00:04:09,812 --> 00:04:11,653
can you earn enough money to cover your debts each month?

51
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:22,987
Why do you ask?

52
00:04:26,627 --> 00:04:28,785
I’m just curious.

53
00:04:38,256 --> 00:04:40,840
Some months it’s enough, some months it’s not.

54
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,892
It depends on how much my brother can earn in a given month.

55
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,370
But I must help with the earnings regardless.

56
00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:52,751
If there's a month where I can't pay them back in time or in full, 

57
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:55,355
it's just like what you saw.

58
00:04:56,132 --> 00:04:57,209
I get beaten up.

59
00:04:58,132 --> 00:04:59,055
Why do you ask?

60
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:56,524
3 HOURS LATER

61
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,872
Hey!

62
00:07:15,908 --> 00:07:16,811
What?

63
00:07:18,158 --> 00:07:20,158
The thought of playing games doesn't even cross my mind.

64
00:07:22,155 --> 00:07:23,438
I didn’t say a word.

65
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,240
I only wanted to ask if that thing is called…

66
00:07:30,672 --> 00:07:31,928
VR?

67
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,530
Yeah.

68
00:07:34,114 --> 00:07:35,271
I just got it.

69
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:36,106
Wow!

70
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:37,720
That’s so cool.

71
00:07:39,518 --> 00:07:40,395
Uh…

72
00:07:43,025 --> 00:07:44,148
Can I…

73
00:07:45,102 --> 00:07:46,351
try it?

74
00:07:47,493 --> 00:07:49,342
Why not? I've been waiting to hear that.

75
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:50,151
Come here.

76
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:50,893
Right now?

77
00:07:50,893 --> 00:07:51,692
I’ll show you how to play.

78
00:07:56,748 --> 00:07:57,687
Hold this in your hand.

79
00:07:59,494 --> 00:08:00,741
Can’t you be still?

80
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,243
I’m not still enough?

81
00:08:02,897 --> 00:08:03,611
And that other hand.

82
00:08:03,611 --> 00:08:04,720
See the screen?

83
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,203

[Math Sample Test Questions]

96
00:09:05,722 --> 00:09:07,722
THE NIGHT BEFORE FIRST-SEMESTER EXAMS

97
00:09:11,887 --> 00:09:12,921
Shit.

98
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:15,295
Not again.

99
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:17,214
The whole neighborhood had a blackout the other day too.

100
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:20,447
Damn.

101
00:09:21,525 --> 00:09:24,596
I didn’t charge my laptop. How am I going to study tonight?

102
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,104
Do you have any candles here?

103
00:09:44,892 --> 00:09:47,397
I think your house should have a backup power supply.

104
00:09:47,397 --> 00:09:50,045
That’s a good idea. Or I should get solar panels installed.

105
00:09:50,772 --> 00:09:52,347
I saw it on international news.

106
00:09:52,347 --> 00:09:54,243
They use windmills to generate electricity now.

107
00:09:55,264 --> 00:09:56,213
How does that work?

108
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,655
The principle is similar to typical windmills.

109
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:02,770
The kinetic energy from the wind makes a windmill spin.

110
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,909
Then, the kinetic energy is converted into mechanical energy.

111
00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:09,251
After that, the mechanical energy is converted into electrical power.

112
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:13,440
The amount of electricity generated depends on the wind’s speed and volume.

113
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:14,872
Do you follow?

114
00:10:16,143 --> 00:10:18,701
I got lost as soon as you brought up that damn kinetic thingy.

115
00:10:19,236 --> 00:10:20,387
I knew it.

116
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,893
Let me simplify it.

117
00:10:25,962 --> 00:10:29,237
A windmill needs wind to generate electricity.

118
00:10:32,055 --> 00:10:36,526
That means wind is super important to windmills, right?

119
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,292
Absolutely.

120
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,592
Without wind, how can a windmill spin?

121
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:09,758
Let’s keep going.

122
00:11:13,492 --> 00:11:14,486
Which question are you working on?

123
00:11:15,903 --> 00:11:16,672
This one.

124
00:11:17,496 --> 00:11:18,488
Can you explain it to me?

125
00:11:19,443 --> 00:11:20,412
I’ve already covered that one.

126
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:21,177
Work it out on your own.

127
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,058
Here. Thanks a lot.

128
00:11:41,997 --> 00:11:43,922
Do your best on your exams tomorrow.

129
00:11:46,444 --> 00:11:47,123
Wait.

130
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:47,860
Huh?

131
00:11:50,522 --> 00:11:54,275
I think I should tell you this.

132
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:55,720
What is it?

133
00:12:03,992 --> 00:12:05,912
Grandma said if I don’t pass all my midterms,

134
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,160
she won’t hire you anymore.

135
00:12:12,995 --> 00:12:14,254
I kinda figured that.

136
00:12:15,264 --> 00:12:18,077
Well, other parents do that too.

137
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,017
You figured that. Why don’t you put any pressure on me?

138
00:12:23,538 --> 00:12:26,468
You wouldn't listen to me even if I did.

139
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,550
Let’s be honest.

140
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:31,715
Do I have any influence over you?

141
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:41,268
I’m getting inside now.

142
00:12:41,268 --> 00:12:42,179
Give it your all tomorrow.

143
00:13:06,433 --> 00:13:11,435
These midterm exams, you must pass all subjects.

144
00:13:11,996 --> 00:13:16,945
Otherwise, I’ll need to find you a new tutor.

145
00:13:19,304 --> 00:13:20,188
Kang.

146
00:13:22,526 --> 00:13:23,642
Can you do that for me?

147
00:13:49,484 --> 00:13:50,111
Hey.

148
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,113
Huh?

149
00:13:51,113 --> 00:13:52,437
Why the long face?

150
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:55,009
I heard you went through some intensive tutoring.

151
00:13:55,382 --> 00:13:57,120
Can you pass me a cheat sheet when we’re inside?

152
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,080
Get out, Max. Don’t cut in line.

153
00:14:00,357 --> 00:14:02,045
Kang, give me a cheat sheet.

154
00:14:03,072 --> 00:14:04,355
We are in different exam rooms.

155
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,862
How can I give it to you, dumbass?

156
00:14:05,862 --> 00:14:06,450
Eh?

157
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,012
You’re right.

158
00:14:08,437 --> 00:14:09,422
Get yourself ready now.

159
00:14:09,906 --> 00:14:11,561
We’re not in the same room with him?

160
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:12,395
No.

161
00:14:14,525 --> 00:14:16,844
Didn’t you check the exam notice?

162
00:14:19,136 --> 00:14:21,694
You are in my way. Move.

163
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,299
No. You move.

164
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:24,170
Get out of my way.

165
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:31,180
- I got here first.
- I got here first.

166
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:31,949
Both of you, move!

167
00:14:33,995 --> 00:14:34,782
Yes.

168
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:39,731
And get inside already if you don’t want to retake the exam.

169
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,851
Got it, sir.

170
00:14:53,444 --> 00:14:56,746
Students, if you're finished, you can submit your test paper.

171
00:15:19,869 --> 00:15:21,869
[Trust me. You can do it.]

172
00:15:55,498 --> 00:15:56,392
Hold on.

173
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,976
Take this, just in case.

174
00:15:58,109 --> 00:16:00,000
It’s my favorite umbrella.

175
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,650
I used to have two of these.

176
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,649
I can’t remember who I lent the other one to.

177
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:05,082
So, take good care of it.
